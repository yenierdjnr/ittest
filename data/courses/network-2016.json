certification exam.\n\n3\n00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:13.172\nNow this exam centers around\nnetworking technologies,\n\n4\n00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:17.070\nwireless technologies as\nwell as wired technologies.\n\n5\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.840\nAnd when you are through with\ntaking this certification exam,\n\n6\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.290\nit does demonstrate competencies in things\nlike network design, basic connectivity.\n\n7\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.350\nWe'll look at things like an understanding\nof maintaining network documentation,\n\n8\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.070\nas well as the limitations,\nthe weaknesses and\n\n9\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.500\nimplementation of security standards and\nprotocols.\n\n10\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.190\nOne of the things to keep in mind\nis that the candidate will have\n\n11\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.590\na basic understanding of\nthe emerging technologies,\n\n12\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.400\nlike things like cloud-based\ntechnologies and unified communication.\n\n13\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.330\nLet's go ahead and took a look at what the\nbreakdown of what this exam will be, so\n\n14\n00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.550\nyou can kinda get an idea as to what you\ncan expect when you look at the series.\n\n15\n00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.300\nYou'll see that in 1.0, we're gonna be\ntalking about, well, network architecture.\n\n16\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.090\nYou could see that that is\n22% of the overall exam.\n\n17\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.840\nYou could see here that in Domain 2.0,\n\n18\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.680\nwe're gonna be looking\nat network operations.\n\n19\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.480\nYou could see that that is pretty\nhefty portion of the exam as well,\n\n20\n00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.240\nyou can see that it is 20% of your exam.\n\n21\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.260\nWe'll also be looking at network security,\n\n22\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.590\nvery important to keep your network\nsecure cuz when you bring them online,\n\n23\n00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.960\nwe gotta make sure that they stay online\nand they don't get attacked or hacked.\n\n24\n00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.970\nWe're also gonna look\nat troubleshooting and\n\n25\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.130\nyou can see that out of everything\nwithin the exam breakdown here, 24%,\n\n26\n00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.080\ntroubleshooting does constitute\nthe majority of this entire exam.\n\n27\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.876\nFinally, we're gonna talk a little about\nthese industry-wide standards inside of\n\n28\n00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:40.950\nnetworking communications today.\n\n29\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.380\nGoing a little bit farther than that,\nif we break down some of the things that\n\n30\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.480\nyou can see when we look\nat network architecture,\n\n31\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.730\nwe'll be looking at the various\nconnectivity devices that are in our\n\n32\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.780\nnetworks that move communications\nfrom source to destination.\n\n33\n00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.530\nWe'll also be looking at\nthe different various services\n\n34\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.660\nthat allow our networks to communicate.\n\n35\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.720\nWe'll be looking at services like DHCP.\n\n36\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880\nYou can see DNS as well.\n\n37\n00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.830\nWe'll be looking at different forms\nof things like network translation\n\n38\n00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.970\ntechnologies.\n\n39\n00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.730\nWe will be looking at copper media, fiber\nmedia, wireless communications and more.\n\n40\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.710\nSo you can say that there is a lot of\ninformation that is going to be in this\n\n41\n00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.230\ncertification exam.\n\n42\n00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.060\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's bump on over the CompTIA's website.\n\n43\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.160\nNow, if you want more information\nabout what you can expect,\n\n44\n00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.990\nthe objective as well as the exam details,\n\n45\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.510\nyou can always go to www.comptia.org and\nyou could find this information.\n\n46\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.928\nYou can see that the current\nExam Code is N10-006.\n\n47\n00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:41.573\nAnd you can see here too, Network+ covers\nthe configuration, management, and\n\n48\n00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:45.620\ntroubleshooting of common wireless and\nwired network devices.\n\n49\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.640\nThe number of questions that you can see\ninside of this exam is going to be, well,\n\n50\n00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.660\n90 questions, maximum of 90 questions.\n\n51\n00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500\nNow the type of questions,\nthey're multiple choice, right?\n\n52\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.830\nMultiple choice questions, right,\nthe fact that you're gonna pick A,\n\n53\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.580\nB, C, or D, you'll also see things\nlike multiple answers, right?\n\n54\n00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.190\nYou see single and multiple responses.\n\n55\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.390\nFor instance, if you have a question and\nit requires multiple responses,\n\n56\n00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.580\nit might say something like,\nwell choose two, maybe A and B.\n\n57\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.950\nYou will also have things\nlike drag-and-drops.\n\n58\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.230\nA list of potential answers on one side\nthat you have to drag them and enter and\n\n59\n00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440\nfill out boxes on the right side.\n\n60\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.820\nThey also talk about\nperformance based questions.\n\n61\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.760\nPerformance based questions means you\ndo have the potential to see some\n\n62\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.950\nsimulations on the CompTIA Net+ exam.\n\n63\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.850\nYou can see that the length\nof the test is 90 minutes.\n\n64\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.796\nYou see that the passing score\nis 720 on a scale of 100-900.\n\n65\n00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:45.900\nThe experiment, or experience,\nexcuse me, recommended experiences,\n\n66\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.936\nwell they rather recommend having the A+\ncertification, taking the 901 and\n\n67\n00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:56.950\nthe 902 currently in those exams, and also\nto have nine months of network experience.\n\n68\n00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.030\nWe do have a few different language types\nif that is something that you need.\n\n69\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.670\nKeep in mind that the series is\ngoing to be based in English,\n\n70\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.740\nbut there is a Japanese version and\na German version as well.\n\n71\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.932\nLast but not least,\nyou can see that the overall price for\n\n72\n00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:20.448\nthe Network+ (N10-006) exam\nis going to be $294.00.\n\n73\n00:04:20.448 --> 00:04:24.446\nSo if network is something that you\nbelieve you want to accomplish,\n\n74\n00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.602\nwhether it is a certification exam or\nwhether it is for\n\n75\n00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:31.462\nself experience in a real world to\nmaybe give you a better position\n\n76\n00:04:31.462 --> 00:04:34.926\nwithin your company,\nthen this is what you've gotta be.\n\n77\n00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:41.790\nSo stick around as we got a lot more at\nCompTIA Network+ (N10-006) coming up.\n\n78\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.642\n[SOUND]\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:16.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.110\nAnd in today's episode, we are back with\nmore on our CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.600\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\n\n8\n00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.520\nour resident expert on that very topic,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.500\nWes, welcome back, my man.\n\n10\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.090\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.860\nhaving me here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.070\nAs always, it's definitely a pleasure.\n\n13\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.310\nWe're gonna be diving in today\nlike Dan says with more Net+.\n\n14\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.420\nAnd we're gonna be coming at you\nwith some networking devices.\n\n15\n00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.420\nAnd we're gonna kinda introduce these and\n\n16\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.020\ntell you a little bit about what you\ncan probably expect to see on the exam.\n\n17\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.060\nAgain we can't tell you everything.\n\n18\n00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.410\nBut we'll try to give you some\nof the characteristics and\n\n19\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.750\nthe attributes of these\ndifferent network devices.\n\n20\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.780\nAnd just kind of introduce them to you so\nthat you'll be familiar with them.\n\n21\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.060\nAnd we're just gonna take\nour objective list, guys.\n\n22\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.350\nAnd we're gonna go one\nby one through the list.\n\n23\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.140\nAnd we'll explain them as we get to them.\n\n24\n00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.910\nIn fact, one of the very first things,\nI'll tell you what, before we even get\n\n25\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.725\ninto that let's just talk about\nnetworking devices in general, right.\n\n26\n00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:12.055\nIt really boils down to two different\ntypes of networking devices.\n\n27\n00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.595\nYou have what are known as endpoints, and\n\n28\n00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:16.355\nyou have what are known\nas redistribution points.\n\n29\n00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.845\nThose are two really really the typical\ntwo types of network devices you have\n\n30\n00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:21.850\nout there, right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.370\nIf I have a redistribution point, it's\nusually some form of network connectivity\n\n32\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.480\ndevice that takes the signal that\nit receives and it passes it.\n\n33\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.480\nIt might even amplify it or reboost it,\n\n34\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.220\nsend it on its way with a little\nbit stronger of a signal.\n\n35\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.710\nSo, we don't have to worry about\nthings like signal attenuation.\n\n36\n00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.980\nBut then you have your endpoints,\nand your endpoints, or end systems,\n\n37\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.840\nas you might hear them called, this is\nwhere we actually have our source and\n\n38\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.510\nour destination addressing.\n\n39\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.460\nSource of the communication,\nthat's one endpoint or end system.\n\n40\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.600\nAnd then we send it to another\nend system or endpoint and\n\n41\n00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420\nthat becomes the destination or\nrecipient of the data.\n\n42\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.120\nIn fact, you can even see this in some\nof the names of like some of the older\n\n43\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.970\nrouting protocol like ISIS is one and\nthey called that, Intermediate System to\n\n44\n00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.990\nIntermediate System,\nbecause their naming convention for\n\n45\n00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.270\nthe people that wrote that or\nbuilt that protocol.\n\n46\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.820\nWas to call them intermediate systems and\nend systems.\n\n47\n00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.720\nSo again, an intermediate system would\nbe a redistribution point, right,\n\n48\n00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.290\nit's intermediate between the source and\ndestination.\n\n49\n00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.170\nSo, we're gonna be looking at pretty\nmuch the redistribution systems, right.\n\n50\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.840\nAnd then some of the technologies as well.\n\n51\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.180\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into the very first one here.\n\n52\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.120\nWe're gonna talk about\nwhat are known as routers.\n\n53\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.180\nNow if you're not familiar with\na router and what it does, a router is,\n\n54\n00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.400\nit's a device that really what it does\nis it allows us to basically connect\n\n55\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.260\nto other networks that we're not aware of,\nthat we're not directly connected to.\n\n56\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.930\nIt's one of the most important networking\ndevices really we have on the backbone\n\n57\n00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.480\nof the Internet.\n\n58\n00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.490\nIt's what allows us to communicate\nacross mass distances.\n\n59\n00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.990\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here,\nwe can kinda look at it.\n\n60\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.400\nA router, what it does,\nis it works and it routes traffic.\n\n61\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.769\nIt passes traffic between\nendpoints based on an IP address,\n\n62\n00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.630\na logical address that's set in software.\n\n63\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.130\nIt also makes complex\nrouting decisions and\n\n64\n00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.160\nwhat we mean by complex routing decisions\nis it usually has a database that it\n\n65\n00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.820\nstores inside of it that when it needs\nto determine which way to send, for\n\n66\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.450\ninstance which network\nto send the data to.\n\n67\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430\nOr if it's not directly connected to,\nwhich interface do I send it out\n\n68\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.860\nin order to get that information\nwhere it needs to go.\n\n69\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.762\nIt can make a decision\nbased on a routing table.\n\n70\n00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:39.582\nIt can look at that database and say okay,\n\n71\n00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:45.620\nI see that I've got a route that leads\nout to let's say network a or network b.\n\n72\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.410\nHow do I get it there?\n\n73\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.800\nWell I send it out this interface.\n\n74\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.210\nNow what happens if the route\nthat's in that table\n\n75\n00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.320\nends up becomes a problem or\nit's congested?\n\n76\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.630\nWell this is the beauty of routers.\n\n77\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.680\nRouters can communicate\namongst other routers.\n\n78\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.593\nIn fact they can form this very complex\ntopologies essentially by talking to each\n\n79\n00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:08.783\nother and learning of networks that\nthey weren't aware of before and\n\n80\n00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:12.100\nthat's one of the great\nthings about a router.\n\n81\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.160\nNow, some of the additional, Things that\nI'd like to mention about a router so that\n\n82\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.920\nyou'll be prepared for it on the exam, is\nwhere this sits in the overall OSI model.\n\n83\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.550\nIn another episode,\nwe talked about the OSI model and\n\n84\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.460\nwe've even talked about\na model known as TCP/IP.\n\n85\n00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.290\nSo where do routers sit.\n\n86\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.600\nA router sits at layer\nthree of the OSI model.\n\n87\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.740\nThis is where routing happens.\n\n88\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.650\nThis is where IP addresses\nare applied to our data.\n\n89\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.640\nIt's what routers deal with.\n\n90\n00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.550\nNow if we're talking\nabout the TCIP/IP model.\n\n91\n00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.960\nWe're talking about layer two,\nthat's the Internet layer.\n\n92\n00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.610\nSo, OSI model, layer three, network layer.\n\n93\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.190\nIf you're talking about TCP/IP, it's layer\ntwo, it's called the Internet layer.\n\n94\n00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.605\nAgain, the functionalities between the two\ndifferent models are doing the same thing.\n\n95\n00:04:57.605 --> 00:05:01.505\nSo, know that for\nthe exam just in case they ask you.\n\n96\n00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:06.125\n&gt;&gt; Wes, typically will they ask you\nquestions when it comes to the models that\n\n97\n00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:09.445\nyou might use, are they typically gonna\nask us about the TCP/IP layer, what\n\n98\n00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:13.690\nlayer routers reside on, or is it gonna be\nOSI or is it gonna be a jumble of both?\n\n99\n00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.020\n&gt;&gt; It very well could be both.\n\n100\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.740\nAnd let me tell you a little bit more.\n\n101\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.160\nLet me elaborate a little\nbit more on that.\n\n102\n00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.200\nIf you look at the objectives,\n\n103\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.220\ncuz we don't really know\nexactly what's on the exam.\n\n104\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.700\nBut they do tell you, given a scenario,\napply such and such model, right?\n\n105\n00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.360\nSo whether it's OSI, or whether it's\nTCP/IP so I would say that there\n\n106\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.830\nis a very high probability of\na question being like that on the exam.\n\n107\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.070\nAnd you have to pay attention.\n\n108\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.870\nIs it the OSI model, or\nis it the TCP/IP model?\n\n109\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.380\nAnd that's why it's good to know both,\nand also know the relationship between\n\n110\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.520\nthose two models when we talk about\ncomparisons and the functionality.\n\n111\n00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.080\nSo if this doesn't make sense, it would\nbe time to check out the OSI model and\n\n112\n00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.420\nthe TCP/IP model episodes that we do have\nso that you guys will be aware of that.\n\n113\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.200\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n114\n00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.090\nThe next thing we have are, well, this is\nanother device that is commonly on our\n\n115\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.600\nnetworks and these are known as switches.\n\n116\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.580\nAll right, now a switch.\n\n117\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.710\nWhat is it and what is a switch doing?\n\n118\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.780\nWell, routers can route traffic\n\n119\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.855\nacross networks that they're\nnot directly connected to.\n\n120\n00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:18.480\nA switch on the other hand,\nit doesn't work like that.\n\n121\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.270\nThat's not what it does with one exception\nthat I'll get back to coming up.\n\n122\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.670\nWhat it does, switching technologies,\n\n123\n00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.730\nthey work inside of your\nlocal area networks, right?\n\n124\n00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.720\nRouters can connect and pass traffic\nbetween local area networks, right?\n\n125\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.348\nThey don't have to be directly connected\nto a local area network to get that\n\n126\n00:06:37.348 --> 00:06:38.338\ninformation to it.\n\n127\n00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:40.008\nSwitches on the other hand,\n\n128\n00:06:40.008 --> 00:06:44.610\nthey're only aware of the devices that\nare directly connected to their port.\n\n129\n00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.220\nSo, the switch can communicate inside of\nyour local area network but the basic\n\n130\n00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.160\nswitching functionality doesn't allow you\nto connect to other networks that you're\n\n131\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.579\nnot aware of or that are not directly\nconnected to your connectivity device.\n\n132\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.760\nSo what is it that\na switch is operating on?\n\n133\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.260\nWell the switches they're operating\non MAC addresses all right?\n\n134\n00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.440\nUnlike a router which is dealing with\nlayer three of the USI model and\n\n135\n00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.630\nIP addresses.\n\n136\n00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.300\nSwitches stay, the switching\nfunctionality is at layer two.\n\n137\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.670\nLayer two of the OSI model and the MAC\naddresses also sit at this layer as well.\n\n138\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.230\nSo they use what are known as the physical\naddresses in order to forward traffic in\n\n139\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.860\nbetween their ports and\nthey do inside of our local area networks.\n\n140\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.880\nNow, I said with one exception, right?\n\n141\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.040\nThere is an exception to that.\n\n142\n00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.983\nWe do have what's known\nas a multi-layer switch.\n\n143\n00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:41.390\nA multi-layer switch is\nlike the name implies.\n\n144\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.263\nTheir operations or functionality doesn't\njust stay on a single layer like layer\n\n145\n00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:47.181\ntwo, It can actually traverse layers.\n\n146\n00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.545\nIn fact, one of the most common ones\nwe call is a layer three switch and\n\n147\n00:07:50.545 --> 00:07:54.036\na layer three switch is one that starts\nmoving its job and its business.\n\n148\n00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:58.456\nAs it starts dipping into layer three, and\nsays, I know, router, that's your job but\n\n149\n00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:01.045\nyou know what,\nI understand that functionality.\n\n150\n00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:04.110\nI've got a routing table and\nI can make those decisions as well.\n\n151\n00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.970\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, that seems crazy, right?\n\n152\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.570\nYour thinking, okay,\nwe have routers on layer three and\n\n153\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.580\nwe have switches on layer two.\n\n154\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.705\nHow is it that a switch says,\nyou know what,\n\n155\n00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:14.985\nI'm just gonna start doing router jobs.\n\n156\n00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:16.595\nHow does it make that leap?\n\n157\n00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:19.475\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's usually what's\nknown as a managed switch.\n\n158\n00:08:19.475 --> 00:08:22.655\nLike, for instance, if I have,\nyou might have seen them, maybe you have,\n\n159\n00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:26.315\nmaybe you haven't, a little four\nport Linksys type switch, right?\n\n160\n00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:30.690\nI can't get into that switch into\na configuration interface and\n\n161\n00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.315\nstart to make changes.\n\n162\n00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:34.625\nBut with these switches that are managed,\n\n163\n00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:39.000\nthey can do a lot more functionalities\nthan just basically forwarding traffic.\n\n164\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.730\nLike, giving an example, right?\n\n165\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.210\nWe can set up things like VLANs,\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n166\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.340\nNow, that's at layer two,\n\n167\n00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.355\nbut it understand how to\nlogically divide those ports up.\n\n168\n00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:54.015\nWell, we talk about that logical nature,\nright, that's in software.\n\n169\n00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:56.695\nWell, they just built into\nthe software the ability for\n\n170\n00:08:56.695 --> 00:09:00.912\nthe device to also understand routing\nprotocols and to make those decisions.\n\n171\n00:09:00.912 --> 00:09:03.542\nSo when it comes to how\ndoes the device do that,\n\n172\n00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.532\nusually it's some kind of configuration\nthat's gonna go on inside of the switch.\n\n173\n00:09:06.532 --> 00:09:10.312\nAnd it's something that the vendors or\nthe manufacturers kind of built or\n\n174\n00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:13.012\ncoded into the DNA of that type of switch\n\n175\n00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:15.492\nto allow it to understand\nthings like routing protocols.\n\n176\n00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:18.762\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so where you have a router\nthat has I do routing stuff, and\n\n177\n00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:22.620\nyou have a layer two switch that says\nI do switching stuff at layer two.\n\n178\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.510\nThey've went into that layer three or\nmulti-layer switch and said,\n\n179\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.070\nwell, we're gonna add, we're gonna take\nthat router stuff, we're gonna take\n\n180\n00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.200\nthat switch stuff, we're gonna jam it all\ntogether into one box and make it happy.\n\n181\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and you even have some\nswitches that can act like firewalls and\n\n182\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.270\ndo staple packet inspection.\n\n183\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.930\nIf we start talking about stateful\npacket inspect now we say,\n\n184\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.680\nand that's why they don't say\njust layer three switch anymore.\n\n185\n00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.650\nNow they're saying\nthings like multi-layer.\n\n186\n00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.280\nCuz we have what are known as MFDs,\nmulti functioning device.\n\n187\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.385\nIt's a switch that does a lot more\nthan just layer two forwarding,\n\n188\n00:09:50.385 --> 00:09:52.300\nand even layer three routing.\n\n189\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.190\nIt can do things like staple packet\ninspection which means it's gonna have to\n\n190\n00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.580\nstart looking at things like ports.\n\n191\n00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.550\nWhich means it's gonna have to start\nopening up, peeling back the layers and\n\n192\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.980\nlooking into the transport layer and\n\n193\n00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.880\nlooking at those port values,\nto inspect the data.\n\n194\n00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:08.000\nAnd some of them even go up even further\nthan that, where they're like, HTTP, yeah,\n\n195\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.440\nI know what that is.\n\n196\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.690\nTypically, switches do not.\n\n197\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.540\nIf you talk about\nthe switching functionality,\n\n198\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.540\nthe switching functionality\ndeals with frames.\n\n199\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.860\nThe only thing that it has is some kind\nof field within the frame that tells\n\n200\n00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.250\nupper layer protocols,\nwhich it knows nothing about, what to do.\n\n201\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.170\nWhen I get done with this,\nI don't know who you are up there, but\n\n202\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.390\nI'm gonna hand it off to you,\nthis is what I'd like you to do with it.\n\n203\n00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.640\nWhen we talk about the layer\nthree switch and beyond,\n\n204\n00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.380\nit actually knows what's going on.\n\n205\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.560\nAnd so, it's a little bit more\naware of what's going on across\n\n206\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.310\nnetworks that it's not\ndirectly connected to.\n\n207\n00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.070\nNow, that being said,\nwhen we talk about the switch,\n\n208\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.870\nwe've been talking about\nlayer two of the OSI model.\n\n209\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.730\nThat caveat is, all right, put a little\nparenthesis statement conditional, is that\n\n210\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.820\nif they ask you if it understands routing,\nthen that is a layer three switch.\n\n211\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.690\nDon't think that it just\nbypasses layer two completely.\n\n212\n00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.080\nIt's doing both.\n\n213\n00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.150\nOne of the benefits of that is\nthe fact that if you're only running\n\n214\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.070\nEthernet, right?\n\n215\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.090\nYou already got Ethernet on your system,\nwell guess what?\n\n216\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.610\nYou can have a switch running\nEthernet that built inside of it,\n\n217\n00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.760\nit also understands routing,\nrather than having a router and\n\n218\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.890\nthen having to turn around and\nget a switch as well.\n\n219\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.240\nSo, it's not for everybody,\nit's not a one size fits all.\n\n220\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.130\nSome companies still need the routing\nfunctionality and the gateway\n\n221\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.140\nfunctionality between two dissimilar\nprotocols and dissimilar medias.\n\n222\n00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.790\nSo, routers definitely\nhave their place as well.\n\n223\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.190\nAnd that's one thing, also going back,\n\n224\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.520\njust stepping back a little bit to\nthe routers, the fact that a router can be\n\n225\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.880\nconnected to two dissimilar protocols and\nstill allow that communication, right?\n\n226\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.310\nFor instance, Sonnet, right?\n\n227\n00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.240\nYour demarcation point,\n\n228\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.030\nyou've got some kind of Sonnet\nline maybe coming into the demarc.\n\n229\n00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:49.010\nAnd then on the other side of the router,\nit's got some short range fiber\n\n230\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.390\nconnection that's doing the translation\nbetween those two dissimilar protocols.\n\n231\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.930\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings also about the router.\n\n232\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.290\nRouter's functionality.\n\n233\n00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.170\nDo want to talk just briefly about that.\n\n234\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.060\nWhen it comes to router's functionality,\n\n235\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.580\nit essentially does\nthree different things.\n\n236\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.530\nAnd I'll go ahead and just kind\nof type them out here real quick.\n\n237\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.405\nIt does what we call forwarding, right?\n\n238\n00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:10.565\nNow, what is forwarding?\n\n239\n00:12:10.565 --> 00:12:14.983\nWell, forwarding says basically we've got,\nlet's say, Client05 here, and\n\n240\n00:12:14.983 --> 00:12:17.775\nClient05 has to send\ninformation to Client04.\n\n241\n00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:22.238\nWell, forwarding says that it's gonna send\ninformation, or the client file will send\n\n242\n00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:26.350\ninformation from it's network\nadapter into the port on the switch.\n\n243\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.330\nThe switch inspects what's\nknown as the MAC Table.\n\n244\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.840\nThe MAC Table contains,\n\n245\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.240\nfor instance, the MAC addresses associated\nwith their associated port values.\n\n246\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.560\nAnd it says, well,\nwho's the MAC address, the destination?\n\n247\n00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.710\nOkay, I see this MAC address is on Port 4,\n\n248\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.300\nin this case for\ndemonstration purposes, it's Client04.\n\n249\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.329\nAnd it forwards that traffic\n\n250\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.100\nto the outbound port there\nthat it's connected to.\n\n251\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.480\nSo, it does what's known as forwarding,\nall right?\n\n252\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.380\nNow, it also does things like,\nfor instance,\n\n253\n00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.900\nanother functionality of it is filtering,\nall right?\n\n254\n00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.470\nAnd let me tell you a little\nabout filtering, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.530\nNow, if you're doing something like port\nfiltering, that means you can basically\n\n256\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.740\nassign a MAC address to a port, and\nthen if you don't have that MAC address,\n\n257\n00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.520\nthe traffic's not gonna be allowed\nto flow in and out, right?\n\n258\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.160\nBut when we say filtering in this case,\nimagine it's Client05.\n\n259\n00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.170\nSends a broadcast communication, right?\n\n260\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.100\nInto this switch.\n\n261\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.990\nMeans it's supposed to go to everybody.\n\n262\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.580\nThe switch is intelligent enough,\nit knows that, yeah,\n\n263\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.450\nI need to broadcast that out on\nports going to Client01, right?\n\n264\n00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.910\nClient02, in this case,\nClient03 and Client04.\n\n265\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.720\nBut it's smart enough to know\nthat it was Client05 that sent\n\n266\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.760\nthe broadcast into the switch,\nso there's no reason for\n\n267\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.490\nthe broadcast to go back out to\nthe same person who sent it, right?\n\n268\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:47.870\nSo it filters it.\n\n269\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.230\nSo that's one of the other\nfunctionalities.\n\n270\n00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.466\nNow, switches and network adapters usually\ntalk to each other when they first\n\n271\n00:13:55.466 --> 00:14:00.386\nturn on, and they communicate what's\nknown, they negotiate something\n\n272\n00:14:00.386 --> 00:14:05.647\nknown as their duplex configuration and\ntheir speed configuration, right?\n\n273\n00:14:05.647 --> 00:14:09.013\nI'm operating and\nprobably not happening much any more, but\n\n274\n00:14:09.013 --> 00:14:13.229\nI'm operating at ten megs, 100 megs,\na gig or 1,000 megs, right?\n\n275\n00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:16.746\nAnd the devices need to know that, so\nthey communicate that, and they say, okay,\n\n276\n00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:20.415\nyou said it's 100 meg network, I'm gonna\nset the network adapter in the machine,\n\n277\n00:14:20.415 --> 00:14:22.800\nyou know operating system doing this,\nto 100 megs.\n\n278\n00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.670\nNow we're equal, right?\n\n279\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.740\nWe're operating at a simultaneous two-way\ncommunication, full duplex, right?\n\n280\n00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.200\nThey talk and\nthey negotiate that fact, okay?\n\n281\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.110\nWhat happens if for\nsome reason somebody plugs a device in,\n\n282\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:44.960\nand the switch isn't aware of that device,\nright?\n\n283\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.480\nSo when you plug in, and part of that\ncommunication with the auto negotiation\n\n284\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.890\nis, hey, this is my MAC address, and\nthe switch says, you're on this port.\n\n285\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.530\nI can see your MAC address,\nlet me go ahead and put that in my table.\n\n286\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.780\nAnd the next time somebody needs to\nsend information as that destination MAC\n\n287\n00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.980\naddress I'll know it's you and\nI'll send it directly to you.\n\n288\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:08.880\nBut what if I plug the device in and\nthe switch is off, right?\n\n289\n00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.990\nWell, there is a rare occasion\nwhen the switch might not have\n\n290\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.378\nthat entry in its MAC table, right?\n\n291\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.560\nAnd another computer,\nin this case it may be\n\n292\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.050\nClient05 who is trying to send\ninformation to let's say Client03.\n\n293\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:28.030\nClient03, when you plugged it in, it\nwasn't turned on, switch says MAC table,\n\n294\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.910\nI don't see Client03 here.\n\n295\n00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.964\nBut you know what?\n\n296\n00:15:29.964 --> 00:15:32.941\nClient05, you gotta know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n297\n00:15:32.941 --> 00:15:35.918\nI'll trust that you know\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n298\n00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:39.479\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm gonna try discover who's out there.\n\n299\n00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:42.604\nI dont know what port its on, but\nits gotta be on one of these ports.\n\n300\n00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:47.734\nSo what it does, it sends that\ncommunication out all ports it floods.\n\n301\n00:15:47.734 --> 00:15:49.123\nThat's what is known as a flood.\n\n302\n00:15:49.123 --> 00:15:50.244\nAnd what is it trying to do?\n\n303\n00:15:50.244 --> 00:15:54.376\nIt's trying to discover the MAC address\nof the computer that it's not aware of,\n\n304\n00:15:54.376 --> 00:15:55.730\nin hopes that you do know.\n\n305\n00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.360\nOr your computer knows that it's\nconnecting to that segment.\n\n306\n00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.616\nSo it can also flood too.\n\n307\n00:16:00.616 --> 00:16:03.912\nSo do keep that in mind, all right.\n\n308\n00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:08.738\nAgain, multi-layer switch, keep in mind\nthat this performs both routing and\n\n309\n00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:09.539\nswitching.\n\n310\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.930\nAll right let's see what\nwe've got next here.\n\n311\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.122\nNext thing we have are well,\nfirewalls, all right?\n\n312\n00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:18.920\nNow there are a couple of\ndifferent types of firewalls.\n\n313\n00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.243\nAnd they don't really call\nthem out specifically.\n\n314\n00:16:21.243 --> 00:16:22.992\nThey just kind of\ngenerically say firewall.\n\n315\n00:16:22.992 --> 00:16:25.512\nSo there are a couple of\nthings I'd like to talk about.\n\n316\n00:16:25.512 --> 00:16:30.155\nBecause there are two major different\nclasses of firewalls that we commonly\n\n317\n00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:30.889\ndeal with.\n\n318\n00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:35.090\nThe one firewall that we deal with is\none that maybe you're familiar with.\n\n319\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.542\nI'll start this a little bit out of order,\nright?\n\n320\n00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.910\nMaybe it's one that you're familiar with.\n\n321\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.875\nIf you're running a Windows machine.\n\n322\n00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.323\nIf you're running for\n\n323\n00:16:43.323 --> 00:16:47.827\ninstance a Linux or a Unix system\nyou've probably heard of iptables.\n\n324\n00:16:47.827 --> 00:16:50.150\nIn Windows we have the Windows firewall.\n\n325\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.440\nI'm not sure, what does Mac run?\n\n326\n00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.580\n[LAUGH] I'm not exactly sure what Mac runs\nbut, I believe it's iptables, isn't it?\n\n327\n00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.250\nWould it be?\n&gt;&gt; You could probably install\n\n328\n00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:57.960\niptables on there.\n\n329\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.150\nI don't know that it\ncomes with it by default.\n\n330\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; There is a Mac version of it on-\n\n331\n00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.155\n&gt;&gt; Their own little version, gotcha.\n\n332\n00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:04.655\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n333\n00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:05.572\nIt's not iptables, though.\n\n334\n00:17:05.572 --> 00:17:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.\n\n335\n00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.070\nSo iptables is just pretty much\nin your Linux environment.\n\n336\n00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.460\nAnd it's a firewall, right?\n\n337\n00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.620\nThese are called host-based firewalls,\nwhy?\n\n338\n00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.630\nWell, they're governing traffic or\n\n339\n00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.110\nseeing traffic that is running\non the host themselves, right?\n\n340\n00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.221\nOn the device itself,\nthat's called a host-based firewall,\n\n341\n00:17:23.221 --> 00:17:26.088\nlike the Windows firewall or\niptables, right?\n\n342\n00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:30.830\nNow, it only oversees if you will, or\n\n343\n00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:36.210\nmonitors traffic coming to and\nfrom the network adapter on that machine.\n\n344\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.301\nThat's why they call it\na host-based firewall.\n\n345\n00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.654\nNow the other thing that\nthis could be named.\n\n346\n00:17:39.654 --> 00:17:41.184\nAnd I didn't put it up\nhere in the definition.\n\n347\n00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:45.020\nIs this can also be called\na software-based firewall, why?\n\n348\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.390\nWell, this is a program,\n\n349\n00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.059\nan application that's running in\nthe operating system on this machine.\n\n350\n00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.980\nAnd that's a little bit different than\nthe next type of firewall, right?\n\n351\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.020\nThe next type of firewall's\ncalled a network-based firewall.\n\n352\n00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.520\nSo what's the difference?\n\n353\n00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.290\nWell, I want you to see\nwhere in position or\n\n354\n00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.370\nrelationship to all the devices in the\nnetwork where this firewall sits, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:16.620\nNotice that if Computer 1, 2 or 3 decide\nto communicate with the internet, right?\n\n356\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:22.230\nWell, if it's computer 1,\nits firewall's protecting itself, right?\n\n357\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.160\nBut, computer 2's firewall is\nnot protecting computer 1.\n\n358\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.800\nBut all of this traffic is going\nto the network-based firewall.\n\n359\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.830\nDoesn't matter who's sending\ninformation inbound or\n\n360\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.546\noutbound, it's all going through, if you\nwill, that funnel, that bottle neck.\n\n361\n00:18:35.546 --> 00:18:38.470\nThat's the network-based firewall.\n\n362\n00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.020\nNow I'm gonna say this [LAUGH] and\nwe gotta be careful with it.\n\n363\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.230\nThis is also what's known as\na hardware-based firewall.\n\n364\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.194\nBut you might say,\nwell if it's a hardware-based firewall,\n\n365\n00:18:46.194 --> 00:18:47.390\ndo we have any software running on it?\n\n366\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.838\nIt can't be a software-based firewall.\n\n367\n00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:53.351\nAnd this is where you usually hear people\nsay, yes it's a hardware firewall but\n\n368\n00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:55.040\nit is also running software, right?\n\n369\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.680\nA device has to have an operating system\nor it's just a glorified paperweight.\n\n370\n00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.790\nSo, yes it does have a operating system,\n\n371\n00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.300\nbut notice that it is a physical\ndevice that is on your network.\n\n372\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.710\nSo where do firewalls operate?\n\n373\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.350\nWell, pretty much wherever\nthey want [LAUGH].\n\n374\n00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.708\nBased on their functionality,\n\n375\n00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:19.130\nthey can operate as low as the data\nlink level of the OSI model, level two.\n\n376\n00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.672\nThey can go all the way up doing things\nlike application based firewalls.\n\n377\n00:19:22.672 --> 00:19:26.514\nThat can actually monitor the traffic\ncoming from an application layer\n\n378\n00:19:26.514 --> 00:19:27.610\nprotocol, right?\n\n379\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.090\nSo notice we just went from layer two,\nboom, all the way up to layer seven.\n\n380\n00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:37.170\nIf it's doing stateful packet inspection,\npacket filtering happens at layer two.\n\n381\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.640\nExcuse me, I'm sorry,\nlayer three and four technically.\n\n382\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.171\nSo you could see that it's\noperating at layer two.\n\n383\n00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:46.522\n[LAUGH] It's operating at layer three,\nfour, and seven.\n\n384\n00:19:46.522 --> 00:19:49.614\nSeven being kinda like the third or\nfourth generation application.\n\n385\n00:19:49.614 --> 00:19:52.516\nOr, I'm sorry, third or\nfourth generation type firewalls,\n\n386\n00:19:52.516 --> 00:19:54.280\nthose application layer firewalls.\n\n387\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.190\nThose are the newer models.\n\n388\n00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.243\nAnd when I say newer models,\nI'm not talking six months ago.\n\n389\n00:19:58.243 --> 00:20:02.174\nI'm talking relative to networking\nwithin the last five or six years,\n\n390\n00:20:02.174 --> 00:20:03.164\nmaybe ten years.\n\n391\n00:20:03.164 --> 00:20:06.495\nThe newer generation of firewalls\neven understand things going on\n\n392\n00:20:06.495 --> 00:20:08.260\nup at the application layer.\n\n393\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, kind of staying\nin the same vein of security,\n\n394\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.050\ntrying to keep our networks safe.\n\n395\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.330\nIDSes, IPSes,\n\n396\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.310\nthose kinds of devices, that's something\nyou'll probably run into as well, right?\n\n397\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, in fact, and\n\n398\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.480\nthis is another one that gets kind\nof divided up into two categories.\n\n399\n00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.850\nI've heard the term HIDS,\nhost intrusion detection system.\n\n400\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:34.582\nI've heard NIDS, yes, network intrusion\ndetection systems, all right?\n\n401\n00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:36.590\nSo [LAUGH] what's going on with that?\n\n402\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.470\nWell, the concept is\nreally close to the same.\n\n403\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.130\nLet's go ahead and\ncheck, just generically,\n\n404\n00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.140\na host-based intrusion detection system,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.280\nWith a host-based\nintrusion detection system,\n\n406\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.020\nit's monitoring things like processes that\nare going on within a specific system.\n\n407\n00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.330\nAll right it's essentially\njust an application.\n\n408\n00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:59.240\nIt's monitoring things like processes and\nwhere memory is being used.\n\n409\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.300\nWhat's kind of going on in memory, right?\n\n410\n00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.535\nFor instance we have portions of memory.\n\n411\n00:21:03.535 --> 00:21:05.069\nIt doesn't matter what operating\nsystem you're running.\n\n412\n00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:07.832\nIt's not a Windows thing, it's not\na Mac thing, it's not a Linux thing.\n\n413\n00:21:07.832 --> 00:21:12.393\nWhere all the different OS vendors,\nthey lock down portions of memory.\n\n414\n00:21:12.393 --> 00:21:16.164\nSo they can't exploit code or\ncode can't execute in it.\n\n415\n00:21:16.164 --> 00:21:19.041\nWell, host-based intrusion\ndetection systems,\n\n416\n00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:21.730\nwhat they look at are those\nprocesses in memory.\n\n417\n00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:22.934\nAnd they find out,\n\n418\n00:21:22.934 --> 00:21:28.510\nis that code behaving the way it should\nbe cuz it's not supposed to be executing?\n\n419\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.430\nAnd if I look in that marked area and\nsomething's trying to execute,\n\n420\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.890\nthat should set off a red flag\nthat something's going on here.\n\n421\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.260\nOur CPU processes,\nwhat are going on in the threads and\n\n422\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.380\nstuff that are going in and\nout of our processor and being chewed up?\n\n423\n00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.200\nI say chewed up, processed.\n\n424\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.020\nThings like your network communications,\nright.\n\n425\n00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.190\nBut the big thing to take away\nfrom this is all of this,\n\n426\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.110\nall of this is technically running\nright there on that single machine.\n\n427\n00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.516\nThat is your Host-Based Intrusion\ndetection system.\n\n428\n00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:06.174\nThe next one that they call out,\nthey kind of call out IPSs and IDSs.\n\n429\n00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:07.049\nYou say, wait a second.\n\n430\n00:22:07.049 --> 00:22:12.127\nWhat's the difference between an HIDS and\nand IDS?\n\n431\n00:22:12.127 --> 00:22:15.671\nWell this is where the network\nintrusion detection system comes in.\n\n432\n00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:20.777\nSometimes they just leave off the network\npart and that's just semantics.\n\n433\n00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:26.851\nThe intrusion prevention system on the\nother hand is something that is active.\n\n434\n00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:29.158\nIt implements countermeasures.\n\n435\n00:22:29.158 --> 00:22:34.142\nBecause when you look at an IDS,\nright, the whole purpose of an IDS\n\n436\n00:22:34.142 --> 00:22:38.599\nis essentially to monitor for\nsigns of intrusion, right.\n\n437\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.687\nAlert you to signs of an intrusion, so\nmonitor if you will, detect and alert.\n\n438\n00:22:44.687 --> 00:22:45.911\nThat's an IDS.\n\n439\n00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:49.009\nDoesn't matter if it's host based,\na process or\n\n440\n00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:52.272\nan application that is\nrunning on a single machine.\n\n441\n00:22:52.272 --> 00:22:55.512\nOr if it's a network\nintrusion detection system.\n\n442\n00:22:55.512 --> 00:22:59.550\nAll right,\nthe difference here is that the intrusion\n\n443\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:04.160\nprevention system can\nimplement countermeasures.\n\n444\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.020\nThe IDS is just for monitoring and\nwe're going to send out an alert but\n\n445\n00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.750\nwe're not really doing anything\nabout something that's going on.\n\n446\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.860\nThat's just detection.\n\n447\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.216\nThe IPS on the other hand says, yeah,\n\n448\n00:23:15.216 --> 00:23:18.790\nnot only am I constantly\ndoing real time monitoring.\n\n449\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:24.492\nI'm detecting it, I'm gonna still\nemail you SMS message or an email.\n\n450\n00:23:24.492 --> 00:23:29.028\nBut now fourth,\nI'm gonna actually do something about it.\n\n451\n00:23:29.028 --> 00:23:30.650\nAnd that's the IPS.\n\n452\n00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.450\nAnd I want you to also know position\nin relationship to your network.\n\n453\n00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.880\nNotice that all traffic in the IDS,\n\n454\n00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.040\nnot all traffic is basically\nflowing through the IDS.\n\n455\n00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.472\nThat's the big difference,\nthe IPS, this could be on for\n\n456\n00:23:45.472 --> 00:23:48.003\ninstance Cisco's ASA firewall, right?\n\n457\n00:23:48.003 --> 00:23:51.908\nWhere everything, just like the firewall,\nand a lot of times it's built into\n\n458\n00:23:51.908 --> 00:23:55.292\nthe firewall, every bit of the traffic\nis passing through the IPS.\n\n459\n00:23:55.292 --> 00:23:59.198\nSo, it doesn't matter If it's going\nto computer one, two, or three.\n\n460\n00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:04.733\nIf it's some kind of intrusion they're\ntrying to let's say attack one of these\n\n461\n00:24:04.733 --> 00:24:11.250\ncomputers, the IPS is gonna detect it cuz\nall of that information is passing inline.\n\n462\n00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.400\nNotice that the IDS is just\na passive device on your network.\n\n463\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.640\nYou can do things like port mirroring,\nright.\n\n464\n00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.320\nI plugged the IDS into a port and\nwe do port mirroring and\n\n465\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.060\nall the traffic that comes into one\nport is mirrored through the IDS and\n\n466\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.120\nwe can kind of find out if there's\nsome kind of anomaly, right?\n\n467\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.430\nAnomaly on our network that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n468\n00:24:33.255 --> 00:24:36.330\nAll right, so again,\nthey can be hardware based.\n\n469\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.110\nThey can be software based, IDS,\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n470\n00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.320\nWe have Snort.\n\n471\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.090\nSnort is a software-based.\n\n472\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.850\nYou'll also have things like Cisco.\n\n473\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:51.170\nCisco's got their called NGIPS's,\nacronym next generation IPS.\n\n474\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.903\nThey're really really sophisticated,\n[CROSSTALK] yes exactly.\n\n475\n00:24:53.903 --> 00:24:56.590\nDan you want to talk a little bit\nabout that, they just do everything.\n\n476\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:57.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's really cool.\n\n477\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.170\nYou can actually like import\nprivate keys for encryption, and\n\n478\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.140\nit can actually decrypt data\nas it goes across the line.\n\n479\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.610\nCheck for malicious code or whatever.\n\n480\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.460\nSome sort of maleficent that's happening\nand then verify that that's all good.\n\n481\n00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.630\nIf it is, it allows the network.\n\n482\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.830\nSo it can actually look into encrypted\ntraffic, find if there's a problem, and\n\n483\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.060\nthen stop it if necessary.\n\n484\n00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.419\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThey truly are the.\n\n485\n00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:20.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So that's is why when then,\n\n486\n00:25:20.958 --> 00:25:24.233\nwhen you see that NG, next generation,\nguys, they're literally,\n\n487\n00:25:24.233 --> 00:25:27.843\nI'm just fascinated that everything we\nlooked at is just electrical ones and\n\n488\n00:25:27.843 --> 00:25:30.970\nbinary ones and zeroes and\nsomebody's figured out how to do this.\n\n489\n00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.530\nThey're really, really amazing.\n\n490\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.330\nSo that would be an example\nof a hardware based firewall.\n\n491\n00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.250\nExcuse me, well it would be a firewall but\n\n492\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:42.780\nit's also they got the intrusion\nprevention system built into it.\n\n493\n00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.930\nAll right.\nDan, well I got a few more here, sir.\n\n494\n00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.900\nBut I'm looking at you wanna do one more?\n\n495\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, go.\nGo wanted some more.\n\n496\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.100\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sure.\n\n497\n00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.330\nSo the next thing that they call out,\nthey call out access points, and\n\n498\n00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.580\nI don't really have a diagram for\naccess points.\n\n499\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.230\nAnd we've talked pretty extensively in\nother episodes about wireless local area\n\n500\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.250\nnetwork, WLAN technologies.\n\n501\n00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm guessing it's the point\nat which you access the network.\n\n502\n00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.320\n&gt;&gt; Hey, man,\nI can't get anything passed this guy.\n\n503\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.542\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's for sure.\n\n504\n00:26:06.542 --> 00:26:07.605\nSo an access point, right.\n\n505\n00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:10.367\nYou might be saying, I got an access\npoint at my house right now.\n\n506\n00:26:10.367 --> 00:26:13.180\nI got a wireless router\nsitting behind the TV.\n\n507\n00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.510\nOr somewhere in your house.\n\n508\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.770\nWell, be careful.\n\n509\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.150\nThat's a multi-functioning device.\n\n510\n00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:17.690\nAll right?\n\n511\n00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:23.400\nWhen we talk about an access point,\nwe're talking about a wired device\n\n512\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.430\nthat gives wireless devices, like Dan\nsaid, an access point to your network.\n\n513\n00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.510\nA point of entry into your network.\n\n514\n00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.060\nAll right?\n\n515\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.150\nWhen we talk about the wireless,\nthe access points if you will.\n\n516\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.890\nThey operate at layer\ntwo of the OSI model.\n\n517\n00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.450\nI know my notes, I gotta update my notes.\n\n518\n00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.500\nMy notes are a little wrong.\n\n519\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.030\nI got layer one and I'll adjust that for\nyou guys out there, but it is layer two.\n\n520\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.560\nWhen we talk about the access points and\nwhy do we say it's layer 2?\n\n521\n00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.190\nWell if you've been\nfollowing along some of\n\n522\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.830\nthe other standards that we've been\nthrowing at you, 802.11, right?\n\n523\n00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.780\nThat's the IEEE's specification for\n\n524\n00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:06.190\nwireless local area network communication,\n802.11 sits at layer two,\n\n525\n00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.630\ncarriers sends multiple access,\ncollision avoidance sits at layer 2.\n\n526\n00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.470\nAnd that's essentially what these\naccess points are allowing you to do,\n\n527\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.660\noperating at that same very layer.\n\n528\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.310\nSo, they should be switched in the notes.\n\n529\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:23.570\nIt should be OSI layer two and\nit should TCP/IP layer one,\n\n530\n00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:28.240\nwhen it comes to those devices there.\n\n531\n00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.360\nAll right, so yeah,\nlike I said I think we got a few more, but\n\n532\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.230\nwe'll probably have to save that for\npart two.\n\n533\n00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.660\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell I look forward to doing that.\n\n534\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.550\nHopefully you do as well.\n\n535\n00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.190\nWes, you've guided us\ndown the road thus far.\n\n536\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.160\nI guess we'll go with you another mile.\n\n537\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.070\nHow about that?\n\n538\n00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.740\nThanks for joining us everybody, but\nit looks like we've run out of time for\n\n539\n00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.790\nthis episode.\n\n540\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.960\nHopefully we'll see you\nin part two as well.\n\n541\n00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.840\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n542\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.200\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n\n543\n00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.749\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n544\n00:27:52.749 --> 00:27:58.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n545\n00:27:58.730 -->

00:00:12.569\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.372\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:17.130\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.550\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.270\nin today's episode we are continuing on\nwith more on our Comptia Network+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.640\nAnd of course joining me back in the\nstudio again to continue our conversation\n\n9\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.800\non networking devices,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.620\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n11\n00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.230\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.470\nThanks for having me back here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.190\nThat's right,\nwe are going into a part two,\n\n15\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.540\ncuz we had a handful of devices\nthat we needed to finish, but\n\n16\n00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.330\nthat we couldn't finish it in the time\nthat I had in the first part.\n\n17\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.010\nSo we are back with a part two.\n\n18\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.910\nWe had left off, we were talking,\nin the last episode,\n\n19\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.200\nwe were talking about various devices.\n\n20\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.640\nWe talked about a couple\nof the more famous ones.\n\n21\n00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.510\nRouters, and switches.\n\n22\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.171\nWe talked about other\nthings like your IDSs,\n\n23\n00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:02.180\nIPSs, host-based intrusion detection\nsystems, all kinds of great stuff.\n\n24\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.630\nAnd firewalls.\n\n25\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.770\nWell, the first one that\nwe're gonna talk about now is\n\n26\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.940\nsomething known as content filters,\nall right?\n\n27\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.852\nNow, a content filter,\nits job basically is to filter out,\n\n28\n00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:17.382\nit's gonna be easy to say\njust filter out content, but\n\n29\n00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:21.857\ncontent that maybe the company\ndeems inappropriate inside of work.\n\n30\n00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.853\nThis doesn't necessarily have to\nbe some of the obvious things,\n\n31\n00:01:24.853 --> 00:01:28.610\nand some of those obvious things that we\ncertainly don't think are appropriate in\n\n32\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.870\na workplace environment.\n\n33\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.480\nBut doesn't have to be just\na workplace environment.\n\n34\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.310\nI know, Dan,\n\n35\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.610\nI know you've got kids, I've got kids,\nwe've got to keep our kids safe as well.\n\n36\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.330\nSo we can always get these for\nthe home environments, too.\n\n37\n00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.140\nBut on a larger scale,\nwhen we talk about enterprise wise,\n\n38\n00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620\nwe can also get hardware\nbased content filters and\n\n39\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.110\nwe can have software based\ncontent filters likewise, too.\n\n40\n00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.520\nIn fact, I've got an example.\n\n41\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.870\nHandy Filter's one that's out there.\n\n42\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.420\nIt's a free content web filtering here,\nand\n\n43\n00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.610\nyou can see some of the things that\nyou can do for keeping track of\n\n44\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.490\nthe websites that are visited,\nwhich are the other ways that we could do,\n\n45\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.630\nrestrict Internet by time,\nsecure your children.\n\n46\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.390\nFor me as a father,\nthis is one that I really like, too.\n\n47\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.060\nAnd those concepts that you would\nwant to secure your children,\n\n48\n00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.325\nif you have kids out there, would be\nthe same thing that you would want to do\n\n49\n00:02:16.325 --> 00:02:17.935\ninside of a work environment as well,\n\n50\n00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:22.025\nbecause we certainly don't want certain\nthings being our work environment, right?\n\n51\n00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.285\nRisque sites.\n\n52\n00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:26.205\nSites like for instance,\neven gambling, right?\n\n53\n00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:30.762\nThere's laws in, definitely here in\nthe states where some states you're not\n\n54\n00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:32.152\nsupposed to do online gambling.\n\n55\n00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.122\nIt's illegal, right?\n\n56\n00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:37.152\nThere are some companies that\nwill need to enforce this, right?\n\n57\n00:02:37.152 --> 00:02:41.150\nSo you can't be visiting those\nwebsites on the work hours.\n\n58\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.260\nSo how do we control that?\n\n59\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.810\nNow, that is controlled, and\n\n60\n00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.440\ncan be controlled through\nservices here like Handy Filter.\n\n61\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.830\nThere's bigger services, like I said,\nCloud based services that scale up very,\n\n62\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.808\nvery large.\n\n63\n00:02:51.808 --> 00:02:54.400\nBut you can also have things like\nhardware based content filters.\n\n64\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.100\nI know in one of the places I used to\nwork we had to do content filtering.\n\n65\n00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.840\nAnd ours did quite a few things.\n\n66\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.510\nIt did things like spam filtering as well.\n\n67\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.390\nSo it filtered on multiple levels.\n\n68\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.920\nOne that became a problem in\none of the mentoring areas\n\n69\n00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.450\nthat we had a bunch of computers set up,\nwe got a cease and desist order.\n\n70\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.870\nWe got a cease and desist order from\none of these movie companies, and\n\n71\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.990\nsomebody had been just saying, I get free\nInternet connection here, let me go in and\n\n72\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.830\nI'll start running some\nof my torrents here,\n\n73\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.830\nI'll start downloading\nsome of my torrents.\n\n74\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.450\nSo, we had to do due diligence as\na company, and we responded and\n\n75\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.050\nwe blocked that type of traffic.\n\n76\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.530\nWe filtered it.\n\n77\n00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.920\nCompletely.\n\n78\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.710\nNot to mention other sites, too, like\nonline gaming sites and stuff like that.\n\n79\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.950\nWe had to filter it,\nit was becoming not only for a company\n\n80\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.430\ndetrimental to the continuity of the\ncompany when you get a cease and desist.\n\n81\n00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.650\nBut also detrimental to the learning\nexperience for other students and stuff.\n\n82\n00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.620\nSo you can see that we could\ndo these things as well.\n\n83\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.300\nI'll give you an example of some of them.\n\n84\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.555\nThe one that we had,\nby the way, was a Barracuda.\n\n85\n00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:05.000\nBarracuda's pretty famous for things like\nspam filters, Internet gateway filters,\n\n86\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.030\ncontent filtering as well.\n\n87\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.330\nCisco's got their devices.\n\n88\n00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.600\nDell SonicWall.\n\n89\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.860\nSonicWall used to be it's own thing but\nDell bought them out.\n\n90\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.660\nSo, Dell SonicWall today.\n\n91\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.600\nUbiquity.\n\n92\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.540\nWe've got some Ubiquity devices in\nhere that are connectivity devices.\n\n93\n00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.310\nLike for instance, access points.\n\n94\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.830\nBut that does give you an example,\nWatchGuard is another one, too.\n\n95\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.250\nSo you've got various hardware\nmanufacturers, vendors,\n\n96\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.460\nout there that support these\nas well do offer them.\n\n97\n00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.110\nKeep in mind that when you start\ntalking about a hardware-based\n\n98\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.970\ndevice that's gonna do content filtering,\nthey can get expensive very quick.\n\n99\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.514\nSo there's always things like Cloud-based\nservices that you can use today as well,\n\n100\n00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:44.981\nbecause the popularity of the Cloud.\n\n101\n00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:47.195\nThey definitely integrate that\ninto a solution like that.\n\n102\n00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:50.226\nOr you could pay somebody else, and\nthey have the networking devices and\n\n103\n00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:52.513\nyou're just routing your\nservices through them, and\n\n104\n00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:55.150\nthey can keep that traffic\noff of your network.\n\n105\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.388\n&gt;&gt; Now what's the next objective\nthey call, or device, or\n\n106\n00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:01.565\nsay in the objectives that\nthey call is Load Balancers.\n\n107\n00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:04.640\nAnd ten years ago,\nthey wouldn't have talked about this one.\n\n108\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.250\nNow, this is becoming such\na prevalent type of technology,\n\n109\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.730\nsomething you're probably gonna see and\nprobably even work with as a network tech,\n\n110\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.330\nthey make you sort of\nput that in the system.\n\n111\n00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, because for the most\npart it it would be your network engineers\n\n112\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.190\na lot of times that see them, right?\n\n113\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.420\nA lot of times they're transparent,\nnobody even knows they're there.\n\n114\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.580\nBut load-balancing is definitely\nsomething that, like Dan says,\n\n115\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.530\nit's becoming popular.\n\n116\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.640\nBecause we have things like, for instance,\nyou can have, let's say, a server, right?\n\n117\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.810\nNetworking a lot of times is about what?\n\n118\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.400\nA couple of things, right?\n\n119\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.350\nServices or resources and\ncommunication, right?\n\n120\n00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.665\nWell, if you have a service that's very,\nvery critical, crucial, and important,\n\n121\n00:05:43.665 --> 00:05:48.715\nand it's on a very large scale, you might\nhave a single device that if that single\n\n122\n00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:52.695\ndevice was providing a service, let's\nsay for instance a web server, right?\n\n123\n00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:56.780\nThat maybe one server\nstarts to get overwhelmed.\n\n124\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.430\nSo what do we do?\n\n125\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.860\nWell, you could put a load-balancer in the\nmix, and then you put two servers, three\n\n126\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.600\nservers, or however many servers it takes\nto provide the work load that you need.\n\n127\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.423\nAnd then what you could do is you\ncan balance the workload, right?\n\n128\n00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:15.104\nWe could do load balancing and we could\nsend a portion of the web request to,\n\n129\n00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:18.911\nlet's say, server one, and a portion\nof the request to server two, right?\n\n130\n00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:24.300\nLoad-balancing provides things like\nhigh availability and redundancy.\n\n131\n00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.588\nAnd that's one of the good things\nwhen it comes to load-balancing.\n\n132\n00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:31.880\nFor instance, I know there has been\ntimes when you might go to a website and\n\n133\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.850\nyou don't realize that unless you really\nlook at the like the IP addresses and\n\n134\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.860\nstuff that you're on different IP\naddresses, but you're on the same website.\n\n135\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.870\nWebsite didn't change,\nso what's happening?\n\n136\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.270\nJust means that when that request came\ninto whatever the company is that you're\n\n137\n00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.320\nlooking at their website,\nthey've got a load-balancer there, and\n\n138\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.580\nit said at the time that you visited,\nyou're gonna be redirected here.\n\n139\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.210\nAnd heck, Dan can sit there and\nfire up the same webpage, and\n\n140\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.820\nthen he's got a different IP address.\n\n141\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.060\nBut it's going to the same source.\n\n142\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.880\nAnd what they're doing is they're sending\nthe request to a device that splits it,\n\n143\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.035\nand balances the workload out.\n\n144\n00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:09.680\nLoad-balancers, again, are very, very\ngood for dividing the workload evenly so\n\n145\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.570\nyou get not just a moderate level\nof performance, but you get\n\n146\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.120\nthe performance that you need out of\na service typically that you're providing.\n\n147\n00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.350\nSo, yes, we do have those load-balancers.\n\n148\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.490\nThere's another one that they call out and\nthat is what is known as a hub.\n\n149\n00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.200\nWhen we talk about hubs,\nhubs are an interesting device because we\n\n150\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.620\nreally don't use them too much\nanymore inside of networks.\n\n151\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.230\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not telling you,\nyou say, Wes, well,\n\n152\n00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.300\nI've got five of them sitting in a closet\nhere, and I had to plug one in yesterday.\n\n153\n00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.990\nSo, I'm not saying that we don't use them,\nbut we typically try to stay away from\n\n154\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.450\nthem and\navoid them based on how they send traffic.\n\n155\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:49.766\nHow do they deliver traffic?\n\n156\n00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:55.545\nWell, the first thing to know about a hub\nis a hub is a very, very dumb device.\n\n157\n00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:57.569\nIt doesn't understand logic, right?\n\n158\n00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:01.640\nIt doesn't have any logical operations\nthat are going on with inside of it.\n\n159\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.588\nIn fact, it's hardwired.\n\n160\n00:08:02.588 --> 00:08:04.860\nIt says when I receive a signal,\n\n161\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.330\nI'm hardwired to send the electrical\nsignals out every port.\n\n162\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.350\nSo for instance, if computer one here and\nwe'll go ahead and call this.\n\n163\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.760\nLet's go ahead and do PC1 here,\nmake some distinctions here, right?\n\n164\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.675\nLet's say PC1 decides that it's gonna send\nsignals and it only needs to send it,\n\n165\n00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:27.113\nand we'll get a couple more going here.\n\n166\n00:08:27.113 --> 00:08:33.040\nMaybe it only needs to send it to,\nI don't know, PC4, all right?\n\n167\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.890\nWell, with the way the hub works,\n\n168\n00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.600\nremember that it is hardwired\nthat when traffic goes from one\n\n169\n00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.710\ndevice into a port on the hub,\nwhat ends up happening is that it\n\n170\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.630\njust broadcasts it out all\nthe other ports on the hub.\n\n171\n00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.860\nSo hubs have a problem, or\ncause a problem on our networks.\n\n172\n00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.170\nWhat they do is they essentially increase\nthe contention within our networks, right?\n\n173\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:08.210\nIf one device sends traffic, all the other\ndevices are gonna hear that traffic,\n\n174\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.940\neven if it was only PC4 that needed\nto receive that information.\n\n175\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.870\nSo we essentially have a lot of\nbroadcast communications going on.\n\n176\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.394\nAnd I'm not talking about broadcast guys\nin the sense that we're addressing at\n\n177\n00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:23.293\nlayer two that all F Mac address.\n\n178\n00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:25.880\nHubs don't understand that.\n\n179\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.110\nThey are hardwired to broadcast.\n\n180\n00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.179\nSo when you have hubs in the mix of your\nnetwork, you're increasing the contention,\n\n181\n00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:35.247\nyou're increasing what's known\nas the collisions that go on.\n\n182\n00:09:35.247 --> 00:09:39.321\nBecause essentially it turns this network,\neven though it kinda looks like a star.\n\n183\n00:09:39.321 --> 00:09:42.932\nWe talked about topologies,\nit kinda looks like a star pattern.\n\n184\n00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:47.300\nReally it's laid out like one of\nthe ethernet bus based networks.\n\n185\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.085\nWhy?\n\n186\n00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:51.770\nCuz remember on those older networks\nwhen one computer would send,\n\n187\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.840\neverybody else would hear it.\n\n188\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.270\nDoesn't mean everybody's gonna process it,\ndoesn't mean everybody's gonna respond but\n\n189\n00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.070\neverybody's gonna hear it.\n\n190\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.870\nSo if one computer did that,\nwhat happens to all the other computers?\n\n191\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.912\nWell, they talk the same way.\n\n192\n00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:07.513\nSo we got a lot of unnecessary\ntraffic on our networks, and\n\n193\n00:10:07.513 --> 00:10:09.876\nthat is what logically a hub is doing.\n\n194\n00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:14.097\nIt's basically bringing us back [LAUGH] to\nthe days of thin wire and the thick wire\n\n195\n00:10:14.097 --> 00:10:17.762\nor thick net old ethernet standards\nwhere we had a lot of contention.\n\n196\n00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:22.173\nSo you really kinda want to take these\nout of your networks if you can.\n\n197\n00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:24.510\nI'm not saying that they\ndon't have their purpose.\n\n198\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.750\nI know that we probably talked about it\nbefore, where it's nice to take a hub and\n\n199\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.166\nplug it into the wall, and\nplug another two devices in the hub and\n\n200\n00:10:32.166 --> 00:10:34.020\nyou can kinda mirror the traffic.\n\n201\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.301\nI can capture the traffic because\neverything that's being sent into\n\n202\n00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:39.291\nthe hub is being broadcast out on report.\n\n203\n00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.990\nSo it's a way that you can\nkinda inspect traffic.\n\n204\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.020\nBut there are other ways to do that, and\n\n205\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.890\nif you go onto Cisco they'll talk about\nthings like doing port mirroring for that.\n\n206\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.980\nSo really they have no place\nin our networks anymore.\n\n207\n00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.590\nSo no logic.\n\n208\n00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.520\nIt's like a repeater.\n\n209\n00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.480\nI don't know if I mentioned that.\n\n210\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.757\nIt's kinda like a repeater on every port.\n\n211\n00:10:56.757 --> 00:10:57.632\n&gt;&gt; Multi port repeater, right?\n\n212\n00:10:57.632 --> 00:10:58.660\n&gt;&gt; A multi port repeater.\n\n213\n00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.680\nThat's a very good analogy.\n\n214\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.110\nIt just amplifies and boosts the signal.\n\n215\n00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:11.150\nWhat else, degrades performance,\nno logic, the OSI model.\n\n216\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.860\nRight, where does this fit?\n\n217\n00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.800\nRemember what we said about\nthe physical layer of the OSI model.\n\n218\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.330\nThat's where our electrical\nimpulses get placed on a wire.\n\n219\n00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.330\nThat's what a hub's doing.\n\n220\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.320\nIt doesn't do any framing.\n\n221\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.610\nIt doesn't look at any fields.\n\n222\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.080\nAll it does is it understands\nelectrical signals.\n\n223\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.460\nAccept the signal, I send the signal.\n\n224\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.270\nI don't even care where it's going\ncuz it's going everywhere, really.\n\n225\n00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.360\n&gt;&gt; Not really a great salesman for\nthe community, are you there, Wes?\n\n226\n00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.892\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, if I had to sell hubs,\nI would be a very,\n\n227\n00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:42.867\nvery hungry person for sure.\n\n228\n00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:48.110\nAll right, so that kind of takes\ncare of that OSI layer one.\n\n229\n00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.690\nThe great thing is,\nTCP IP layer one as well.\n\n230\n00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.564\nI love when you've got a couple of\nfacts that you can memorize one time,\n\n231\n00:11:54.564 --> 00:11:56.578\nand it helps you in a couple of areas.\n\n232\n00:11:56.578 --> 00:11:59.565\nSo yeah, definitely be aware of that.\n\n233\n00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:03.755\nNow, the next kind of activity device that\nwe have is one that's also been around for\n\n234\n00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:04.650\na very long time.\n\n235\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.949\nBut still does have a place in a our\nnetworks even if you might think that it\n\n236\n00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:08.501\ndoesn't.\n\n237\n00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.750\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n238\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:15.310\nWell, we're talking about the modem,\nthe modulator demodulator if you will.\n\n239\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.220\nA modem, so what is it do?\n\n240\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.500\n&gt;&gt; Well, I want you to think about those\nelectrical impulses that are coming off\n\n241\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.370\nof, for instance,\n\n242\n00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.820\nthe ethernet cable coming out of\nthe back of your computer, right?\n\n243\n00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.930\nThose are binary ones and zeroes.\n\n244\n00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.010\nWell, if a computer speaks binary ones and\n\n245\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.310\nzeroes, how do we take those\nbinary ones and zeroes and\n\n246\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.440\nplace them on the old PSTN line, the\npublic switch telephone networks, right?\n\n247\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.860\nYou might be saying, well, Wes,\nwhat's the big deal about that?\n\n248\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.080\nWell, you gotta understand\nthe signal types.\n\n249\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.935\nOne signal type really only has\ntwo possible values, right?\n\n250\n00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:48.261\nOn or off, one or zero, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:51.621\nBut dialup goes over phone lines and\n\n252\n00:12:51.621 --> 00:12:56.480\nphone lines are noise,\nthat's sound, right?\n\n253\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.070\nThat's essentially what it is.\n\n254\n00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.030\nSo what a modem is doing, let's take\nall the complexities out of it, guys.\n\n255\n00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.640\nDon't worry about the layers or\nanything like that.\n\n256\n00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.340\nWhat does a modem do?\n\n257\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.300\nIt takes binary bits, and\nturns them into a sound.\n\n258\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.490\nAll it's doing.\n\n259\n00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:18.230\nI say it like it's very, very easy and\nI could invent it in my sleep.\n\n260\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.777\nThere's a lot of electrical engineering\nthat went on in these things.\n\n261\n00:13:20.777 --> 00:13:23.985\nThe people that made these are brilliant,\nso I'm not trying to downplay that.\n\n262\n00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:28.544\nBut simplistically, if you wanna know what\nit's doing, it's taking those impulses,\n\n263\n00:13:28.544 --> 00:13:31.910\nthose on and off electrical pulses and\nturning them into a sound.\n\n264\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.650\nTaking a digital signal, right?\n\n265\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.660\nModulating it, okay?\n\n266\n00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.870\nBasically taking a carrier signal,\n\n267\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.480\nsee a carrier signal can travel very,\nvery far distances, all right?\n\n268\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.420\nWhen we talk about far distances,\n\n269\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.560\nthe signal that's coming from your\ncomputer does not travel far distances.\n\n270\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.740\nSo what happens with modulation,\n\n271\n00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.540\nwhen we do modulation, is we run\nthe digital signal through what's known as\n\n272\n00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.900\na digital to analog converter chip,\nif you will, DACs.\n\n273\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.403\nAnd the DACs, what they do is they\nessentially take that carrier signal,\n\n274\n00:14:11.403 --> 00:14:15.848\nthat analog carrier signal\nthat can travel far distances.\n\n275\n00:14:15.848 --> 00:14:21.707\nAnd take the low frequency sound that\nyour data has just been turned into.\n\n276\n00:14:21.707 --> 00:14:27.709\nAnd superimpose the low frequency\ndata signal modulation over the long,\n\n277\n00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:32.259\nlong distance carrier signals\nthat could be traveled or\n\n278\n00:14:32.259 --> 00:14:35.770\nbasically can be sent over the PSTN lines.\n\n279\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.870\nNow, I've mentioned\na couple of those terms.\n\n280\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.840\nLet's go ahead and make sure that we know\nwhat I'm saying here when I say acronyms.\n\n281\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.660\nCuz again, it's alphabet soup,\n\n282\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.270\njust like most of your technical\ncertifications are, right?\n\n283\n00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.990\nWe're talking about public\nswitch telephone networks, or\n\n284\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.613\nsometimes just called plain\nold telephone service line.\n\n285\n00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:55.550\nSo that's what you got there.\n\n286\n00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.790\nSo again, keep in mind modem is just\nsimply modulation demodulation.\n\n287\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.370\nIf it's the return trip or\nit's the recipient in this case,\n\n288\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.470\nremember what's happening\nis we have that sound.\n\n289\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.390\nNow we gotta get it turned\nback into electrical impulses.\n\n290\n00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.330\nSo what's the first thing that happens?\n\n291\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.931\nWell, the first thing that happens in\na demodulation is we remove the two\n\n292\n00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:15.826\nsounds, right?\n\n293\n00:15:15.826 --> 00:15:18.570\nThe carrier signal that\ncan travel long distances.\n\n294\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.850\nSo what's left?\n\n295\n00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.090\nThe very low frequency data signal.\n\n296\n00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.140\nAnd then that's run through\nthe demodulation process of converting\n\n297\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.910\nback into a digital signal and\ndelivering it to the endpoint.\n\n298\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.260\nAll right, so Dan, let me see here.\n\n299\n00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.390\nOSI model layer two,\nby the way, with your modems.\n\n300\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.930\nI will throw cable modems here.\n\n301\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.770\nI don't think we have those in there.\n\n302\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.785\nThey just kinda generically talk,\nwell, they do mention analog modem.\n\n303\n00:15:42.785 --> 00:15:47.240\nLet me go ahead a throw a cable\nmodem in here because cable modems,\n\n304\n00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.870\nthey do a lot of things.\n\n305\n00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.023\nAnd it really depends.\n\n306\n00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:53.842\nI don't know about your cable\nmodem at your house there Dan, but\n\n307\n00:15:53.842 --> 00:15:55.900\nI know I got a coaxial cable there.\n\n308\n00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.710\nIt's got an ethernet cable there.\n\n309\n00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.780\nI know it's handling things like DHCP.\n\n310\n00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.250\nSo cable modem's really doing a lot.\n\n311\n00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.740\nThey operate at layer two, and\nthen depending on their functionality,\n\n312\n00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.220\nthey can operate at higher\nlayers than that as well.\n\n313\n00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.627\nThe traditional analog modem,\n\n314\n00:16:11.627 --> 00:16:16.797\nthat's something that's operating\nat layer two of the OSI model and\n\n315\n00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:22.253\nthat's the data link layer or\nlayer one if you will of the TCP/IP model.\n\n316\n00:16:22.253 --> 00:16:26.168\nAll right now that brings us to\nour next little topic here and\n\n317\n00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:29.940\nthat's something known as a packet shaper,\nall right?\n\n318\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.550\nSo what is a packet shaper?\n\n319\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.150\nI don't know, I guess if you want\nyour packets to be really fit\n\n320\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.485\nyou send them to a packet shaper.\n\n321\n00:16:37.485 --> 00:16:40.360\nNo, joking aside guys this is kinda,\nI want you to pick up this,\n\n322\n00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.230\nI had good analogy, I said it's\nthe opposite of packet filtering.\n\n323\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.880\nAll right so let's put those two together,\nwhat does packet filtering do?\n\n324\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.730\nDrops packets.\n\n325\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.400\nI've seen a packet,\nI don't want that traffic on my network,\n\n326\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.340\nwhatever my security policy is or\nfor whatever reason, drop it.\n\n327\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.290\nPackage shaping ensures\nthe exact opposite.\n\n328\n00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.570\nWe slow down traffic.\n\n329\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.850\nWe make sure this traffic goes here and\nthis traffic goes here in real time.\n\n330\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.250\nWe ensure that package don't get dropped.\n\n331\n00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.570\nDoes that make sense, that's the opposite.\n\n332\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.210\nSo packet shaping does\nthe opposite of packet filtering.\n\n333\n00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:19.020\nWhere packet filtering says I see that,\nI got an ACL or a rule, drop it.\n\n334\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.240\nPacket shaping says I see this data,\nthat's real time transfer protocol,\n\n335\n00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.170\nI'd better put some put\nsome speed on that and\n\n336\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.440\nsend it to the end point real quick,\nright.\n\n337\n00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.550\nOr FTP might slow you down just a little\nbit because you don't need quite the same\n\n338\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.460\namount of bandwidth as that real time\nvideo teleconferencing technology did.\n\n339\n00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.150\nHow do we do this?\n\n340\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.700\nWe can do this with things\nlike quality of service.\n\n341\n00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.440\nRight, class of service and stuff.\n\n342\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.080\nSo packet shaping just ensures that you\nhave a smooth processing of the data so\n\n343\n00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.190\nthat packets don't get dropped.\n\n344\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.378\nAll right,\nwhat else have we got here, Dan?\n\n345\n00:17:52.378 --> 00:17:53.150\n&gt;&gt; VPN concentrators.\n\n346\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.720\n&gt;&gt; That's what they call out next.\n\n347\n00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.350\nAnd these are fun little devices.\n\n348\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:00.560\nIf you ever had a deal with the VPN\nenvironment, you can know that like\n\n349\n00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.230\nyou just look at your life and go,\nI think I'm gonna go be a truck driver or\n\n350\n00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.235\nsomething, because these VPN clients\nof mine can be a pain in the back side.\n\n351\n00:18:09.235 --> 00:18:12.735\nVPN concentrators can make\nour lives a little bit easier\n\n352\n00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:14.485\nwhen we're dealing with that\nkind of environment right?\n\n353\n00:18:14.485 --> 00:18:17.385\n&gt;&gt; That's right as long as you get the end\nusers out of that equation you're gonna\n\n354\n00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:18.645\nhave a good life and that's right.\n\n355\n00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:21.575\nBecause VPNs for\nsomebody like Dan setting them up and\n\n356\n00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:23.900\nhaving to support them, it's okay for him.\n\n357\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.320\nIt's when you have to deal with somebody\nwho's on the other end, 100 miles away,\n\n358\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.660\nthat doesn't know how to configure\nthe other side of the VPN.\n\n359\n00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.170\nSo a VPN in general, right?\n\n360\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:38.300\nWe talk about VPNs in other episodes, but\nlet me just kind of recap real quick.\n\n361\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.730\nSo the VPN,\n\n362\n00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.860\nit allows you to take an existing public\nnetwork and tunnel through it, so\n\n363\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.230\nthat you can essentially create your own\nvirtual point-to-point-type link, okay.\n\n364\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.620\nAnd then you encrypt that traffic, so\nthat you further scramble the data, so\n\n365\n00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.610\nif somebody's trying to look outside-in,\nthey don't see anything, right?\n\n366\n00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.360\nThat's the very, very basic of a VPN.\n\n367\n00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.330\nNow, here's where the concentrator\ncomes into play, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:11.920\nThat encryption, decryption and tunneling\ntakes a lot of processing power, right.\n\n369\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.180\nYou can even find that on\nsome devices support VPNs,\n\n370\n00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:20.110\nthey'll say supports at\nmaximum of ten VPNs.\n\n371\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.980\nWell why is it only ten?\n\n372\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.090\nBecause think about it each one of\nthose connections has to encrypt data,\n\n373\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.750\nhas to decrypt data,\nencrypt data, decrypt data.\n\n374\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.940\nAnd you throw things like transmission\ncontrol protocol in there\n\n375\n00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.560\nwhere you're monitoring\nthe state of the communications.\n\n376\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.020\nWe have a lot going on.\n\n377\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.068\nSo what kind of device can I\nget that can aggregate 100,\n\n378\n00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:47.015\n1,000 simultaneous VPNs\nthat doesn't completely\n\n379\n00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:52.179\nslow everything down to where\nwe might as well have a modem?\n\n380\n00:19:52.179 --> 00:19:54.610\nAnd that's where\nthe concentrator comes in.\n\n381\n00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.110\nNow Cisco makes them.\n\n382\n00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.600\nI don't think they them\nanymore as individual devices.\n\n383\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.490\nI know they build them into\nthe functionality of their other\n\n384\n00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.610\nbig devices today.\n\n385\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.720\nWe were talking about things like the next\ngeneration IPS that does everything except\n\n386\n00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.160\nfor launch the space shuttle.\n\n387\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.340\nA lot of these devices do build\nthat functionality right in.\n\n388\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.550\nSo you'll still see them,\n\n389\n00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.410\nthe VPN concentrators are still\nout there everywhere.\n\n390\n00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.400\nBut you might see today\nwhere that functionality\n\n391\n00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.230\nis built in to an ASA firewall or\na device that's doing a lot more.\n\n392\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:29.280\nBut just remember, the VPN concentrator,\nthe point of it is because a VPN,\n\n393\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.690\na single VPN communication and\nconnection is so processor intensive, when\n\n394\n00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:40.850\nyou need to scale up to hundreds, hundreds\nand hundreds of simultaneous VPNs,\n\n395\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.370\nthen you need a device that's got the\nprocessing power in order to manage those\n\n396\n00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.710\ntunnels and do the encapsulation, the\nencryption and decryption, all of that.\n\n397\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.960\nFor a single connection,\nmultiply times 1,000.\n\n398\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.570\nAgain, they scale up very, very well.\n\n399\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.580\nAll right, well Dan,\nI think that's got it.\n\n400\n00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.050\nI do wanna make mention of one more thing.\n\n401\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.850\nI kinda forgot,\n\n402\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.525\nI wanted to show you guys in relation\nto our networks one last thing.\n\n403\n00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:08.535\nWe talked about routers and\nwe talked about switches and\n\n404\n00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:12.835\nhow routers see IP addresses and\nthe switches see MAC addresses.\n\n405\n00:21:12.835 --> 00:21:16.335\nLet's, if we could,\njust take a little look here, all right?\n\n406\n00:21:16.335 --> 00:21:18.645\nOur router when it's going\nto look at networks,\n\n407\n00:21:18.645 --> 00:21:20.855\nit's gonna see IP addresses, right?\n\n408\n00:21:20.855 --> 00:21:24.145\nSo all these IP addresses,\nthis is what the router sees.\n\n409\n00:21:24.145 --> 00:21:27.230\nOur switches on the other hand,\nthey don't see,\n\n410\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:31.060\noutside of a layer three switch,\nthey don't see these IP addresses.\n\n411\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.710\nWhat they see are the MAC addresses.\n\n412\n00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.450\nSo keep in mind, that's the difference\nbetween a connectivity device, network\n\n413\n00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:42.240\ndevice that's operating at level three,\nversus one that's operating at layer two.\n\n414\n00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.950\nWhat they see are completely different.\n\n415\n00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.030\nUnless they see both,\nlike a layer three switch.\n\n416\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.810\nThen it'll see all of this\n&gt;&gt; Wes, you've done a great job about\n\n417\n00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:55.110\nwalking us through all of these individual\ndevices that we might encounter as\n\n418\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.190\na network technician, someone who is\nstudying for a Network+ exam that we would\n\n419\n00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.640\nhave some familiarity with that, know\nexactly what each one of those devices do,\n\n420\n00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.120\nhow they compare and\ncontrast with the other devices as well.\n\n421\n00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.570\nWas there anything else\nthat we needed to cover?\n\n422\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.390\nMaybe you want to wrap this up in a pretty\npink package with a bow on top for us.\n\n423\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you know we can do that.\n\n424\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.760\nIn fact I've got a diagram that\nwe're gonna look at it and\n\n425\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.790\nwe can kind of just do a real quick recap.\n\n426\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.710\nSo I'll tell you what.\n\n427\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.840\nLet's go ahead and look at my computer.\n\n428\n00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.100\nSo this little chart that I made\nto kind of do a real quick recap.\n\n429\n00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.200\nWe've got the device.\n\n430\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.750\nWe've got the OSI model and\nwe've got the TCP/IP model.\n\n431\n00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.500\nKeep in mind that routers operate\non layer 3 of the OSI model,\n\n432\n00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.700\nlayer 2 of the TCP/IP model.\n\n433\n00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.002\nSwitches in less than multilayers\nswitch like we talked,\n\n434\n00:22:41.002 --> 00:22:45.810\nswitching happens at layer 2 in TCP/IP,\nIP that's layer 1.\n\n435\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:50.060\nThe multilayer switch, we talked\nabout already operates at more than\n\n436\n00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.640\none layer depending on what its doing\nit can go high than just layer 3.\n\n437\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.790\nYour firewall is a multilayered\ndevice likewise.\n\n438\n00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.880\nYour hubs,\nthat's a layer 1 device, remember?\n\n439\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.090\nIt's just dealing with\nphysical electrical impulses.\n\n440\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:08.050\nThe modem is at layer 2 of the OSI model,\nand layer 1 of the TCP/IP model.\n\n441\n00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.590\nAlso remember too that the access points,\n802.11, IEEE 802.11,\n\n442\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:17.000\nthat's gonna operate at\nlayer 2 of the OSI model and\n\n443\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.830\nit's gonna operate at layer\n1 of the TCP/IP model.\n\n444\n00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.970\nSo, just kind of a real\nquick little recap so can,\n\n445\n00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.970\ncuz we talked about a lot of different\ndevices that hopefully on the exam,\n\n446\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.860\nif I ask you anything about the\nrelationship to the standards models that\n\n447\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.048\nwe have out there,\nyou'll be prepared for the exam.\n\n448\n00:23:34.048 --> 00:23:35.990\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, thank you so much for\n\n449\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:41.380\nthat little recap of all the interesting\nitems that we have walked through so far.\n\n450\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.040\nBut it does look like it's time for\nus to close our show.\n\n451\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.870\nThanks for joining us today, and\nwe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n452\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.620\nBut like I said, signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n453\n00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n454\n00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.191\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n455\n00:23:53.191 --> 00:23:59.079\n[MUSIC]\n\n456\n00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:02.423\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.919\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.934\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Net+ theories,\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:21.587\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking\nat identifying network services and\n\n6\n00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.980\napplications.\n\n7\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.562\nWe've got some really great\ncontent to cover in this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:29.316\nI'm super excited, we have Mr.\nWes Brian in the studios with us today.\n\n9\n00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.452\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.452 --> 00:00:31.563\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:35.917\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\ndifferent services on a network in, well,\n\n12\n00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:39.690\nthey say applications, but when it comes\ndown to it most of it is a service.\n\n13\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.640\nSo, let's go ahead and dive right in here.\n\n14\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.060\nThe very first thing that we're gonna\nbe talking about is really related to\n\n15\n00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.430\nsecurity.\n\n16\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.390\nWe're gonna take a trip through time,\nback to the early day,\n\n17\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.350\nthe yesterday of our Internet.\n\n18\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.141\nI mean, even farther before it\nwas even called the Internet,\n\n19\n00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.302\ngo back to the 70s when\nit was called ARPANET.\n\n20\n00:00:57.302 --> 00:01:01.299\nIn those very first early days of the\nInternet, I think we only had like five\n\n21\n00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.359\nentities on the Internet at all,\nnot like we have today.\n\n22\n00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:08.003\nSo, there wasn't a lot of security\nthat was built-in because, well,\n\n23\n00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:08.975\nit was a lot safer.\n\n24\n00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:14.130\nIt was a lot safer net back then, but\nafter the .COM Boom, and as we see today,\n\n25\n00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.020\nit's not quite the safe place and\nsafe stomping grounds that it used to be.\n\n26\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.160\nAnd we also have a lot more data that\nis traversing our networks today and\n\n27\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.750\nwe need a way in which I can send a piece\nof information from my network from let's\n\n28\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.420\nsay Cherokee's network.\n\n29\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.250\nAnd if the man in the middle or\nhacker in the middle\n\n30\n00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.460\nIs out there trying to eavesdrop on us,\nthey can't gain access to our data.\n\n31\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.130\nSo, how can we do this?\n\n32\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.060\nWell, [LAUGH] in the early days,\nwhat we would do\n\n33\n00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.450\nis you would throw money at the problem\nand everything would be solved, right?\n\n34\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.060\nJust kidding.\n\n35\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.750\nIn the early days,\n\n36\n00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.850\nwhat you would do is you would\nget a Point to point line, right.\n\n37\n00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.990\nYou and\nI have a serial point connection and\n\n38\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.640\nyou knew that was pretty\nmuch a safe connection.\n\n39\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.190\nWhy.\nWell ,because you were the only one who\n\n40\n00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.330\nwas using that line.\n\n41\n00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.470\nWell, now that with our packaged switched\nnetworks is a little bit different,\n\n42\n00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.440\ncause we get a multiple people\nof sharing that same network.\n\n43\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.230\nWell, that calm isn't too far off west\nbecause it's depending on the distance\n\n44\n00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.820\nto go ahead and\nReserve that point-to-point line,\n\n45\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.580\nyou could be essentially\nthrowing money at your ISP.\n\n46\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.640\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThat's right.\n\n47\n00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.540\nAny time you need to make\nsomething completely secure,\n\n48\n00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.730\nthe more money you throw at it,\nthe more secure it seems to get.\n\n49\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.875\nHowever since an unlimited bank account\ntypically isn't what companies have.\n\n50\n00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:29.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n51\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.440\n&gt;&gt; This certainly\n\n52\n00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.480\nwhat they had in the early 90s.\n\n53\n00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920\nMicrosoft decided we need a technology\nthat's gonna allow us to use public\n\n54\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.620\nnetworks.\n\n55\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.810\nAnd as they're getting more and\nmore people on these public networks,\n\n56\n00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.520\nwe need a way to secure that communication\nto where only the intended source and\n\n57\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.740\nrecipient of that information\ncan actually see it.\n\n58\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.770\nAnd that led us into VPN technology.\n\n59\n00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.540\n&gt;&gt; Something known as\na virtual private network.\n\n60\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.590\nAnd when it comes to a virtual\nprivate network, all it really is,\n\n61\n00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.400\nis a virtualized point to\npoint connection that looks\n\n62\n00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.040\ndedicated to the two\nendpoints that are using it.\n\n63\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.790\nAnd I say two endpoints, could be\nmultiple people using it a single site,\n\n64\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.040\nwhich we'll look at coming up.\n\n65\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.300\nSo keep in mind that a VPN is\na way that you can create with a,\n\n66\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.710\nSeries of technologies,\nyou can create a tunnel if you will that\n\n67\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.860\nsimulates a virtualized point to point\nconnection over a public network.\n\n68\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.110\nAnd then we can couple this with\nencryption techniques that can also take\n\n69\n00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.610\nthe data that you're sending through that\ntunnel and scramble it in a way That takes\n\n70\n00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.420\nplain text, produces cypher text, and\nwe can add a little bit more security to\n\n71\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.520\nthe information it's traversing that\nvirtualized point-to-point link.\n\n72\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.230\nSo I've got a little\nbit of a diagram here.\n\n73\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.660\nWe'll talk about what the term\nsite-to-site means here in a second,\n\n74\n00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.940\nbut what we wanna look at here is\nI've got one side of a corporate LAN.\n\n75\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.640\nAnd I've got another corporate, right?\n\n76\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.830\nAll the say is, I guess in this point,\nwe call a WAN connection, right?\n\n77\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.000\nBecause it's separating multiple\ngeographical locations here.\n\n78\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.830\nBut the problem is we've got\nthe Internet out here, right?\n\n79\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.280\nAnd with the Internet Comes all\nthe final level, we're hacking things.\n\n80\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.850\nAnd security exploits out themself.\n\n81\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.000\nI was almost gonna put hackers there.\n\n82\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.405\nLet me just go ahead and\ncall what i meant to call, internet.\n\n83\n00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:13.850\n[LAUGH] So, we're using a lot of\nother people's' infrastructure.\n\n84\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.690\nRight?\nI wanna make sure that Between these two\n\n85\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.350\nnetworks over this public network\nwhich in this case is the Internet,\n\n86\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.260\nthat we can secure the communication.\n\n87\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.420\nWe do that in VPNs,\nthere's something known as tunnelling.\n\n88\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.910\nWe use a series of protocols and I'll come\nback to this diagram coming up What we do,\n\n89\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.880\nis we use a series of\ntunneling protocols or\n\n90\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.400\nwhat they do is they build up this\nvirtualize point to point connection,\n\n91\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.000\nthey maintain the tunnel and then what\nwe use are encryption technologies\n\n92\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.510\nthat as the data comes through this\ntunnel and goes to the other side.\n\n93\n00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.690\nSomebody that's on the outside\ncan't see what's going on.\n\n94\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.480\nAll right.\n\n95\n00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.670\nAgain virtual private network.\n\n96\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.600\nNow how does this happen?\n\n97\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.610\nWell this happens through\nsomething known as tunneling.\n\n98\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.900\nRight.\nLike we talked about.\n\n99\n00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.450\nSo what do we have?\n\n100\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.330\nAll right.\nWell we've got one protocol that\n\n101\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.900\nbuilds this virtual point-to-point link.\n\n102\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.380\nAnd then and that's essentially\ncalled a carrier, a carrier protocol.\n\n103\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.240\nThen we have our data and our data\nhas to be in encapsulated in a way\n\n104\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.340\nthat it can traverse the carrier protocol.\n\n105\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.400\nSo there's two protocols\nworking together here.\n\n106\n00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.900\nYou have a carrier protocol that's\nresponsible for moving the traffic through\n\n107\n00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.410\nthe tunnel and a passenger protocol that\nPrepares the data to enter the tunnel.\n\n108\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.940\nAll right.\n\n109\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.510\nNow, depending on how we implement these,\n\n110\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.140\nwe can use a series of\ntunneling protocols.\n\n111\n00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.710\nWe can also use a series\nof encryption protocols.\n\n112\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.250\nThe types of protocols that we\nuse are really all contingent\n\n113\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.470\non what level of encryption that we want.\n\n114\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.100\nI'm gonna go ahead, Cherokee, and\nI'm gonna kinda talk a little bit about\n\n115\n00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.610\nthe protocols, the tunneling protocols\nthat we can use, and then what we'll do.\n\n116\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.810\nAs we talk about the different tunneling\ntypes cuz how we set this up is really\n\n117\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.980\ncontingent on how we meet\naccess into our networks and\n\n118\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.780\nacross this public networks okay.\n\n119\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.620\nSo what are some of the tunneling\nprotocols that we can see\n\n120\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.900\ninside of our networks?\n\n121\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.280\nAll right, well one of the oldest ones.\n\n122\n00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.850\nRemember I told you that early mid 90's,\nMicrosoft got.\n\n123\n00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.090\nDevelop really the first\ntunnelling protocol.\n\n124\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.230\nIt was called PPTP that's the point\nto point tunnelling protocol.\n\n125\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.220\nPoint to point tunnelling protocol.\n\n126\n00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Some of these acronyms get a little\ncrazy when you're talking about\n\n127\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.810\nthese tunnelling protocols.\n\n128\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.140\n&gt;&gt; They sure do.\n\n129\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.110\nAlright now there were.\n\n130\n00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.960\nSome limitations.\n\n131\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.950\nSo the point to point tunneling protocol,\nthere wasn't a lot interoperability\n\n132\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.650\nbetween things like gateway devices,\nwhich we'll see coming up here.\n\n133\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.150\nSo what happened is Microsoft\ngot together with Cisco and\n\n134\n00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.590\nthey formed this little coalition,\nif you will.\n\n135\n00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.230\nAnd Microsoft says, well,\nwe need something better, right?\n\n136\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.770\nWe need something that's a little\nbit more interoperable for\n\n137\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.030\nmultiple devices out there.\n\n138\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.510\nSo what they did is they took the best\nof what they had, They have PPTP.\n\n139\n00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.440\nWell Cisco at the time, also had\nwhat their proprietary technology.\n\n140\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.550\nAnd that was called L2F, right,\nlayer to forwarding, so L2F here.\n\n141\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.355\nL2F, if I can spell that acronym,\nI'll be doing great.\n\n142\n00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:11.140\n[LAUGH] All right, and then they added and\ncombined the best of these two protocols.\n\n143\n00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.100\nPPTP, And L2F.\n\n144\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.450\nWe add these two together and\nthe marriage between these two\n\n145\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.580\nprotocols we get one of the most popular\ntunneling protocols that we use today.\n\n146\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.140\nAnd that is something known as\nL2TP that's known as Layer 2\n\n147\n00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.060\nTunneling Protocol L2TP again it\nwas formed out of this console or\n\n148\n00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.640\nI guess you would say a collective\nwork between Microsoft and\n\n149\n00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.670\nCisco they say well you've got a tunneling\nprotocol, we've got a tunneling protocol\n\n150\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.180\nlet's Go ahead we'll put\nthe best features together.\n\n151\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.240\n&gt;&gt; It's like the best of both worlds.\n\n152\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.260\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n153\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.475\nWe'll put them together and\nwe come out with L2TP.\n\n154\n00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:53.504\nAlright, so that's another one that\nyou could see out there, L2TP.\n\n155\n00:07:53.504 --> 00:07:55.615\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nI'm gonna erase some of the stuff here.\n\n156\n00:07:55.615 --> 00:08:03.130\nSo we've got L2TP Now there is something\nthat gotta understand with L2TP and PPTP.\n\n157\n00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.340\nThey use a couple of ports that\ncan be blocked by firewalls, and\n\n158\n00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:14.456\nin other episodes we'll talk about\nthese ports and what they mean for us.\n\n159\n00:08:14.456 --> 00:08:17.125\nBut for now I do want you to know,\nif we're gonna be talking\n\n160\n00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:20.015\nabout the tunneling protocols\nthe ports that are associated,\n\n161\n00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:23.720\nthat you open on the firewall is something\nyou have to be aware of, and not only for\n\n162\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.790\na Net+ exam but\nalso if you're gonna implement these.\n\n163\n00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:32.780\nThe PPTP, Point to Point Tunneling\nProtocol, that uses port 1723 and\n\n164\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.892\nL2TP uses port 1701.\n\n165\n00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:41.274\nNow with the nature of these tunneling\nprotocols being in a range of\n\n166\n00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:46.310\nports the firewall typically block,\nthat can cause some problems.\n\n167\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.940\nSo today what we also have is\na third tunneling protocol and\n\n168\n00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.690\nactually there is a fourth one,\nit's not on the exam objectives but\n\n169\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.680\nI'm gonna mention it anyway just cuz we\nwant you to be prepared for the exam.\n\n170\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:03.340\nSo we've got L2TP, and\nwhat they did is they said, you know what?\n\n171\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.060\nWe need a tunneling protocol, we need a\nlittle bit of encryption but we also need\n\n172\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.950\nsomething that can traverse firewalls\nrelatively easy, so what did they do?\n\n173\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:18.631\nThey took and made a secure socket\nlayer tunneling protocol, SSTP.\n\n174\n00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:23.827\nSo what this does is a tunneling\nprotocol that uses SSTP,\n\n175\n00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:28.500\nthe Secure Socket layer\ntunneling protocol.\n\n176\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.870\nNow Cherokee, I know you know your ports.\n\n177\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.550\nIf this was SSL tunneling protocol,\nwhat port do you think it might be using?\n\n178\n00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.120\n&gt;&gt; 443?\n\n179\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.040\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, on the a game today.\n\n180\n00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.857\nAnd that's because typically this\nis the same port that HTTPS uses.\n\n181\n00:09:45.857 --> 00:09:47.815\nAnd with secure web communications,\n\n182\n00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:51.620\nfirewalls typically don't block\nthat type of communication.\n\n183\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.150\nSo if we have a tunneling protocol\nthat uses port 443, then chances are,\n\n184\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.740\nby default, it's not gonna be blocked.\n\n185\n00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.894\nIt sits in the well known,\nsecure ports, if you will,\n\n186\n00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:03.530\ninside of the TCP/IP protocol stack.\n\n187\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.866\nNow that's port 443.\n\n188\n00:10:05.866 --> 00:10:08.430\nNow here's another thing that\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n189\n00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:15.690\nWe're gonna talk about what types of VPNs,\n[LAUGH] if I can get my deck to work here.\n\n190\n00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.330\nOkay, there we go.\n\n191\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.190\nThere's another thing with L2TP and\nPPTP that we gotta keep in mind, and\n\n192\n00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.820\nwhat is that?\n\n193\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.410\nWell that's Client Agents.\n\n194\n00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:29.820\nYou got software,\nsoftware that needs to be set up\n\n195\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.340\non a client that wants to use this to make\na remote connection, or a VPN connection.\n\n196\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.220\nWell guess what the SSTP uses.\n\n197\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.130\nSSTP, the Secure Socket tunneling\nprotocol uses something that is\n\n198\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.550\ntypically found in every modern operating\nsystem, at least one by default.\n\n199\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.640\nAnd what is that?\n\n200\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.430\nWell, no agent software,\nbut that's a web browser.\n\n201\n00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.090\nImagine being able to make\na secure communication\n\n202\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.490\nover a port that is typically\ntrusted by your firewalls.\n\n203\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.190\nAnd is utilized by\n\n204\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.120\na technology that's typically already\nin your operating system by default.\n\n205\n00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.310\nDoes make it a little bit easy when you\nhave to deal with VPN communication.\n\n206\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.530\nCuz if you could say yeah,\njust open your web browser,\n\n207\n00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.350\nand type in this IP address or\nthis address.\n\n208\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.140\nNow that's one of them.\n\n209\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.190\nThere's another one that I mention and\nI go ahead and mention it here.\n\n210\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.090\nI don't have it on the objective list but\nit is a tunneling protocol nonetheless.\n\n211\n00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.240\nAnd as you go on to things\nlike Microsoft training,\n\n212\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.250\nand since there's been such an explosion,\nif you will,\n\n213\n00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.390\nover the last five years of this BYOD,\nbring your own device, trend,\n\n214\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.270\nit's probably a good thing to make mention\nof a fourth tunneling protocol that, for\n\n215\n00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.580\none reason or another,\ndidn't make it into the objectives.\n\n216\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.400\nAnd that's something known as,\nInternet, and\n\n217\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.760\nI know I'm kinda going off the beaten\npath here, Cherokee, on my notes.\n\n218\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.920\nThat's the Internet Key Exchange,\nversion 2.\n\n219\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.450\n&gt;&gt; IKE.\n\n220\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.300\n&gt;&gt; IKE, that's right, IKEv2.\n\n221\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:11.080\nAlso known sometimes as MOBIKE,\ndid you know that one?\n\n222\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.955\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] MOBIKE, so\n\n223\n00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:13.410\nwhy did I call it MOBIKE?\n\n224\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Cuz MYBIKE is better than MOBIKE.\n\n225\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.220\nNo that's bad, that's bad,\nthat's really bad.\n\n226\n00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.807\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that's okay,\nwell, it's all right.\n\n227\n00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:20.791\nWe're two steps out of the hall of lame.\n\n228\n00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:23.360\nI'll join you there, I'm a super-geek.\n\n229\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.170\nMOBIKE, Mobile Internet Key Exchange.\n\n230\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.450\nThat's where it gets its\nname because it's very,\n\n231\n00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.770\nvery versatile when your\nnetwork connection isn't.\n\n232\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.680\nSo this is perfect for mobile devices\nthat wanna use tunneling technologies but\n\n233\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.530\ntheir wireless connection is inconsistent.\n\n234\n00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.810\nWhy?\nWell in Windows,\n\n235\n00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.590\nMicrosoft you got things\nlike VPN Reconnect,\n\n236\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.760\nwhich means if you're using IKE version 2\nwhen you lose connection to the VPN and\n\n237\n00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.820\nthen you change networks and\nthe wireless network comes back on,\n\n238\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.739\nboom IKE version 2 can\ntrigger the tunnel again.\n\n239\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.120\nSo that is another thing to keep in mind.\n\n240\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.270\nSo let me just go ahead and\ncheck real quick and\n\n241\n00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.430\nmake sure that I didn't forget anything.\n\n242\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.230\nWe're gonna come back to\nsome of these protocols.\n\n243\n00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.320\nBut we do have to talk about\nthe type of VPN's that you can see.\n\n244\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.320\nWhen we talk about a VPN,\nthat's just the tunneling.\n\n245\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.250\nBut there are ways that you can see\nthe relationship to how the VPN\n\n246\n00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.330\nworks inside of your organization.\n\n247\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.910\nSo the very first one that\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n248\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.670\nis going to be known\nas a site-to-site VPN.\n\n249\n00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:33.269\nThis is one of the more common ones\ninside of your corporate environment.\n\n250\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.430\nNow what does that mean, site-to-site VPN?\n\n251\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.346\nWell, what that typically means is\nthat connected between your sites,\n\n252\n00:13:42.346 --> 00:13:45.770\nor sometimes they are just\ngenerically called gateway routers.\n\n253\n00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.250\nI went ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.790\nput a VPN gateway router cuz sometimes\nwe assume that their gateway routers.\n\n255\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:56.450\nAnd what this means is\nthat these two gateway\n\n256\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.740\nrouters are what are controlling and\n\n257\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.740\nmaintaining the VPN,\nthey're establishing the tunnel.\n\n258\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.894\nAnd the tunnel appears-\n&gt;&gt; They can be servers\n\n259\n00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:07.840\nfunctioning as routers.\n\n260\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.480\n&gt;&gt; They could if it's, for instance\nrouting a remote access which we're gonna\n\n261\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.000\nshow you here in a second,\nthey very well could be.\n\n262\n00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.110\nI will tell you though typically, we're\nnot gonna use servers as routers because\n\n263\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.740\nthey don't function as well as a router.\n\n264\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:26.340\nSo with the encryption\nencapsulation that a site to site\n\n265\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.470\nVPN would need, the multiple connections,\n\n266\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.309\nchances are this is gonna be\na physical-based, hardware-based router.\n\n267\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.660\nSo the site-to-site VPN again,\nit's connecting two sites.\n\n268\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.980\nYour two gateway routers these are the\nones, they're maintaining that tunnel so\n\n269\n00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.600\nthat if there is a computer in\nSite A that needs to talk to\n\n270\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.300\na server in Site B they can directly\nbetween these two gateway routers.\n\n271\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.390\nSo that's for a routed environment.\n\n272\n00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.410\nHowever, you do have another type of VPN.\n\n273\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.410\nYou got what's known as host\nthe site of site the host.\n\n274\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.247\nAnother name that you might hear\nthis called is site-to-client or\n\n275\n00:15:06.247 --> 00:15:11.750\nclient-to-site, depending on which\nway you're talking about the diagram.\n\n276\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.052\n&gt;&gt; There also might be another term and\nthat's called working in my pajamas.\n\n277\n00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:16.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, telecommuter.\n\n278\n00:15:16.755 --> 00:15:18.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Telecommuter for sure.\n\n279\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.990\nSo what's the host-to-site?\n\n280\n00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.605\nWell, Cherokee kinda leaded into that.\n\n281\n00:15:22.605 --> 00:15:25.540\nWhich typically when you have a single\nperson that's in a remote location who\n\n282\n00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.030\nneeds access to the local\nnetwork over a public network.\n\n283\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.340\nWe wanna build up those tunnels,\nwe want to encrypt that information, and\n\n284\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.280\nmake sure that nobody else\ncan see that information.\n\n285\n00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.910\nBut they might also be called\nan access VPN as well.\n\n286\n00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.996\nCuz you're really just giving\na single employee, in this case,\n\n287\n00:15:43.996 --> 00:15:48.998\naccess back to the gateway router into\na simple resource inside of the network.\n\n288\n00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:52.129\nLast but not least is another\none that they call out,\n\n289\n00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:56.627\nthe first two are probably the most\ncommon, called a host-to-host VPN.\n\n290\n00:15:56.627 --> 00:16:01.231\nI always want to say like George Noory\ncoast to coast, but a host-to-host VPN.\n\n291\n00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:07.094\nAnd what this is, is I've got client-based\nsoftware running on my computer that helps\n\n292\n00:16:07.094 --> 00:16:12.580\nto create and connect to the VPN router\nhere, and that typically gives me access.\n\n293\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.880\nAnd this really doesn't even have to be\na VPN gateway router to another piece of\n\n294\n00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.360\nclient software that's running on\nmaybe a server inside of your network.\n\n295\n00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.856\nSo for instance, if this person here that\nin Cherokee's case is in the pajamas.\n\n296\n00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:26.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n297\n00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:30.490\nthey need access to the file server that's\nholding the documents within the network.\n\n298\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.754\nWell we might run a host to host in that\nit's usually when somebody outside of your\n\n299\n00:16:34.754 --> 00:16:37.700\nnetwork needs access to\none specific resource.\n\n300\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.870\nVersus just transparent access\ninto the main network in general.\n\n301\n00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.543\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool, Wes.\n\n302\n00:16:43.543 --> 00:16:47.300\nWe can see a lot of benefits with VPN and\nhow it's evolved over time.\n\n303\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.090\nWe don't have to have\na dedicated lease line.\n\n304\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.533\nWe can build up and break down\nthat tunnel on an as-needed basis.\n\n305\n00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:56.415\nAnd it'll allow us that\nfunctionality to well, save money.\n\n306\n00:16:56.415 --> 00:16:58.210\nWe'll have less travel expenses.\n\n307\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.500\nWe're still able to access corporate\nresources from the comfort of our own\n\n308\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.710\nhomes, airports, whatever, very popular.\n\n309\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and\n\n310\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.070\nthat ultimately rounds us up to\nthe why would we even use a VPN.\n\n311\n00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:11.890\nAgain, remember when we took\nour journey back in time.\n\n312\n00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.730\nRight and we were setting up public or\nwe were setting up dedicated lease lines.\n\n313\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.110\nYou need to pay for\nthat connection, right?\n\n314\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.520\nYou need to pay for\n\n315\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.250\nall of the infrastructure to\nsupport that connection right?\n\n316\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.213\nExtra infrastructure.\n\n317\n00:17:25.213 --> 00:17:27.484\nThat's one of the things that makes VPN's,\n\n318\n00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:30.840\nor one of the few things that\nmakes VPN's very, very beneficial.\n\n319\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.800\nThe versatility of them, the fact that I\ndon't need a lot of extra infrastructure.\n\n320\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.820\nI don't need a dedicated lease line, why?\n\n321\n00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.560\nBecause I can piggyback off a public\nnetwork infrastructure that\n\n322\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.750\nsomebody else has laid.\n\n323\n00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.960\nSo they can pay the bill for\nthat architecture.\n\n324\n00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.430\nLet them pay the bill.\n\n325\n00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.308\nYou implement the VPN and you can reap\nthe benefit off of their hard work.\n\n326\n00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:51.762\n&gt;&gt; And with the functionality of\nlight weight protocols, you might\n\n327\n00:17:51.762 --> 00:17:56.380\nnot even need to install an actual piece\nof software, just by using a browser.\n\n328\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.640\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n329\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.560\nAll right so,\nlet's see here where am I at right now?\n\n330\n00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.830\nOkay so the next thing that,\n\n331\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.200\nwe're not gonna get into remote\naccess servers quite yet.\n\n332\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.170\nLet's go ahead and let's switch\nover to our virtual machine here.\n\n333\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.160\nI've got a server\noperating system running.\n\n334\n00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.920\nAnd I kind of wanna just show you\nwhere some of those protocols there.\n\n335\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.710\nSo we've got routing and remote access\nactually installed on this server.\n\n336\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:26.170\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and just fire\nup routing and remote access here.\n\n337\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.480\nAnd when you first start this up and\nwe're gonna talk a little bit more about\n\n338\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.060\nremote access services\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n339\n00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.860\nBut I do wanna give you a chance\nto at least see the protocols.\n\n340\n00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.670\nSo let me go ahead, I'm gonna right click\nand we're gonna choose configure and\n\n341\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.970\nenable routing and remote access.\n\n342\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.550\nAnd we'll choose next here.\n\n343\n00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.410\nNotice that this says,\nwe're gonna setup a dial-up or VPN server.\n\n344\n00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.320\nWe're gonna choose next here, and you\nknow it doesn't let me customize it here.\n\n345\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.300\nWhy, let's see.\n\n346\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.170\n&gt;&gt; And what Wes is doing here,\nthis is really cool,\n\n347\n00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.340\nif you're not sure of the particular\nprotocols that are available when you're\n\n348\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.210\nlooking at point to point tunneling\nprotocol and layer 2 tunneling protocol.\n\n349\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.610\nIf you have access to a network operating\nsystem, do what he is doing right now.\n\n350\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.406\nPlay in there and\nit gives you nice descriptions and\n\n351\n00:19:08.406 --> 00:19:12.520\nit'll let you go ahead and set up a lab\nenvironment and a RAS Server cell.\n\n352\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.871\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n353\n00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:17.510\nvirtualization is definitely a good thing.\n\n354\n00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.207\nI know it's what's helped\nme learn this technology.\n\n355\n00:19:20.207 --> 00:19:23.048\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do a custom configuration and\n\n356\n00:19:23.048 --> 00:19:26.170\nI'm gonna use VPN access and\nwe'll choose finish.\n\n357\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.012\nAnd we'll let that go ahead and\nget finished up, go ahead and\n\n358\n00:19:29.012 --> 00:19:30.305\ninstall our service here.\n\n359\n00:19:32.097 --> 00:19:34.680\nAnd, it looks like it's ready to use.\n\n360\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.140\nWe'll start the service here.\n\n361\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.951\nAnd it takes a second, one of the things\nto know kind of about routing and\n\n362\n00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:42.632\n[LAUGH] remote access, if you ever get\nin and you have to reconfigure it,\n\n363\n00:19:42.632 --> 00:19:44.623\nyou always have to start over\nfrom the beginning here.\n\n364\n00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:48.250\nAnd it could take a second, it's turning\nthat information on, and we should\n\n365\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.090\nsee some additional information in the\nrouting and remote access console here.\n\n366\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:53.880\nNow I'm going to go ahead,\n\n367\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.260\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to\nright click on the local server here.\n\n368\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.192\nI'm going to choose the IPv4 here and\nlets see,\n\n369\n00:20:02.192 --> 00:20:07.257\ndo I have an ethernet\nadapter I wanna hang this to?\n\n370\n00:20:07.257 --> 00:20:07.915\nYep, there we go.\n\n371\n00:20:09.225 --> 00:20:11.685\nAnd again guys,\nI'm just giving us something,\n\n372\n00:20:11.685 --> 00:20:14.215\nwe definitely wanna look of some these.\n\n373\n00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:16.667\nThere we go, there's our ports here.\n\n374\n00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.197\nAll right, notice the different\nports that we have available.\n\n375\n00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:23.593\nThe different tunneling protocols and\nboy there is a lot of SSTP.\n\n376\n00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:26.117\nLet's see if we can\nscroll down a little bit.\n\n377\n00:20:26.117 --> 00:20:27.270\nThere's your SSTP.\n\n378\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.857\nHere's your PPTP.\n\n379\n00:20:28.857 --> 00:20:31.787\nOne of the ones we were talking\nabout that you can see your point to\n\n380\n00:20:31.787 --> 00:20:35.710\npoint tunneling protocol,\nsome different ones there.\n\n381\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.240\nLets see here, close down, scroll down.\n\n382\n00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.540\nThere's Ike version two.\n\n383\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.140\nThat's that mobike that\nI was talking about.\n\n384\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.140\nAgain that one's not on the exam but\nmight as well mention it.\n\n385\n00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.852\nI can almost guarantee that you'll see it\nin the security sections if not you'll\n\n386\n00:20:48.852 --> 00:20:52.471\ndefinitely see it in security plus so\nit's a good one to know.\n\n387\n00:20:52.471 --> 00:20:55.320\nGRE okay so GRE.\n\n388\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.140\nLet me go ahead and I want to start there.\n\n389\n00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.020\nBecause we've got a few different\ntunneling protocols that we wanna\n\n390\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:00.620\nbe aware of.\n\n391\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.180\nThis GRE is the generic\nrouting encapsulation.\n\n392\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.529\nWe've gotta be careful with this one,\n\n393\n00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:10.588\nbecause this one offers absolutely\nno encryption, no security for\n\n394\n00:21:10.588 --> 00:21:14.237\nthe information,\nthe data that's traversing the tunnel.\n\n395\n00:21:14.237 --> 00:21:18.940\nSo where might I use something like this\nif it's stateless and has no security?\n\n396\n00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.160\nWell if you already have\na dedicated lease line, right?\n\n397\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.850\nIf you've got a dedicated line and\n\n398\n00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.506\nyou know nobody else is on that line then\nyou don't necessarily need encryption.\n\n399\n00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:30.470\nAnd you don't need\nthe overhead of encrypting and\n\n400\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.750\ndecrypting if you're\nthe only one on that line.\n\n401\n00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.950\nSo you can use something like\ngeneric routing encapsulation.\n\n402\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:42.790\nAnd it's basic IP encapsulation in\nan area that you don't need security.\n\n403\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.630\nAll right so we've seen a couple of these.\n\n404\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.370\nLet me go ahead and scroll back up here,\nsince we've seen PPTP.\n\n405\n00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.160\nAgain, remember PPTP,\nit's an older standard.\n\n406\n00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.494\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n407\n00:21:53.494 --> 00:21:58.423\nmention an RFC standard just in case it\ncomes up on the test, that's RFC 2637.\n\n408\n00:21:58.423 --> 00:22:02.796\nAnd in case you wanna read some\nvery boring stereo instructions,\n\n409\n00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:06.781\nputting stereos together if\nyou guys remember doing that.\n\n410\n00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:13.267\nIt is the Internet engineering task\nforce request for comments 20637.\n\n411\n00:22:13.267 --> 00:22:17.207\nNow we gotta worry about point to point\ntunneling protocol cuz it does provide\n\n412\n00:22:17.207 --> 00:22:20.008\nencryption but\na very low bit of security on your data.\n\n413\n00:22:20.008 --> 00:22:23.197\nWe said tunneling and encapsulation.\n\n414\n00:22:23.197 --> 00:22:27.204\nThis is usually as something known as\nMicrosoft's point to point encryption,\n\n415\n00:22:27.204 --> 00:22:30.920\nMPPE, which is a very, very,\nvery weak encryption algorithm.\n\n416\n00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.120\nSo, yes, we still use PPTP but commonly\ntoday, if we can scroll down here,\n\n417\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:40.480\nwe should get to L2TP just\nbelow GRE if I remember right.\n\n418\n00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.640\nI might have this backwards here.\n\n419\n00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.000\nGo ahead and why can't I find.\n\n420\n00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.570\nThere's sstp,\nI probably scrolled all the way past it.\n\n421\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Now, L2TP is another one of those\nprotocols like Wes mentioned with GRE.\n\n422\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.000\nAlone it provides no additional security.\n\n423\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.030\nSo when we're looking at\na protocol such as L2TP.\n\n424\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.490\nYou hear this term as protocol suite and\nyou want to go ahead and\n\n425\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.590\npair it or\ncouple it with a security protocol.\n\n426\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.950\nWith L2TP you want to go ahead and\nselect IPSEC if you are looking for\n\n427\n00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.720\nthat extra encryption there.\n\n428\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.340\n&gt;&gt; Definitely it would of\nbeen better just to go to\n\n429\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.550\nproperty the ports then I wouldn't\nof had to scroll as much.\n\n430\n00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.244\nBut, there’s a right way to do and\n\n431\n00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:19.469\nthen there’s of course the Wes\nway which is typically very hard.\n\n432\n00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:23.225\n[LAUGH] So here you can actually see all\nof those protocols that are much easier\n\n433\n00:23:23.225 --> 00:23:24.220\nfashion.\n\n434\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.220\nSecure socket tunneling protocol,\nI do want you to keep that in mind for\n\n435\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.500\nthe exam.\n\n436\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.756\nKeep in mind it uses a web browser,\nport 443.\n\n437\n00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:37.236\nL2TP on the other hand is one that if\nyou want to use an encryption suite of\n\n438\n00:23:37.236 --> 00:23:42.687\ntechnologies, not just one technology, but\na collection of protocols called IPsec.\n\n439\n00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:45.522\nGives you a much better\nlevel of encryption,\n\n440\n00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:47.836\nbeyond better level of encryption,\n\n441\n00:23:47.836 --> 00:23:53.160\nmultiple technologies to secure your\ninformation inside of an IP based network.\n\n442\n00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.220\nIf you are gonna use IPsec,\nyou have two options.\n\n443\n00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.347\nYou have to use L2TP or\nyou have to use IKEv2.\n\n444\n00:23:59.347 --> 00:24:01.055\nThe Internet can exchange version two.\n\n445\n00:24:01.055 --> 00:24:06.650\nCuz you also use, if you will,\nIPsec for that, likewise.\n\n446\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.260\nAll right, let's see.\n\n447\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.390\nWell, I know that I\nhave plenty more to go.\n\n448\n00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.695\nI think that's gonna be\na good stopping point.\n\n449\n00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:18.150\nCuz I do see that we've got things like\n\n450\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.290\nauthentication I wanna\ntalk a little bit about.\n\n451\n00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.800\nI'm gonna mention, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n452\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.240\nmention that here because in our security\nchapters we're gonna get much more in\n\n453\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.600\ndepth with authentication and\nwhat that means.\n\n454\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.330\nBut let me go ahead and mention them\nhere as it relates to how do we prove,\n\n455\n00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.220\nwe are who we say we are,\nwhen we're using VPN technologies.\n\n456\n00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.580\nWe can use technologies like challenge,\nhand shake, authentication protocol.\n\n457\n00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:46.351\nOr Microsoft, the common variant today,\nMicrosoft's MS Chat Version 2.\n\n458\n00:24:46.351 --> 00:24:51.268\nWe can use an unencrypted password\nauthentication program called PAP.\n\n459\n00:24:51.268 --> 00:24:53.510\nAnd you might want to\nstay away from that one.\n\n460\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.840\nIt's a security vulnerability.\n\n461\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.492\nAnd then we also have things like EAP,\nthe extensible authentication protocol and\n\n462\n00:24:58.492 --> 00:25:01.413\nif you're doing certificate based\nauthentication it would be EAP\n\n463\n00:25:01.413 --> 00:25:02.678\ntransport layer security.\n\n464\n00:25:02.678 --> 00:25:03.759\n&gt;&gt; Very flexible.\n\n465\n00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:05.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, EAP TLS.\n\n466\n00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:10.140\nSo couple of authentication protocols\nto be aware of with your VPNs,\n\n467\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.180\nalso know those protocols and\nthe different types of VPNs so\n\n468\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.880\nthat you could be prepared for\nthis network plus exam.\n\n469\n00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.830\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Wes, that was a lot of\ninformation that we had in this episode.\n\n470\n00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.805\nBut that's the magic and\nthe beauty behind it all.\n\n471\n00:25:21.805 --> 00:25:25.679\nYou guys can go ahead and hit rewind and\nwatch it over because at this level,\n\n472\n00:25:25.679 --> 00:25:29.500\nyou are expected to be able to\nidentify those particular protocols.\n\n473\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.930\nThank you so much for joining us today.\n\n474\n00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.960\nI appreciate it, and\nI appreciate you guys for tuning in.\n\n475\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.000\nBut don't go anywhere.\n\n476\n00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.090\nWe have some additional NetPlus\ninformation headed your way.\n\n477\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.470\nFor this episode we're\ngonna call it a quits and\n\n478\n00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.980\nI'm gonna sign off as your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n479\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n480\n00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.885\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n481\n00:25:48.786 --> 00:25:54.749\n[MUSIC]\n\n482\n00:25:54.749 --> 00:25:57.885\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.305\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:12.179\nYou're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.236\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Comp TIA Network+\nseries, I'm your show host,\n\n6\n00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:18.150\nCherokee Booth.\n\n7\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.620\nThis episode is a continuation where\nwe were previously looking at network\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.580\nservices and applications.\n\n9\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.420\nAnd we had Mr. Wes Bryan explain a lot of\nthe different protocols that are under\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.190\npinning these technologies.\n\n11\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and pick up, and\n\n12\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.210\nkind of just do a little bit of review of\nthat to go ahead and begin the show today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.200\nSo, let's go ahead and welcome Mr.\nWes Bryan in the studio today.\n\n14\n00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.330\nThank you for joining us, sir.\n\n15\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.610\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Cherokee, as always,\nfor having me here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.930\nAnd that's right, it is a pleasure\nto be with ITPro.TV today.\n\n17\n00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.697\nThat's right,\nI talked way too much, and well,\n\n18\n00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:47.098\nI didn't get through all the content.\n\n19\n00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:50.527\nSo Cherokee, in the last episode had\nto give me the axe there and say, hey,\n\n20\n00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:52.930\nwe gotta come back here and\nwe gotta do another part.\n\n21\n00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.480\nSo, we've got a few things\nthat we're gonna wrap up.\n\n22\n00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.355\nWe talked about a series of the services\nthat we had related to things like\n\n23\n00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:01.935\nVPNs in the first episode.\n\n24\n00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:03.837\nWe did talk a little bit\nabout the protocols.\n\n25\n00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:07.565\nI'm gonna recap those protocols,\njust to make sure that if they do come\n\n26\n00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:09.465\nacross the exam,\nyou are going to be prepared.\n\n27\n00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:14.830\nSo, we're also gonna talk a little\nbit about something known\n\n28\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.002\nas the Remote Access Dial-In User Service\ncalled RADIUS.\n\n29\n00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.518\nAnd we're also going to talk\nabout an outdated authentication\n\n30\n00:01:23.518 --> 00:01:25.053\nmechanism called TACACS.\n\n31\n00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:26.680\nThat's the terminal-\n&gt;&gt; That's a mouthful.\n\n32\n00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.010\n&gt;&gt; That's it, yeah, Terminal Access\nControl Access Control System.\n\n33\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.960\nAnd then we'll show you the newer\n\n34\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.000\nTACACS that we're really using\ntoday more than the obsolete one.\n\n35\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.800\nSo, we're gonna look at protocols,\nwe're gonna look at little bit at RADIUS.\n\n36\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.010\nWe're gonna look at TACACS, and\n\n37\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.510\nalso a little bit about web servers,\nand unified voice communications.\n\n38\n00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.710\nSo, let's go ahead and\nI've got a little list right here,\n\n39\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.110\nand I wanna just review these protocols.\n\n40\n00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.800\nBecause remember, the Comp TIA,\n\n41\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.260\nyou're learning a new language\nany time you go into IT.\n\n42\n00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.920\nIf you're just starting out in A+,\nmaybe you're watching some of these, and\n\n43\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.402\nyou're still studying for your A+.\n\n44\n00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:04.360\nI don't have to tell you guys\nabout acronym city, right?\n\n45\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.106\nAlphabet soup to the nth degree.\n\n46\n00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:11.060\nWell, in Net+, it's the same way, because\nnow you're not so much just learning\n\n47\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.510\nthe language of, well, PCs and\nMacs and operating systems.\n\n48\n00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.890\nNow you're learning\nthe language of the network.\n\n49\n00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.769\nAnd it's kinda funny,\nalmost sounds like a pun,\n\n50\n00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.440\nbecause that's what a protocol really is.\n\n51\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.830\nRemember, it defines the rules of\ncommunications the two systems must have,\n\n52\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.760\nor share, in order to\ncommunicate across the network.\n\n53\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.117\nNow, with VPN communications,\n\n54\n00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.030\nthese are the protocols that we were\ntalking about in the last episode.\n\n55\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.020\nAnd again, just a real quick recap,\n\n56\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.190\nthe tunneling protocols that we\nreally deal with a lot are these,\n\n57\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.010\nI say two, but there's actually three\nhere, nor could be a fourth one.\n\n58\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.020\nL2TP is well, we got to make sure that\nwe include in here, so, these are our\n\n59\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.970\nprotocols, some of the main protocols,\nbut then we also have other ones here.\n\n60\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.490\nWe've got an SSL VPN, and we've also\ngot something known as IKE version two.\n\n61\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.750\nGuys, I'm putting IKE version\ntwo here in this section,\n\n62\n00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.190\nbecause, and version two also supports\ntunneling, it is a tunneling protocol,\n\n63\n00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.170\nand it also allows us the ability to\nuse IPSec as its encryption mechanism,\n\n64\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.150\nin order to maintain confidentiality of\nyour data, the integrity, so that if I\n\n65\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.110\nsend something that's encrypted with IPSec\nfor myself to Ms. Cherokee over here.\n\n66\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.340\nShe knows that not a single punctuation\nmark in that data packet has\n\n67\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.110\nbeen modified.\n\n68\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.580\nNow, you think modifications.\n\n69\n00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.466\nYou think,\nsomebody's out there on the wire, right?\n\n70\n00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:34.440\nAnd they're trying to craft your packets,\nor hack in your systems,\n\n71\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.340\nand that really isn't just\nalways the case, right?\n\n72\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.760\nHow about transmission errors?\n\n73\n00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.810\nRequest for a retransmissions\nthey happened in IP seconds.\n\n74\n00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.900\nA protocol that can maintain the integrity\nof your data saying that if we do\n\n75\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.460\nfind errors in it, we'll discard it.\n\n76\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.720\nAnd we'll recall for another transmission.\n\n77\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.330\nSo IPs,\nI do want to mention PPTP and L2TP.\n\n78\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.955\nPPTP was really one of the first tunneling\nprotocols back in the early 90s by\n\n79\n00:03:57.955 --> 00:04:01.670\nMicrosoft, it's called\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.\n\n80\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.100\nIt is an older protocol, the security that\nit uses a little bit weaker, actually,\n\n81\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.370\nit's fairly weak, it's called Microsoft's\nPoint-To-Point Encryption, MPPE.\n\n82\n00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.980\nSo, it is really not The GO2 when we\ntalk about VPN communication today.\n\n83\n00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.050\nReally today, what we gonna be using\nsomething like L2TP coupled with IPSEC,\n\n84\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.011\nbecause of the encryption level that\nwe get with that suite of technologies.\n\n85\n00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.064\nNow, there is another.\n\n86\n00:04:27.064 --> 00:04:29.788\nThey call it SSL VPN,\nbut I wanna go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:34.890\nchange the terminology here to something\nthat we've already talked about.\n\n88\n00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.820\nEven though they call it SSL VPN,\n\n89\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.190\nright, we're gonna be using\na protocol called SSTP.\n\n90\n00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.576\nAgain, keep in mind,\nsome of the things about the SSTP.\n\n91\n00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:45.549\nIs the fact that well, it is SSL,\n\n92\n00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:50.209\nit's what it's used in the sheer\nsecure socket layer, that's port 443.\n\n93\n00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.570\nIt uses a common port used for\nour secure web communications.\n\n94\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.680\nUnlike the, I say non-standard.\n\n95\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.728\nThey're standard of the protocols.\n\n96\n00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:06.119\nBut the other port numbers, Port 1723 and\n1701 that both PPTP and L2TP use.\n\n97\n00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:10.113\nSo, if you do have firewall issues, one\nof the things that you can use is one of\n\n98\n00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:13.677\nthese secure socket tunneling protocols,\nan SSL VPN, if you will,\n\n99\n00:05:13.677 --> 00:05:17.856\nbecause you can couple that with client\nsoftware that's already bundled in with\n\n100\n00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:19.580\nyour operating system.\n\n101\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.940\nThat being your web browser.\n\n102\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.950\nSo, it's nice to have a client\ninside of your operating system, or\n\n103\n00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.620\nshould I say client application that's\nalready in your operating system.\n\n104\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.480\nIt doesn't take too much configuration,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.030\ndoesn't require a third-party\nsoftware download.\n\n106\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.760\nSo, those are a little\nbit about the protocols.\n\n107\n00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.330\nLet's see to make sure i didn't\nforget anything there, all right.\n\n108\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.010\nAnd we did kinda mentioned\nthe authentication protocols, guys.\n\n109\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.520\nKeep in mind that we do have coming up, we\ndo have an episode on user authentication.\n\n110\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.480\nSo, I'm kinda just rattling them off here,\nso\n\n111\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.880\nyou know that they're associated\nwith VPN connections.\n\n112\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.340\nIf I wanna make a connection over a VPN\ntunnel, I gotta establish who I am,\n\n113\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.010\nand well, how do I establish who I am?\n\n114\n00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.745\nAnd that's where these\nauthentication methods come in here,\n\n115\n00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:02.730\nchallenge-handshake authentication\nprotocol,\n\n116\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.388\nwhich is typically used in\na none Microsoft environment.\n\n117\n00:06:05.388 --> 00:06:09.980\nIf you are in a Microsoft environment, and\npotentially a non-Microsoft environment,\n\n118\n00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.040\nmost commonly, you're going to\nbe using MSCHAP Version 2 today.\n\n119\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.090\nI know some of the Cisco tunneling\nmechanisms use a combination\n\n120\n00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.660\nof EAP MSCHAP Version 2.\n\n121\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.200\nSo, that's kind of one of\nthe industry wide standards today.\n\n122\n00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.770\nIt is Microsoft proprietary, but it's used\nquite heavily today in authentication.\n\n123\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.930\nI did mention the authentication or excuse\nme, Extensible Authentication Protocol,\n\n124\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.240\nEAP, this is really good, because in\nthe earlier days of something called PPP,\n\n125\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.120\nthe Point-to-Point Protocol, it didn't\nreally have a lot of authentication\n\n126\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.920\nmechanisms that were\nsupported at that time.\n\n127\n00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.140\nYou only had what you had, and\n\n128\n00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.160\nyou couldn't really make\nany modular adjustment.\n\n129\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.000\nAnd certainly, it wasn't prepared for\n\n130\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.850\nthe future when we would\ninvent new technology.\n\n131\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.950\nSo, what they said is, let's go ahead and\ntake the functionality of PPP and\n\n132\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.880\nwe'll put it in a framework, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.600\nAnd then once we wrap\nit in that framework,\n\n134\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.840\nthat framework allows you to add\ndifferent authentication methods.\n\n135\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.280\nSo, you might see in some of your\nmaterial where it says EAP, it calls for\n\n136\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.600\nan arbitrary authentication mechanism.\n\n137\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.170\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n138\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.160\nIt's extensible.\n\n139\n00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.140\nThink about the name,\nit means I can extend the functionality by\n\n140\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.770\nhaving the authentication\nmechanisms do what I want.\n\n141\n00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.520\nI do wanna let you know though, if you're\ngonna use smart card authentication,\n\n142\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.310\nmore specifically,\nit's gonna have to be EAP-TLS.\n\n143\n00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.090\nAnd again, like I said,\n\n144\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.800\nwe'll talk a little bit more about\nthose authentication mechanisms,\n\n145\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.230\nbreak them down, and show you how the\nprocesses with them in another episode.\n\n146\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.670\nSo, that's kind of the recap, I just,\nI got to thinking about it, and\n\n147\n00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.280\nI wanted to make sure that we\nreally did cover those protocols.\n\n148\n00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.110\nBecause if you're just learning this for\nthe first time,\n\n149\n00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.070\nit really does just seem like\na slew of acronyms thrown at you.\n\n150\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.450\nI want you to understand some\nof the characteristics, and then\n\n151\n00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.670\nsome of the port values, just in case they\nthrown you in a scenario where maybe you\n\n152\n00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.050\nhave to troubleshoot that communication,\nand you can't understand why.\n\n153\n00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.617\nYou've got everything set up,\nbut you don't have a VPN tunnel.\n\n154\n00:07:56.617 --> 00:07:58.405\nIt could be a firewall blocking a port,\nand\n\n155\n00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:01.054\nif you don't know those port\nnumbers you might get that wrong.\n\n156\n00:08:01.054 --> 00:08:04.202\nSo, hopefully we've established that.\n\n157\n00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:06.838\nNow, where do we go from here.\n\n158\n00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:10.144\nWell the next two topics that we're gonna\ntalk about fall under something known\n\n159\n00:08:10.144 --> 00:08:10.696\nas triple A.\n\n160\n00:08:10.696 --> 00:08:15.110\nThat’s authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n161\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.633\nNow one of the first ones that we\nhave is an industry wide standard.\n\n162\n00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:23.240\nThis is something known as the remote\naccess dial in user services.\n\n163\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.516\nIt's called RADIUS if I can remember that.\n\n164\n00:08:25.516 --> 00:08:27.360\nBig old long acronym.\n\n165\n00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.422\nAll right, and this is actually\nan IETF standard for again AAA,\n\n166\n00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:35.423\nauthentication, authorization,\nand accounting, right.\n\n167\n00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:41.273\nRemote authentication, this is IETF,\nthe Internet Engineering Task Force's\n\n168\n00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:46.370\nstandardization for\ncentralized remote authentication.\n\n169\n00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.016\nNow that's a big one.\n\n170\n00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:47.883\nKeep that one in mind.\n\n171\n00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:51.609\nAnd it just means if I'm gonna make\na connection from outside of my network,\n\n172\n00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:54.754\nback in to my network,\nwe probably need some kind of standard for\n\n173\n00:08:54.754 --> 00:08:56.890\ndoing that and that's what RADIUS is.\n\n174\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.794\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we wanna make sure that we keep\nour networks secure from any kind of\n\n175\n00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:02.011\nremote connections.\n\n176\n00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.342\nAnd we can add some restrictions\nonto who's allowed to connect and\n\n177\n00:09:06.342 --> 00:09:09.140\nto keep those bad guys\nout of our networks.\n\n178\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.877\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point.\n\n179\n00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:12.760\nSo, for instance,\nto kind of expand on what Cherokee said.\n\n180\n00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.271\nSo inside of Windows, you have something\nknown as the network policy server, right?\n\n181\n00:09:16.271 --> 00:09:19.650\nAnd it's not just about,\nyou're not just authenticating people.\n\n182\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.671\nYou can add a lot of modular functionality\nthat helps increase the feature set of\n\n183\n00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:25.298\nwhat your RADIUS server can do.\n\n184\n00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:28.502\nAnd that is, I know a little vendor\nspecific here but it's a functionality.\n\n185\n00:09:28.502 --> 00:09:31.600\nAnd there are other\nsoftware out there too.\n\n186\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.840\nKeep in mind, it's not just about\nauthentication because, we also want a way\n\n187\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.100\nthat we can track user accounts and stuff\nas far as password changes and stuff.\n\n188\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.948\nSo let's go ahead and look at some of\nthe components here that you're gonna use\n\n189\n00:09:43.948 --> 00:09:45.596\ninside of a RADIUS environment.\n\n190\n00:09:45.596 --> 00:09:49.140\nAnd I know it seems like a lot, and\nfor the most part it kind of is.\n\n191\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.730\nKeep in mind that if I'm gonna do remote\nconnections outside of my network,\n\n192\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.319\ninto my home network, then I can use\na technology as simple as something like\n\n193\n00:09:56.319 --> 00:09:57.909\nRDP, remote desktop protocol.\n\n194\n00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:01.629\nThat is not probably what you're gonna\nuse if you have a thousand users that\n\n195\n00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:04.180\nare outside of your network\ntrying to come back in.\n\n196\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.105\nWell, I guess if you have some kind\nof remote services gateway maybe, but\n\n197\n00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:09.621\ndoesn't necessarily mean that's\nit's the most efficient.\n\n198\n00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:10.861\nSo this what we can use.\n\n199\n00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.166\nWe can use something known as RADIUS.\n\n200\n00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:16.633\nNow RADIUS has quite a few different\ncomponents that you have to be aware of.\n\n201\n00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:19.992\nOne of the first things that it's gonna\nrequire, yes is a RADIUS server, but\n\n202\n00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:22.300\nit's also gonna require\na few other things.\n\n203\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.199\nYou're gonna have what are known\nas remote access clients.\n\n204\n00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:26.927\nWhat is a remote access client?\n\n205\n00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:29.863\nWhen you see a laptop here, please\nunderstand that's just for the diagram.\n\n206\n00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:33.732\nThis is anybody that's outside of\nyour network that has an account\n\n207\n00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:38.362\nin the RADIUS database or in another\nuser database like LDAP-based database,\n\n208\n00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:42.369\nlike Active Directory,\nthat has the permissions, the privilege,\n\n209\n00:10:42.369 --> 00:10:45.780\nto connect over a public\nnetwork back into yours, right?\n\n210\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.702\nDoes it have to be a laptop?\n\n211\n00:10:46.702 --> 00:10:48.600\nNo, it doesn't have to just be a laptop.\n\n212\n00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.810\nIt can be a mobile device, right?\n\n213\n00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.043\nThey have applications as I\nbring out my phone here, and\n\n214\n00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:56.420\nbetter close down YouTube so they\ndon't know that that's what I'm doing.\n\n215\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.020\nBut I can even get devices on my phones,\nthat will allow me the ability to perform\n\n216\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.055\nthat remote authentication,\nthat remote access.\n\n217\n00:11:04.055 --> 00:11:08.364\nKeep in mind the client,\nit's not the device that is the client.\n\n218\n00:11:08.364 --> 00:11:12.844\nIt's the remote access software that's\nmaking the remote connection that\n\n219\n00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:15.229\ntechnically is the client, all right.\n\n220\n00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:18.990\nThen we have what are known as,\nsometimes generically called RAS.\n\n221\n00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.435\nYou might even hear them\ncalled RAS Servers.\n\n222\n00:11:21.435 --> 00:11:23.760\n&gt;&gt; A little redundant but-\n&gt;&gt; It is, that's right.\n\n223\n00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.854\nSo here's what I've done.\n\n224\n00:11:24.854 --> 00:11:27.167\nI've said we're gonna\ncall it a RAS Server and\n\n225\n00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:31.039\nit's not redundant cuz we're gonna\ncall it Remote Access Services server.\n\n226\n00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.608\nBut like [LAUGH] Ms. Cherokee says,\n\n227\n00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.860\nsometimes they just call a Remote\nAccess Server, and you say RAS server.\n\n228\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.070\nSo, like an ATM machine, you're saying\nRemote Access Server server [LAUGH].\n\n229\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.010\nSo, don't worry about the acronym there,\njust understand what it's doing.\n\n230\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.231\nNow, what is a Remote Access Server\ndoing for us?\n\n231\n00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:51.974\nOkay, well, the obvious thing is that\nit's giving us remote access, but\n\n232\n00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:54.850\nhow does it work in\ncombination with RADIUS.\n\n233\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.811\nNow we've got a couple of different\ntypes of remote access servers that we\n\n234\n00:11:57.811 --> 00:11:58.488\ncould be using.\n\n235\n00:11:58.488 --> 00:12:01.186\nRight, we could use a dial-up server.\n\n236\n00:12:01.186 --> 00:12:05.354\nI know dial-up people saying 56k my\ngoodness, really a dial-up server.\n\n237\n00:12:05.354 --> 00:12:09.349\nWell I've got to tell you,\nwhen your packet switching networks fail,\n\n238\n00:12:09.349 --> 00:12:13.478\nkeep in mind we've got hundreds of\nthousands if not millions of PSTN lines\n\n239\n00:12:13.478 --> 00:12:15.160\nthat are strung everywhere.\n\n240\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.526\nSo yes, dial up is still being used.\n\n241\n00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:18.246\n&gt;&gt; That's how it all started.\n\n242\n00:12:18.246 --> 00:12:19.448\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n243\n00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.525\nIt's history cycling\nback around on itself.\n\n244\n00:12:21.525 --> 00:12:24.705\nOf course, maybe it's not cycling at\nall cuz it's never gone anywhere.\n\n245\n00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:26.757\nBut then we also have VPN servers, right?\n\n246\n00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:30.163\nYes, a VPN server is a form of\nremote access server, because if\n\n247\n00:12:30.163 --> 00:12:34.300\nyou think about it, like we've shown\nyou in the first part of this episode.\n\n248\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:40.665\nRemember we've seen a host,\nright, a host-to-site VPN.\n\n249\n00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:43.004\nWell, you know what the other name for\na host-to-site VPN is?\n\n250\n00:12:43.004 --> 00:12:44.030\nI believe I said this.\n\n251\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.374\nIf not, I'll tell you now.\n\n252\n00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:47.677\nIt's called remote access VPN.\n\n253\n00:12:47.677 --> 00:12:52.092\nSo yes, we have VPN servers that\nalso are the remote access servers.\n\n254\n00:12:52.092 --> 00:12:54.880\nThen we have the RADIUS server.\n\n255\n00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.682\nBoy boy,\nthat is a lot of infrastructure to get to,\n\n256\n00:12:56.682 --> 00:12:57.814\njust to get to the RADIUS server.\n\n257\n00:12:57.814 --> 00:13:01.162\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you're talking about\nsecurity, you really do have all these\n\n258\n00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:04.410\nextra steps and checks, because\nthat's part of our defense in depth.\n\n259\n00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.235\nYou're just building up those layers.\n\n260\n00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:09.416\n&gt;&gt; I could say, Cherokee,\nlet's just implement RDP and\n\n261\n00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:11.294\nwe'll cut this episode short.\n\n262\n00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:14.081\nNaw we wouldn't do that, but\nthat's why you've got to keep in\n\n263\n00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:17.619\nmind that something like this is gonna\nbe used inside of a corporation, right.\n\n264\n00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:20.131\nWhere security,\nobviously security is paramount,\n\n265\n00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:22.790\nnot that security is not\nimportant on my home network.\n\n266\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.246\nBut about the only thing I can't afford\nto lose on my network compromise wise is\n\n267\n00:13:27.246 --> 00:13:29.078\npictures of my family, right?\n\n268\n00:13:29.078 --> 00:13:31.400\nEvery other piece of\nsoftware I could lose,\n\n269\n00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.104\nmy operating system I couldn't care less\n&gt;&gt; A lot more liability in the corporate\n\n270\n00:13:35.104 --> 00:13:35.657\nenvironment.\n\n271\n00:13:35.657 --> 00:13:40.847\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but it's different when\nyour company's like Amazon, all right?\n\n272\n00:13:40.847 --> 00:13:43.973\nAmazon stakes, what do they lose?\n\n273\n00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:48.298\nThey lose about $1 million an hour\nif their networks are down.\n\n274\n00:13:48.298 --> 00:13:50.760\nThink about that, $1 million an hour.\n\n275\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.782\nSo it's a lot more to\nsomebody like Amazon or\n\n276\n00:13:52.782 --> 00:13:55.471\nsomebody like L.L.Bean that\nwe have here in the states.\n\n277\n00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:59.006\nAnd we're here in the states guys,\nand Amazon obviously is worldwide, so\n\n278\n00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:02.428\nyou guys if you're watching in other\ncountries, you guys know those big\n\n279\n00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:06.670\ncompanies that make a lot of money, maybe\nthat's local to your country there too.\n\n280\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.021\nThey can't afford to have some\nkinda hack into a system.\n\n281\n00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:12.990\nSo we definitely need to secure\nthese remote connections.\n\n282\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.593\nAnd that's what the RADIUS Server\nhelps us to do.\n\n283\n00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:16.619\nThere we go.\n\n284\n00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:21.510\nThe RADIUS server, what is it gonna do in\ncomparison to the remote access server?\n\n285\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.996\nWell, you have what's\nknown as a RADIUS message.\n\n286\n00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:30.090\nAll right, the RADIUS message is something\nthat only the RADIUS server can process.\n\n287\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.512\nSo what is going on here?\n\n288\n00:14:31.512 --> 00:14:36.737\nWell, the Remote Access Client,\nit sends a RADIUS challenge, right?\n\n289\n00:14:36.737 --> 00:14:37.769\nThis RADIUS challenge.\n\n290\n00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:40.000\nHey, I wanna authenticate it\nagainst the RADIUS server.\n\n291\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.510\nI'm gonna let you know here's this\nmessage, called RADIUS challenge, right.\n\n292\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.000\nAnd the RAS servers, what do they do?\n\n293\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.275\nThey take that challenge and\nthey encapsulate it in a RADIUS message,\n\n294\n00:14:49.275 --> 00:14:52.326\njust like those, the Russian\ndolls that we were saying, right,\n\n295\n00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:56.063\nan egg inside of an egg or a doll inside\nof a bigger doll, inside of a bigger doll.\n\n296\n00:14:56.063 --> 00:14:59.500\nIt encapsulates it and\nit sends that RADIUS message.\n\n297\n00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.261\nDoesn't matter if it's the VPN or\nthe dial up server.\n\n298\n00:15:01.261 --> 00:15:04.540\nWhichever one it is that you're using or\nboth, for that matter.\n\n299\n00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.340\nIt sends that RADIUS message\noff to the RADIUS server.\n\n300\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.690\nWell the RADIUS server is the only one\nthat can process the RADIUS message.\n\n301\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.594\nSo now what does the RADIUS server do?\n\n302\n00:15:15.594 --> 00:15:18.930\nWell, the RADIUS server can do\none of two things, all right.\n\n303\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.682\nWith the RADIUS server, one of the things\nthat it can do is it can turn around and\n\n304\n00:15:23.682 --> 00:15:27.079\nit can authenticate that user right there,\nall right?\n\n305\n00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:28.810\nNow there's a problem with that,\nall right?\n\n306\n00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.901\nThere is kind of a problem with that.\n\n307\n00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:35.339\nLet's say, and\nyou really shouldn't do this,\n\n308\n00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:38.980\nI don't want anybody having direct\naccess to my RADIUS server, right?\n\n309\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.236\nTechnically, the VPN server or the dial up\nserver could do the authentication, right?\n\n310\n00:15:43.236 --> 00:15:48.750\nBut what happens, why don't I want my\nRAS servers to do the authentication?\n\n311\n00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.579\nWell, I'm sending you a request for\nan authentication and it hits you.\n\n312\n00:15:51.579 --> 00:15:52.929\n&gt;&gt; Denial of service.\n\n313\n00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:53.451\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n314\n00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:56.101\nWell and\nI already got access to your server,\n\n315\n00:15:56.101 --> 00:15:59.190\nright cuz I'm sending\nan authentication request.\n\n316\n00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:04.441\nIf I could send that authentication\nrequest directly to your Server.\n\n317\n00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:07.791\nThen like Cherokee said, I can do one of\nthese AAA, denial of service attacks,\n\n318\n00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:10.991\nwhere I just keep on authenticating,\nauthenticating, authenticating.\n\n319\n00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:13.970\n&gt;&gt; Kind of cool that you\ncan even put in that field,\n\n320\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.887\nyou can make it where that initial radius\ndevice on your perimeter will not even\n\n321\n00:16:18.887 --> 00:16:21.280\nrespond if you don't set that.\n\n322\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.100\nAnd they use the term phone number\nwhenever you're typing it out,\n\n323\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.820\nbut it's really the IP address.\n\n324\n00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.450\nAnd it won't even acknowledge\nthose to help prevent that.\n\n325\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.690\nSo you do have a counter measure in\nMicrosoft but, exactly, that's the thing.\n\n326\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.320\nAnd what's interesting, I've always\nthought that was a confusing term.\n\n327\n00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.970\nCuz when you're setting up a VPN server\nit says, set up your phone book.\n\n328\n00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.054\nWell, hold on, let me go find one but,\n[LAUGH] yeah, it is a little, it goes.\n\n329\n00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:50.730\nIt harkens back to the days of dial up\nwhen it truly was or is a phone book.\n\n330\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.870\nSo we don't want that.\n\n331\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.820\nWhat we want is that we want those\ncredentials encapsulated in a way that\n\n332\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.810\nonly a specific type of row or\nservice on a server can interpret them.\n\n333\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.660\nAnd that's what the RADIUS\nserver is doing.\n\n334\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.100\nNow again like I said,\nonce it strips off the RADIUS message and\n\n335\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.990\nit's got the authentication\nwhat does it do?\n\n336\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.070\nWell, it sits there,\nit's got one of two things it can do.\n\n337\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.360\nIt can authenticate on a database\nthat's stored on the RADIUS server.\n\n338\n00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.980\nHowever, do you see all\nthis infrastructure?\n\n339\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.020\nWe're not gonna put in all this\ninfrastructure trying to secure it, and\n\n340\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.000\nthen have those accounts potentially\nstored on a server that could\n\n341\n00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.760\npotentially get compromised.\n\n342\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.870\nSo what do we do?\n\n343\n00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:32.260\nWe typically use some kind of directory\nservice that the RADIUS server,\n\n344\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.190\nwhat's its job?\n\n345\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.250\nPull up the RADIUS message, that's all.\n\n346\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.220\nJust strip off the RADIUS message and\nsay, okay,\n\n347\n00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.720\nhere's your authentication,\nlet me send this to you, Active Directory.\n\n348\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.190\nYou authenticate the user.\n\n349\n00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.230\nAnd if you turn around and you tell\nme that they are all authenticated.\n\n350\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.760\nWell guess what?\n\n351\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.880\nI'm gonna take that authenticated,\nor that you are authenticated,\n\n352\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.800\nthat successful message.\n\n353\n00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.820\nI'm gonna put it back\nin a RADIUS message and\n\n354\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.090\nI'm gonna send it back to the RAS Server.\n\n355\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.650\nThe RAS server again's gotta pass it\nright on through back to the remote\n\n356\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.040\naccess client.\n\n357\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.110\nAnd now we could start to gain access.\n\n358\n00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.110\nNow it's a little bit simplified here,\nremember there's a lot,\n\n359\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.650\nif I rip a network sniffer here you'll\nsee there's a lot going on to it.\n\n360\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.390\nBut that's simply what it's doing for us.\n\n361\n00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:22.820\nKeep in mind that this is\nthe Internet Engineering Task Force is\n\n362\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.360\nstandard for AAA or\ntriple A communication.\n\n363\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.580\nI do want to make mention of some\nports that it traverses on just so\n\n364\n00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.100\nyou can have these ports.\n\n365\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.710\nThese are standardized ports.\n\n366\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.570\nYou have 1812 for\nyour authentication messages.\n\n367\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:48.210\nAnd then you also have port 1645 for\nyour accounting messages.\n\n368\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.312\nAnd there is actually a couple of ports,\nlet me step back here and\n\n369\n00:18:51.312 --> 00:18:52.633\nmake sure I got this right.\n\n370\n00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:56.319\n1812 and 1813,\nthese are your authentication ports and\n\n371\n00:18:56.319 --> 00:19:00.015\nthen you have two ports,\n1645 and 1646 for accounting.\n\n372\n00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's kind of interesting\nwhen we do look at this Wes.\n\n373\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.720\nIn real life, in production everything\nthat he's explained to you thus far,\n\n374\n00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.520\nthe protocols.\n\n375\n00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.080\nYou might be thinking,\nwell how does this all relate?\n\n376\n00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.990\nWhy do I care, why is it important?\n\n377\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.600\nThe truth is you're not gonna\nbe setting up RADIUS servers on\n\n378\n00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.410\na daily basis, all right.\n\n379\n00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:22.310\nHowever, you do need to have the knowledge\nof these protocols to select and\n\n380\n00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.960\nchoose the best protocol for\nyour environment.\n\n381\n00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.430\nAnd then it's very important that you\nunderstand what protocols are being ran on\n\n382\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.870\nthat RADIUS server so\nwhen you're configuring the client,\n\n383\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.260\nwhich does happen quite often if you\nsupport that in your environment if you\n\n384\n00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.840\nhave a lot of connections coming in\nremotely, so, you can fat finger it.\n\n385\n00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.670\nAnd if you have any kind of a mismatch\nthere with encryption types,\n\n386\n00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.580\nnone of that will even happen,\nwhat Wes was just describing to you.\n\n387\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.715\nSo understanding how it works, plus\nall those protocols that he explained.\n\n388\n00:19:51.715 --> 00:19:53.865\nReally that's how they\nmarry together here.\n\n389\n00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:55.745\n&gt;&gt; And you do, you're right, Cherokee.\n\n390\n00:19:55.745 --> 00:19:57.515\nYou have to know the language.\n\n391\n00:19:57.515 --> 00:19:58.670\nEven if you're not configuring it.\n\n392\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.450\nCuz you're right, you're not gonna be\nbringing servers online every day,\n\n393\n00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.580\nunless you work for somebody.\n\n394\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.610\nAnd I'm joking aside,\nsomebody like Google.\n\n395\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.770\nThey add probably 1,000 servers a day.\n\n396\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.480\n&gt;&gt; True.\n\n397\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.730\n&gt;&gt; Facebook is another one.\n\n398\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:13.610\n&gt;&gt; That would be awesome.\n\n399\n00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.250\n&gt;&gt; That is exponentially growing.\n\n400\n00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:21.680\nI've seen them, they typically have\na 53 foot, 18-wheeler every day\n\n401\n00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.360\nthat's got racks of thousands of servers,\nand they're adding them on a daily basis.\n\n402\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.530\nSo in that situation, maybe you are.\n\n403\n00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:32.330\nBut our servers are brought online, and we\nreally don't want them going offline for\n\n404\n00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.560\nthree years, five years,\nwhatever the life cycle is doing.\n\n405\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.690\nSo, you might not be bringing\nthese online every day, but\n\n406\n00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.170\njust like she said,\nyou might be supporting it.\n\n407\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.320\nAnd if you're supporting it,\nyou definitely need to know the lingo.\n\n408\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.050\nIf you're taking this exam,\nyou're gonna need to know the lingo.\n\n409\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.880\nSo either way, it becomes a win-win\nsituation to understand these concepts.\n\n410\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.320\nNow, they call out another\none that I did mention, but\n\n411\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.130\nI wanna be, we'll mention it again just so\nyou're aware of it.\n\n412\n00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.740\nAnd that's the Remote Access Services.\n\n413\n00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.180\nI kinda already said what they are.\n\n414\n00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.390\nBut again, just keep in mind that these\nare typically the first devices you hit.\n\n415\n00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.100\nThe first networking components that you\nhit when you're making a connection over\n\n416\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.950\na public network is\nthe remote access service,\n\n417\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.415\nserver or sometimes generically\nremote access server server.\n\n418\n00:21:16.415 --> 00:21:20.330\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat takes care of RADIUS.\n\n419\n00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:22.000\nNow, what else do we have?\n\n420\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.700\nWell, we've got a couple\nother things here.\n\n421\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.910\nLet me go ahead and just restate what,\nbecause I wanna mention TACACS too.\n\n422\n00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.910\nThis is authentication.\n\n423\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.990\nI can prove the identity of a person,\nright?\n\n424\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.950\nOr actually it's validation of\na set of credentials if you really\n\n425\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:38.110\nwanna get technical.\n\n426\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.550\nAuthorization, we can determine\nwhat actions can be performed.\n\n427\n00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:48.160\nSo for instance, if Cherokee is\na part of our network, which she is.\n\n428\n00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.390\nShe has to be authenticated before\nI can first deny her access.\n\n429\n00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:54.210\nAnd that sometimes isn't understand,\nright.\n\n430\n00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.640\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n431\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.740\n&gt;&gt; If somebody's not a part\nof our network at all,\n\n432\n00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.730\nthey're not apart of our company, well\nwe already know they're denied, right?\n\n433\n00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.410\nBut if Cherokee's allowed\nto have access and Wes for\n\n434\n00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.650\nwhatever reason is not\nallowed to have access, and\n\n435\n00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.030\nwe're both a part of the network,\nwe have to first be authenticated before\n\n436\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.380\nthe authorization part says,\nCherokee, you have remote access.\n\n437\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.580\nWes, access denied.\n\n438\n00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.250\nAnd then, the accounting part Cherokee\nlogs in at 1:30 in the morning.\n\n439\n00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.680\nWe've got a log in place that's,\nsomebody comes and\n\n440\n00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.650\nsays Cherokee why did you log in from\na remote location at one in the morning?\n\n441\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.685\nAnd she says, well, I've got kids.\n\n442\n00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:36.700\n[LAUGH] I have to work when I can or\nthere was a problem with such and\n\n443\n00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.260\nsuch application.\n\n444\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.450\nIt couldn't wait.\n\n445\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.490\nI got a call, and\nnow I'm fixing it, right?\n\n446\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.350\nSo, the point is,\nit's not the service ticket or\n\n447\n00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.820\nthe support that might happen, it's just\nthe fact that we've also got accounting.\n\n448\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.090\nNow, RADIUS is a standard.\n\n449\n00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.410\nTACACS actually, believe it or\nnot, was start at,\n\n450\n00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.440\nI mentioned the acronym Terminal\nAccess Control Access Control System.\n\n451\n00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.840\nThis actually is an obsolete\nprotocol today and\n\n452\n00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.940\nit was originally started as\nan industry wide standard to\n\n453\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.780\nreally control access to terminals when\nwe're really just using terminals.\n\n454\n00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.200\nHowever, Cisco continued to support it but\nthey made changes to it and\n\n455\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.630\nthen it made so many changes to it\nthat deviated from the standard.\n\n456\n00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.240\nSo what they did is they said well,\nnobody else will supporting it,\n\n457\n00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.510\nwe'll continue to support it but\nthe problem is so\n\n458\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.840\nmany changes that wasn't backwards\ncompatible with the original TACACS.\n\n459\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.855\nTACACS+ today is a Cisco\nproprietary AAA implementation,\n\n460\n00:23:26.855 --> 00:23:30.085\nand it's got some things that I want\nyou to be aware of for the exam.\n\n461\n00:23:30.085 --> 00:23:32.885\nNot compatible,\nnot backwards compatible with TACACS.\n\n462\n00:23:32.885 --> 00:23:36.085\nThey are two completely\ndifferent scenarios.\n\n463\n00:23:36.085 --> 00:23:40.730\nTACACS+ tends to be a little bit\nmore secure than RADIUS because\n\n464\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.320\nthe whole entire authentication\nprocess is encrypted and\n\n465\n00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.615\nit is over\nTCP Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n466\n00:23:46.615 --> 00:23:49.731\nAnd we have\na Reliability Transport Protocol and\n\n467\n00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:51.859\nencryption associated with it.\n\n468\n00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:53.091\nWhat else?\n\n469\n00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:55.882\nAnd it uses TCP port 49.\n\n470\n00:23:55.882 --> 00:23:57.125\nJust know that for the exam.\n\n471\n00:23:57.125 --> 00:24:00.379\nAgain, they do like to\ncall those things out.\n\n472\n00:24:00.379 --> 00:24:02.523\nLet' see, I think that's about it.\n\n473\n00:24:02.523 --> 00:24:05.392\nAgain, it's proprietory,\nprimarily used today for\n\n474\n00:24:05.392 --> 00:24:09.881\nthings like device administration, but it\ncan perform most of the functionality and\n\n475\n00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:14.040\nsome of those functionalities\nbetter than RADIUS, all right.\n\n476\n00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.014\nNow we've got a couple other things\nthat we need to talk about too.\n\n477\n00:24:17.014 --> 00:24:19.002\nOne of the last two or three things, and\n\n478\n00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:21.483\nI know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n479\n00:24:21.483 --> 00:24:23.352\nSo without rushing you guys,\n\n480\n00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:27.850\nlet's just talk about something\nknown as web services, okay.\n\n481\n00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.570\nNow let's be careful because we're\ntalking about a service here as\n\n482\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.520\nmore that we're talking about a protocol,\nright.\n\n483\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.097\nCherokee when I say web,\nwhat protocol comes to mind?\n\n484\n00:24:39.097 --> 00:24:39.761\n&gt;&gt; HTTP.\n\n485\n00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:42.481\n&gt;&gt; HTTP, right just like that.\n\n486\n00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:45.110\nAnd that's what I was thinking\nwhen I first learned web service.\n\n487\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.825\nWell we got to be talking about\nhyper text transfer protocol.\n\n488\n00:24:45.825 --> 00:24:48.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean that's web.\n\n489\n00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:52.006\nAnd the answer is well not completely.\n\n490\n00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:54.024\nA web service really is a way for\n\n491\n00:24:54.024 --> 00:24:59.270\ntwo applications that are network\naware to communicate with one another.\n\n492\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.279\nThey typically do it over HTTP.\n\n493\n00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.926\nIt doesn't have to be HTTP.\n\n494\n00:25:02.926 --> 00:25:06.750\nIt could be other components\nwithin the TCP/IP protocol stack.\n\n495\n00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:11.660\nBut then it's using what are known as XML\nmessages to communicate over that service.\n\n496\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.100\nNow, this is platform independent.\n\n497\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.850\nSo it doesn't matter if\nwe're writing in Java.\n\n498\n00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.200\nDoesn't matter if we're writing in Python\nand Wes can't write in any of them.\n\n499\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.260\nI can spell C++ on a good day.\n\n500\n00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.240\nDoesn't matter if we're\nrunning Linux machines.\n\n501\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.030\nDoesn't matter if we're\nrunning Windows machines.\n\n502\n00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.300\nWe get that interoperability.\n\n503\n00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.141\nSo it is completely platform independent.\n\n504\n00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:32.020\nThey also mention\na couple of other things.\n\n505\n00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.880\nNow I don't want to go into\nthis episode too much.\n\n506\n00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.480\nBecause I've got a whole entire\n\n507\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.100\nobjective where we're gonna talk about\nthings like UC gateways, US devices.\n\n508\n00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.115\nWe're talking about\nunified communications.\n\n509\n00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:47.717\nHowever on these objectives right here\nthey do talk about unified voice services,\n\n510\n00:25:47.717 --> 00:25:49.170\nand I want you to be aware.\n\n511\n00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.930\nLet's see, I believe I got\na little diagram here, yeah.\n\n512\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:56.300\nWhat a unified voice communication\nreally means for us, okay?\n\n513\n00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.420\nIn short,\nwhen we talk about unified communications.\n\n514\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:07.530\nWe're talking about combining instant\nmessages, email, voiceover IP, presence.\n\n515\n00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.650\nWe talk about a lot of things.\n\n516\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.530\nWe're going to talk about\nthat in its own episode.\n\n517\n00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.513\nBut here,\nwhen we're talking about unified,\n\n518\n00:26:13.513 --> 00:26:16.970\nif I can even say it,\nunified voice services.\n\n519\n00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.730\nWhat we're talking about is a combination\nof all the different types of voice\n\n520\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.550\nimplementations that we have.\n\n521\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.080\nUnified voice services.\n\n522\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.052\nBreak down the individual words, right?\n\n523\n00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:29.578\nSo we're talking about integrating PSTN.\n\n524\n00:26:29.578 --> 00:26:33.490\nPublic switch network, or excuse me,\npublic switch telephone network lines.\n\n525\n00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.767\nPBX is private branch exchange,\nvoice over IP.\n\n526\n00:26:36.767 --> 00:26:43.193\nI was gonna throw in ISDN because ISDN\nalso does video, does voice, does data.\n\n527\n00:26:43.193 --> 00:26:48.750\nBut, again, just keep in mind that those\nalso traverse over public PSTN Line.\n\n528\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.730\nSo I kinda just lumped them all together.\n\n529\n00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.630\nBut basically what we get is a blending\nof analog and digital signals and\n\n530\n00:26:54.630 --> 00:27:00.140\nall the different excuse me voice\ntypes into a single infrastructure.\n\n531\n00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.889\nThat is what we are talking about\nwhen we say unified voice services.\n\n532\n00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.030\nOne of the last things I wanna\nmention are network controllers.\n\n533\n00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.608\nAnd I'm gonna mention network controllers\nfrom two different perspectives.\n\n534\n00:27:12.608 --> 00:27:19.238\nI know Mrs. Cherokee I'm kinda jumping\noff the tracks here from my notes.\n\n535\n00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:24.190\nOkay, so you have very basically what's\ncalled a network Interface controller.\n\n536\n00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.480\nThat's a network adapter, guys.\n\n537\n00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.030\nWe have a section where we're going to\nreally break down the network adapter and\n\n538\n00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.110\naddressing and talk about it, but let's\ngo ahead and kind of mention it here.\n\n539\n00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.953\nWith your network adapter, your network\ncontroller, network interface controller,\n\n540\n00:27:36.953 --> 00:27:39.860\nit literally is the device\nthat says whether you can or\n\n541\n00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.949\ncannot put your electrical communications\nout onto this physical media.\n\n542\n00:27:43.949 --> 00:27:46.504\nWhether it be bounded media or\nbe radiated energy.\n\n543\n00:27:46.504 --> 00:27:51.270\nThrough satellite, Wi-Fi,\nWiMAX if you will, or RF communications.\n\n544\n00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.760\nThe network controller is called\nthat because it's what it does.\n\n545\n00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.740\nIt has the control.\n\n546\n00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.400\nIt has the say so.\n\n547\n00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.820\nIt's got a little transceiver chip on it.\n\n548\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.220\nNow notice I said transceiver.\n\n549\n00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.420\nIt's the combination of a receiver and\na transmitter,\n\n550\n00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.320\nwhich means it's transmitting and\nreceiving data.\n\n551\n00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.000\nIt's the little processor, if you will,\n\n552\n00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.460\non the network adapter that\ncontrols all the communications.\n\n553\n00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.340\nNow we also have other types of network\ncontrollers that I'll mention here too.\n\n554\n00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.550\nWhen you have things like, for instance,\ncloud based technologies you have\n\n555\n00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.210\norchestration technologies,\norchestration components.\n\n556\n00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.758\nAnd what they do is they\nhelp control the network and\n\n557\n00:28:22.758 --> 00:28:25.254\nmake sure all the pieces\nare operating together.\n\n558\n00:28:25.254 --> 00:28:28.117\nAnd you can control all the pieces\ntogether in things like software defined\n\n559\n00:28:28.117 --> 00:28:29.400\nnetworking.\n\n560\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.618\nWe also get the ability that you have\nnetwork controllers that can do things\n\n561\n00:28:32.618 --> 00:28:36.619\nlike, for instance, managing firewalls and\nprocessing network communications aswell.\n\n562\n00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:38.003\nSo that's what it really comes down to.\n\n563\n00:28:38.003 --> 00:28:41.566\nWhen you talk about a network controller,\nwhether you're talking about it on a small\n\n564\n00:28:41.566 --> 00:28:44.003\nsensor like the network adapters\nthat are in our devices.\n\n565\n00:28:44.003 --> 00:28:46.749\nYou're talking about something\nthat controls the communications,\n\n566\n00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:49.550\nhow they're sent out on the wire,\nhow they're received off the wire.\n\n567\n00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:53.018\nI say physic I say that figuratively\ncuz we're also talking about wireless\n\n568\n00:28:53.018 --> 00:28:54.239\ncommunications as well.\n\n569\n00:28:54.239 --> 00:28:58.158\nBut then you also have devices that can\ncontrol other devices across the network\n\n570\n00:28:58.158 --> 00:28:59.979\nhence the term network controller.\n\n571\n00:28:59.979 --> 00:29:04.371\nSo a few things that we want you to be\naware of to make sure that you are going\n\n572\n00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:05.888\nto be ready for the exam.\n\n573\n00:29:05.888 --> 00:29:09.008\nMiss Cherokee let me go ahead real quick\nand we will just look back over here and\n\n574\n00:29:09.008 --> 00:29:10.740\nmake sure that I didn't forget anything.\n\n575\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.788\nI don't think I did.\n\n576\n00:29:11.788 --> 00:29:12.783\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n577\n00:29:12.783 --> 00:29:15.066\n&gt;&gt; So for unified voice service again,\n\n578\n00:29:15.066 --> 00:29:18.896\nI just want to remind you guys that\nwe I do have an episode coming\n\n579\n00:29:18.896 --> 00:29:23.480\nup that's gonna talk about a lot more\nabout the unified communications.\n\n580\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.322\nAnd not just voice, so\ndata communication, voice,\n\n581\n00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:29.690\nvideo we'll talk about all that\ncoming up in another episode.\n\n582\n00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.120\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Wes for taking the time\nin explain those different services and\n\n583\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.380\napplications.\n\n584\n00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.780\nI have a feeling though we're gonna\ntake this information and apply it\n\n585\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.470\nsome additional training or information\nthat we're going to see coming right up.\n\n586\n00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:42.360\nSo, stay tune.\n\n587\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.130\nDon't go anywhere.\n\n588\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.660\nWe've got some really great\ninformation headed your way.\n\n589\n00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.250\nBut for this episode, I'll go ahead and\nsign off as your show host.\n\n590\n00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.180\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n591\n00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n592\n00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:55.217\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n593\n00:29:55.217 --> 00:30:01.126\n[MUSIC]\n\n594\n00:30:01.126 --> 00:30:04.503\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.950\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.183\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network+\ncertification series,\n\n5\n00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.814\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.814 --> 00:00:21.875\nIn the last couple of episodes\nwe kinda been prepping you,\n\n7\n00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:25.746\ngetting you ready to look at how were\nwe going to install these services and\n\n8\n00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:28.133\napplications that we've been speaking of.\n\n9\n00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.940\nSo, guess what?\n\n10\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.800\nHere today in studios, we have Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520\nWes Bryan to go ahead and\nwalk us through this process.\n\n12\n00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000\nThank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, you're welcome Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.380\nA pleasure to be here with ITProTV.\n\n15\n00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.945\nThat's right, we're gonna be tackling,\nwhat is the official objective,\n\n16\n00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:50.460\n1.3 install and configure network\nservices and applications.\n\n17\n00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.113\nYeah that's right, that's what\nwe're gonna be tackling here and\n\n18\n00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:56.325\nwe're gonna be tackling really all of\nthese services that we're gonna be talking\n\n19\n00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.222\nabout are important.\n\n20\n00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:01.133\nSo when I say some are very, very\nimportant please don't think that others\n\n21\n00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.112\naren't, but some of them have\nbeen around for awhile and\n\n22\n00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:07.370\nit's really the way we get things\ndone on our networks today.\n\n23\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.960\nFirst and foremost DHCP, and\nthen second's gonna be DNS.\n\n24\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.200\nAnd we're gonna talk about those.\n\n25\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.097\nGuys, I'm throwing you alphabet soup\nright away there, some acronym city.\n\n26\n00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:17.600\nWe'll get back to them and\nwe will define them.\n\n27\n00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.770\nBut we're also gonna take a look at some\nother technologies that are in here.\n\n28\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.510\nWe're gonna talk about what a proxy and\na reverse proxy is.\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.840\nWe're talking about network\naddress translation.\n\n30\n00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.400\nNetwork address translation\nis important and\n\n31\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.140\nthen we will talk about\nthings like port forwarding.\n\n32\n00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.640\nSo we've got a lot to talk\nabout in this episode.\n\n33\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.200\nSo what do you say we go ahead and\nwe dive right in.\n\n34\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.700\nNow, one of the things that we\nhave to understand about network\n\n35\n00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.800\ncommunications is that we need\nan IP address to communicate.\n\n36\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.880\nNow, there's another address\nout there too, mac address, and\n\n37\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.950\nthat is important as well.\n\n38\n00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.760\nBut for right now, what we wanna talk\nabout is the focus on an IP address.\n\n39\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.440\nAn IP address is really nothing more\nthan a 32-bit identifier that tells who\n\n40\n00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.250\nthe source or the destination of a data\ntransmission is going to or coming from.\n\n41\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.901\nIt really is, I mean it's half of what we\ncall the TCP/IP Protocol stack [LAUGH], so\n\n42\n00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.893\nyou should realize it's kind of important.\n\n43\n00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:15.873\nSo it is the protocol that's responsible\nfor addressing our packets as\n\n44\n00:02:15.873 --> 00:02:20.020\nthey are routed through a network\nfrom source to destination.\n\n45\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.990\nNow how we obtain these IP address-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, how do I get that?\n\n46\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say,\nhow do we obtain the IP address,\n\n47\n00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.570\nthere's gonna be a couple different ways.\n\n48\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.430\nAnd it really depends on,\nI guess, if you're paid hourly or\n\n49\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.180\nyou're a salary employee.\n\n50\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.560\nJust kidding, but you'll see what\nI'm talking about here in a second.\n\n51\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.165\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n52\n00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:43.900\nI got a couple different ways\nthat you could address a machine.\n\n53\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.020\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.590\nwe'll talk about the one that could be\nthe bane of a lot of IT existence here.\n\n55\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.740\nLet me go ahead and\nmake it a little easier to, there we go.\n\n56\n00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Any kind of manual work is\nthe bane of an admin's existence.\n\n57\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n58\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.919\nMicrosoft would call this not\nthe least administrative effort.\n\n59\n00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.020\nSo we got dynamic and\nwe've got static addressing.\n\n60\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.900\nWhen we look at static addressing,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n61\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.710\nThat is a very manual process.\n\n62\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.390\nAnd what that means is that I have\nto go into a network adapter and\n\n63\n00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.000\nI have to assign an IP address.\n\n64\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.180\nIn fact I've got a machine here,\nwe can show you what we would have to do.\n\n65\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.750\nI have to, and I know my head's\nkinda covering it up right now.\n\n66\n00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.700\nBut if, down here in the lower right\nhand corner, if I right-click,\n\n67\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.660\nand I say right-click.\n\n68\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.500\nIf I right-click on this\nlittle network icon here.\n\n69\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.110\nAnd we'll kinda zoom in so\nyou can see that a little bit there.\n\n70\n00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.918\nAnd you can see you have the open\nnetwork and sharing center here.\n\n71\n00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:42.860\nAnd then we have over here we have\nthis Change adapter settings.\n\n72\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.300\nAnd I can go ahead and click on this, and\n\n73\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.840\nI can see the network adapters\nthat are in the machine.\n\n74\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.195\nIf it happen to be a multihomed machine\nwhere I had two network adapters,\n\n75\n00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:50.985\nI would see it here.\n\n76\n00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:54.285\nYou say well wait a second, Wes,\nyou have two adapters there.\n\n77\n00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:57.825\nWell technically,\none is more like a virtualized adapter,\n\n78\n00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.935\ncuz it's the Bluetooth communications.\n\n79\n00:03:59.935 --> 00:04:02.285\nSo I'm not really worried about\nthe Bluetooth connection right now,\n\n80\n00:04:02.285 --> 00:04:06.995\nbut the one I am concerned about,\nin this case is named Ethernet0.\n\n81\n00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:12.200\nI could rename these, so understand\nthat default client installation,\n\n82\n00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.430\nyou might see it called\nlocal area connection.\n\n83\n00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.011\nSo the name could change however\nthe adapter is important.\n\n84\n00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:18.449\n&gt;&gt; The versions of\nthe operating system can vary.\n\n85\n00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.330\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n86\n00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.870\nIf I choose Properties, all right,\nand if I come up here into Properties.\n\n87\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.555\nThis is properties of a network\nadaptor more specifically and\n\n88\n00:04:28.555 --> 00:04:30.780\nthese called protocol bindings.\n\n89\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.630\nThink about protocol binding as a way to\nbasically teach a network adaptor how to\n\n90\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.483\nspeak that protocol, or\nthose rules of communication.\n\n91\n00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:41.867\nAnd by default, we already have, I said by\ndefault, default installation of Windows,\n\n92\n00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:45.315\nwe have some protocols that are already\nbound to the network adaptor,\n\n93\n00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:48.657\nwhich means this network adaptor\nknows how to speak that language.\n\n94\n00:04:48.657 --> 00:04:53.556\nNow the one that I'm really looking for\nhere is the Internet Protocol version 4,\n\n95\n00:04:53.556 --> 00:04:54.860\nor it could be IPv6.\n\n96\n00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.250\nWe'll get to that one here in a second.\n\n97\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.290\nBut I have Internet Protocol version 4,\n\n98\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.700\nand if I choose the Properties icon\nhere and back out just a little bit,\n\n99\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.210\nyou can see that I have obtained\nan IP address automatically.\n\n100\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.870\nThis is the dynamic addressing that\nwe'll get to here in a second.\n\n101\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.292\nBut if I want to do static assignment\nthen what I do is I come in here and\n\n102\n00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:21.058\nI say okay, this is gonna be my,\n10 dot network,\n\n103\n00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:24.597\nand I do 10.10.254.\n\n104\n00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:29.249\nAnd I know this network right now\nis using a class c subnet mask,\n\n105\n00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.939\nif that doesn't make sense to you keep in\nmind we have an addressing schemas episode\n\n106\n00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.560\ncoming up where we'll talk a little\nbit more about what those mean.\n\n107\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.940\nI don't have a default gateway on this\nmachine here, so I'm not gonna go ahead.\n\n108\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.680\nI guess I could assign it if I wanted to,\njust for the heck of it,\n\n109\n00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.730\neven though it's not\nreally gonna do anything.\n\n110\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.570\nWe'll go ahead-\n&gt;&gt; Plus we'll still be able to\n\n111\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.040\ncommunicate on his local area network.\n\n112\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.360\nBut that default gateway, remember,\n\n113\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.410\nthat's just going to allow you\nto communicate externally.\n\n114\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.314\nSo you don't have to, but If you wanna\ngo ahead and communicate with another\n\n115\n00:05:59.314 --> 00:06:03.340\nnetwork, those are the three essential\ncomponents that you need right here.\n\n116\n00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n117\n00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.960\nI actually got a DNS server here,\nand I know its address.\n\n118\n00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.720\nI'll go ahead and now I've assigned a DNS.\n\n119\n00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.480\nNow, hopefully I've assigned\neverything correctly.\n\n120\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.330\nIf I haven't assigned things correctly\nthen chances are I might not get any\n\n121\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.750\ncommunication on this network.\n\n122\n00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.190\nIn fact let's go ahead and see if I can\nping that machine here real quick and\n\n123\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.640\nwe can see.\n\n124\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.304\n&gt;&gt; And you might think,\nI don't make mistakes,\n\n125\n00:06:30.304 --> 00:06:33.110\nbut here's the thing,\nif you're working in an IT department.\n\n126\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.230\nAnd I created the Excel spreadsheet or\nhowever you store that information,\n\n127\n00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.780\nand I'm passing it off to Wes, it might\nhave been someone else's mistake too.\n\n128\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.622\nSo it's just human error, it happens.\n\n129\n00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:45.250\nWe're not as reliable as those computers.\n\n130\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nnow you can see I do have communications.\n\n131\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.880\nNow that was just one machine and\n\n132\n00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.210\nyou see what I had to do in order\nto get that up and running.\n\n133\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.690\nNot a big deal too much, but\nwhat if I have 1,000 of these to do?\n\n134\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.912\nLike I said, if you're an hourly employee,\n\n135\n00:06:59.912 --> 00:07:01.240\nyou've got no problem with that,\ntake all day.\n\n136\n00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.321\n&gt;&gt; Make sure you've got your sneakers.\n\n137\n00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n138\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.360\nSo, what if I do have 1,000?\n\n139\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.970\nIf I have 1,000 devices then I don't\nwant to have to statically assign\n\n140\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.470\nthem because it will lead to\nthings like configuration errors.\n\n141\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.870\nSure, I might be able to type it one,\ntwo, maybe three times.\n\n142\n00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.460\nMaybe three times,\nwithout making a configuration error.\n\n143\n00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.489\nBut then as I go on farther and farther,\n\n144\n00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:26.514\nthere is a tendency to cause\nthese configuration errors.\n\n145\n00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:29.820\nSo static assignment is\na very manual process.\n\n146\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.500\nI'm gonna go back to our diagram here.\n\n147\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.620\nAnd that's one of the big things,\nthat it does cause or\n\n148\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.840\ncan lead to configuration errors.\n\n149\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.930\nNow, the other thing that I do\nwant you to keep in mind as well,\n\n150\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.230\nis that what kind of devices\nare statically assigned?\n\n151\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.417\nDoes that have a place in our network?\n\n152\n00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.270\nWell, yes it does have\na place in our network.\n\n153\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.902\nThere are certain devices\nthat provide services for\n\n154\n00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:56.560\nthe network that we don't want their\nIP addresses Is changing, right?\n\n155\n00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.314\nFor instance, we have network routers,\nrouters we don't want their IP addresses\n\n156\n00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:03.090\nchanging, because they're\nour default gateways.\n\n157\n00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.930\nNotice I assign that default gateway, and\n\n158\n00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.550\nif I do ipconfig,\n&gt;&gt; We need that stability to\n\n159\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.540\ndepend on these devices.\n\n160\n00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.410\nAs a matter of fact, I was just looking at\na home security camera system last night,\n\n161\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.450\nand you cannot use those devices\nwith dynamic IP addresses,\n\n162\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.420\nthey have to be statically addressed.\n\n163\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.970\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting, so if we look\nat the Default Gateway, what happen?\n\n164\n00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.530\nWhat is my Default Gateway again?\n\n165\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.470\nWell, that's how I send traffic\noff of my local network.\n\n166\n00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.250\nWell, what if the Default Gateway on\na thousand of these devices that I\n\n167\n00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.795\njust got done configuring changes?\n\n168\n00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:36.009\nNow it's let's say 10, 10.0.1.\n\n169\n00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:39.187\nWell now I have to,\nif everything is statically assigned,\n\n170\n00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:43.870\nI have to go back to each individual\nmachine, re-assigning the default gateway.\n\n171\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.480\nThat's not really feasible.\n\n172\n00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.555\nSo, again, I do want you to keep\nin mind that there are certain\n\n173\n00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:50.325\ndevices that their IP\naddresses don't change.\n\n174\n00:08:50.325 --> 00:08:54.195\nServers that are providing services,\nwe don't want their IP addresses changing.\n\n175\n00:08:54.195 --> 00:08:56.875\nIf I've got a website that's serving\n\n176\n00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:01.785\nup Internet based website that's serving\nup a employee handbook, safety and\n\n177\n00:09:01.785 --> 00:09:05.080\nregulations if you will,\nsecurity policies, right?\n\n178\n00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.840\nI don't want their IP address changing\nbecause then if it does I have anything\n\n179\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.910\nthat's relying on that IP address\nnow has to be changed as well.\n\n180\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.990\nSo these devices typically have static\nIP address, all right, so I want\n\n181\n00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.610\nyou to know that static assignments do\nhave their place inside of our networks.\n\n182\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.810\nHowever, what is more common.\n\n183\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.280\nI didn't mention printer too,\nI'll go ahead and mention printers.\n\n184\n00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.680\nKeep in mind, network based printers,\nwe don't want their IP addresses changing.\n\n185\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.880\nCuz when we deploy these printers,\nessentially through a policy or\n\n186\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.980\nconfiguration that's inside the clients,\nand I change the IP address for\n\n187\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.680\nwhatever reason on the network printer.\n\n188\n00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.210\nNow I have to re-deploy these policies.\n\n189\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.880\n&gt;&gt; You're going to have a lot\nof help tickets rolling in.\n\n190\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we are going to\nhave to reconfigure everything.\n\n191\n00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.850\nSo the configuration itself,\nit's not really a good way to do this,\n\n192\n00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.370\nto have the possibility that\nthe IP address could change.\n\n193\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.430\nSo this is where we get\ninto dynamic addressing.\n\n194\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.980\nAll right?\nNow when we look at Dynamic Addressing,\n\n195\n00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.110\nthis means that it can change.\n\n196\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.720\nSome people think that it's automatic.\n\n197\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.240\nThat is not the case.\n\n198\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.250\nIt's dynamic.\n\n199\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.310\nDynamic meaning the fact\nthat it can change.\n\n200\n00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.440\nI do want you to keep in mind,\nbecause we do have a form of auto,\n\n201\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.710\nIP address assignment, but\nthat's a separate technology,\n\n202\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.150\ncompletely different technology that\nwe'll talk about in a bit coming up.\n\n203\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.470\nNow, why would we do dynamic addressing\nto things like our workstations,\n\n204\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.590\nto our laptops,\nto our mobile devices like tablets BYOD,\n\n205\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.140\nbecause we could have hundreds,\nwe could have thousands of them, and\n\n206\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.700\nwanna a way to reduce the burden\nof administration, right.\n\n207\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.010\nIf you take a Microsoft exam they talk\n\n208\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.260\nabout the least amount of\nadministrative efforts,\n\n209\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.130\nnot sure if Cam T is gonna use that verb\nbut keep in mind that's what your goal is.\n\n210\n00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.439\nEase the burden of\nadministration because now-\n\n211\n00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:48.336\n&gt;&gt; Harder and not harder.\n\n212\n00:10:48.336 --> 00:10:49.327\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n213\n00:10:49.327 --> 00:10:54.580\nNow when my devices come online,\nthey can call out to the network.\n\n214\n00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.560\nThey can say, hey, I need an IP address\nand they get one of the IP addresses.\n\n215\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.970\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk a little bit about that.\n\n216\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.130\nAll right, let's talk about how do\nthese devices get their IP addresses.\n\n217\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.760\nAll right.\n\n218\n00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.060\nWell, they get their IP addresses\nthrough a process of called DORA.\n\n219\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.600\nAll right.\n\n220\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.762\nNow DORA, it's actually a little\nacronym if you will and\n\n221\n00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:20.285\nit stands for Discovery, Offer,\nRequest and Acknowledge.\n\n222\n00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:21.770\nSo what is this mean?\n\n223\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.290\nWell I want you to think about our\ncomputer here, I told you our computer\n\n224\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.413\ncomes online and it asks for\nan IP address, so what is going on?\n\n225\n00:11:28.413 --> 00:11:32.672\nWell, at first when your clients that\nis using DHCP, the is DHCP client,\n\n226\n00:11:32.672 --> 00:11:37.137\nthe service that is gonna call out for\nan IP address, when it first boots up and\n\n227\n00:11:37.137 --> 00:11:41.944\nit looks at the network adapter and it\nsays, I don't have a static configuration,\n\n228\n00:11:41.944 --> 00:11:44.090\nI'm supposed to use DHCP.\n\n229\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.680\nIt looks at that network adapter and\n\n230\n00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.630\nit says,\nis there an IP address assigned to it?\n\n231\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.530\nLet's say this is the first time\nyou've ever deployed this machine, so\n\n232\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.490\nthe answer's gonna be, no, it doesn't.\n\n233\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.260\nSo what it does,\n\n234\n00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.220\nis it sends a broadcast communication\nout to your local network, right?\n\n235\n00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.680\nBroadcasting, as we have\nseen in other episodes,\n\n236\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.550\nis a one to everybody communication.\n\n237\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.730\nSo it says to the whole entire network,\nright?\n\n238\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.610\nWhatever it can reach.\n\n239\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.920\nAnd it says, is there anybody out\nthere that's got an IP address?\n\n240\n00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.420\nAnd then it listens.\n\n241\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.690\nNow, the next part of this\nis called an offer packet.\n\n242\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:23.000\nAnd the offer packet is the DHCP server\nslash servers that says, yeah, sure.\n\n243\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.170\nHere's an IP address.\n\n244\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.170\nAnd again, that's the offer.\n\n245\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.840\nWell then comes the third part,\nthe R in this.\n\n246\n00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.440\nAnd this is what is known as a request.\n\n247\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.100\nNow a request is kinda interesting.\n\n248\n00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.710\nAnd I remember when I first\nstarted studying this,\n\n249\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.750\ndidn't I just try to\ndiscover an IP address?\n\n250\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.490\nWhy would I turn around and make a request\nif I've already tried to discover?\n\n251\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.400\nWell that really relies in how DHCP works.\n\n252\n00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.060\nSee, I only have a single\nDHCP server out here.\n\n253\n00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.230\nBut if I put a few more on my network, and\n\n254\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.820\nI call out to the network on\nthat first discovery packet.\n\n255\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.290\nAnd we say,\nanybody out there got an IP address?\n\n256\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.390\nWell, who's gonna respond to that?\n\n257\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:09.120\nAny DHCP server that is listening and\nconfigured to respond is going to respond.\n\n258\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.140\nSo, in this case,\nif we have three DHCP servers,\n\n259\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.560\nour client is gonna receive three offers.\n\n260\n00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.910\nSo what does it do?\n\n261\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.790\nYour client says, I'm gonna take\nthe offer, the IP address, for\n\n262\n00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:28.640\nthe very first DHCP server\nthat responded to me.\n\n263\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.241\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n264\n00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.400\nthen what do all the other\nDHCP servers do?\n\n265\n00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.840\nThey say, okay, we see that you're\ntaking that DHCP server's address.\n\n266\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.770\nWe'll go ahead and take our offer and\nwe'll put it back in our database so\n\n267\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.580\nthat if somebody else comes online and\n\n268\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.790\ndoes that same process\ncalls out to the network,\n\n269\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.710\nwe'll have that in our pool of addresses\nthat lease out to other devices.\n\n270\n00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.050\nAll right, so\nonce your device says I'll take it.\n\n271\n00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.490\nI'll take that IP address.\n\n272\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.860\nThe last part of this\nin an acknowledgement.\n\n273\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.710\nAnd the acknowledgement it's a little\nbit not quite centered here.\n\n274\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.300\nBut I just want you to remember that\nit should technically go ahead and\n\n275\n00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.880\nput the acknowledgement down here,\nthe server down here.\n\n276\n00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.620\nBecause it's what acknowledge is that.\n\n277\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.670\nIt says okay, so you said you'll take it.\n\n278\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.650\nLet me look at my little check list\nhere and I see that IP address.\n\n279\n00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.840\nI'm wanna go ahead and just mark\nit off that it's reserved for you,\n\n280\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.700\nnot reserved but it's gonna be\nleased to you for eight days and\n\n281\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.295\nI'll put your name there so that if\nanybody else comes online and ask for\n\n282\n00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:25.905\nan IP address, I won't give that to them.\n\n283\n00:14:25.905 --> 00:14:28.445\nAll right, so that is something\nthat I do want you to know.\n\n284\n00:14:28.445 --> 00:14:31.635\nHow do we actually see this in play?\n\n285\n00:14:31.635 --> 00:14:34.785\nThat is one of the things that we're\ngonna take a look at here in a second.\n\n286\n00:14:34.785 --> 00:14:38.105\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, thank you for taking the time\nto actually break it down because\n\n287\n00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:40.465\na lot of you, this might be\nthe first time ever seen it before.\n\n288\n00:14:40.465 --> 00:14:43.010\nBut let me just give you\na heads up that it's\n\n289\n00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.660\nvery important that you fully understand\nthis process that Wes has explained.\n\n290\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.620\nBecause if you continue to\nfurther your career within IT,\n\n291\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.180\nyou need to understand things like\n\n292\n00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.920\nas we're moving with the admin of IPV 6\nwe don't have broadcast transmissions.\n\n293\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.910\nSo really understanding how\nthis works is going to help it\n\n294\n00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.410\nmake more sense in the long run.\n\n295\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.910\nAnd understanding if you're\nlooking into security plots, or\n\n296\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.610\nmoving forward with that angle.\n\n297\n00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.280\nYou could look at any kind of exploits and\n\n298\n00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.640\nvulnerabilities that are associated\nwith these protocols.\n\n299\n00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.560\nSo make sure you get a good understanding\nof what he's covering here.\n\n300\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.280\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\nreally what it comes down to, this,\n\n301\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.950\nI can't stress the importance of DHCP and\nDNS.\n\n302\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:26.140\nThese two services\nare services that we rely on.\n\n303\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:26.690\n&gt;&gt; Network services.\n\n304\n00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Heavily, exactly, the core services is\none of the best ways to put it, for sure.\n\n305\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.270\nSo let's go ahead and we'll go ahead and\n\n306\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.410\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nswitch over to our server, here.\n\n307\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.314\nAnd let me go ahead and, you guys\ncertainly don't need to see me logging\n\n308\n00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:47.500\nin because then you would just\nsee how bad I type, all right.\n\n309\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.230\n&gt;&gt; Password.\n\n310\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.388\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say our producer saved\nyou a little bit of the trouble so\n\n311\n00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:53.430\nyou didn't have to see how bad I type.\n\n312\n00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.174\nWe're logged into Windows, I think this\nis a 2016 box that I have here guys.\n\n313\n00:15:58.174 --> 00:16:00.769\nOne of the great things is it\ndoesn't really change much.\n\n314\n00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:04.630\nThe interfaces haven't changed,\nreally the manager themselves, too much.\n\n315\n00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:11.130\nSo if you're in 2008, 2008 R2, 2012,\n2012 R2, and now finally 2016.\n\n316\n00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.163\nYou're gonna end up seeing pretty\nmuch of the same thing, all right?\n\n317\n00:16:15.163 --> 00:16:18.000\nSo we have our DHCP server here,\nall right?\n\n318\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.931\nAnd please understand\nthat this DHCP server,\n\n319\n00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:25.371\nwe want it to provide that DHCP service.\n\n320\n00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.002\nNow as it's configured right now we've\ngot some checks in place to tell me this\n\n321\n00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:30.555\nserver is up and running, okay?\n\n322\n00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:34.743\nSo we should be sending out IP addresses,\nright?\n\n323\n00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:36.209\nWrong, all right?\n\n324\n00:16:36.209 --> 00:16:38.170\n[LAUGH] Let's see what else you do.\n\n325\n00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.000\nAll right,\nwe're talking about IP addresses.\n\n326\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.160\nWhat's kinda funny is,\nwhat IP addresses are we talking about?\n\n327\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160\nWell, that comes from\nsomething known as a scope.\n\n328\n00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.040\nOkay, very basically,\n\n329\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.560\na scope is nothing more than a pool of\nIP addresses that you have to lease out.\n\n330\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.330\nHowever, the scope gives us a little\nbit more configuration flexibility,\n\n331\n00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.010\nand I'll come back to that\npoint here in a second.\n\n332\n00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.730\nSo let's go ahead and see that, all right?\n\n333\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.648\nRemember, a scope.\n\n334\n00:17:00.648 --> 00:17:06.200\nIf I right-click on our IPv4 you'll see\nthere's this New Scope option, all right?\n\n335\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.100\nAnd when you imagine\nthat wizard driven here,\n\n336\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.030\nwe've got a nice point-and-click wizard.\n\n337\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.170\nWe'll go ahead and Next through this,\nand we'll start our New Scope Wizard.\n\n338\n00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.681\nNow it's gonna ask us\nto name our scope here,\n\n339\n00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:22.130\nand I might just call this DemoIT.\n\n340\n00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.030\nWhat do I, as talented or\nI should say creative as I am.\n\n341\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.310\nI'll just call it Demo.ITProTV and\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n342\n00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.340\nwe'll Next through the wizard.\n\n343\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.390\nNow remember what I told you.\n\n344\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.760\nYou define the scope address range,\nwhat do they mean by the address range?\n\n345\n00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.790\nWell we have a pool of addresses\nthat has a starting point,\n\n346\n00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.020\na starting IP address, and\nit ranges to the end IP address.\n\n347\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:52.310\nSo in this case I might do something\nlike I think I'll end in 220 here.\n\n348\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.369\nSo we'll do 10.10.220.\n\n349\n00:17:56.369 --> 00:18:00.331\nAnd then what we're gonna\ndo here is we'll do\n\n350\n00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:05.770\n10.10.10.240, we'll keep it simple.\n\n351\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:10.030\nAll right, so basically we have\n21 addresses I believe there,\n\n352\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.230\nI think that's about right,\nor 20 addresses.\n\n353\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.312\nNow, the next thing is we have to\ndefine what kinda network are we\n\n354\n00:18:16.312 --> 00:18:17.409\nsupporting, right?\n\n355\n00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:21.285\nAnd in this case, you'll see that\nin a 10 dot it defaults to 8 bit.\n\n356\n00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:23.182\nAnd that's because\nthe server a lot of times,\n\n357\n00:18:23.182 --> 00:18:26.660\nthe network configurations will\ndefault to what's known as classfull.\n\n358\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.494\nI'm not going classfull,\n\n359\n00:18:28.494 --> 00:18:33.687\nmy network is set up as a class A private\nIP address range with a class C subnet.\n\n360\n00:18:33.687 --> 00:18:37.278\nI know I probably just confused you,\nexcept if you've already watched our IP\n\n361\n00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:39.610\naddressing schema section,\nit'll make sense.\n\n362\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.490\nIf not, that's definitely\none you're gonna check out.\n\n363\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.550\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll put a 24\nbit Subnet mask in site or notation,\n\n364\n00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:51.430\nif you will, or 255.255.255.0,\nand we'll choose Next.\n\n365\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:56.207\nNow, they don't call these out on the exam\nbut I'm gonna mention them here anyways.\n\n366\n00:18:56.207 --> 00:19:00.240\nBecause it's not always just about\nwhat's on the exam here at ITProTV.\n\n367\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.460\nWe also want you to have a little bit more\ninformation as you start to advance your\n\n368\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.390\nstudies, maybe into the Microsoft realm.\n\n369\n00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.090\nMaybe you're gonna go into\nserver administration.\n\n370\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.270\nSo this is gonna be important.\n\n371\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.950\nThis is what's known as an exclusion.\n\n372\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:16.140\nAll right,\nlet's say I set a 254 address range.\n\n373\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.340\nSo typically it's class C, right?\n\n374\n00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.190\nI've got 1, 1's usually reserved for\nthe default gateway.\n\n375\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.110\nBut let's say we got 2 to 254.\n\n376\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:33.320\nBut I decide that in that range of 253\naddresses [LAUGH], do bad math here.\n\n377\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.120\n253 addresses that I have 50 servers\n\n378\n00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.240\nthat already have static IP\naddresses within that range.\n\n379\n00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.544\n&gt;&gt; You don't want to mess with those.\n\n380\n00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:42.423\n&gt;&gt; I don't want to mess with those.\n\n381\n00:19:42.423 --> 00:19:42.923\nThat's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:42.923 --> 00:19:43.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We definitely don't.\n\n383\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.720\nRemember what I just told you about\nservers not changing their IP addresses,\n\n384\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.470\nthat'd be bad.\n\n385\n00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:48.870\n[LAUGH] We don't want that to happen.\n\n386\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.050\nSo what we do is we add an exclusion.\n\n387\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:54.760\nAnd what does the exclusion do, it does\nexactly what it sounds like, all right?\n\n388\n00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.651\nIt says, from this IP address to this IP\naddress, which could be 2 if you want or\n\n389\n00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:00.757\nit could be 50.\n\n390\n00:20:00.757 --> 00:20:03.365\nYour DHCP Server scope\nwill turn a blind eye.\n\n391\n00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:06.054\nIt'll say, we'll exclude those\nfrom the overall scope or\n\n392\n00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:08.180\nrange and we won't hand those out.\n\n393\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.050\nI'm not gonna do that but\nI just wanted you to know.\n\n394\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.264\nIt's not called out on the exam objectives\nbut you should know what it does and\n\n395\n00:20:13.264 --> 00:20:14.840\nwhere it applies to you.\n\n396\n00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.390\nThe other one again is not called out\nhere too, Subnet delay in milli second.\n\n397\n00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:24.420\nAnd this is quite literally\na delay to the discovery packet.\n\n398\n00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.890\nIf a machine, if you will, calls out,\nright, and says, hey I need an IP address.\n\n399\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.910\nWell, what kind of delay\nare we gonna implement?\n\n400\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.820\nSo again, you can do that.\n\n401\n00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.570\nWe're not gonna worry\nabout any delays there.\n\n402\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.806\nNow, I want you to think\nabout what I said when I\n\n403\n00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:45.602\nsaid an IP address is leased to you,\nall right.\n\n404\n00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:47.479\nLeased as in a rental car, all right?\n\n405\n00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:49.218\nIf I know that I'm going\nto a certain area and\n\n406\n00:20:49.218 --> 00:20:51.673\nI know I'm gonna need to drive around and\nI can't take my car.\n\n407\n00:20:51.673 --> 00:20:55.030\nI'm gonna go ahead and what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna lease the car.\n\n408\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.550\nLet's say I have it for a week.\n\n409\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.029\nIP addresses that are obtained\nthrough a DHCP server\n\n410\n00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.850\nhave the same concept applied to them.\n\n411\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.182\nThey have what's known as a lease.\n\n412\n00:21:04.182 --> 00:21:06.960\nAll right, a lease duration and\nyou can see what the default is.\n\n413\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.820\nIt's typically eight days.\n\n414\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:12.450\nIt means that I have that IP address for\neight days.\n\n415\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.710\n&gt;&gt; Well what if you go on vacation?\n\n416\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.180\n&gt;&gt; Is that good for your company?\n\n417\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.590\nWell the answer is, I don't know.\n\n418\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.580\nI don't know if it's good for\nyour company.\n\n419\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.280\nRight, if it's a mobile device and\nit's gonna be on my network one time.\n\n420\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.980\nIf it's like Cherokee said.\n\n421\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.230\nI go on vacation.\n\n422\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.887\nWell that means when I obtain\nan IP address on this network, and\n\n423\n00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:31.821\nif I go on vacation for two weeks.\n\n424\n00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:34.460\nWell that means eight days out\nof that two weeks I'm gonna take\n\n425\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.940\nthat IP address off your network.\n\n426\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.390\nAnd it's not going to anybody else.\n\n427\n00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.180\nHow about if I have a mobile device?\n\n428\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.470\nHow many of you guys have connected to\na WI-fi network on your mobile device?\n\n429\n00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.460\nI know I'm guilty of it all the time,\nright,\n\n430\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.610\nI'm guilty of it all the time, we do that.\n\n431\n00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.520\nBut imagine obtaining an IP address\nthrough a wireless network and\n\n432\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.850\nyou are on that network for 15 minutes.\n\n433\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:53.610\n&gt;&gt; Starbucks.\n\n434\n00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.488\n&gt;&gt; Starbucks, very good, very, very good.\n\n435\n00:21:56.488 --> 00:21:58.441\n&gt;&gt; How long does it take you\nto drink a cup of coffee?\n\n436\n00:21:58.441 --> 00:21:59.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I've been working\non one all day here so\n\n437\n00:21:59.859 --> 00:22:00.952\nmaybe that's not a good analogy.\n\n438\n00:22:00.952 --> 00:22:02.386\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry.\n\n439\n00:22:02.386 --> 00:22:03.293\nI'll let you do your thing.\n\n440\n00:22:03.293 --> 00:22:07.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can set this, maybe for\n\n441\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.980\nus it's not days.\n\n442\n00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.270\nMaybe if it's a mobile network,\nI set it for one hour.\n\n443\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.620\nAll right, now let's go make this\nDHCP server slightly busier.\n\n444\n00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.670\nRight, it's going to\nhave to reply to a lot of\n\n445\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.610\nbasically the door process again, but\nmaybe it's right for your network.\n\n446\n00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.540\nI'm not going to change this.\n\n447\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.930\nI'm going to go ahead and what I'll do\nis I'll just leave this at the default.\n\n448\n00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.360\nWe'll leave it eight days, all right.\n\n449\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.786\nEight days and\nI believe the eight days is so\n\n450\n00:22:36.786 --> 00:22:40.030\nthat you have more than just a work week.\n\n451\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:40.861\n&gt;&gt; A solid work week?\n\n452\n00:22:40.861 --> 00:22:43.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, more that just a solid work week.\n\n453\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.340\nAnd let me go ahead and reset that.\n\n454\n00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.081\nI am changing all kinds of things here.\n\n455\n00:22:46.081 --> 00:22:47.420\n[LAUGH] And we'll choose Next.\n\n456\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.080\nNow here's the next thing\nthat we need to look at and\n\n457\n00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.290\nthis is called out on the exam.\n\n458\n00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.300\nThese are what are known as\nthe DHCP options, all right?\n\n459\n00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.870\nRight here, what we're doing is\nconfiguring the basic DHCP options, and\n\n460\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.450\nI'll show you why I say\nbasic here coming up.\n\n461\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.090\nDHCP options, this comes back\nto the name of the protocol.\n\n462\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:12.120\nSome people, as they're studying DHCP\nthey focus solely on the IP address.\n\n463\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.680\nAll right, you have to understand\nwhat this protocol's name is.\n\n464\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.530\nDoes it say this is the dynamic\nIP addressing protocol?\n\n465\n00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.750\nNo, it says that it's\nHost Configuration Protocol.\n\n466\n00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:23.740\n&gt;&gt; There's more to it.\n\n467\n00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.862\n&gt;&gt; It's host configuration.\n\n468\n00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:25.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n469\n00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:26.826\nthat's what you have to keep in mind.\n\n470\n00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:29.860\nThere are other things,\nand this is the benefit.\n\n471\n00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.760\nAnd I wanted to wait until we\ngot here to mention the benefit.\n\n472\n00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.660\nThis is the other benefit of DHCP.\n\n473\n00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.823\nIt's not just about saying, here's your\nIP address, I'll see you in eight days.\n\n474\n00:23:38.823 --> 00:23:42.620\nBut it's, here's your IP address.\n\n475\n00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:47.710\nAnd while you're at it, let me go ahead\nand I'll hand you out a default gateway.\n\n476\n00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.725\n&gt;&gt; Could you just imagine,\nthis DHCP server is trying to maybe\n\n477\n00:23:52.725 --> 00:23:58.657\ncreate a little Online dating,\nI have so much more to offer than that.\n\n478\n00:23:58.657 --> 00:24:00.967\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Just not an IP address.\n\n479\n00:24:00.967 --> 00:24:01.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n480\n00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.160\nSo we're gonna go more\nthan just the IP address.\n\n481\n00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.470\nWe'll offer a little bit more.\n\n482\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.640\nWe're gonna offer that default gateway.\n\n483\n00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.750\nAgain, that router.\n\n484\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.175\nSo, I'll go ahead and I'll keep\nthis on the same network hopefully.\n\n485\n00:24:13.175 --> 00:24:14.503\n10.10.10.1.\n\n486\n00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:16.224\nAgain, it's going to be\ndifferent in your network.\n\n487\n00:24:16.224 --> 00:24:19.738\nIf your home router is\nactually doing this for you,\n\n488\n00:24:19.738 --> 00:24:25.720\na lot of times it's a 192.168.0.1 or\na 192.168.1.1 address.\n\n489\n00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.133\nThat is not a standard.\n\n490\n00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:30.193\nThere is nothing standardized that\nsays you have to have this IP address\n\n491\n00:24:30.193 --> 00:24:31.530\nover this one.\n\n492\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.500\nA lot of times we just do that for\nease of use and\n\n493\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.570\nwhat we do is just to identify the very\nfirst IP address in a network range.\n\n494\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.660\nIt does not have to be that way.\n\n495\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.070\nI've seen people get tricky and\nactually put it towards the end, but\n\n496\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.890\nthat's up to you.\n\n497\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.200\nSo we'll go ahead and\nadd the default gateway.\n\n498\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.588\nNow, here's another\nthing that we get to do.\n\n499\n00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:52.780\nAll right, now,\n\n500\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:57.470\nthey call it out on your objectives,\nthey call it out as a suffix.\n\n501\n00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.953\nThis is actually a connection\nspecific suffix and\n\n502\n00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:07.630\nwhen I am a part of a domain,\nmy computer has a host name.\n\n503\n00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.420\nAnd then when it's part of the domain,\nit adds not only the host name that it\n\n504\n00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.280\ndoesn't need to be a part of a domain\nto have it, it adds the domain name.\n\n505\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.440\nAnd those two become what's known as\na fully qualified domain name, so\n\n506\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.360\nwhen we do a name lookup,\nwhich we'll get into in a little bit,\n\n507\n00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.610\nlet's say server one here is srv01, right?\n\n508\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:33.209\nIt's gonna append.,\nin this case demo.itpro.tv.\n\n509\n00:25:33.209 --> 00:25:36.040\nThis is called a connection\nspecific suffix here.\n\n510\n00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.960\nAnd they do point those out.\n\n511\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.150\nI'll show it to you in the operating\nsystem coming up here in a second just as\n\n512\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.840\nsoon as we finish the demo.\n\n513\n00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.340\nThis is our domain name and\nthe DNS server.\n\n514\n00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.100\nSo not only the domain name but\nwho is providing DNS and\n\n515\n00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.840\nyou see there's an IP address\nalready populated here.\n\n516\n00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:57.329\nI can tell you why that is, this is\nan active directory integrated DNS zone.\n\n517\n00:25:57.329 --> 00:26:01.262\nSo since this computer is already\na part of that database it says\n\n518\n00:26:01.262 --> 00:26:03.710\nI already know where your DNS server is.\n\n519\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:05.470\nI don't have to use that, right?\n\n520\n00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.420\nI could use a public IP address,\nif I wanted to.\n\n521\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.640\nYou're probably not, but it's not\nsaying that I have to use this one.\n\n522\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.680\nIn fact, I've seen in some cases, in labs,\nwhere it's gotta 169.254 address.\n\n523\n00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.370\nThe first thing I do is remove that,\nand we'll talk about why, coming up.\n\n524\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:25.120\nAll right, so we choose next, and\nif I happen to be using the old\n\n525\n00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.610\nNetBIOS names,\nthey're a single look up name.\n\n526\n00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.670\nAll it does is says computer01.\n\n527\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.780\nAnd there was a way, a service that\nwould map that to an IP address.\n\n528\n00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.750\nIt's kinda outdated.\n\n529\n00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.947\nI would say we're not gonna use it but\nwe've been saying that for\n\n530\n00:26:39.947 --> 00:26:41.628\nthe last 15 years and\nit hasn't gone away yet.\n\n531\n00:26:41.628 --> 00:26:44.820\nSo it's still baked into your\nWindows operating systems.\n\n532\n00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.430\nAnd if you happen to need to resolve\nthose NetBIOS names to an IP\n\n533\n00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:53.420\naddress you use what's known as a Windows\ninternet naming service server, winserver.\n\n534\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.350\nI'm not using that so I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and I'm going to remove that.\n\n535\n00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:02.140\nCuz I don't need it, and\nI'm gonna choose Next.\n\n536\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.430\nAll right, now it asks me if\nI wanna activate this scope.\n\n537\n00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.600\nI've configured it, but\nit's like a light switch.\n\n538\n00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.130\nI haven't turned it on yet, right?\n\n539\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.000\nThe light switch is mounted, right?\n\n540\n00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.860\nIt could turn the light on, but\nI have to actually walk over there and\n\n541\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.770\nflip the switch for it to turn it on.\n\n542\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.490\nThat's what we're gonna go ahead and do.\n\n543\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.100\nWe're gonna go ahead and what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna flip the switch.\n\n544\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:23.840\nAnd we'll choose Finish.\n\n545\n00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:29.420\nAnd now as you can see under\nIPv4 we have a scope, right?\n\n546\n00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.780\nAnd now that I have a scope\nI can expand that scope out.\n\n547\n00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.000\nAnd we can see additional things.\n\n548\n00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.366\nWe can see our address pool, right,\nthat address pool, remember 220 to 224.\n\n549\n00:27:41.366 --> 00:27:43.300\nAddress leases,\nwe don't have any of those.\n\n550\n00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.280\nSo we're gonna take care of that,\n\n551\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.680\nbut I can see we're coming close\nto the end of the episode here.\n\n552\n00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.980\nSo we might be taking care\nof that in a part two here.\n\n553\n00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.810\nWe'll look at Reservations, and\nwe'll look at Scope Options.\n\n554\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.320\nI do, and I'll tell you what Cherokee,\nI'll go ahead and finish this one up.\n\n555\n00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.030\nSince we'll just round up\nthe scope options here.\n\n556\n00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.210\nThose are those options.\n\n557\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.340\nNow remember what I told you?\n\n558\n00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.360\nI said we were setting the basics.\n\n559\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.790\nLet me show you why.\n\n560\n00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.220\nIf I right-click on Scope Options and\nI choose this Option.\n\n561\n00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.240\nWell that's redundant,\nto Configure Options.\n\n562\n00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.530\nWhat we're gonna talk\nabout options everywhere.\n\n563\n00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.890\nYou will see that I have five.\n\n564\n00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:16.880\nNot really.\n\n565\n00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:22.750\nActually if I scroll through here\nI have tons and tons and tons.\n\n566\n00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:27.490\nAnd we can even go into Advanced, and\nwe can get out of DHCP Standard Options.\n\n567\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.530\nAnd we can get into more older,\n\n568\n00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.720\nproprietary options that\nare specific to Microsoft.\n\n569\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.700\nSo, options are something that,\nthink about this way.\n\n570\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.483\nAdditional configuration parameters that\nwe can hand our devices that are calling\n\n571\n00:28:40.483 --> 00:28:41.583\nfor an IP address.\n\n572\n00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:46.174\nThat also is one of the things that\nmakes DHCP stand a dynamic IP addressing\n\n573\n00:28:46.174 --> 00:28:50.769\nhelpful is because I can also configure\nadditional things without having\n\n574\n00:28:50.769 --> 00:28:54.934\nto go to computer to computer to\ncomputer manually defining them.\n\n575\n00:28:54.934 --> 00:28:56.502\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, we are out of time.\n\n576\n00:28:56.502 --> 00:29:00.427\nAnd I know I introduced this show as we're\ngoing to be looking at installing and\n\n577\n00:29:00.427 --> 00:29:02.580\nconfiguring services and applications.\n\n578\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.810\nWe haven't quite made it through\nour entire first protocol here.\n\n579\n00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.210\nBut I feel like its better to be more\nthorough than to rush through it so\n\n580\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:15.160\nhang with us because we do wanna continue\nlooking at DHCP in the next episode.\n\n581\n00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.170\nSo grab your popcorn, get comfortable,\nstay tuned, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n582\n00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.580\nwrap it up for this show and remember\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n583\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n584\n00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.631\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n585\n00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:33.660\n[MUSIC]\n\n586\n00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.756\nThank you for watching

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:14.466\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network\nplus training series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.240\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boos.\n\n5\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.260\nIn the previous episode,\nwe were able to look at DHCP.\n\n6\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.320\nWe have a little bit more to cover in this\nepisode and hopefully we'll be able to\n\n7\n00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.000\nlook at additional services and\napplications but if not, no worries,\n\n8\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.235\nwe really wanna make sure that you get\nthorough understanding of these concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.045\nAnd to do that today,\nwe have Mister Wes Bryan in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:35.045 --> 00:00:36.385\nThank you for joining us Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:38.565\n&gt;&gt; I appreciate you guys having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:40.995\nYeah we might have to rename\nthe title application and\n\n13\n00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.695\nservice if I don't get past more than one.\n\n14\n00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.200\nBut well they are important services,\nshe's already mentioned it.\n\n15\n00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.330\nYou really need to know about these\nservices, and it doesn't matter if you're\n\n16\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.910\ntaking an exam or you're just maybe\ntrying to learn about networking,\n\n17\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.510\nor refresh for that matter, because\nthese services really are important.\n\n18\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.180\nAnd one of the first things that we talked\nabout I should say in the first episode\n\n19\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.030\nis we talked about DHTP.\n\n20\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.530\nWe mentioned things like static\nversus dynamic IP addresses\n\n21\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310\nwe talked about scopes we\nalso talked about leases.\n\n22\n00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.720\nRemember, when I get an IP address from\na DATP server, it does have a validity\n\n23\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.370\nperiod about 50% through that\nvalidity period my computer\n\n24\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.570\nis going to try to reach back out to\nthe DHCP server and renew that lease.\n\n25\n00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.240\nIf it doesn't, at about 75% of the total\n\n26\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.340\nduration of that lease, if it can't\ncontact the original DHCP server,\n\n27\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.780\nit kind of loses faith that that DHCP\nserver should be on your network anymore.\n\n28\n00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.120\nMaybe, it took a vacation.\n\n29\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Hey, it made an attempt, right?\n\n30\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.780\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nSo\n\n31\n00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.940\nwhat it does is it starts to broadcast\nagain and it says, well I'm going to try\n\n32\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.230\nto contact another DHCP server because I\nneed to maintain that work connectivity.\n\n33\n00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.710\nHow long the leases are set up for\nis really dependent on your environment?\n\n34\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.270\nRemember, typically things like mobile\ndevices are going to have a lower lease\n\n35\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.910\nvalidity period because, let's face it,\nthey're on your network for 15 minutes.\n\n36\n00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.270\nCherokee mentioned,\nin the first part of this,\n\n37\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.940\nhow long does it take you really drink\na cup of coffee at a hotspot, right?\n\n38\n00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.430\nWell if I am at a hotspot, let's say they\nwere doing DHCP, which they probably are.\n\n39\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.420\nI walk off their network.\n\n40\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.700\nI've been on it for 15 minutes but\n\n41\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.100\nnow I've got one of their IP addresses for\na week.\n\n42\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.430\nYou multiply that times 100 and\n\n43\n00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.810\nyou can't really figure out why people\naren't connecting to your hotspot anymore.\n\n44\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.300\nSo you can see that you could\nrun into problems there.\n\n45\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.040\nWe talked a little about options.\n\n46\n00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.650\nRemember, these are additional\nconfiguration Parameters that we can\n\n47\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.050\nassign to machines that\nare relying on our DHCP server.\n\n48\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.150\nAll right, so we in the first part we\nshowed you how to get your DHCP set up and\n\n49\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.960\nconfigured but\nthat was on the server side.\n\n50\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.000\nRemember?\nOne of the big things that I probably\n\n51\n00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.770\nshould have started with this whole\nthing with networking applications and\n\n52\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.270\nservices is this is a client server\nprotocol, and, well, unfortunately,\n\n53\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.260\nwe've only seen the server side.\n\n54\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.140\nSo how about we do this, we'll go ahead,\nwe know our scope is active.\n\n55\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.090\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna jump into our client here.\n\n56\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.550\nAnd we'll go ahead and,\nmy client's somewhere, there we go.\n\n57\n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.850\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n58\n00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.890\nAnd if you remember if I'm\ndoing an ipconfig /all,\n\n59\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.970\nyou might see that in\nthe first part of this episode\n\n60\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.590\nwe did a static configuration right here.\n\n61\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.200\nSo, you could see DHCP enabled, no, right?\n\n62\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.920\nYou might also see that there's\nleasing information that has been\n\n63\n00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.780\ncompletely eliminated.\n\n64\n00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.885\nIt's not leasing, right?\n\n65\n00:03:29.885 --> 00:03:34.720\nIt's static IP addresses don't go away\nwhich, in certain instances like servers\n\n66\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.180\nand network devices and printers, we\ndon't want those IP address is changing.\n\n67\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.860\nSo, we actually have to\nget this machine prepared.\n\n68\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.530\nNow, there's a couple of\ndifferent ways that I can do this.\n\n69\n00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.440\nIf I do it from the graphical\nuser interface,\n\n70\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.810\nmy head's kind of covering it up here.\n\n71\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.390\nDown here in the bottom,\nlet me go and kinda zoom in.\n\n72\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.340\nI know that it's kinda hard to see there.\n\n73\n00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.945\nThere's this open network and\nsharing center, right?\n\n74\n00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:02.090\nAnd that takes us to imagine this,\nbig surprise there, well the network and\n\n75\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.270\nsharing center.\n\n76\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.440\nGood thing they labeled it right.\n\n77\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.780\nAnd then we're gonna go to\nchange adapter settings.\n\n78\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.730\nYou seen this in the first one but I kinda\njust breeze it right by really quick so\n\n79\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.540\nit won't take a second here.\n\n80\n00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.450\nShow you what we're doing.\n\n81\n00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.920\nIf I right click on here, I could show\nStatus, right and if I see the Status here\n\n82\n00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.410\nI can then turn around and I can choose\non our Status option dialogue box.\n\n83\n00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.910\nI can choose Details and\nI can see DHCP is not enabled.\n\n84\n00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.950\nSo that now we know right away\nthat this is static assignment,\n\n85\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.250\nnot dynamically assigned.\n\n86\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.680\nRight?\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol\n\n87\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.030\nand it says no.\n\n88\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.720\nAll right, so if I wanted a changes\nI can close this down and\n\n89\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.150\nI can choose Properties.\n\n90\n00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.450\nWhen I choose the properties option, this\ngives me the ability to launch the IPB,\n\n91\n00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.050\nforward protocol properties, and\nnow here is my scenic assessment.\n\n92\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.160\nAnd I could, just switch these over.\n\n93\n00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.870\nRight, obtain an IP address automatically,\nand that would do exactly what I want.\n\n94\n00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.830\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and then I thing\nI'm gonna make up an IP address here.\n\n95\n00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.260\nIt's not gonna connect to the network but\nI do wanna show you that you can do this\n\n96\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.360\nfrom, switch this up here,\nthe command prompt as well.\n\n97\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.110\nI'm not gonna worry about DNS server and\nwe certainly don't expect to get any\n\n98\n00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.520\nnetwork connection, and I can also drop\ndown to the command line if I want.\n\n99\n00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.300\nRemember, that if you need find out the IP\naddressing Information on your machine,\n\n100\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.800\nyou use pconfig and you can use\npconfig /all in a Windows environment.\n\n101\n00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.240\nYou can use ifconfig, like for\ninstance if I jump down to my Mac here.\n\n102\n00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.140\nAnd I open a terminal on my Mac.\n\n103\n00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.190\nAnd I decided to do an ifconfig, right?\n\n104\n00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.700\nI could do an ifconfig here.\n\n105\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.560\nAnd, boy,\nwe get a lot of information there.\n\n106\n00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.030\nAnd I can see with my EN 4 interface\nI can see what my IP address is,\n\n107\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.590\nwe can make that a little bit easier and I\ncan actually just type that up to grip and\n\n108\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.540\ndo an IN just in general and it will give\nme a little bit less information to look\n\n109\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.160\nat and I can actually see\nthe information that I want there.\n\n110\n00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.370\nAll right, so we can do this,\nthat's in your Mac system if you will.\n\n111\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.410\nYou could also do it in Lenox.\n\n112\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.160\nKeep in mind that you also\nhave IP space addr and\n\n113\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.510\nthen space Show if your\nare running your Lenox machines,\n\n114\n00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.779\nbut we're in Windows here so\nagain we're going to do an IP config.\n\n115\n00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.700\nAnd when I run this again, keep in mind,\nyou'll see what we just set this up as.\n\n116\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.350\nBut I wanna set this up as dynamics.\n\n117\n00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.836\nSo, if I am in the command prompt and\n\n118\n00:06:32.836 --> 00:06:37.496\nI decide to set this up\nfrom the command prompt.\n\n119\n00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:43.965\nWe can do a netsh, make sure I spell\nall this right, interface ipv4.\n\n120\n00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:48.939\nWe could do a set Address and\nthen I have to name it and\n\n121\n00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:54.264\nthat name let's see name equals and\nthis is ethernet,\n\n122\n00:06:54.264 --> 00:07:00.070\nwhat is that 0 and then And\nwe'll do source equals dhcp.\n\n123\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.660\nAnd you have to run this from\nan administrative command prompt.\n\n124\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.590\nProbably should have let you know that.\n\n125\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.300\nYou have to elevate your command\nprompt in order to run these Commands.\n\n126\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.910\nWe'll do a control,\n\n127\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.510\nshift, enter, there we go,\nthat'll make it a little bit easier there.\n\n128\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.690\nAnd we'll rerun that command.\n\n129\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.970\nLet's give ourselves a little bit\nmore real estate there on the screen,\n\n130\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.390\nand we'll run our netsh interface ipb4 and\n\n131\n00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.210\nthis is set Address.\n\n132\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.980\nI don't think I had that right last\ntime which is kind of good I didn't have\n\n133\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.770\nthe elevated command prompt open.\n\n134\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.640\nSo it's name, equals, ethernet 0 if\nI remember that interfaces name.\n\n135\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.530\nAgain, the interface will change.\n\n136\n00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.970\nThe name, I should say, will change\nas far as the command itself it will\n\n137\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.320\nstay the same and\nI believe source equals DHCP.\n\n138\n00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.691\nLet me just kind of Run back through that,\nso I'm saying the interface is ipv4,\n\n139\n00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:59.022\nwe wanna set the address, we named\nthe adapter, and then we say source=dhcp.\n\n140\n00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:05.168\nWe run it and I got absolutely nothing,\nback, well, that's not a bad thing.\n\n141\n00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:08.104\nIt's sometimes in your\ncommand line interfaces.\n\n142\n00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:09.560\nIf you get an okay, it's even better, but\n\n143\n00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.959\na lot times that just happens with\nthings like the firewall and stuff.\n\n144\n00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:15.937\nBut hopefully if we do an IP config here,\n\n145\n00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:21.390\nwe're gonna find out,\nI've got an IP address.\n\n146\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.603\nAnd I see the default gateway,\nthe subnet mask,\n\n147\n00:08:24.603 --> 00:08:29.325\nthat 24 bit, in this case, 255.255.255.0.\n\n148\n00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:29.830\nRight?\n\n149\n00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.030\nI can also see the IP address,\nthat's actually the very first\n\n150\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.020\nIP address in that range and\nthe scope that we applied.\n\n151\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.190\nI can see, now, this is something\nthat I get to show you here.\n\n152\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.820\nRemember, one of the things\nthey called out was a suffix.\n\n153\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.010\nI told you this is a connection-specific\nDNS suffix, all right?\n\n154\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.960\nWe're gonna get into\nDNS here in just a bit.\n\n155\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.160\nAnd that just means that when\nthey look for this machine,\n\n156\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.750\nmy machine in fact, go ahead and\nmake this a little bit easier here.\n\n157\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.780\nIf I type just host name,\nI could find that out.\n\n158\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.660\nSo host name, spelled with an e, helps.\n\n159\n00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.590\nI can see that it's Client01.\n\n160\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:09.220\nAll right, so what is\nthe Connection-specific DNS Suffix do?\n\n161\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.750\nIt means that if you're gonna look for\n\n162\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.770\nthis computer, you type Client01\nif you're on the network.\n\n163\n00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:22.560\nAnd it says you must mean the computer\nthat is in the demo.itpro.tv domain.\n\n164\n00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.250\nSo it appends that to it and\n\n165\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.410\nnow we have what's known as\na fully qualified domain name.\n\n166\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.810\nWe're coming back to that\nbecause I promise you, Cherokee,\n\n167\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.093\nthere are gonna be more than just one\nservice, we'll get to two at least.\n\n168\n00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:33.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No rush, take your time.\n\n169\n00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.090\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nin this episode, so here we go.\n\n170\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.000\nAll right, so I've got an IP address.\n\n171\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.950\nNow that's what happens, right?\n\n172\n00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.570\nI did an ipconfig, let's say for instance\nI get rid of the IP address, right?\n\n173\n00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.100\nYou can do that too.\n\n174\n00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.365\nI say, ipconfig /release.\n\n175\n00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:51.991\nAll right,\nnotice what it tells me it says,\n\n176\n00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:55.760\nman that media is disconnected, right?\n\n177\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.270\nAnd if I rerun my ipconfig,\nI don't have an IP address, all right?\n\n178\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.130\nSo if I want to start\nthe door process over,\n\n179\n00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.760\nI gotta couple of ways that I can do this.\n\n180\n00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.090\nI can restart the network adapter,\ndisable it, enable it,\n\n181\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.840\nstarts the door process over.\n\n182\n00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.139\nTries to obtain me an IP address.\n\n183\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.160\nEasiest way?\n\n184\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.480\nYeah, reboot the machine,\nit does the same thing.\n\n185\n00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.260\nOr I can force it here to redo the door\nprocess by running the ipconfig /renew.\n\n186\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.680\n&gt;&gt; Good tip, Wes, because you know\nsometimes if you're working with\n\n187\n00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.400\na customer remotely, you don't want to\nhave to walk them through this process\n\n188\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.710\nonce you lose that connection if you're\njust talking to them on the phone.\n\n189\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.800\nSo you just say, hey,\nhit the reboot button.\n\n190\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.630\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you that that works and let\nme tell you where it got me in trouble.\n\n191\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.320\n[LAUGH] It's funny that you mention\nthat I got a story for that one.\n\n192\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.680\nIf your phone connection\nis over voice over IP, and\n\n193\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.749\nthe voice over IP system is connected\nto the PC Don't tell them to reboot.\n\n194\n00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:49.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I see where that's going, yeah.\n\n195\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:56.110\n&gt;&gt; I told them okay, just go ahead and\ntype in IP Config /release and\n\n196\n00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.185\nhe goes, okay, IP config /release.\n\n197\n00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:04.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Luckily he was smart enough to know\n\n198\n00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.636\nhe restarted the machine and\ncalled me back.\n\n199\n00:11:05.636 --> 00:11:06.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you only need to make that\n\n200\n00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.660\nmistake one time though.\n\n201\n00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n\n202\n00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.110\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n203\n00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.590\nWell hopefully, if not,\nshame on me if it happens the second time.\n\n204\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.890\nSo, we could see that it works here.\n\n205\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.480\nIf I decide, and\nI wanna ping my domain controller.\n\n206\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.320\nLet's verify connectivity, right?\n\n207\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.440\nWe don't wanna just assume.\n\n208\n00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:26.709\nAnd you know what, I know the ICMP\nis turned off on that machine.\n\n209\n00:11:26.709 --> 00:11:27.857\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe were playing around earlier.\n\n210\n00:11:27.857 --> 00:11:28.382\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n211\n00:11:28.382 --> 00:11:31.080\nAnd let me just double check,\nmake sure my scope is right.\n\n212\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.280\nAll right, we'll do 150.\n\n213\n00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.075\nAnd I know I can, I know I can\ncommunicate with that server, why?\n\n214\n00:11:38.075 --> 00:11:42.035\nThat's my DHCP server and if I can't\ncommunicate with it something's wrong.\n\n215\n00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:43.715\nNow we can say that the client itself.\n\n216\n00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:44.525\nLet me get out of here.\n\n217\n00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:45.985\nSorry guys.\n\n218\n00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.880\nThe client itself is\ncommunicating with a DHCP server.\n\n219\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.660\nLet's go ahead and\nsee what it looks like on the server side.\n\n220\n00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.560\nSo we'll get logged into our machine here.\n\n221\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.910\nAnd before,\nI didn't have any address leases.\n\n222\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.870\nIf you guys remember earlier, I clicked\non this but now if I click on this and,\n\n223\n00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.870\nhere's something you got to remember about\nmanagement consoles inside of windows.\n\n224\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.400\nThey never refresh.\n\n225\n00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.858\nSo I can almost bet if I go up to action\nand I choose refresh, sure enough.\n\n226\n00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:14.840\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n227\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.860\n&gt;&gt; There's my lease.\n\n228\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.890\nAnd I can even see, remember\nthe connection specific suffix I told you?\n\n229\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.000\nWhen I said,\nyou mean Client01.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n230\n00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.980\nWell, it puts it right here.\n\n231\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.660\nNow how about this?\n\n232\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.760\nHow about if I want\na device to come online and\n\n233\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.281\nwhen it comes online I wanna make sure it\nalways has the same IP address, right?\n\n234\n00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.420\nWhat could I do?\n\n235\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.960\nWalk over to it and\nI can statically map it.\n\n236\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.160\nYeah, you can do that.\n\n237\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.860\nWhat if you've got 100 printers?\n\n238\n00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.410\nYou don't wanna do sneaker net like\nCherokee mentioned in the first part.\n\n239\n00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.430\nWe don't wanna walk to 100\ndifferent printers and\n\n240\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.830\nmanually set their IP addresses.\n\n241\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.280\nSo what we can do is we can make sure that\nthe device connects to the network and\n\n242\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.804\nalways receives the same IP address after\nit requests it through a reservation.\n\n243\n00:12:58.804 --> 00:13:00.863\nNow reservations,\nyou gotta do a couple of things.\n\n244\n00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:03.090\nLet's go ahead,\nlet's show you to set up a reservation.\n\n245\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.460\nIn fact we'll switch back\nover to our client here.\n\n246\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.930\nAnd, I'm not in PowerShell here so\nthat doesn't work or bash.\n\n247\n00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.410\nAll right CLS, let's go ahead and what\nwe'll do is we'll do an ipconfig /all.\n\n248\n00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.820\nI could have done this another way too.\n\n249\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.020\nI could've done a get MAC and\n\n250\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.968\nthat would've done the same\nthing that I'm about to do here.\n\n251\n00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:26.030\nBut ipconfig /all is really one of the\nones that you should know for the test.\n\n252\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.300\nAnd by the way do you guys can see that\nlease there we didn't see earlier when\n\n253\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.720\nit was statically assigned?\n\n254\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.180\nBut what I really want and\nif I scroll up is the MAC address.\n\n255\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.020\nPhysical addresses,\n\n256\n00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.995\nMAC addresses, these are what are required\nif you're gonna do a DHCP reservation.\n\n257\n00:13:41.995 --> 00:13:45.180\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n258\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.580\nOver here in my reservations, I'm gonna\ngo ahead and I'm gonna create a new one.\n\n259\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.550\nYou could see that there\naren't any reservations yet.\n\n260\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.790\nBut my reservation name,\nI'm gonna call this printer.\n\n261\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.330\nWe know it's a Windows 10 client.\n\n262\n00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.160\nBut I'm gonna call it printer just to keep\nit consistent with what we've been saying,\n\n263\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.570\nwhy would we even do this.\n\n264\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:07.078\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and say, you know\nwhat, I like the number to be 222.\n\n265\n00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:08.790\nI can remember that's my printer.\n\n266\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.130\nDial in to it if you need to.\n\n267\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.070\nNot dial in to it but\nbrowse to it but 222.\n\n268\n00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.060\nAll right and now I'm gonna paste\nthe Macaddress to that machine and\n\n269\n00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.960\nI could say a description.\n\n270\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.480\nI could say, for instance, this is a,\nI don't know what a J net is, but\n\n271\n00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.100\na network printer typos.\n\n272\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.905\nAnd I'm gonna support both DHCP or\n\n273\n00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:29.910\nit's earlier predecessor\nthe bootstrapping protocol, BOOTP.\n\n274\n00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.800\nAnd we'll choose add and\nwe'll add it, all right?\n\n275\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.970\nThere we go.\n\n276\n00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.540\nSo now I have a machine that should,\nbased on its Mac address,\n\n277\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.930\nthe next time it connects,\nshould receive this IP address, all right?\n\n278\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.000\nWell, let's go ahead and\n\n279\n00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.620\nlet's switch over to our client,\nsee if we can get this in gear.\n\n280\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.660\nAll right, so used to using\nPowerShell that I keep typing clear.\n\n281\n00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.010\n&gt;&gt; You know, it's really like you have\ndifferent languages that you do know.\n\n282\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.460\nIt's kind of crazy working with all\nthese different operating systems.\n\n283\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.054\n&gt;&gt; It really is and I-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n284\n00:15:00.054 --> 00:15:01.320\n&gt;&gt; I tell people all the time I usually\n\n285\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.820\nlaunch up PowerShell because I can run\ncommand prompt inside of PowerShell.\n\n286\n00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.260\nI didn't do that this time and\nshame on me [LAUGH].\n\n287\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:15.760\nSo let's go ahead and let's see,\nIP config, space /all, right?\n\n288\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.700\nWe still have a lease present, right?\n\n289\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.740\nLet's go ahead and let's delete the lease.\n\n290\n00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.630\nLet's be mean to our client here.\n\n291\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:32.210\nLet's go up to that address lease,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.340\nAnd notice that I've got still Client 01.\n\n293\n00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.390\nI'm gonna right click, I'm gonna\nchoose delete, and I'm gonna say sure.\n\n294\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.960\nNow, that means I shouldn't\nhave an IP address, right?\n\n295\n00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.600\nLet's find out.\n\n296\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.395\nLet's do an IP config /all.\n\n297\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.500\nAnd I still have an address.\n\n298\n00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.220\nRemember the lease?\n\n299\n00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.547\nJust because I deleted\nthe lease inside of the server,\n\n300\n00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:58.544\nthis computer isn't communicating\nwith the server, it has no clue.\n\n301\n00:15:58.544 --> 00:16:01.756\nSo it's gonna keep this IP address\nuntil that lease runs out.\n\n302\n00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:03.153\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n303\n00:16:03.153 --> 00:16:06.266\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna force it to give that up.\n\n304\n00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:09.775\nAll right, we'll say, that's it, give it\nup, go on the wagon, or off the wagon, or\n\n305\n00:16:09.775 --> 00:16:11.410\nwhichever one that might be.\n\n306\n00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.620\nAnd we're gonna say, release.\n\n307\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.441\nAll right, you could see,\njust like we had before, and\n\n308\n00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:20.786\nwe don't have any information here, but\nnow we're gonna change that to a renew.\n\n309\n00:16:20.786 --> 00:16:25.310\nAnd we'll wait here a second, and\nit's gonna do that DORA process,\n\n310\n00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.440\nit's gonna call out.\n\n311\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.060\nBut it's interesting,\nthis time the author, when it comes out,\n\n312\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:36.840\nit's gonna look, that server is going\nto look and it's gonna say I see\n\n313\n00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.730\nyour Mac address, I can see that there in\nthe little packet that I'm interpreting.\n\n314\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.542\nI can look at my file here and says, hey\nman, just kinda like dinner reservations,\n\n315\n00:16:47.542 --> 00:16:51.025\nI already got an IP address here sitting\nfor you reserved, waiting for you,\n\n316\n00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:51.580\nall right?\n\n317\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.270\nNow, I don't know if it's\nactually kicked in yet.\n\n318\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.930\nSo let's go ahead and do a refresh.\n\n319\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.130\nAnd sure enough, I can tell you that\nit's got an active reservation.\n\n320\n00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.651\nAnd if we switch back\nover to our client here.\n\n321\n00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:08.380\nThird time's a charm now I actually got\nthe clear screen right that time [LAUGH].\n\n322\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.430\nI rerun.\n\n323\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.239\n&gt;&gt; I wish they would all just\nagree on something instead of\n\n324\n00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:12.667\nhaving their own little idiosyncrasies.\n\n325\n00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:14.966\n&gt;&gt; Agree to disagree, that's right.\n\n326\n00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:18.943\nWe'll run our ipconfig/all and\nI want you to notice,\n\n327\n00:17:18.943 --> 00:17:21.990\nI still have all those scope options.\n\n328\n00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.610\nI have a DHCP server,\nI have a DNS server, right?\n\n329\n00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.430\nI have my Subnet Mask.\n\n330\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.070\nBut now I've got an IP address that\nmatches the reservation that we've set up.\n\n331\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.800\nAnd that's the benefit of the reservation,\n\n332\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.730\nthe reservation says any time you\ncome online you can ask me for\n\n333\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.660\nan IP address, I'm gonna give\nyou the same one every time.\n\n334\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.390\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.300\nAnd let's see here, Cherokee.\n\n336\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.140\nI think there's one thing that I forgot,\nand\n\n337\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.180\nI really don't have a demonstration or\nreally even a diagram for this one.\n\n338\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.230\nSo I just want you guys to keep in mind,\nin fact, let me go ahead and,\n\n339\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:59.220\nlet me see if I can bring back\nthat DHCP DORA process here\n\n340\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.300\nif it's not gonna be too\nmuch of a trouble here.\n\n341\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.110\n&gt;&gt; I think I know where you're going.\n\n342\n00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.240\nYou're gonna explain a caveat here.\n\n343\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah.\n\n344\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Gotta love those caveats, right?\n\n345\n00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWe're gonna throw this one in here\n\n346\n00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:12.780\nright at the end.\n\n347\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.308\nAnd this is what I get for trying to open\nstuff and not having it ready to go.\n\n348\n00:18:18.308 --> 00:18:19.260\nThere's the DORA process,\n\n349\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.330\nand I just wanna make a mention of this so\nbear with me here guys.\n\n350\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:31.000\nAll right, and the next concept is what is\nknown as an IP, they call it an IP Helper.\n\n351\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Cisco does.\n\n352\n00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's also called an IP,\nso we'll put IP Helper.\n\n353\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.860\nIt's also called an IP relay agent,\nall right?\n\n354\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.010\nSo I'm just going to\nput relay here as well.\n\n355\n00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.450\nSo relay agent, all right?\n\n356\n00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.030\nWhat is this used for?\n\n357\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:51.120\nWell, it all stems from this very\nfirst process here, this discovery.\n\n358\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.840\nAll right?\nSo,\n\n359\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.180\nwhen your computer first comes online\nit doesn't have an IP address, okay?\n\n360\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.470\nIt doesn't know what the network is.\n\n361\n00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.180\nAnd even more so, it doesn't know the what\nbroadcast address is for the network.\n\n362\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.220\nSo I if don't know\nthe broadcast address is,\n\n363\n00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.130\nI can't send broadcast communication,\nso what are we doing?\n\n364\n00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.640\nThere is a little address that\nnot really talk too much about,\n\n365\n00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.690\nin the lower levels of networking and\nthat's the all 255 address, right?\n\n366\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.180\nThey call it, technically,\nthe internet working broadcast address.\n\n367\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.210\nI want you to think of it as\na broadcast address when I don't\n\n368\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.310\nknow what the broadcast address is.\n\n369\n00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.040\nIt means, I don't have an IP address so I\ncan't send it to the broadcast address on\n\n370\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.100\nthat network so\nI just send it to everybody.\n\n371\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.940\n&gt;&gt; Kind of generic?\n\n372\n00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.980\n&gt;&gt; Very, very generic, good way to put it.\n\n373\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.650\nSo the DHCP server's listening.\n\n374\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.870\nBut the important part\nis it's a broadcast.\n\n375\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.770\nAnd if it is a broadcast,\n\n376\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:49.070\nthen what that means is that if I end up\nhaving a couple of subnets here, right?\n\n377\n00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.670\nAnd I have a router in between those\nsubnets, guess what's not gonna happen?\n\n378\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.880\nThe discovery packet isn't gonna\ntraverse this router's interface.\n\n379\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.310\nIt isn't gonna go from this\nnetwork to this network.\n\n380\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.040\nSo that's where the IP helper or\nthe IP relay agent comes in.\n\n381\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.740\nIt says okay, so\n\n382\n00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.860\non this side of this network where\nthe discovery packet happened.\n\n383\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.505\nI put in a IP helper or\na DHCP relay agent.\n\n384\n00:20:14.505 --> 00:20:18.955\nIt hears that broadcast communication,\nit recognizes it as a discovery packet.\n\n385\n00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:22.845\nIt grabs it as part of\nthe broadcast communication.\n\n386\n00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:27.855\nIt encapsulates it in a Unicash\ntransmission, and it forwards it across\n\n387\n00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:32.595\nthe subnet directly to the DHCP server\nwho can then finish the DORA Process.\n\n388\n00:20:32.595 --> 00:20:37.330\nNow that the first portion of the process\nhas been directed directly to it.\n\n389\n00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.550\nOr I should say, sent directly to it.\n\n390\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:46.880\nSo the IP Helper, that is important in\nmaking sure that if you have a DHCP server\n\n391\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.026\non one subnet, that it can also service\nIP address requests on another subnet.\n\n392\n00:20:53.026 --> 00:20:55.620\nSo it is an important thing to have and\ndefinitely,\n\n393\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.430\nif you don't have a DHCP\nserver on that network.\n\n394\n00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.390\nAll right, so that really kinda\nconcludes what we are talking\n\n395\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.900\nabout when it comes to DHCP.\n\n396\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.870\nI know I kinda brought that slide\nup there at the end on the fly.\n\n397\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.020\nThe next thing that we have to talk\nabout is something known as DNS.\n\n398\n00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.800\nAnd you know, there is one other thing.\n\n399\n00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.330\nI'm like Columbo here,\njust one more thing, Ma'am.\n\n400\n00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.510\nI do want to talk about\nanother one that is mentioned.\n\n401\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.110\nI believe it's in the list here.\n\n402\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.570\nWell, if it's not it should be.\n\n403\n00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.900\nAnd that's called,\nlet's double-check my notes here.\n\n404\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.070\nNo, it's not, but like I said,\nit should be, and that's called APIPA.\n\n405\n00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.090\nWhat's APIPA about?\n\n406\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:38.000\nThat's the Automatic Private IP Addressing\nsystem, or address sometimes, for short.\n\n407\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000\nAPIPA is a Microsoft standard that\nessentially says that if I can't\n\n408\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.430\ncommunicate with a DHCP server and\nI still need an IP address, what do I do?\n\n409\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:50.840\nWe'll if you didn't have APIPA\nyou would do absolutely nothing.\n\n410\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.340\nBut what it does is it falls back on\na self-zero config, zero configuration\n\n411\n00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.100\ntechnology that says, I can't talk to the\nDHCP server, I still need to talk locally,\n\n412\n00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.783\nI'll automatically assign my IP\naddress at a 169.254.anything.\n\n413\n00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.040\nanything address.\n\n414\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.450\nThe last two octets are self generated\nby your computer at the time.\n\n415\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:15.980\nNow, on the exam understand what\nthe Automatic Private IP Address is for.\n\n416\n00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.150\nI can't communicate with the DHCP server,\nI still need to know IP address so\n\n417\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:24.710\nI fall back on this IP address that\nrestricts me to the communication with\n\n418\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.060\nother computers that also\nhave APIPA addresses.\n\n419\n00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.350\nIt's kind of like that last resort.\n\n420\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.200\nYou really don't want to rely on this.\n\n421\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.680\nWhat happens when the DHCP\nserver comes online?\n\n422\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.640\nWell even though you have an APIPA\naddress, you still have the DHCP decline.\n\n423\n00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.120\nIt says I haven't gone anywhere and\nit's in the background.\n\n424\n00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.640\nIt says yeah you got an APIPA address,\nyeah you got an APIPA address.\n\n425\n00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.600\nSay DHCP, nope, not talking.\n\n426\n00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.740\nYeah you got an APIPA address,\nyeah you got an APIPA address.\n\n427\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.870\nHey DHCP, and the DHCP server responds.\n\n428\n00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.990\nIt says, discard the APIPA and\nlet's go through the DORA process,\n\n429\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.490\ncuz I need your IP address to\nactually do some communication.\n\n430\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.440\nSo know what the APIPA is.\n\n431\n00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.490\nThat brings us to the end of DHCP.\n\n432\n00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.520\nThere's a lot more.\n\n433\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.560\nIn fact, Cherokee was mentioning\nbefore we even started.\n\n434\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.320\nShe can ramble on and\n\n435\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.330\nteach a week on just this topic alone and\nmaybe still have more concepts to go.\n\n436\n00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.950\nUnderstand some of the basic concepts\nthat we're showing you here.\n\n437\n00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.770\nNow the next thing that we have to talk\nabout is we have to talk about a concept\n\n438\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.260\nknown as DNS.\n\n439\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.180\nDNS is a very important concept,\nand what this service provides,\n\n440\n00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.670\nlet's start with the acronym.\n\n441\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.530\nThe acronym starts with something\nknown as the Domain Name System.\n\n442\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.300\nAll right, the Domain Name System.\n\n443\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.720\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n444\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720\nI wanna say it goes back to,\nI wanna say like 83,\n\n445\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.500\n84 is when it first came into play.\n\n446\n00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:45.060\nNow think about this, if you wanna visit\na website, you know its IP address?\n\n447\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.575\nRight, that four octet dotted\ndecimal address, 192.168.1.10?\n\n448\n00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:52.547\nDo you know it or not?\n\n449\n00:23:52.547 --> 00:23:55.870\nWell if you don't know it,\nyou can't communicate with the website.\n\n450\n00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.870\n&gt;&gt; I don't go around\nmemorizing IP addresses.\n\n451\n00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:58.460\n&gt;&gt; You don't, do you?\n\n452\n00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:58.990\nThat's right.\n\n453\n00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.480\nSo what are we doing here?\n\n454\n00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.374\nThat's crazy talk, right?\n\n455\n00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:07.128\nI'm gonna memorize every single IP address\nto every website and every computer I need\n\n456\n00:24:07.128 --> 00:24:11.435\nto talk to out there across the network\nand the web That's where DNS comes in.\n\n457\n00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:12.927\nThe domain name system.\n\n458\n00:24:12.927 --> 00:24:17.376\nAll right, the domain name system we\nhave to kind of understand works on what\n\n459\n00:24:17.376 --> 00:24:21.550\nare known as fully qualified domain names,\nall right.\n\n460\n00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.420\nEssentially DNS takes an FQDN a fully\nqualified domain name, a name,\n\n461\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:32.032\nsomething we can recognize like\nwww.google.com, www.comptia.org,\n\n462\n00:24:32.032 --> 00:24:36.979\nwww.microsoft.com maps them to\ntheir individual IP addresses.\n\n463\n00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.670\nNow why is that such an important\nservice on our network?\n\n464\n00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.150\nBecause then I don't have to\nremember hundreds of IP addresses.\n\n465\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.485\nI have a hard time\nmemorizing my anniversary.\n\n466\n00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:51.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let alone 10, 20, 30, 50 IP addresses,\n\n467\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.778\nhowever many.\n\n468\n00:24:52.778 --> 00:24:53.637\n&gt;&gt; I won't tell your wife.\n\n469\n00:24:53.637 --> 00:24:55.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, shh, don't tell my wife.\n\n470\n00:24:55.797 --> 00:24:58.020\nThat'll just be between me,\nyou, and the Internet.\n\n471\n00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.145\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n472\n00:24:59.145 --> 00:25:02.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe need a service there that can help us,\n\n473\n00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.400\nthat can make that a little bit easier and\nthat's where DNS comes into play.\n\n474\n00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.440\nIt means,\nwhen I type a name into a search engine,\n\n475\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.380\nI type a name into an address field in\na web browser, that in the background,\n\n476\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.940\nit goes through the process that\nwe'll look at here coming up.\n\n477\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.520\nAnd probably in the next episode,\nto resolve that name.\n\n478\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.810\n&gt;&gt; And connect the two,\nto map that name to the IP address so\n\n479\n00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.790\nthat the web browser\ndisplays your web site.\n\n480\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:30.560\nAnd you're none the wiser,\nyou didn't have to know the IP address.\n\n481\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.980\nBut before we go ahead and go into\na part three here, let me go ahead,\n\n482\n00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.650\nI tell you what, one last thing\nthat we'll put in this episode.\n\n483\n00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.730\nLet me show you what a FQDN is, so\nyou can kind of see what I mean.\n\n484\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.060\nCuz I'm throwing an an acronym\nout here at you and\n\n485\n00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.850\nI'm certainly not assuming\nthat you know what it is.\n\n486\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.150\nBut let's make some sense out\nof the alphabet soup here.\n\n487\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.260\nIf we look at my machine here,\n\n488\n00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.940\nI've got what's known as a fully\nqualified domain name, all right.\n\n489\n00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.390\nWhat is a fully qualified domain name,\nFQDN?\n\n490\n00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.440\nWell we have a host name right.\n\n491\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.080\nAnd in fact, if I switch over to my\nmachine and I bring up my, well I don't\n\n492\n00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.648\nwanna do a snapshot here, that's what\nyou get for trying to do shortcuts.\n\n493\n00:26:03.648 --> 00:26:11.180\nAll right, and I say, I, for\ninstance, I type host name, right.\n\n494\n00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.790\nI can see that the name is Client01.\n\n495\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.460\nAll right, but this is a single name.\n\n496\n00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.410\nHow many computers out there\nacross the world do you think\n\n497\n00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:21.830\nmaybe have a name Client01?\n\n498\n00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.440\nThere might be a lot, might be hundreds,\nmight be thousands, I don't know,\n\n499\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.650\ncould be one for all I know.\n\n500\n00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.780\nThis one right here.\n\n501\n00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.250\nBut we don't know.\n\n502\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.710\nSo I can't use this type of name,\nthis single name.\n\n503\n00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.165\nIt's called flat naming space, out there\non the Internet, cuz it's gotta be unique.\n\n504\n00:26:37.165 --> 00:26:41.975\nSo, the hostname alone doesn't represent\na fully qualified domain name, right,\n\n505\n00:26:41.975 --> 00:26:43.765\ncuz it's not specific enough, right.\n\n506\n00:26:43.765 --> 00:26:45.005\nIt's too vague.\n\n507\n00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:51.025\nSo, hostnames by themselves do us, really\nno justice in finding those locations.\n\n508\n00:26:51.025 --> 00:26:54.075\nIt's a combination of that and\nthe domain name.\n\n509\n00:26:54.075 --> 00:26:57.575\nIn this case, we've seen in Microsoft\nit was a connection-specific suffix,\n\n510\n00:26:57.575 --> 00:26:59.470\nDNS suffix, right.\n\n511\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.360\nThat's the domain name.\n\n512\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.790\nSo when we put this two together,\nright, we put hostname and\n\n513\n00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:11.179\nwe put the domain name together,\nwe get what's known as an FQDN.\n\n514\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.640\nWith the FQDN, that's what DNS is doing.\n\n515\n00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:20.680\nDNS is saying let's go ahead and\nlet's take that FQDN, that host name and\n\n516\n00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.340\ndomain name, and\nwe'll map it directly to an IP address.\n\n517\n00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.245\nSo now when I type in the web browser,\nI type in,\n\n518\n00:27:28.245 --> 00:27:33.329\nin this case I'm not gonna\ntype srv01.demo.itpro.tv,\n\n519\n00:27:33.329 --> 00:27:36.963\nbut if I was it would\nmap into its IP address.\n\n520\n00:27:36.963 --> 00:27:39.201\nWe have other things that\nwe're gonna talk about,\n\n521\n00:27:39.201 --> 00:27:42.427\nother kinds of records when it comes\nto DNS that makes it a little bit more,\n\n522\n00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:46.150\nnot so hard to remember, because then\nthat does get complicated as well.\n\n523\n00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.120\nBut judging by the time here,\n\n524\n00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.290\nI know Cherokee's off to the side here\nsaying, you need to wrap this one up.\n\n525\n00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.810\nSo Cherokee, that does look\nlike it's a good spot to stop,\n\n526\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.140\nwe'll probably have to\ngo into a part three.\n\n527\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.820\nYes Wes, thank you for taking the time\nto thoroughly explain DHCP and\n\n528\n00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.770\nintroduce us into DNS.\n\n529\n00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.480\nI do know there's a lot more to\ncover with DNS, so stay tuned.\n\n530\n00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.370\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nprovide that for you in the next series.\n\n531\n00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.310\nFor this episode, we'll call it a quits.\n\n532\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.620\nAnd remember,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n533\n00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.490\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n534\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.100\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n535\n00:28:22.502 --> 00:28:25.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n536\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.810\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching\n&gt;&gt;

You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.370\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.000\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.970\nAnd today you're watching\nthe CompTIA Network+ show.\n\n7\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.131\nWe're about to dive into the realm\nof installing and configuring DNS.\n\n8\n00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:29.030\nThis is a part two in our series here on\nnetworking services and applications.\n\n9\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.960\nAnd here to continue with us is Mr.\nWes Bryan himself.\n\n10\n00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.210\nWes, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.050\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, thanks for\nhaving me here, great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.060\nThat's right,\nI talked way too much in part one.\n\n13\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.820\nAnd apparently we only got through DHCP,\nand\n\n14\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.250\nthere are more services out there that\nwe need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.510\nHowever, keep in mind DHCP is important.\n\n16\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.540\nIf you're just joining us,\n\n17\n00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.430\ngo back and watch that episode on DHCP,\nit's how we get our IP addresses.\n\n18\n00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.210\nAnd remember,\nour IP addresses are important\n\n19\n00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.045\nbecause it's essentially what we need\nto communicate on a TCP/IP network.\n\n20\n00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.965\nHowever, I do want you to keep\nin mind how many possibilities,\n\n21\n00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:05.495\nwhen it comes to an IP address,\nthat we're really talking about, right?\n\n22\n00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.592\nWe're talking about into the billions\nof possible IP addresses.\n\n23\n00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:11.082\nAnd I want you to think.\n\n24\n00:01:11.082 --> 00:01:13.812\nHow do I talk to or find computers,\nlike, for instance,\n\n25\n00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:18.397\nwebsites out there across the Internet,\nif I want to visit them, right?\n\n26\n00:01:18.397 --> 00:01:20.232\nDo I visit them by their IP address?\n\n27\n00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:21.002\nI want you to think about it.\n\n28\n00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:25.437\nWhen's the last time you've typed\ninto your web browser something like\n\n29\n00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:29.342\n70.something.something.something just\nto get to Google, right?\n\n30\n00:01:29.342 --> 00:01:31.142\nYou don't, what do we use?\n\n31\n00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:35.260\nWell, we use another very important\nservice inside of the TCP/IP\n\n32\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.440\nprotocol stack called DNS,\nDomain Name System.\n\n33\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310\nAnd its sole function, its main goal,\n\n34\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.720\nis to take a user-friendly name, something\nthat we can remember a little bit easier.\n\n35\n00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.610\nAnd map it to something, well,\nthat we can't remember, right?\n\n36\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.150\nI would say, like my anniversary,\n\n37\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.020\nbut if my wife's watching that might\nget me into trouble there, Ronnie.\n\n38\n00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.710\nBut what we're talking about is\nmapping to those IP addresses.\n\n39\n00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.340\nNow when we say names, and\nwe say name resolution, I say mapping.\n\n40\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.910\nKeep in mind that term is used\ninterchangeably, name, resolving the name,\n\n41\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.540\nname resolution if you will,\nmapping a name to an IP address.\n\n42\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.210\nSo is it gonna be just any old name?\n\n43\n00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.960\nWell, no.\n\n44\n00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.866\nOne of the things that we have to do is we\nhave to make sure that the name that we\n\n45\n00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.170\nuse is unique across the Internet, right?\n\n46\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.000\nThat's one of the things that we have\nthese international standards bodies,\n\n47\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.460\nrights, things like ICANN, right.\n\n48\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.960\nMaking sure that IP addresses\nare unique across the world,\n\n49\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.630\nmaking things like domain names,\nthey have to be unique across the world.\n\n50\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.160\nSo we do have to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.570\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nthe name itself, all right.\n\n52\n00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.190\nI actually got a little diagram\nhere on my computer here.\n\n53\n00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.450\nIf we look at what makes up a domain name,\n\n54\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.980\nit is something known as a hostname,\nall right.\n\n55\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.720\nAnd then the domain name or, excuse me,\n\n56\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.190\nthe Fully Qualified Domain Name,\nlet me correct myself, the FQDN.\n\n57\n00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.280\nThat's what we use in order to resolve\nthose names to IP addresses with DNS.\n\n58\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.130\nNow it comes with two parts.\n\n59\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280\nIt comes with what's known as a hostname,\nand\n\n60\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.530\nit comes with what's\nknown as a domain name.\n\n61\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.720\nNow the hostname we have to be careful\ncuz the hostname by itself isn't\n\n62\n00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.530\nreally unique.\n\n63\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.430\nYou look at the one that I\nhave as an example here.\n\n64\n00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.065\nAnd you could see, yes,\nit's part of my FQDN.\n\n65\n00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:20.160\nBut by itself, srv01,\nthat isn't too unique.\n\n66\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.283\nIf you look at the possibilities of\nmillions of computers out there over\n\n67\n00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:29.522\nthe Internet, probably somebody else has\nthought about naming their computer srv01.\n\n68\n00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:34.195\nSo if I'm in my local network,\nmy LAN, can I use a hostname?\n\n69\n00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:36.750\nWell, yeah,\nI can use a hostname because for\n\n70\n00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.780\nthe most part my hostnames are gonna\nbe unique within my network.\n\n71\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.380\nBut they're unique to my network.\n\n72\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.714\nIf Ronnie's got a network that\nhe's supporting, let's say,\n\n73\n00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:49.804\nin Georgia somewhere, right, are my\nnames gonna be unique to their network?\n\n74\n00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:51.700\nMaybe, maybe not.\n\n75\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.680\nMost likely they won't, especially if you\nhave a naming convention that's close to\n\n76\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.416\nthe one I have,\nyou're gonna have some overlap.\n\n77\n00:03:56.416 --> 00:04:01.350\nSo while the hostname is good for\nresolving IP addresses,\n\n78\n00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.380\nfinding machines on our local network,\nit's not a scalable solution for\n\n79\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.500\nthe backbone of the World Wide Internet.\n\n80\n00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.234\nSo that's why DNS, we use a hierarchical\nname system, not just a single name,\n\n81\n00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:17.956\nbut multiple pieces of a name that\ncollectively make up the FQDN.\n\n82\n00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:22.700\nAnd again, that is not only the hostname,\nbut you can see it is the domain name.\n\n83\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.900\nNow, I want you to look\nat this structure here.\n\n84\n00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.590\nBecause one of the interesting\nthings is here,\n\n85\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.610\nthere's something that's\nkinda missing in this.\n\n86\n00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.730\nIf I was to write this down,\nlet's say srv01.demo.itpro.tv., all right.\n\n87\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.970\nIs that a fully qualified domain name?\n\n88\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.910\nYou might say, well,\nright up looking at it, Wes,\n\n89\n00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.270\nI don't put dots at the end of any time\nI type in something like www.google.com.\n\n90\n00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.740\nI don't put a dot after it so\nwhat is that?\n\n91\n00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.310\nWell, that's actually a portion of\nthe hierarchy that we don't see.\n\n92\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.058\nIt's kind of transparent\nsometimes to the end user and\n\n93\n00:04:56.058 --> 00:04:57.388\nthe end user never gets involved with it.\n\n94\n00:04:57.388 --> 00:04:59.557\nBut the browsers, your operating system,\n\n95\n00:04:59.557 --> 00:05:03.830\nin fact some systems actually will\nput it in there and you'll see it.\n\n96\n00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.770\nThey use that.\n\n97\n00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.300\nWhy?\n\n98\n00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.770\nBecause that's the starting point for\nname resolution, right.\n\n99\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.110\nRemember we said a hierarchical system?\n\n100\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.590\nWell, that dot represents\na part of that hierarchy.\n\n101\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.960\nLet's go ahead and\nlook a little bit about the hierarchy.\n\n102\n00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.390\nSo here's the starting point when\nit comes to name resolution.\n\n103\n00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.970\nAs we look at the hierarchy, I went ahead\nand I put the dot up there at the top.\n\n104\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.350\nWell, again what is that dot?\n\n105\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.990\nThat dot represents what's\nknown as a route hint server.\n\n106\n00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.680\nWhen we talk about route hint servers,\nthey represent the top\n\n107\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.640\nportion of this hierarchical tree system,\nif you will, that we call DNS.\n\n108\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.400\nNow what do the route hint servers do for\nus, all right?\n\n109\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.420\nWell, when I ask a question,\nI was gonna say make a query, but\n\n110\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.100\nunderstand that's asking a DNS\nserver a question, right.\n\n111\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.240\nI don't have an IP address,\nso what do I do?\n\n112\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.325\nWell I ask the DNS server, I say,\nwhere is something like www.microsoft.com?\n\n113\n00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:03.655\nAnd it really could be any IP\naddress that you're trying to look.\n\n114\n00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.027\nSo what is the IP address of so and so?\n\n115\n00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:11.487\nIn this case I use microsoft.com\nas the starting point here.\n\n116\n00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:13.967\nWell, what's gonna happen\nis my local DNS server,\n\n117\n00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:15.657\nwhat it's gonna do is it's gonna look.\n\n118\n00:06:15.657 --> 00:06:21.490\nAnd it's gonna say,\ninside of my database do I have an entry?\n\n119\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.157\nKind of like a little phone book.\n\n120\n00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:26.690\nDo I have an entry, if you will,\nfor www.microsoft.com?\n\n121\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.862\nWell, my DNS server,\nthey're not in control of Microsoft so\n\n122\n00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:31.210\nwhat are they going to do?\n\n123\n00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.470\nThey're gonna say nope,\nI don't have this information.\n\n124\n00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.423\nI'm not the authority,\nI don't own the Microsoft domain, so\n\n125\n00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:40.490\nI need to send you to somebody\nthat can help you out.\n\n126\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.410\nSo what happens?\n\n127\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.820\nWell, the first part we go up and\nwe ask the root.\n\n128\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.006\nSay, hey, root,\ndo you know where www.microsoft.com is?\n\n129\n00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:55.210\nWell the root, what it's in charge of are\nthese what are known as top-level domains.\n\n130\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.400\nIt's not really gonna resolve the name for\nme.\n\n131\n00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.265\nIt's gonna say,\nI don't know what Microsoft is.\n\n132\n00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:03.694\nHowever, judging by the question\nthat you're asking me,\n\n133\n00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:07.780\nthe www.microsoft.com,\nI do know who the .com is.\n\n134\n00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.380\nIn fact, I'm the authority over .com.\n\n135\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.780\nSo let me go ahead,\ntalking to the DNS server, and\n\n136\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.890\nsend you the IP address\nof .com's DNS server.\n\n137\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.620\nWell, that's the next part\nof the resolution process.\n\n138\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.170\nNotice we have, from right to left,\n\n139\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.670\nthe dot that's kind of hidden there we\ndon't see, we talk to the root first.\n\n140\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.200\nThe next thing that we're going to\ndo is we're going to turn around and\n\n141\n00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.699\nwe're going to talk to the .com server.\n\n142\n00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.894\nNow the .com server's interesting\nbecause it's gonna look at its database.\n\n143\n00:07:38.894 --> 00:07:43.420\nAnd it's going to say,\ndo I know where www.microsoft.com is?\n\n144\n00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.084\nAnd in this case, .com has entries in it\nfor second-level domains like Microsoft,\n\n145\n00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:49.783\nlike Facebook, like Google.\n\n146\n00:07:49.783 --> 00:07:51.077\nAnd it says, you know what?\n\n147\n00:07:51.077 --> 00:07:55.339\nI don't know this www that you speak\nof But I'm looking at my list, and\n\n148\n00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:58.167\nI do know who Microsoft is,\nso I tell you what?\n\n149\n00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:02.681\nLet me give you the IP address\nof Microsoft's DNS server and\n\n150\n00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.575\nsee if they can answer your question.\n\n151\n00:08:05.575 --> 00:08:09.383\nNow if you'll notice, we're getting\nback to our fully qualified domain name,\n\n152\n00:08:09.383 --> 00:08:11.567\nwe've result but\nnot really resolve the dot,\n\n153\n00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:15.543\nwe've talked to the highest part of the\nhierarchy, and now we've resolved .com,\n\n154\n00:08:15.543 --> 00:08:18.627\nwe've talked to .com and\nnow .com's pointing us to somebody.\n\n155\n00:08:18.627 --> 00:08:22.513\nWell that somebody just happens to\nbe Microsoft's DNS server, right?\n\n156\n00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:27.049\nAnd it's up to Microsoft to determine that\n\n157\n00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:31.841\nusing their DNS server,\ndo I know who www is?\n\n158\n00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:36.692\nWell, Microsoft is gonna look in their DNS\nserver, their records, their database,\n\n159\n00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:41.286\nand they're just gonna say, yeah, I do\nhave an entry for www, so what does it do?\n\n160\n00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:46.804\nIt returns that answer back to the DNS\nserver, the DNS server stores it locally,\n\n161\n00:08:46.804 --> 00:08:49.969\nwhich we'll talk about\ncoming up in a second,\n\n162\n00:08:49.969 --> 00:08:54.862\nstores it locally and then answers\nmy computer, now what did I notice?\n\n163\n00:08:54.862 --> 00:08:59.842\nDid I notice all of this hierarchical\ngame resolution going on?\n\n164\n00:08:59.842 --> 00:09:04.852\nNo, it's transparent, and\nwhat I mean by that is all I had to do was\n\n165\n00:09:04.852 --> 00:09:10.150\ntype www.mircrosoft.com, and\nI get name resolution, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:15.670\nSo let's go ahead and look at what\nthese second level domain are doing,\n\n167\n00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.547\neach one of them has their own DNS server,\nright?\n\n168\n00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:25.376\nSo if, for some reason, maybe we are going\nto Google, the process is the same,\n\n169\n00:09:25.376 --> 00:09:30.683\nmy DNS server, and actually the DNS\nclient within my operating system,\n\n170\n00:09:30.683 --> 00:09:33.641\ngenerates a question, sends it to the,\n\n171\n00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:37.994\nconfigure DNS server and\nsays where is www.google.com?\n\n172\n00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:42.051\nAnd the process goes again,\ntalk to the route, the route says,\n\n173\n00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:45.582\nI don't know who www is,\nI'm looking at my database and\n\n174\n00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:50.464\nI can see there's an entry for Google,\nso here, let me give you the IP address\n\n175\n00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:54.625\nof Google's DNS server, and\nthen your DNS server talks to them.\n\n176\n00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:59.511\nIt looks at its database, or file that\nit has on hand, and it says, okay,\n\n177\n00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:03.435\nand I haven't put it in here, but\nI do have a entry here for www,\n\n178\n00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:06.650\ngo talk to them, and\nthen finally, what happens?\n\n179\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.130\nWell, you hopefully,\nthat's the end of it and\n\n180\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.098\ntheir web server is running correctly and\nyou get a Google search engine, or\n\n181\n00:10:13.098 --> 00:10:16.954\nsome other Google website, so\nthat's a little bit about the hierarchy.\n\n182\n00:10:16.954 --> 00:10:24.450\nNow, let's go ahead and we'll do a little\nbit of a demonstration on what's going on.\n\n183\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.960\nAll right, so let's go and\nwhat we're gonna do, I'll tell you what,\n\n184\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.490\nwe'll do this from,\nwhere do I wanna do this from?\n\n185\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.965\nI'll do it from terminal here on the map,\nso if want to find, if I want to see\n\n186\n00:10:34.965 --> 00:10:39.390\nthe name resolution in action,\nthere's a couple of things that I can do.\n\n187\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.448\nIf you're in a Windows system, you can\nuse something known as NS Lookup, and\n\n188\n00:10:42.448 --> 00:10:45.755\nwe'll show you that as well, it's in here\ntoo, but you also have things like dig.\n\n189\n00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:49.914\nSo, for instance, I could do, which is the\ndomain internet groper, I don't know where\n\n190\n00:10:49.914 --> 00:10:53.239\nthey come up with these names, but\nit's gonna ask a DNS a question, and\n\n191\n00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.970\nit's gonna see if it can resolve the name\nfor me, so let's see if it can do that.\n\n192\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:04.004\nI'm gonna go ahead a dig www.google.com,\nand let's see if it gives me an answer.\n\n193\n00:11:04.004 --> 00:11:10.498\nBoy, did it give me an answer, for sure,\nso what I did is that same process,\n\n194\n00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:15.492\nI said DNS server,\ncan you find www.google.com for me?\n\n195\n00:11:15.492 --> 00:11:19.197\nAnd well, it definitely turned\nsome answers up here and there,\n\n196\n00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:23.929\nthey don't have just one web server, they\nhave hundreds of thousands of them, so\n\n197\n00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:28.594\nit's multiple IP addresses that it's\nresolving for me, but I can see that these\n\n198\n00:11:28.594 --> 00:11:33.022\nIP addresses were solved back to the name\nthat I was looking for, all right?\n\n199\n00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:36.952\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, because it actually resolved\nit the way that we see like the server\n\n200\n00:11:36.952 --> 00:11:41.064\nright there, this actually ties back into\nthe previous episode where you talked\n\n201\n00:11:41.064 --> 00:11:42.172\nabout DHCP, right?\n\n202\n00:11:42.172 --> 00:11:46.487\nWhere we could configure that option to\nsay, hey, go and ask this particular DNS\n\n203\n00:11:46.487 --> 00:11:50.676\nserver, so it really is kind of starting\nto fit together and gel together of how\n\n204\n00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:55.244\nthe resolution works, because you may be\nthinking, if this is the first time you're\n\n205\n00:11:55.244 --> 00:11:58.761\nseeing it, how did it know to ask\nthat one particular DNS server?\n\n206\n00:11:58.761 --> 00:12:01.966\nSo, hopefully this ties back in and\nit kinda reinforces that concept.\n\n207\n00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:03.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely,\nthat's a good point, Ron.\n\n208\n00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:07.068\nLet me go ahead and show you exactly\nwhat Ronnie's talking about because this\n\n209\n00:12:07.068 --> 00:12:10.298\ndoesn't magically happen, and\nthat's something I can't assume,\n\n210\n00:12:10.298 --> 00:12:13.766\nwell, it's just magic, what do you do,\ndo you throw a little water on it?\n\n211\n00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:17.672\nNo, just kidding, don't do that, but let's\ngo ahead and we'll go into the Windows\n\n212\n00:12:17.672 --> 00:12:20.732\nmachine here, and we'll show you\nwhat he's talking about here.\n\n213\n00:12:20.732 --> 00:12:24.813\nSo I'll go ahead, and what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to launch a command prompt\n\n214\n00:12:24.813 --> 00:12:28.481\nhere, and I'm going to do an ipconfig\nspace forward slash all, remember\n\n215\n00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:32.168\nwe were using this in the first part\nto do some testing of the DHCP service?\n\n216\n00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.017\nWell, I want you to look right here,\nremember when we said those options that\n\n217\n00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:39.527\nwe configured, I showed you guys us\nconfiguring in the last episode?\n\n218\n00:12:39.527 --> 00:12:43.651\nWell, remember, one of those options\nthat we handed out, I explained,\n\n219\n00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:46.590\nwas the DNS server,\nthat's how it's finding out.\n\n220\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.571\nSo like Ronnie mentioned,\nwe have to configure the DNS server,\n\n221\n00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:55.435\nwe have to tell the adapter, this is\nthe DNS server that you will use, in fact,\n\n222\n00:12:55.435 --> 00:12:57.228\nlet me kind of show you that.\n\n223\n00:12:57.228 --> 00:13:01.960\nI know my head's kind of covering it up\nright now, if I right click on the little\n\n224\n00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.619\nmonitor icon, with the little\ntrident pitchfork on it, and\n\n225\n00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:10.355\nI say Open Network and Sharing Center,\nand I choose Change Adapter Settings,\n\n226\n00:13:10.355 --> 00:13:13.797\nremember, we've seen all of\nthis in the first part, but\n\n227\n00:13:13.797 --> 00:13:18.429\nwe right click on the network adapter\nin question and we choose Properties.\n\n228\n00:13:18.429 --> 00:13:22.671\nAll right, now, we're gonna go ahead,\nremember, this is IPv4 Properties that\n\n229\n00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:26.625\nwe're looking at right here, so\nwe'll select that and choose Properties.\n\n230\n00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:33.121\nAll right, and if I want to use this\nDNS server, I can configure it here.\n\n231\n00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:37.103\nNow one of the things that I should\nhave showed you is that DHCP is actually\n\n232\n00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:41.546\nhanding out these options, and that's\nanother thing that we did talk about, so\n\n233\n00:13:41.546 --> 00:13:46.115\nif I wanna statically map it, I can, or I\ncan hand it through DHCP, if you're gonna\n\n234\n00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:50.362\nstatically map your IP address, where\nI showed you is where you're gonna put\n\n235\n00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:54.392\nthe DNS server in, that is actually\nin the lower part of that dialog box.\n\n236\n00:13:54.392 --> 00:13:57.756\nWe need to go back there real quick and\nI tell you what, we'll go ahead and\n\n237\n00:13:57.756 --> 00:14:01.507\nwe'll just do this for the heck of it\nhere, hopefully we don't break anything on\n\n238\n00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.565\nscreen, this is what happens when\nyou do labs on the fly, right?\n\n239\n00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:10.142\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll change it to,\nwe're gonna use a static IP address,\n\n240\n00:14:10.142 --> 00:14:15.310\nwe're gonna do something outside of\nthat scope that I set, let's guess,\n\n241\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:21.242\nwe'll guess 30, hopefully 30's right,\nand I'm gonna set my DNS server here.\n\n242\n00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:24.903\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll apply those settings here,\n\n243\n00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:28.260\nwe'll close up our Properties\nto our Ethernet adaptor there.\n\n244\n00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.413\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe will launch our command prompt and\n\n245\n00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.163\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsee can we now ping a server, and\n\n246\n00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:37.884\nwe're going to use its name to see if it\nwill resolve that, now, I could do a,\n\n247\n00:14:37.884 --> 00:14:41.720\nI could use things like NS lookup, we're\ngoing to look at that here in a second,\n\n248\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.952\nbut let's go ahead and\nuse the ping utility.\n\n249\n00:14:43.952 --> 00:14:49.580\nWe use a ping here, srv01, and I really\ncould stop right there, but that's not\n\n250\n00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:55.146\nwhat we wanna do, we wanna see does that\nfully qualified name actually resolve?\n\n251\n00:14:55.146 --> 00:15:01.507\nSo I'm gonna do a ping,\nspace, srv01.demo.itpro.tv,\n\n252\n00:15:01.507 --> 00:15:04.871\nnow, notice what happens here.\n\n253\n00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:09.666\nI am getting a ping, so\nat least we know that it's connecting, but\n\n254\n00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:14.635\nthat's not why I use the ping utility,\nwhat I use the ping utility for\n\n255\n00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:20.205\nhere is this part right here,\nnotice that I have srbo1.demo.itpro.tv,\n\n256\n00:15:20.205 --> 00:15:24.915\nso I can see that it is resolving\nthe name to its IP address, well,\n\n257\n00:15:24.915 --> 00:15:28.367\nwhere is that name,\nwhere does it even reside?\n\n258\n00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:32.305\nWell, that actually is in a file on the\nDNS server, and let's go ahead, I'll tell\n\n259\n00:15:32.305 --> 00:15:36.074\nyou what, let's jump over to our DNS\nserver and let's take a look at that file,\n\n260\n00:15:36.074 --> 00:15:39.833\nlet me go ahead and close these down,\nguys, so you know where we're looking.\n\n261\n00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:45.673\nI'm on a server, I think it's a 2016 box,\nand if I go up to Tools and I scroll down,\n\n262\n00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:50.953\nyou'll see that there's this option\nhere for DNS, that's the DNS Manager,\n\n263\n00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:56.319\nall right, so we'll go ahead and we'll\nopen this up And when we resolve names.\n\n264\n00:15:56.319 --> 00:16:00.502\nNames to IP addresses,\nthis fully qualified domain names that in\n\n265\n00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:04.850\nour server here is stored in what's\nknown is a Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n266\n00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.580\nForward Lookup Zone is where we store\nthose records that have the names to\n\n267\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.690\nthe IP addresses that's\ncalled a forward look up.\n\n268\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.710\nIf we open it up here,\nI take a look at the zone itself\n\n269\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.350\nI can see that I've got a series\nof entries here, right?\n\n270\n00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.570\nWe've got a few different types.\n\n271\n00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.370\nNotice the Type column here in the Name.\n\n272\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.880\nWe have Host (A), what does that mean?\n\n273\n00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.340\nHost (A), Host (A), well, I want you\nto look at what's going on here.\n\n274\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.930\nThere's that single name.\n\n275\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.010\nRight, srv01 and the host name map,\n\n276\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.820\nor the host record if you will,\nis what maps it to an IP address.\n\n277\n00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.100\nSo when we look at these names that\nare being resolved, how is it doing that?\n\n278\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.070\nWell this DNS server, could be\nGoogle's DNS server doing this, could be\n\n279\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.960\nMicrosoft DNS server, the process works\nthe same, is when you ask for a name,\n\n280\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:59.300\nin this case a hostname to an IP address,\nit says, let me look in my database.\n\n281\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.000\nMy zone file, as they call this.\n\n282\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.270\nAnd can I find that entry?\n\n283\n00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:08.270\nNow, if it doesn't find and entry like\nwe found for srv01, what does it do?\n\n284\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.570\nWell, this DNS server,\nif it's configured this way there's\n\n285\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.690\nmany different configurations that you'll\ngo on to learn in more advanced studies.\n\n286\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.260\nBut what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nforward that out to a DNS server,\n\n287\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.420\nthat question it's called a recursion.\n\n288\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.840\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna say,\nlet me go talk to the root.\n\n289\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.030\nI don't have that entry here.\n\n290\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.040\nI can't find that record\nyou're looking for.\n\n291\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.870\nAnd then it starts that process,\nthe name resolution process.\n\n292\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.050\nThat's what's known in the DNS records\nas an A record or a host record.\n\n293\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.150\nAll right, well there's other types\nof records that we have as well.\n\n294\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.460\nNow I don't have a quad A record in here.\n\n295\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.490\nBut I could put one if I want.\n\n296\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.055\nNow I mentioned that term Quad A,\nyou might see it written out as four As,\n\n297\n00:17:51.055 --> 00:17:55.270\nAAAA and what does that mean?\n\n298\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.420\nLet's show you what it actually means for\nus.\n\n299\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.750\nIf I decide that I'm gonna make\na Quad A or a four A record, all right?\n\n300\n00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.690\nNotice that it’s also a host record, but\n\n301\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.570\nit says A or Quad A, or\nfour A’s, what is that?\n\n302\n00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.645\nWell the four A’s actually signifies\nan IPv6 address all right?\n\n303\n00:18:14.645 --> 00:18:17.695\nAnd I also wanna talk a little bit more\nabout the host records in general.\n\n304\n00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:20.945\nNotice that there's single lookup names\nover here in the listing and you say well\n\n305\n00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:23.795\nait a second Wes, I thought you said\nthese are fully qualified domain names.\n\n306\n00:18:23.795 --> 00:18:25.335\nWhere is the domain name?\n\n307\n00:18:26.425 --> 00:18:29.615\nWell the other part here is what you\ndon't see hen you create the record.\n\n308\n00:18:29.615 --> 00:18:31.385\nThere's the domain name right?\n\n309\n00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:36.790\nSo watch what happens when I type\nout srv01 notice how it Fills in\n\n310\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.220\nthe rest of it for me and\nI don't have to do that.\n\n311\n00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.800\nWell, that's because it\nknows that is the domain.\n\n312\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.180\nSo it takes the host name and\n\n313\n00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:49.240\nit just puts it right there together with\nthe host name or with the domain name.\n\n314\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.980\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's show you a quality record,\n\n315\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.880\nwhich is, again,\na name to an IPv6 address, and\n\n316\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.870\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nMake one up here on the fly,\n\n317\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:04.930\nmake it a little bit easier and you gotta\nsay, that's an interesting IPv6 address.\n\n318\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.278\nWell, I know but it will work for\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n319\n00:19:08.278 --> 00:19:14.740\nAll right, now, what if there's another\nrecord that I wanna go ahead and\n\n320\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.500\nkinda talk about if I can\nget my screen to work here.\n\n321\n00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.690\nAnd you'll notice it says create\nthe associated pointer record or PTR.\n\n322\n00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.550\nThat's a pointer record.\n\n323\n00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.650\nA pointer record is something that\nyou use in reverse lookup zones.\n\n324\n00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.190\nWell what's a reverse look up zone?\n\n325\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.470\nWell if we set up a forward lookup takes\na name and reserves it to an IP address,\n\n326\n00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.590\nwell the reverse lookup zone are where\nyou have pointer records and\n\n327\n00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.855\nthe pointer records said I\nstarted out with a IP Address and\n\n328\n00:19:42.855 --> 00:19:44.975\nI need to resolve it for a name.\n\n329\n00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:47.585\nNow that's why they call\nit a reverse lookup.\n\n330\n00:19:47.585 --> 00:19:49.485\nBecause you're already starting\nout with the IP address and\n\n331\n00:19:49.485 --> 00:19:52.685\nyou resolve it to the name so\nthat's what that PTR record is.\n\n332\n00:19:52.685 --> 00:19:55.930\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll finish creating this Quad A record.\n\n333\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.060\nYou'll notice that it says\nthat host is host record.\n\n334\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.970\nSuccessfully created there.\n\n335\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.020\nWe'll choose okay to that.\n\n336\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:09.370\nAnd then we'll close that down and\nnotice that I now have a Quad A record.\n\n337\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.670\nWell let's go ahead and\njump back to our machine here.\n\n338\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.190\nAnd let's see what those\nrecords look like for us.\n\n339\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:21.060\nThere’s another utility that I talked\nabout just very briefly called NS Lookup.\n\n340\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.365\nIts name server lookup and I can actually\nsend a question into the server saying,\n\n341\n00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:27.260\nhey, resolve this name for me.\n\n342\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.440\nLet me see if we can do that.\n\n343\n00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.700\nWe'll do NS Lookup and then we're\ngoing to do SRV01.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n344\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.870\nAll right, and we'll give it a second.\n\n345\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:43.660\nAnd I want you to see what it returns.\n\n346\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.725\nNotice now it's returning an IPV four\nnumber, that's an A record, right?\n\n347\n00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:50.680\nIPv4 address I should say.\n\n348\n00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.230\nThat's your A record.\n\n349\n00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.950\nThen the Quad A record, it's also a host\nrecord which is essentially what I just\n\n350\n00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.646\nasked the DNS server.\n\n351\n00:20:57.646 --> 00:20:58.586\nSo I got two entries.\n\n352\n00:20:58.586 --> 00:21:03.640\nI got an IPv6 or a four A record and\nI have a single A record.\n\n353\n00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.740\nWell here, let me give you both.\n\n354\n00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.990\nI don't know which one you want so\nhere's both of them, alright.\n\n355\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.690\nSo that's the other kind of host\nrecord that you can see inside of DNS.\n\n356\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.910\nNow there are a couple more that they call\nout guys that you should be aware of.\n\n357\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.200\nAnd one of them I've kind\nof been talking about, but\n\n358\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.180\nI haven't told you what's\nbehind the scenes.\n\n359\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.395\nAnd that's something known, if we\nright-click on our zone file here and\n\n360\n00:21:26.395 --> 00:21:31.415\nwe choose New Alias,\nthis is called the canonical name.\n\n361\n00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.455\nI know many of you out there\nwhen you browse to a website,\n\n362\n00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:40.335\nyou don't type srvo1.google.com,\nyou type www.\n\n363\n00:21:40.335 --> 00:21:40.965\nWhy?\n\n364\n00:21:40.965 --> 00:21:43.605\nWell that is a little\nbit easier to remember\n\n365\n00:21:43.605 --> 00:21:47.330\nthan some crazy long fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n366\n00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:52.060\nSo what an alias does or conoautical\nname or CNAME is it takes a name and\n\n367\n00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.900\nit maps it back to the actual host record,\nso it is a if you type www,\n\n368\n00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.330\nthen what you meant is this host record.\n\n369\n00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:05.030\nLet me show you that there, so\nif we type CNAME, alright and I type, for\n\n370\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.679\ninstance if me alias is going to be www.\n\n371\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.660\nAnd if you look here,\nnotice that if I zoom in,\n\n372\n00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.840\nnotice that it says, www.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n373\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.600\nNow that's something we probably\ncould remember a little bit easier,\n\n374\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.762\nlike www.google.com.\n\n375\n00:22:21.762 --> 00:22:23.400\nBut then notice what I have to do.\n\n376\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.340\nI have to turn around, and I have to map\nit back to a fully qualified domain name.\n\n377\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.700\nSo if I choose browse,\nI could just type it in.\n\n378\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.390\nIf I choose browse I can\ngo into my DNS server and\n\n379\n00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.440\nI can find the host that I wanna create.\n\n380\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.150\nI'll tell you what, what will do is\nwe'll be a little tricky here just for\n\n381\n00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.290\ndemonstration purposes.\n\n382\n00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:45.820\nI'm gonna make a New Host and I'm gonna\ncall it web not wes, web server one.\n\n383\n00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.920\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nsay IP address.\n\n384\n00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:56.510\nWe'll make up an IP address here,\nand we'll chose Add Host, all right.\n\n385\n00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.120\nNow when I go back,\n\n386\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.560\nnow we've got something that's\na little bit more tangible there.\n\n387\n00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.610\nSomething that we'd probably see\ninside of the work environment.\n\n388\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.580\nWe'll recreate that alias.\n\n389\n00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.840\nWe're gonna make the same name.\n\n390\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.640\nWe'll do www, so it resolves.\n\n391\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.300\nAnd you can actually see this in Windows,\nnotice that?\n\n392\n00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:11.910\nI don't know, Ronnie.\n\n393\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.460\nCan you see that?\n\n394\n00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.670\nI know it's kinda hard to see\nthat last little do there.\n\n395\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.890\nSo remember, even though we don't\ntype the root hint dot out,\n\n396\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.920\nthat trailing dot Your operating system,\nlike I said, is still using it.\n\n397\n00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.360\nAlright, now we're gonna\nbrowse to the host\n\n398\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.250\nthat this alias maps to and, like I said,\nwe'll make it a little bit more\n\n399\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.190\nrealistic by mapping it to a server\nthat's called web server one.\n\n400\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.110\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose OK to that.\n\n401\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.120\nAnd notice that I have www here,\nand it is a CNAME.\n\n402\n00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.626\nBut the CNAME doesn't\nresolve to an IP address.\n\n403\n00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:50.061\nWhat it resolves to is another\nfully qualified domain name.\n\n404\n00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:54.090\nSo what the DNS server does,\nwhen it gets a request for www,\n\n405\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:58.180\nis it looks at this listing,\nit says, I find www.\n\n406\n00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.570\nWho does that map to?\n\n407\n00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:00.370\nThat's websrv01.\n\n408\n00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.770\nWell, what is websrv01's IP address?\n\n409\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.240\nAnd it maps it to it, and\nyou connect to the webpage.\n\n410\n00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.820\nIt makes it a lot easier to remember www,\nit is in this case the websrv01.\n\n411\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.670\nSo let's go ahead, let's test that.\n\n412\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.230\nLet's see if we can resolve\nthat address now that we've got\n\n413\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.320\nthat inside of our DNS zone file there,\nor our database, right?\n\n414\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:26.850\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll do nslookup space www.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n415\n00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:32.646\nWe'll give it a second there and\nwe'll see if it resolves and\n\n416\n00:24:32.646 --> 00:24:37.763\nthen sure enough that\nWebsrv01 that we just created\n\n417\n00:24:37.763 --> 00:24:43.120\nwith the 10.10.10.140, it resolved it.\n\n418\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.568\nSo that is what an alias is for.\n\n419\n00:24:47.568 --> 00:24:50.480\nRonnie, I know we're running\na little bit low on time here,\n\n420\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.910\nabout one of the last things that I'll\ntalk about with DNS is the caching system.\n\n421\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.400\nI have to mention that.\n\n422\n00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.870\nYou can see it in your local machine.\n\n423\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.530\nAnd let me go ahead and just pull up\nthe DNS cache on this workstation here.\n\n424\n00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:09.810\nAnd we'll talk about\nthat just a little bit.\n\n425\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.760\nAll right.\nSo that's ipconfig /displaydns,\n\n426\n00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.981\nall right now when I run that you can see\nwell there is one record name in here,\n\n427\n00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:23.140\nthat's all I've got, that's the only\nthing that I've kept, alright.\n\n428\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.240\nAnd notice that it is an A record and\nit maps back to it's IP address,\n\n429\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.610\nnow to make DNS a little\nbit more efficient.\n\n430\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.850\nIf I ask Ronnie a question, and\n\n431\n00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:38.150\nthen I ask him that same question,\nand then I ask him that same question.\n\n432\n00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.270\nI would hope that by the third time, he's\ngoing to get a little irritated at that.\n\n433\n00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.530\nHe's going to say, Wes,\ncan you just write that down?\n\n434\n00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.330\nYou're asking me the same\nquestion over and over.\n\n435\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.480\nIt's not really efficient,\nit's taking up my time.\n\n436\n00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.790\nAnd I know he wouldn't do that.\n\n437\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.590\nHe would help me regardless, but\nimagine asking the DNS server,\n\n438\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.970\nthe same question over and over and\nover and over, is that really efficient?\n\n439\n00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.530\nWell, may be if it's in milliseconds,\nbut not really.\n\n440\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.570\nSo what happens?\n\n441\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.860\nI asked the DNS, where is srv01?\n\n442\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.960\nWhat does it do?\n\n443\n00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.200\nIt resolved it for me, but\nthen I stored it locally.\n\n444\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.490\nSo what I get the ability to\ndo is I'll check locally.\n\n445\n00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.460\nBefore I generate this question\nthat I go through the process,\n\n446\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.910\nI say the operating system goes through\nthe process formulating the question and\n\n447\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.930\nsending it out to the DNS server.\n\n448\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.940\nWaiting, waiting for a response,\nhopefully it gets a response.\n\n449\n00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.220\nAnd then finally visiting the website\nit says no, I'll look locally,\n\n450\n00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.130\nI'll look to the cache.\n\n451\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.780\nHave I ever asked this question before?\n\n452\n00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.330\nBecause if I have,\nI don't have to ask the DNS server.\n\n453\n00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.730\nNow that's a good thing.\n\n454\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.170\nIt can speed up resolution.\n\n455\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.370\nBut it also can be a bad thing sometimes,\ntoo.\n\n456\n00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.030\nBecause if you don't turn\nyour computer off, right,\n\n457\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.270\nthis is a volatile memory\nlocation that it's storing this.\n\n458\n00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.910\nEvery time I reboot the computer,\nthis cache does what's known as a flush.\n\n459\n00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.840\nWell there might be times where\nmaybe you're storing information.\n\n460\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.680\nEvery one of these records that we\ntalk about has what's known as a TTL,\n\n461\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.710\na Time To Live If that TTL, all right,\nand if that TTL, that time to live,\n\n462\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.460\nis really great, that means you're going\nto cache that record for a very long time.\n\n463\n00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.030\nAnd what happens if some changes are made?\n\n464\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.990\nWell, if an IP address changes, then a\nname that was formally mapped to an old IP\n\n465\n00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.090\naddress and you're still caching it,\nguess what?\n\n466\n00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.330\nYou're going to use the old address and\n\n467\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.570\nyou're not going to ask\nthe DNS a question, right?\n\n468\n00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.890\nSo there might be times when you\nactually have to flush this and\n\n469\n00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.510\nthen start new to ensure that\nyou get the right resolution.\n\n470\n00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.790\nSo you can see that it is flushed.\n\n471\n00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.880\nLast thing is dynamic DNS.\n\n472\n00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:29.550\nDynamic DNS is a way that you can update\nDNS, I don't wanna say automatically.\n\n473\n00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.520\nWhen IP addresses have a tendency\nto change, IP addresses can.\n\n474\n00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.960\nI'll tell you one way that I\nuse this on my home network.\n\n475\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.460\nRight at the home router, I lease an IP\naddress that isn't static from my ISP,\n\n476\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.050\nmy Internet Service Provider, right.\n\n477\n00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.330\nThey could change it at any time.\n\n478\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.060\nWell I have services that allow\nme to get in to my network and\n\n479\n00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:53.540\njust like any other communication they\nrely on the IP address to do that.\n\n480\n00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.560\nHowever, what if the IP address changes?\n\n481\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.960\nAll those services break.\n\n482\n00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.660\nWell, they're also relying on DNS.\n\n483\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.030\nAnd if I've got a way that I can\ndynamically update the DNS records\n\n484\n00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.130\nworldwide on my network, in case my\nIP address changes, well, guess what?\n\n485\n00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.260\nI don't have to go back and reconfigure\nall of those applications that are waiting\n\n486\n00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.040\nfor a certain IP address to be there.\n\n487\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.595\nSo dynamic DNS is a way that you\ncan update the DNS database that\n\n488\n00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:21.680\nreflects any IP address changes that\nmight have happened since the last time\n\n489\n00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.090\nthe record was what they call\nregistered in the DNS database.\n\n490\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.650\nAnd it's a way keep DNS\nupdated on any kind\n\n491\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.980\nof IP address that changed related\nto the record that it used to store.\n\n492\n00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.740\nSo dynamic DNS it's\nsomething that we do use.\n\n493\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.850\nBe aware of it on the exam but\nessentially, that's one of the most\n\n494\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.840\nimportant services that allow us to\nconnect to machines across the internet.\n\n495\n00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.600\nKeep in mind we have just touched,\nscratched the surface on this.\n\n496\n00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.305\nAs you go on to more advanced training,\nyou'll get more in depth but DNS and\n\n497\n00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:54.955\nDHCP, two of the most important services\nwithin your networks, and it really,\n\n498\n00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:57.865\nreally benefits you to understand them.\n\n499\n00:28:57.865 --> 00:29:03.935\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, thank you again for leading\nus through this very deep topic of DNS and\n\n500\n00:29:03.935 --> 00:29:08.765\ngiving us a solid understanding as a basis\nfor more knowledge that's to come later.\n\n501\n00:29:08.765 --> 00:29:11.495\nAnd make sure you do heed what\nWes is telling us, right now,\n\n502\n00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:15.940\nwe're not gonna be an expert at DNS just\nthrough a couple of shows we actually need\n\n503\n00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.610\nto do a little bit more in depth study,\nyou want to take advantage of that make\n\n504\n00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.635\nsure you check out the IT Pro TV library\nand that will also help you out as well.\n\n505\n00:29:23.635 --> 00:29:27.830\nBut this is a great place for us also to\nend this episode then, signing of for\n\n506\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.510\nIT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n507\n00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.470\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:34.790\nYeah, we're working on a Stephen King\nnovel on this one for sure.\n\n13\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.060\nThat's right, our part three and I just\ncouldn't quite fit everything in the last\n\n14\n00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.070\nepisode, so I certainly didn't\nwanna rush you guys through it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.900\nIn the first episode,\nwe talked pretty much just about DHCP.\n\n16\n00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.310\nAnd in the last episode, well,\nwe talked pretty much just about DNS.\n\n17\n00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.120\nHowever, Ronnie, I was looking at my\nobjectives and as much I did talk, yes I\n\n18\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.810\ndid leave something out and it was one\nof the valuable records that are in DNS.\n\n19\n00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.610\nSo I wanna just take a second\nto recap what we already know.\n\n20\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.660\nWe will go through those very quickly but\nthen I do wanna mention one other record\n\n21\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.040\nbecause it is called out\nby the exam objectives and\n\n22\n00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.230\nwe want you to make sure that we take\ncare of all those exam objectives here,\n\n23\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.410\nin the NetPlus course here.\n\n24\n00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.060\nSo if we can look at my screen here,\n\n25\n00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.410\nremember that we talked about that\ndatabase that holds the records?\n\n26\n00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.500\nWe got to see that database, and\neven create some records, and\n\n27\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.180\nthen test those records out?\n\n28\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.135\nRemember that that is called a DNS Zone,\nand in the Zone File, or\n\n29\n00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:31.776\nwhere those are stored, and there was\none record that we didn't mention.\n\n30\n00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:36.620\nRemember that we talked about the A and\nthe quad A, or four A record, IPv6,\n\n31\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.423\n128-bit, four times the size\nof the 32-bit IPv4.\n\n32\n00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.328\nI'm thinking that's why they named it for\nthe record, but who knows.\n\n33\n00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:49.130\nI'm not exactly sure on that one,\nbut then we talked about\n\n34\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.627\nthe A maps a host to an IPV4 address,\nquad A maps a host to an IPV6.\n\n35\n00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:57.791\nAnd here's the one that I didn't mention\nand that's the mail exchanger record.\n\n36\n00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.670\nWe mentioned the CNAME canonical name\nbeing an alias as well as the PTR record\n\n37\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.830\nsaying, hey, I got an IP address,\nnow I need a name, right?\n\n38\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.210\nThat was in the reverse lookup zone.\n\n39\n00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.750\nThe mail exchanger record.\n\n40\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.640\nThis is a record that is put in the DNS\nzone that essentially points to\n\n41\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.470\nthe email servers, that can send\nemail on behalf of the domain.\n\n42\n00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.204\nThat is the MS record.\n\n43\n00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:22.980\nThere might be on other one, again,\nit's not called out on the exam, but\n\n44\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.100\nwe could just go ahead and put it here.\n\n45\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.810\nBecause it is another type of\nrecord that's important and\n\n46\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.060\nI just thought about this one, Ronnie.\n\n47\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.930\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nkinda go up the beaten path.\n\n48\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.410\nAnd I'm gonna put the NS record in there,\nbecause it's another important record.\n\n49\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.840\nAnd that's the Name Server record.\n\n50\n00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.150\nSo for instance, if Ronnie,\nlet's say Ronnie works for\n\n51\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.480\na company that's hosting DNS services for\nme and\n\n52\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.879\nI know that all of those records\nare stored within his zone file,\n\n53\n00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.870\nI'm not really, I don't wanna have to\ndeal with any of the name resolution,\n\n54\n00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.490\nI'm talking to different people.\n\n55\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.750\nWhat I can use is I can use an NS record.\n\n56\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.600\nAn NS record just says,\nhelp me find the Name Server\n\n57\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.790\nthat's in control of this file,\nthat is the authority over this file so\n\n58\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.560\nthat I know who to ask the question\nto when I need to find a record.\n\n59\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.135\nSo that's the NS record,\nthat's the name server.\n\n60\n00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:15.590\nDidn't wanna mention those last couple\nones, definitely that one, the MX record,\n\n61\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.950\nthe mail exchanger record,\ncuz it is on the exam.\n\n62\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.850\nThe other one is not, but\nit's not always about what's on the exam.\n\n63\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.600\nWe definitely wanna cover\nthe exam objectives.\n\n64\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.410\nBut if we can give you a little bit more,\nmake it a little bit better for\n\n65\n00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.380\nyou then we will.\n\n66\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.540\nAll right, so the next service\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n67\n00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.240\nthis is one that's kinda interesting.\n\n68\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.530\nThis is what they call a proxy and\nI wanna talk a little bit about the proxy.\n\n69\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.080\nThey mention a couple of\ndifferent types of proxies.\n\n70\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.910\nLet's just talk about\nthe term proxy in general.\n\n71\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.810\nLet's not worry about which\ndirection we're facing here.\n\n72\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.440\nA proxy is something, is a server or\n\n73\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.592\na device that is offering a service\non behalf of somebody else.\n\n74\n00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.110\nIt's kinda like the middle man\nbetween a request that you make and\n\n75\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.940\nthat request being fulfilled.\n\n76\n00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.630\nNow let's take a web server, for instance,\nif I wanna connect to a web server and\n\n77\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.990\nI'm at home,\nI fire up the browser, right, and\n\n78\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.360\nI type in whatever the web page is and\nhopefully we've got DNS in check and\n\n79\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.060\nour name resolution is going okay and\nit connects.\n\n80\n00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.860\nIt pulls back that webpage for\nme whatever it might be.\n\n81\n00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.320\nAll right, now in some environments,\nyou might not want people to have direct\n\n82\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.750\naccess connectivity to go right out the\nInternet, maybe it's a secure environment,\n\n83\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.330\nmaybe you wanna control that.\n\n84\n00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.613\nWell, I can actually put in\nwhat's known as a proxy, right?\n\n85\n00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:36.193\nAnd a proxy is actually gonna sit in\nif I make my diagram a little bit more\n\n86\n00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:37.680\ncomplete here.\n\n87\n00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.280\nLet's say the web server is\nout there on the Internet and\n\n88\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.610\nlet's say one of these clients\nmakes a request for a web page.\n\n89\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.205\nWell what's gonna happen here is the\nclient is gonna make that request just no\n\n90\n00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:50.138\ndifferent in the corporate\nenvironment than if I was in the home\n\n91\n00:04:50.138 --> 00:04:51.266\nenvironment, right?\n\n92\n00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:56.174\nThey make a request for that web page and\nprovided the settings are configured\n\n93\n00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:59.620\nright, they're gonna\nreceive that web page.\n\n94\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.700\nNow, what they don't realize is that, that\nwebpage, unlike my home network wasn't\n\n95\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.320\nserved up directly by the server\nthat's hosting the web page.\n\n96\n00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.010\nNow, my home network\nthat's what's happening.\n\n97\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.120\nBut in the corporate environment,\n\n98\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.790\nwhat's actually happening is we\nhave a web proxy, all right.\n\n99\n00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.835\nAnd what's happening is\nthe client computers.\n\n100\n00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:22.755\nTheir web browsers are configured\nto send all of that,\n\n101\n00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:26.955\nall that web requests, all the web request\nthat they're doing right to the proxy.\n\n102\n00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:30.435\nAnd then the proxy is the one\nthat generates a new request and\n\n103\n00:05:30.435 --> 00:05:32.295\nsends it out on behalf of the client.\n\n104\n00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:34.295\nNow, what does that do for us?\n\n105\n00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:35.405\nWell, it does a couple of things.\n\n106\n00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:36.590\nIt allows the administrator,\n\n107\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.715\ncentralized administration over who has\naccess to the Internet and who doesn't.\n\n108\n00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.765\nYou can add things like content filtering.\n\n109\n00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:45.690\nI mean, you don't have to add\nit on this web server here.\n\n110\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.020\nWe talked about content\nfilters on another episode but\n\n111\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.550\nI could do content filtering right here.\n\n112\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.140\nI could say, yeah, maybe this URLs, maybe\nwe got a company URL, we got a government\n\n113\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.750\nURL that you could visit but you can't\nvisit like gambling sites, right?\n\n114\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.060\nSo we could actually control that.\n\n115\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.170\nNow the other thing that's really great\nabout the proxy, how about the web server,\n\n116\n00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.400\nthe actual web server?\n\n117\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.070\nHow about the Internet?\n\n118\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.060\nWhat is it look like to them?\n\n119\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.290\nWell to the rest of the internet, when\nyou're using a proxy like this what you\n\n120\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.310\nend up getting to them is, they don't\neven really know that you exist, right?\n\n121\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.660\nBecause the only thing that this web\nserver that I ask that request off sees is\n\n122\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.650\nthe proxy server.\n\n123\n00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.210\nSo that's one of the good things too,\nthat is the fact that\n\n124\n00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.560\nwhen you do have one of these proxies,\nthe outside world doesn't know the client\n\n125\n00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.350\ninternally that's making the request,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n126\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.095\nNow, that's, a proxy sometimes just called\na proxy sometimes called a forward proxy\n\n127\n00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:41.899\nhere and I do want you to\nremember that for the exam.\n\n128\n00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:44.808\nNow the other one that they\ncall out is the reverse proxy.\n\n129\n00:06:44.808 --> 00:06:47.531\nNow the reverse proxy is\nkinda interesting here.\n\n130\n00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.217\nNow I want you to think\nabout the whole situation.\n\n131\n00:06:50.217 --> 00:06:52.192\nWe're gonna reverse the flow here, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:52.192 --> 00:06:55.698\nMaybe I got somebody out on the internet\nthat needs a file off of one of my\n\n133\n00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:57.890\nservers.They should have access to it.\n\n134\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.960\nI don't wanna give them direct access\ninto my network and have that file that\n\n135\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.880\nmaybe just happens to be sitting on that\nFTP server inside of my network, right?\n\n136\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.040\nI won't do that.\n\n137\n00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.595\nWhy?\nI can actually set up a reverse proxy and\n\n138\n00:07:11.595 --> 00:07:16.449\nwhat happens is this reverse proxy is\ngoing to deliver the resource on behalf of\n\n139\n00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:17.270\nthe server.\n\n140\n00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.870\nSo what happens is the client connects\ninto the reverse proxy asking for\n\n141\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.478\nthat file.\n\n142\n00:07:21.478 --> 00:07:24.768\nThe reverse proxy on behalf\nof the clients or actually,\n\n143\n00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:29.120\nreally on the server's behalf forge\nthat request over to the FTP server.\n\n144\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.341\nThe FTP server then delivers\nthe file back to the reverse proxy,\n\n145\n00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:35.777\nwhich delivers it back to my client.\n\n146\n00:07:35.777 --> 00:07:38.057\nNow where does that benefit, right?\n\n147\n00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:41.880\nWell for one, I don't want somebody to\nhave direct access in my internal network.\n\n148\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.460\nAnd the other thing is, unlike the first\nexample where we said it max the client,\n\n149\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.460\nin this case, it's actually for\nus masking the server.\n\n150\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.250\nThey don't even know\nthat the server exist.\n\n151\n00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.180\nTo them it's just a web,\nthe reverse proxy, excuse me,\n\n152\n00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.328\nthat served up that file transfer there.\n\n153\n00:07:56.328 --> 00:08:01.140\nSo that is the proxy types there, again\nthere's a lot more to it as you're getting\n\n154\n00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.527\ninto server administration and stuff.\n\n155\n00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:04.691\nIf you're getting into Cisco and\n\n156\n00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.155\nstuff like that you're gonna learn\na lot more about reverse Proxies.\n\n157\n00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:11.273\nWe're just really hitting the highlights\nhere that you should know on\n\n158\n00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:12.400\nthe NetPlus exam.\n\n159\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.880\nAll right, so\nthat's one of the services that we have.\n\n160\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.220\nKeep in mind those proxies, again,\n\n161\n00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.900\npay attention to whether you're talking\nabout a forward proxy or a reverse proxy,\n\n162\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.601\nremember, it usually like a middle\ndevice that is acting on behalf of or\n\n163\n00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:34.380\nserving a service based on the request\non behalf of somebody else.\n\n164\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.980\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, where I normally see the\nimplementation of proxies in a real world\n\n165\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.280\nenvironment is gonna be something like,\nfor instance, at a school\n\n166\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.410\nwhere you need to be able to control\nthe type of traffic that's coming in and\n\n167\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.010\nyou also need to be able to cache it so\nthat most of the content that's coming in\n\n168\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.270\nfrom the outside is\ngonna be stored locally.\n\n169\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.000\nAnd then only people from the inside\nare not gonna really ever\n\n170\n00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.930\ndirectly connect to the internet.\n\n171\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.090\nInstead they're gonna\ngo through that proxy.\n\n172\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.586\nSo it gives us a measure of control.\n\n173\n00:09:00.586 --> 00:09:05.450\nIt allows us to speed up certain things as\nwell since they're not really ever having\n\n174\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.860\nto go across the entire internet except\nfor that first exchange of information.\n\n175\n00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.030\nSo regardless of which one that we do,\nthis is probably where you tend to see it.\n\n176\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.350\nNow I'm not saying you can't use it for\nanything that you want to.\n\n177\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.480\nThere are a lot of companies that like\nthis because it is that amount of control\n\n178\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.330\nwhere we can simply block the information\nlike what you're talking about with\n\n179\n00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.640\nthe gambling sites and different things.\n\n180\n00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.290\nBut overall, though, you'll probably see\nit implemented there more often than not,\n\n181\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.420\nin something like a school\nis where you'll see that.\n\n182\n00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.535\n&gt;&gt; Definitely because the web cache\nspeeds up the response times as well and\n\n183\n00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:36.480\nyou'll get a better performance.\n\n184\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.940\nKind of like you talk about when you\ntalk about the DNS cache, right?\n\n185\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.220\nThat's one of the reasons\nwe do the DNS cache too so\n\n186\n00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.700\nwe can hopefully speed up the performance\nof the name resolution process.\n\n187\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.780\nSo very good.\n\n188\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.480\nNow the next thing that we're gonna talk\nabout is we're gonna talk about, well,\n\n189\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.750\nI tell you what.\n\n190\n00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.870\nLet's go ahead and let's do this.\n\n191\n00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.330\nWe're gonna talk about private\nIP addresses for a little bit.\n\n192\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.270\nAll right?\nFor a second,\n\n193\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.920\nbecause one of the things that we've\nbeen doing here since we've been\n\n194\n00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.209\ntalking is we're actually\nconnected out to the Internet.\n\n195\n00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.671\nBut I want you to kinda take\nsomething into consideration.\n\n196\n00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:08.710\nRemember that we've talked\nabout private IP addresses,\n\n197\n00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.640\nwe can't use them out there\non the Internet, right?\n\n198\n00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.400\nI have to have public IP addresses.\n\n199\n00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.480\nThat's the difference between\na private IP address and\n\n200\n00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.600\na public IP address is that, remember,\n\n201\n00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.860\na private IP address is gonna be one that\nI can use internally on my local network.\n\n202\n00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.930\nBut I can't route it across the Internet,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.033\nIt's not allowed.\n\n204\n00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:26.500\nSo what do we use for that?\n\n205\n00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.940\nWell, we go to ISPs and\nthe people who have been allocated these\n\n206\n00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.800\nlarge pools of IP addresses and\nI essentially rent a public IP.\n\n207\n00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.379\nI lease a public IP address to myself.\n\n208\n00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:39.126\nOr if you're a big enough company,\n\n209\n00:10:39.126 --> 00:10:43.280\nmaybe you've actually purchased a block of\nIP addresses, and you have them to use.\n\n210\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.380\nAll right, now here's the thing.\n\n211\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.074\nWhat if I have a few hundred machines,\nright?\n\n212\n00:10:48.074 --> 00:10:51.800\nAnd I have two, three,\none, maybe even just one.\n\n213\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.160\nBut two, three, four,\nten public IP addresses?\n\n214\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.410\nWell, that's not gonna be enough\nto let all of the internal\n\n215\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.670\ndevices that need to communicate\nwith the Internet talk, right?\n\n216\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.020\nBecause, well, we just don't have\nenough of those public IP addresses.\n\n217\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.880\nSo what do they do?\n\n218\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.730\nDo we not allow them to communicate?\n\n219\n00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.200\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n220\n00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.520\nWhat we use is a process called\nNetwork Address Translation,\n\n221\n00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.690\nsomething known as NAT.\n\n222\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.640\nLet's go ahead and take a look here,\njust very basically, of what NAT is,\n\n223\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.520\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n224\n00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.890\nAll right, Network Address Translation\nis a way that I can use those private IP\n\n225\n00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.250\naddresses and still communicate\nacross the the public network, right?\n\n226\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.130\nIt's doing a little packet mangling,\nif you will.\n\n227\n00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.500\nInside of your IP header you have\nwhat's known as the source and\n\n228\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.470\ndestination fields of the IP header,\nall right?\n\n229\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.390\nWell, the destination, if we want it to\nbe [LAUGH] routed across the Internet,\n\n230\n00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.870\nit has to be one of those\npublic IP addresses.\n\n231\n00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.130\nAnd you can see right here,\n\n232\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.670\njust very basically in my data packet\nhere, I got a private IP address.\n\n233\n00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.230\nSo the problem with this is when\nthis hits the router, right?\n\n234\n00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.930\nIf we didn't happen to have\nnetwork address translation,\n\n235\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.260\nit's not gonna go to the other side,\nright?\n\n236\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.050\nIf we don't have the technology,\nwe can't use that.\n\n237\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:08.504\nSo what Network Address Translation does\nfor us, oops, it zooms in, that's right.\n\n238\n00:12:08.504 --> 00:12:11.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is it takes a public IP address, right?\n\n239\n00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.810\nSo here's our public IP address.\n\n240\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.550\nAnd it removes the public IP address,\nor excuse me, the private IP address on\n\n241\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:25.130\nthe internal network and\nit replaces it with its public IP address.\n\n242\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.220\nNow we have something that's\nroutable across the Internet, right?\n\n243\n00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.260\nAnd I can send that out and\nhopefully connect.\n\n244\n00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.839\nIf everything else [LAUGH] is in place,\nwe can connect.\n\n245\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.230\nSo what does that look\nlike on the return trip?\n\n246\n00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.140\nWell on the return trip,\nit's gonna come back into the network and\n\n247\n00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.070\nlook a little bit like this,\nabstractly like this, right?\n\n248\n00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.250\nNotice that on the return trip it's\ncoming in and there's public IP address.\n\n249\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.060\nBut it wasn't the router that sent this,\nright?\n\n250\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.280\nIt was somebody on the inside, a client on\nthe inside of the network that sent this.\n\n251\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.350\nSo what it's gonna do is it's going to\nlook at a little bit of a database,\n\n252\n00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.900\nwhich we'll talk about here in a second.\n\n253\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:58.720\nAnd it's gonna say,\n\n254\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.280\nokay, I see the computer that\noriginally sent that information.\n\n255\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.870\nSo let me go ahead and what I'll do is\nI'll strip off the public IP address.\n\n256\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.840\nI'll return that private IP\naddress to the data packet and\n\n257\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.030\nthen I'll finish the delivery.\n\n258\n00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.900\nNow, that's a simplification, understand.\n\n259\n00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.180\nThat's a simplification of what\nNetwork Address Translation is doing.\n\n260\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:25.190\nBut it's allowing me to take those private\nIP addresses on the internal network and\n\n261\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:28.520\nuse them well, and\nnot maybe that IP address.\n\n262\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.393\nBut still allow me to communicate\nacross a public network,\n\n263\n00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:33.469\nwhich otherwise I wouldn't be able to do.\n\n264\n00:13:33.469 --> 00:13:36.700\nNow there are a couple of\ndifferent types of NAT, right?\n\n265\n00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.820\nWe have what is known as Static NAT,\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n266\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.540\nWe also have what's known as\nDynamic Network Address Translation.\n\n267\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.080\nLet's go ahead and we'll start out with, I\nguess we'll start out with the Static NAT.\n\n268\n00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.995\nIt's a little bit easier for\nme to explain at least.\n\n269\n00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:55.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Static NAT is when I have,\n\n270\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.970\nI am a company, and I've got a series\nof public IP addresses, right?\n\n271\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.290\nI have private IP addresses\nthat I'm still using on my LAN.\n\n272\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.500\nJust because I got more than one public\nIP address didn't change the fact that\n\n273\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.110\nI've still got internal computers\nthat are using private IP addresses.\n\n274\n00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:15.753\nBut if I've got a series of computers that\nI want to have access to the network and\n\n275\n00:14:15.753 --> 00:14:20.585\nwant them to keep the same public\nIP address, that's where we use and\n\n276\n00:14:20.585 --> 00:14:23.735\nimplement something known as\nStatic Network Address Translation.\n\n277\n00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:27.125\nNow the process is still kind of\ngoing on the same here, right?\n\n278\n00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:31.190\nWe still have that crafting of the packet,\nthe removing of a private IP address,\n\n279\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.670\nand replacing it with a public IP address.\n\n280\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.970\nBut the thing here is, with Static NAT,\nis it's a one-to-one mapping.\n\n281\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.970\nWe have a single private IP address,\nthat is mapped,\n\n282\n00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.390\nor NATed, to a single public IP address.\n\n283\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.100\nAnd they don't change.\n\n284\n00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.500\nWell, that's okay.\n\n285\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.050\nIn this case, for my example,\nyou only have three IP addresses and\n\n286\n00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.100\nthree public addresses\nthat you need to use.\n\n287\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.690\nThat's just fine.\n\n288\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.600\nBut what happens if you have ten?\n\n289\n00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.100\nTen computers on the internal network and\nyou only have three public IP addresses?\n\n290\n00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.590\nYou still need all those ten to connect,\nmaybe periodically, well,\n\n291\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.930\nyou can't use Static NAT.\n\n292\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.710\nAnd that's where another term comes in and\n\n293\n00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.480\nthat's called\nDynamic Network Address Translation.\n\n294\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.260\nNow I've used the same exact IP\naddress as internal and external, but\n\n295\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.300\nthere's a couple of\nsituations that can happen.\n\n296\n00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.690\nIt's almost like a first come,\nfirst serve type basis.\n\n297\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.300\nNotice that we've got one that's mapping\nto this IP address at this point.\n\n298\n00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.350\nThis one's mapping to this IP address and\nthen we could switch that up, right?\n\n299\n00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.120\nAnd they're constantly changing\nthe public IP address, right?\n\n300\n00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.640\nWhat public IP address is open at this\ntime, that's gonna be the one that I use.\n\n301\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.530\nWell, that does lend itself to\nkind of a problem, it could be.\n\n302\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.257\nBecause what happens if\nthis last computer or\n\n303\n00:15:44.257 --> 00:15:50.251\ndevice is needing to connect to that or\nhave that IP address translated.\n\n304\n00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:55.089\nAnd what ends up happening is that all of\na sudden another machine comes in here and\n\n305\n00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:56.452\nbeats it to the punch.\n\n306\n00:15:56.452 --> 00:16:00.024\nWell, what happens to our other device?\n\n307\n00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:02.556\nWell sorry, you don't connect.\n\n308\n00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:07.156\nI don't have any more and\nit's dynamic and it changed and,\n\n309\n00:16:07.156 --> 00:16:10.930\nwhat is it,\nfirst come first served type basis.\n\n310\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.387\nThat's dynamic NATs, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:14.551\nSo static, one to one mapping.\n\n312\n00:16:14.551 --> 00:16:18.207\nDynamic map just says that\nthe private IP addresses that\n\n313\n00:16:18.207 --> 00:16:21.410\nare using the public IP\naddresses could change.\n\n314\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.150\nThey could rotate,\n\n315\n00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.789\nyou could have more than just what\npublic IP addresses you have.\n\n316\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.194\nNow, this is typically what we'll see\ninside of the business environment.\n\n317\n00:16:31.194 --> 00:16:34.435\nWhat we see in our home environment,\nI can almost guarantee you.\n\n318\n00:16:34.435 --> 00:16:37.440\nThat if you guys are watching this,\nwe know you're connected to the internet.\n\n319\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.520\nOr [LAUGH] how else are you watching this?\n\n320\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.910\nThat if you have one of these home router,\nor these home gateway devices,\n\n321\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.430\nif you will, home routers.\n\n322\n00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.720\nThey're not going to use this static map.\n\n323\n00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.864\nWhat they're gonna use is,\n\n324\n00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:53.230\nthey're gonna use something known\nas port address translation.\n\n325\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.430\nAnd a port address translation's the way\nif I only have a single public IP address\n\n326\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.930\nhow do I let multiple devices use that?\n\n327\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.540\nRight, well you could say dynamic net but\nI only have a single public IP address.\n\n328\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.401\nSo one of the ways that they do this.\n\n329\n00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:10.079\nAnd again,\nthis is not really going to be safe for\n\n330\n00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:15.590\nyour corporate environment,\nis to do port address translation.\n\n331\n00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.727\nSo with port address translation what\nwe're doing is something slightly\n\n332\n00:17:18.727 --> 00:17:19.290\ndifferent.\n\n333\n00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.659\nNow I know I said we don't\nuse this in business.\n\n334\n00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:27.596\nBut it's more so you're using this where\nyou have more than one IP address.\n\n335\n00:17:27.596 --> 00:17:32.820\nAnd you need to do address translation\nto one single public IP address.\n\n336\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.892\nAnd that's what this is really doing.\n\n337\n00:17:33.892 --> 00:17:36.462\nNotice that we still have\nthose private IP addresses.\n\n338\n00:17:36.462 --> 00:17:40.679\nNow guys, I chose 192.168.1.anything.\n\n339\n00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:43.482\nIt could be a ten dot,\nit could be a 172.16 network,\n\n340\n00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:47.230\ndepends on what your company is using or\nwhat you're using at home.\n\n341\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:52.303\nBut what it's looking at, it's keeping\ntrack of now, are ports, the TCP/IP ports.\n\n342\n00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:56.212\nSo when I send information in and\nout of my network, right.\n\n343\n00:17:56.212 --> 00:17:58.353\nIt's still mapping the addresses or\n\n344\n00:17:58.353 --> 00:18:01.469\naddress translation when\nit comes to the addresses.\n\n345\n00:18:01.469 --> 00:18:05.352\nBut now what it’s doing to keep track\nof the information that’s coming in and\n\n346\n00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:06.317\nout of my network.\n\n347\n00:18:06.317 --> 00:18:08.772\nIs it's keeping track of these ports here.\n\n348\n00:18:08.772 --> 00:18:10.229\nThat's port address translation.\n\n349\n00:18:10.229 --> 00:18:15.088\nAnd again the concept here is when you\nhave multiple private IP addresses.\n\n350\n00:18:15.088 --> 00:18:19.840\nAnd you need to do network address\ntranslation to a single public IP address.\n\n351\n00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.470\nPort Address Translation is\nthe way that you can do that.\n\n352\n00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.380\nNow, looking at my notes, we got one\nmore that they call out right here.\n\n353\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.220\nAnd that is something known as, while we\nare talking about ports, port forwarding.\n\n354\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.240\nNow port forwarding is a technique that\nas you [LAUGH] might guess by the name\n\n355\n00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.040\ndoes rely on looking at those ports.\n\n356\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.710\nAnd making sure that it gets to\na specific location within your network.\n\n357\n00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.190\nSo, one of the things that I\nuse port forwarding for and\n\n358\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.816\nmaybe you guys do here, maybe you guys\ndo that are watching us out there.\n\n359\n00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:54.924\nIs I use port forwarding for instance\nwhen I need to get back into my network.\n\n360\n00:18:54.924 --> 00:18:57.336\nAnd I need to use something\nlike remote desktop.\n\n361\n00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:00.089\nWell, remote desktop uses port 3389.\n\n362\n00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:03.914\nAnd if I wasn't doing port forwarding,\nwhen that traffic went to my home router\n\n363\n00:19:03.914 --> 00:19:06.211\nacross the internet and\nwent to my home router.\n\n364\n00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:09.546\nMy router would say,\nI don't know what you're talking about,\n\n365\n00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:11.412\nI don't know what you want me to do.\n\n366\n00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:15.923\nHowever, if I put a port forwarding\nrule in there that says,\n\n367\n00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:18.409\ntake port 3389 in this case.\n\n368\n00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:22.964\nAnd I want you to make sure that every\ntime you see port 3389 come in to this\n\n369\n00:19:22.964 --> 00:19:24.613\nrouter from the internet.\n\n370\n00:19:24.613 --> 00:19:29.058\nI want you to forward all of that traffic,\nin this case 3389's RDP traffic.\n\n371\n00:19:29.058 --> 00:19:31.977\nI want you to forward that\nover to a specific computer,\n\n372\n00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:34.495\na specific device on your network.\n\n373\n00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:37.785\nThat allows us that when you do\nconnect with a certain service, and\n\n374\n00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:40.310\nthat's usually what these\nports are related to.\n\n375\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.620\nIt's a service that they're providing.\n\n376\n00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.670\nIn this case, this port is related to\nthe service remote desktop protocol.\n\n377\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.520\nAnd what it's doing is\nthe router receives that.\n\n378\n00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.120\nit says, okay.\n\n379\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.520\nI see that port there.\n\n380\n00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.570\nLet me look at this rule that I have here,\nokay.\n\n381\n00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.154\nI see right there.\n\n382\n00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:56.099\nIt says, take that port 3389.\n\n383\n00:19:56.099 --> 00:20:02.100\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nsend it right on over to 192.168.1.15.\n\n384\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.370\nAll right, so that's port forwarding.\n\n385\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.650\nAnd again, it's a way to take a specific\ntype of traffic, based on its TCP/IP port.\n\n386\n00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:15.536\nAnd then forward over to a single\nendpoint on the inside of your network.\n\n387\n00:20:15.536 --> 00:20:19.689\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, well the idea of\nactually using all of these different\n\n388\n00:20:19.689 --> 00:20:22.777\ntypes of services as well\nas the application here.\n\n389\n00:20:22.777 --> 00:20:27.560\nIs really important to all of networking\ntoday as networks continue to grow, right?\n\n390\n00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.623\nThe idea of the way that\nthe Internet worked,\n\n391\n00:20:29.623 --> 00:20:32.128\nby shrinking the number of\nIP addresses you could get.\n\n392\n00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:36.828\nWell, NAT was actually a perfect\nresponse to that ability, then.\n\n393\n00:20:36.828 --> 00:20:41.973\nTo allow you to address as many\ninternal IP addresses as you wanted to.\n\n394\n00:20:41.973 --> 00:20:47.200\nAnd attach them to a single or just\na small number of public IP addresses.\n\n395\n00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.787\nWe also of course talked about the use\nof proxies as well as port-forwarding.\n\n396\n00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:56.325\nYou may see all these concepts in\ndifferent networks at different times.\n\n397\n00:20:56.325 --> 00:20:59.831\nDepending on what you really need and\nwhat you have available to you.\n\n398\n00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:02.138\nIf you only have a single\npublic IP address to you and\n\n399\n00:21:02.138 --> 00:21:04.891\nyou still need to access\nindividual machines on the inside.\n\n400\n00:21:04.891 --> 00:21:08.380\nRemember port-forwarding is probably\ngonna be your friend to do so.\n\n401\n00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.220\nBut if you do have\nmultiple machines though,\n\n402\n00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.170\non the inside [INAUDIBLE] NAT is\nprobably going to be the way to go.\n\n403\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.660\nAnd without NAT, of course,\n\n404\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.670\nyou can't translate those private IP\naddresses to get out on the Internet.\n\n405\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.586\nSo that may actually be kind of\nan exam-like question that you may end up\n\n406\n00:21:22.586 --> 00:21:23.179\nfinding out.\n\n407\n00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:26.098\nWhich is, which of the following\ntechnologies is necessary for\n\n408\n00:21:26.098 --> 00:21:28.158\nyou to trans, or\nto allow for this computer.\n\n409\n00:21:28.158 --> 00:21:31.654\nWhich has a private IP address to\ncommunicate to a computer outside on\n\n410\n00:21:31.654 --> 00:21:32.689\nthe Internet wall.\n\n411\n00:21:32.689 --> 00:21:35.468\nNAT is probably one of\nthose technologies as well.\n\n412\n00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:38.590\nWell that's a great place for us to also\nthink about ending this episode, and\n\n413\n00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.530\nthat's exactly what we are going to do.\n\n414\n00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.720\nSo, as we sign-off here,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n415\n00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:16.945\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:20.530\nAnd today,\nyou're watching the CompTIA Network+ show.\n\n8\n00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.460\nWe're, specifically, gonna be diving in to\nthe realm of different WAN technologies.\n\n9\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.390\nAnd here to help us to understand that\na bit better is gonna be Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.660\nWes, welcome back to the studios.\n\n11\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Ronnie for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.640\nGreat to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.180\nThat's right, we're gonna dive in\nto the side of networks that, well,\n\n14\n00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.620\na lot of times we don't see and\nthe technologies that we don't see.\n\n15\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.740\nIt's all in the cloud and\nit's all magic, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.681\nWell no, there are some technologies\nthere that we have to be aware of and\n\n17\n00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:46.430\nthat's kind of what we're gonna look at.\n\n18\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.318\nWe've got quite a few different\ntechnologies to discuss, so\n\n19\n00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.847\nwhat do you say that we go ahead and\nwe will dive right in?\n\n20\n00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:56.640\nNow, when we talk about WAN\nconnectivities, I want you to understand\n\n21\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.440\nit's really about our Internet Service\nProviders that were talking about here.\n\n22\n00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.346\nWhat are the technologies that they\nimplement in order to connect you between\n\n23\n00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:05.920\nlarge geographical regions?\n\n24\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.700\nAnd it can be something\nas simple as a city,\n\n25\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.270\nit could be something as much\nas a worldwide Internet.\n\n26\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.220\nSo we're gonna definitely be looking\nat those, and one of the first\n\n27\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.810\ntechnologies they call out is, well,\na fiber optic technology known as SONET.\n\n28\n00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.490\nSo let's go ahead and\ndescribe what SONET is, and\n\n29\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570\neven what that acronym means, that's the\nSynchronous Optical Networking standard.\n\n30\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.160\nAgain, it is a fiber optic standard.\n\n31\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.592\nIt is a synchronized data communication\ntechnology and it has a lot of bandwidth.\n\n32\n00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.060\nThat's a potential to\nhave a lot of bandwidth.\n\n33\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.936\nLet's go ahead and look at my screen,\nI got a little diagram here, and\n\n34\n00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:43.290\nyou'll see a couple of different terms.\n\n35\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.590\nYou'll see SONET and you'll also see SDH,\nthat's the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy.\n\n36\n00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.040\nIt really depends on where you are.\n\n37\n00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.050\nIf you're here in the states, our American\nNational Standards Institute, ANSI,\n\n38\n00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.300\ncalls it SONET,\nSynchronous Optical Network.\n\n39\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.754\nIf you are in other countries the,\nwhat is it, the ITU-T, the International,\n\n40\n00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:06.850\nTelecommunications Union and this is their\nTelecommunications Standardization Sector.\n\n41\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.210\nThank goodness,\nthey just abbreviate that with a -T and\n\n42\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.780\nthey're the ones that call it SDH or\nSynchronous Digital Hierarchy.\n\n43\n00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.300\nThis is a fiber optic ring technology and\nit is a very fast technology.\n\n44\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.695\nCouple other pieces that you\nwanna be aware of for the exam.\n\n45\n00:02:22.695 --> 00:02:27.550\nThey'd not really gonna ask you to set\nthis up though is the way we actually\n\n46\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.490\nsend data onto the ring and\nthe different types of rings that we have.\n\n47\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.475\nAgain, this is a hierarchical standard,\nit starts more local and\n\n48\n00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:38.965\nthen it works its way to backbone.\n\n49\n00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:42.575\nSONET rings, the closest to you or\nwhat are known as local rings,\n\n50\n00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:44.825\nsometimes local collector rings.\n\n51\n00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:48.290\nAnd then local collector rings\nare aggregated together and\n\n52\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.470\ntheir data is placed on what's\nknown as a regional collector ring.\n\n53\n00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.350\nAnd then finally,\nwhat we do is we get back to the highest\n\n54\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.270\nportion of the hierarchy, and\nthose are those backbone collector rings.\n\n55\n00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.944\nAnd as you can imagine,\n\n56\n00:03:00.944 --> 00:03:05.058\nthey will aggregate multiple\nregional collector rings.\n\n57\n00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:11.856\nNow essentially, these components\nthat we have here, you'll see an ADM.\n\n58\n00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:12.690\nWell, what is that?\n\n59\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.060\nThat's the add-drop multiplexer.\n\n60\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.552\nAnd essentially, what it does is it\nmultiplexes several lower bandwidth\n\n61\n00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:24.530\nfrequencies into a single signal and\nplaces it onto the collector ring.\n\n62\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.040\nThey also call out other things too here,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.430\nwe'll talk about leased lines coming up.\n\n64\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.566\nBut rather than have some of these topics\nall over the place, I wanna go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:35.210\nmention them here.\n\n66\n00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.710\nOptical carrier standards,\nthese are what we use inside of SONET.\n\n67\n00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.548\nYou might see OC-this, OC-that.\n\n68\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.130\nThe ones I really call out for\nthe exam are optical carrier-3 and\n\n69\n00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.570\nthat's a 155.52 megabyte transfer speeds.\n\n70\n00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.335\nIt's, essentially,\nwhat an aggregation of an OC-1 standard,\n\n71\n00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.190\nthe OC-1 standard starts\nat 51.84 megabytes.\n\n72\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.672\nYou have OC-192, OC-12 is another one,\n\n73\n00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:13.059\nthat's 622.08 megabytes or megabits.\n\n74\n00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.716\nAnd no, I didn't have this remembered,\nI had to write it down, so\n\n75\n00:04:15.716 --> 00:04:17.100\nI could remember to tell you guys.\n\n76\n00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.750\nHowever, I will tell you that they could\nask you these standards on the exam.\n\n77\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.381\nBut it might be something\nas simple as saying hey,\n\n78\n00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:27.670\nyou've got this design that you need,\nyou got this transmission speed.\n\n79\n00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.820\nWhich of these technologies will\nallow you that amount of bandwidth?\n\n80\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.601\nThe other one that you see\ntoo on 10 GBASE networks is\n\n81\n00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:40.065\nthe optical carrier-192, OC-192, and\n\n82\n00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:46.134\nthat's just under 10 GB speeds,\nthat's 99.5328 megs.\n\n83\n00:04:46.134 --> 00:04:51.584\nAnd again, just kinda being kinda\nspecific on those standards there and\n\n84\n00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:55.700\nthe speeds there just in case\nthey ask you for the exam.\n\n85\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.509\nNow, there is a couple different\ntechnologies that they also\n\n86\n00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.420\ncall out when they call out fiber optics.\n\n87\n00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.220\nThey call out something\nanother acronym called DWDM,\n\n88\n00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.230\nthe dense wavelength\ndivision multiplexing, and\n\n89\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.900\nthey also call out something called CWDM,\nand that's the course wavelength DM.\n\n90\n00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.412\nWhen it comes down to it,\nthe DWDM has a higher bandwidth.\n\n91\n00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:21.210\nIt's more expensive, but\n\n92\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.909\nit does have a higher bandwidth than\nCWDM due to the frequency spacing.\n\n93\n00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.975\nSo it allows for longer distances\nthan the course wavelength dense, or\n\n94\n00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:33.161\nexcuse me,\ncourse wavelength divisional multiplex,\n\n95\n00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:35.890\nyou gotta try to keep\nthese acronyms straight.\n\n96\n00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.610\nSo you will see that coming for\nlonger and larger runs.\n\n97\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.530\nAgain, you can get more data,\n\n98\n00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.700\nhigher bandwidth again, due to the\nmultiplexing technologies that they use.\n\n99\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.600\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes, before we move\non for a moment because everything in\n\n100\n00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.980\nthe Network+ is tightly integrated\nalso with the LSI model.\n\n101\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.770\nAre we talking about that,\nwe start talking\n\n102\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.410\nabout this fiber optic technology\nspecifically, the ones that you mentioned.\n\n103\n00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.729\nDoes it really care about the IP\naddressing, or the MAC addressing,\n\n104\n00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.300\nor anything about that?\n\n105\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.755\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question,\nRonnie, and the answer is no,\n\n106\n00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:09.770\nbecause SONET is a physical\nlayer technology.\n\n107\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.600\nIt's described at the physical layer.\n\n108\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.362\nAnd in fact, there are other technologies\nthat run on top of it that SONET is not\n\n109\n00:06:15.362 --> 00:06:17.530\naware of,\nthat being one of the things is IP.\n\n110\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.578\nIt doesn't understand that,\n\n111\n00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:21.290\nbecause it's a couple of layers higher\nif you're talking about the OSI model.\n\n112\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.213\nIf you happen to be talking about\nthe TCP/IP model then you're talking about\n\n113\n00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:25.802\nLayer 1.\n\n114\n00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:29.720\nSo yeah,\njust worried about the electrical.\n\n115\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.410\nOr in this case, optical electromagnetic,\nif you will, aspects.\n\n116\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.930\nThe mechanical characteristics\nof the technology is\n\n117\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.250\nreally what is this concern with.\n\n118\n00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.980\nGreat question.\n\n119\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.910\nSo remember that SONET?\n\n120\n00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.960\nAgain, high speed, fiber optic technology.\n\n121\n00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.650\nAgain, very fast technology.\n\n122\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.715\nAnd we'll talk about, later on,\n\n123\n00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:53.575\nsome other WAN-based technologies that\nactually, speaking of the OSI model.\n\n124\n00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:56.020\nIt actually ride right\non top of a SONET line.\n\n125\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.630\nSo do keep that in mind,\nwe will come back to that.\n\n126\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.370\nNow, the next one that we'll look at\nis something known as Frame Relay.\n\n127\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.640\nAnd Frame Relay is another one\nof these WAN technology, again,\n\n128\n00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.120\nthat we are gonna have to be aware of for\nour exam.\n\n129\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.643\nNow, a couple other things about\nframe relay, one of the good things\n\n130\n00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:18.130\nabout it is the transmission errors,\nit doesn't calculate CRCs.\n\n131\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:24.175\nSo it's a very fast communications\ntransmission medium, if you will.\n\n132\n00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.135\nLet's go ahead and let's take a look, and\n\n133\n00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:29.525\nlet's look at a couple of things that\nwe can see inside of our frame relay.\n\n134\n00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:34.610\nI've got kind of just a very, very\nbasic type of frame relay network here.\n\n135\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.650\nNotice that we have a couple of endpoints,\nright?\n\n136\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.430\nWe've got a couple of\ncustomer routers here.\n\n137\n00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.260\nThese are called DTEs,\nthese are the data terminal equipment.\n\n138\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.030\nThis is the stuff that is typically\nthe equipment that's on the inside\n\n139\n00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.760\nof your customer network.\n\n140\n00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.762\nWe also have a series of\nframe relay switches.\n\n141\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.948\nNow, we've got an interesting device here,\nthis DCE, and\n\n142\n00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:58.397\nthe DCE is the data\ncommunication equipment.\n\n143\n00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:01.805\nIt's what's responsible,\nif you will, for Enoding,\n\n144\n00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:06.988\nthe encoding of the traffic that comes off\nof the customer's network, essentially,\n\n145\n00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:11.330\npreparing it to put it on what is known\nas the frame relay bearer service.\n\n146\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.660\nThat is the service that's\nprovided by the telecom.\n\n147\n00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.740\nAnd one of the great\nthings is this is kind of\n\n148\n00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.600\nthe first implementation\nof the Cloud if you will.\n\n149\n00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.680\nBecause we send information off of our\nnetwork through something known as DLCI,\n\n150\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.330\nthe data link connection identifier.\n\n151\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.770\nAnd what that identifies for us is\nessentially this virtual circuit here.\n\n152\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.410\nSo notice that we have, and again,\nthis is a completely virtual path.\n\n153\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.200\nWe don't and see we see what's look\nlike a dedicated connection but\n\n154\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.216\nit's not really right?\n\n155\n00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:50.650\nIt's up to the telco if you will,\nthe telecommunications provider to make\n\n156\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.380\nsure this makes it to the frame's\nrelay network for us.\n\n157\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.210\nAll we see is this right here.\n\n158\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.280\nAnd this creates, it could create a couple\nof different types of circuits for us.\n\n159\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.780\nThis could be a permanent\ncircuits of PVCs.\n\n160\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.730\nKeep in mind with the permanent virtual\ncircuit it means it's always on,\n\n161\n00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.920\nit's always available.\n\n162\n00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.180\nIt can have higher bandwidth and well,\nthink about this, if I was to make a phone\n\n163\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.960\ncall and leave the phone off the hook and\njust leave it off the hook I'd still be\n\n164\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.060\ncharged for those minutes so\nthese can be a little bit more expensive.\n\n165\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.810\nWhen we talk about a virtual\ncircuit like a switch.\n\n166\n00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.110\nVirtual circuit SPC that\nmean it's more on demand.\n\n167\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.090\nIt means I'm gonna use the circuit and\n\n168\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:32.120\nthen once I'll need it, all those\nresources go back over to the telecom and\n\n169\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.330\nthey can be used for\nadditional connections.\n\n170\n00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.560\nThis relates Ronnie like you asked about.\n\n171\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.950\nSonet, can we look at the OSI model,\nwe look at the system layer one and\n\n172\n00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.340\nthe layer two, the layer two is where we\nsee that data link connection identifier,\n\n173\n00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.120\nand in fact Ronnie just reminded me\nthink about the name, data link, right,\n\n174\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.900\nwell that's the data link\nlayer of the OSI model, so\n\n175\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.400\nthat might be a way it can help you in\nthe exam if they say this identifier,\n\n176\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.440\nthat identifies your connection on\na frame relay switch, what layer is it?\n\n177\n00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.400\nThink about the acronym.\n\n178\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.660\nAnd that's why it's good to constantly,\n\n179\n00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.660\nas you're in the NetPlus level,\nI always say the acronyms, right?\n\n180\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.670\nI constantly remind myself\nof what the acronyms are,\n\n181\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.830\nby saying the individual letters in them.\n\n182\n00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.300\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the frame relay.\n\n183\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.620\nAgain keep in mind the equipment\nwe have talked about.\n\n184\n00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.040\nThe DTE.\n\n185\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.010\nRemember the DCE again and\nalso remember the data link\n\n186\n00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.100\nconnection identifier as a way to\nidentify this virtual circuit there.\n\n187\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.377\nAlright, so that is,\nagain a little bit about frame relay.\n\n188\n00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:40.453\nWe've got a couple of technology.\n\n189\n00:10:40.453 --> 00:10:43.461\nSo far what we've been talking\nabout if you look at SONET and\n\n190\n00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:45.687\nyou look at just basically\nthe frame relay,\n\n191\n00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:49.415\nwe've been talking about what's\nknown as bounded media, right?\n\n192\n00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:52.555\nThis media again has a physical\n\n193\n00:10:52.555 --> 00:10:55.045\nbounded connection typically\nthrough cabling, right?\n\n194\n00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:56.332\nOne in this case is fiber.\n\n195\n00:10:56.332 --> 00:10:59.765\nAnd then when we talk about frame relay,\nwe also have bounded cables.\n\n196\n00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:04.840\nBut the next one that we talk about\nthis is a very cool technology as well.\n\n197\n00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.620\nThis is satellite technology.\n\n198\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.860\nNow, satellite technology is interesting.\n\n199\n00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.180\nAll right, satellite technology helps us\nto overcome some barriers that we have\n\n200\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.530\nwith traditional bounded\nconnections right.\n\n201\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.860\nWe'll I want you to think about maybe\na whole area that needs internet.\n\n202\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.420\nNeeds some kind of communication level.\n\n203\n00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.380\nAnd it's not really feasible and\nmaybe they don't have the budget to start\n\n204\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.010\ndigging up and going through construction\nand everything and laying lease lines.\n\n205\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.740\nMaybe they're on the other\nside of a mountain and\n\n206\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.980\nthey really just can't blow up the\nmountain to lay a couple of lines there.\n\n207\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.170\nWell, this is where we can bring\ncommunications through radiated,\n\n208\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.690\nunbounded energy, if you will.\n\n209\n00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.860\nAnd we're not limited to the bound,\nthe you know,\n\n210\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.980\nI guess the bonds that\nwired connections give us.\n\n211\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.940\nIt has an extremely\nlong LOS communication.\n\n212\n00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.770\nNow I throw that acronym out there just so\nif you see it in your documentation or\n\n213\n00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.390\nas you're reading in your studies,\nyou'll recognize it.\n\n214\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.910\nIt just simply means line of sight.\n\n215\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.110\nWell what is the line of sight?\n\n216\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.170\nTypically the curvature of the earth,\nhowever,\n\n217\n00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:11.490\nkeep in mind that while we can\nspend great geographical distances,\n\n218\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.350\nkeep in mind that there could be some\nlatency of delay on this type of network.\n\n219\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.790\nIt's just gonna happen.\n\n220\n00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.510\nAnd the other thing to keep in mind to is\nthat not only do we have the satellites,\n\n221\n00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.530\nwe also have If I, let me go ahead and\n\n222\n00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.790\njust show you,\nwe end up having what the satellite and\n\n223\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:34.440\nthen we have some kind of radio tower\nthat this is going to communicate with.\n\n224\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.640\nSo even though we call satellite\ncommunications unbounded media,\n\n225\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.170\nit really uses a combination of\nwired media and wireless media.\n\n226\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.180\nIf you think about it the satellite\ncommunication up to the satellite and\n\n227\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.800\nback down to the tower.\n\n228\n00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.280\nSure, that's unbounded connections but\n\n229\n00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.010\nthose radio towers are typically wired in,\nso it is using a combination of both.\n\n230\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.570\nYou should keep that in mind but satellite\ncommunications, the biggest thing\n\n231\n00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:03.410\nhere is the great geographical instances\nthat can bring communications that.\n\n232\n00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.140\nOtherwise we just wouldn't have.\n\n233\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.790\nAll right, now this next one\nI don't have a slide for but\n\n234\n00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.120\nI do wanna kind of mention it,\nbroad band cable.\n\n235\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:20.840\nWhen it comes to broad band cable, these\nmodems as they call them, cable modems.\n\n236\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.780\nThey're kinda interesting.\n\n237\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.320\nIt depends on what's in them\nthat defines what they're doing.\n\n238\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.340\nYes, they do some form of modulation,\n\n239\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.440\ndigital signal if they happen\nto have an ethernet connection,\n\n240\n00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.480\nan ethernet adapter in them which\na lot of them have and guess what?\n\n241\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.830\nThey're operating on layer two.\n\n242\n00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.850\nIf you can assign an IP address to it and\n\n243\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.100\nit's a network aware address, you've got\nan IP address assigned to this device.\n\n244\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.740\nWell then it's operating on layer three.\n\n245\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.710\nBut for the most part,\nI believe, and Ronnie,\n\n246\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.270\nI might even defer to you on this one.\n\n247\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.920\nI think these are just\nprimarily called a layer\n\n248\n00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.070\ntwo device if I'm\nunderstanding this right?\n\n249\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.360\nDo you get that same thing, cuz I've seen\nsome conflicting reports on that one.\n\n250\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.590\n&gt;&gt; I would say so yeah, that layer one,\nlayer two is where we tend to see it.\n\n251\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.600\nThe end points are actually addressed\nwith, of course, layer three.\n\n252\n00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.540\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so and that's why I say,\ndepends on who you talk to because if you\n\n253\n00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.470\njust break down the components,\nwhat are the components doing?\n\n254\n00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:15.190\nIf I have a port on that device that\nI'm plugging an ethernet cable in\n\n255\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.820\nEthernet operates at layer two and\nlayer one because of the physical cabling.\n\n256\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.590\nIf it happens to be network address\nwhat I can assign an IP address to it,\n\n257\n00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.370\nmaybe it's performing things like DHCP.\n\n258\n00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.410\nNow, we're going all the way\nup to the application layer.\n\n259\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.569\nSo, pay attention to\nthe functionality of the cable modem.\n\n260\n00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:35.294\nKeep in mind that its major\nresponsibility is to divide the traffic,\n\n261\n00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:41.080\nyou have the TV signal, the CA TV signal\nthat goes into your top box, if you will.\n\n262\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.830\nAnd then you have the network and\nthe communications that are typically sent\n\n263\n00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.700\nover to whatever the networking\ndevice is that is connected to it.\n\n264\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.940\nCould be your computer,\n\n265\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.620\ncould be a laptop just depends on how\nyou have your home network set up.\n\n266\n00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.180\nAlright, let's see, Where are we?\n\n267\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.260\nWe have a couple more here to go through.\n\n268\n00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.680\nNext one that we are going\nto go through is.\n\n269\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.430\nWell I could have lumped\nall of these together.\n\n270\n00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.630\nWe'll talk about them individually and\nI did this based on the modem themselves\n\n271\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.480\nbecause all three of these technologies\nuse modems in a certain way.\n\n272\n00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.355\nSo if we could go ahead and look at our.\n\n273\n00:15:14.355 --> 00:15:15.765\nLook at my slide here.\n\n274\n00:15:15.765 --> 00:15:18.065\nI'm gonna start out with a DSL.\n\n275\n00:15:18.065 --> 00:15:21.965\nBut I do just wanna kinda\nmention dial-up DSL and ISDN.\n\n276\n00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:27.465\nKeep in mind, these are typically a lot of\ntimes sending information over PSTN lines,\n\n277\n00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:31.630\nand Remember when we talked about a PSTN\nline we're talking about an analog signal\n\n278\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.670\nversus your digital signals coming\nout of your computer, right?\n\n279\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.790\nSo that was the purpose of the modem that\nwe mentioned in our previous episode\n\n280\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.120\nModulator Demodulate,\nModulation Demodulation.\n\n281\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.448\nAnd I told you to really think of it\nthis way, you're taking a digital signal\n\n282\n00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:50.256\nelectrical impulses, and\nyou're turning it into a sound, and\n\n283\n00:15:50.256 --> 00:15:52.910\nthen you're sending it over\nthose traditional pstn lines.\n\n284\n00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.234\nOne of the ones that I want to talk\nabout is something known as well,\n\n285\n00:15:57.234 --> 00:16:01.784\nthere's my other satellite drawing\nthat I was going to show you guys with\n\n286\n00:16:01.784 --> 00:16:04.720\nthe The base station there is DSL,\nall right.\n\n287\n00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.220\nNow your DSL, what happens?\n\n288\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.550\nWell, you have your subscriber modems,\nright, and\n\n289\n00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:13.490\nkeep in mind, these subscriber modems\nare something known as the CPE.\n\n290\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.180\nCustomer Premise Equipment, all right.\n\n291\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.690\nAnd then we have our PSTN lines and\ngoing into our Telco,\n\n292\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.670\nwe have what's known as a DSLAM,\nthe DSLAM.\n\n293\n00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.670\nLet me see if I can remember this,\nI have to write this one down.\n\n294\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.180\nDigital Subscriber Line Access Multiplier.\n\n295\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.480\nAnd what this does, is this takes\nmultiple signals from multiple\n\n296\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.670\nlocations and\ncombines them into one signal.\n\n297\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.430\nRight.\nThat's what the multiplexer does.\n\n298\n00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.350\nYou might call it Max device,\nyou might hear the term D Max, and\n\n299\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.620\nthat's the other way, right.\n\n300\n00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.910\nWe're going downstream.\n\n301\n00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:51.350\nWe're coming back off of\nthe high-speed backbone network.\n\n302\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.210\nAnd it D multiplexes them.\n\n303\n00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.190\nSo that's what the DSLAM does.\n\n304\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.440\nAnd then it's usually connected to\nsome kind of high speed backbone\n\n305\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.610\nthat is then turned around and it is\nconnected to whatever the TELCO switch is.\n\n306\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.970\nNow what's kinda interesting\nis there is a limit\n\n307\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.040\nto how far away from that\nTelco switch you can be.\n\n308\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.610\nAnd I do want you guys to\nkinda be aware of that limit.\n\n309\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:13.430\nThere is a hard limit.\n\n310\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.330\nYou have a certain\ndistance that you can be.\n\n311\n00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:20.600\nAnd this they call out 5.5 kilometers and,\nis that kilometers?\n\n312\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.140\nI believe 18,000 feet?\n\n313\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.350\n18,000 feet is the hard\nlimit from the switch?\n\n314\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.900\nAnd even shorter distances for\n\n315\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.390\none that they call out which\nis the Asynchronous DSL.\n\n316\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.660\nADSL is a little bit shorter of a distance\nthere because as the speed goes up,\n\n317\n00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.070\ntypically your length from\nthe switch actually is reduced.\n\n318\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.020\nLet's see here.\n\n319\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.170\nADSL, it's interesting,\nDSL is layer one of the OSI model.\n\n320\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.620\nI know my notes say, and I'll make\nsure that I correct this in the notes.\n\n321\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.250\nI know I have layer two in there,\nthat's not correct,\n\n322\n00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.170\nit's layer one of the OSI model and\nlayer one of the TCPIP model.\n\n323\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.120\nSo, do be aware of that.\n\n324\n00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.980\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, so taking a look at the\nother technologies that you also had on\n\n325\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.750\nthe screen and\nI also saw the acronym ISDN.\n\n326\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.390\nLet's hear a little bit more about that.\n\n327\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right Ryan,\nanother acronym,\n\n328\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.290\nIntegrated Services Digital Network\n&gt;&gt; Now let's go ahead and\n\n329\n00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.200\ntake look at my screen.\n\n330\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.340\nNow what we're gonna be doing is\nessentially is digitizing our signal and\n\n331\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.460\nthen attaching it to those\ntraditional phone lines.\n\n332\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.930\nNow, does require a little extra\nequipment to be able to do that.\n\n333\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.510\nBut let's go ahead and let's talk about\nthe types of services that are provided\n\n334\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.530\nwith the Integrated Services Digital\nnetwork.\n\n335\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.170\nAnd one of them is called\nbasic rate interface and\n\n336\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.150\nthe other one is\nthe primary rate interface.\n\n337\n00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.730\nAnd depending on which one,\n\n338\n00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.780\nwhat bandwidth you need is which\none's largely that you would have.\n\n339\n00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.250\nA lot of times the higher bandwidth one\nis one that you would see inside of\n\n340\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.150\nthe Telco Company.\n\n341\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:51.440\nSo for instance with the basic rate\ninterface, ISDN, what you have\n\n342\n00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.730\nare two 64 kilobit channels, if I can get\nthat number right, for an overall of 128k.\n\n343\n00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.810\nNow what is a B channel?\n\n344\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:58.920\nWhat is a bearer channel?\n\n345\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.140\nA bearer channel is responsible for\nactually moving the data along the line.\n\n346\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.410\nAnd the Delta channel, that's\nresponsible for the signaling, right.\n\n347\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.010\nThe maintaining of the communication.\n\n348\n00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.400\nAnd breaking it down.\n\n349\n00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.950\nAll right, this were\ntraditionally send over T1 lines,\n\n350\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.070\nand that' why I kinda get\nthat over here to the side.\n\n351\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:21.500\nNow, what if you happen to need or is\nthere a technology an ICDN that allows for\n\n352\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.370\nmore bandwidth and\nthat's the primary rate interface.\n\n353\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:29.490\nNow, the primary rate interface instead of\nusing just two of these bearer channels.\n\n354\n00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.670\nThis actually uses 24 bearer channels and\n\n355\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.210\nthen a D channel as well, and\nthat's a 64k delta channel,.\n\n356\n00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:45.180\nThis primary rate ISDN has an overall\nspeed of 1.544 megabit transfer speed,\n\n357\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.230\nand I want you to remember that speed,\n1.44 megabits.\n\n358\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.160\nIt's not the only place\nthat you're gonna see it.\n\n359\n00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.840\nYou might see it come up again.\n\n360\n00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.630\nNow when I mentioned the term t carrier.\n\n361\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.680\nWhat did I mean by that?\n\n362\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.555\nWell t carrier is a system that we use in\nhere in the States that defines a certain\n\n363\n00:20:02.555 --> 00:20:05.865\nspeed of transfer that the line\ncan produce and we have for\n\n364\n00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:08.785\ninstance Japan lines with us too.\n\n365\n00:20:08.785 --> 00:20:09.405\nT1 and J1.\n\n366\n00:20:09.405 --> 00:20:12.795\nT1 in here the States and\nJ1 being in Japan.\n\n367\n00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:17.598\nAnd that, T1 line or J1 line has a overall\n\n368\n00:20:17.598 --> 00:20:21.780\nbandwidth of 1.44 megabit transfer speed.\n\n369\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:22.870\n&gt;&gt; 544.\n&gt;&gt; 544, thank you.\n\n370\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.050\nAnd then Europe is a little bit\ndifferent and Australia with theirs.\n\n371\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.609\nThey actually have one that combines 30 of\nthese bearer channels and 1 delta channel.\n\n372\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.590\nAnd you can see there's our\n2.048 megabit transfer speed.\n\n373\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.260\nSo, I do kinda wanna put that one in\nthere so that you are aware of it.\n\n374\n00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.940\nLet's see here Ronnie,\ndid I forget anything there?\n\n375\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.210\nThis is an OSI layer one technology.\n\n376\n00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.940\nAnd if you are following along with TCP IP\nmono, keep in mind that this a layer one.\n\n377\n00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.810\nOne technology as well.\n\n378\n00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\n\n379\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.660\nwell that's a lot of different LAN\ntechnologies that we've kind of went over.\n\n380\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.890\nAnd you need to make sure that\nyou do at least know the names\n\n381\n00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.920\nof these technologies, understand their\noperation that the OSI model, and\n\n382\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.230\neven some of the details, especially\nthe numbers that Wes has mentioned.\n\n383\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.130\nA lot of this is just basic memorization,\nif you're getting ready for\n\n384\n00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.470\nthe Network Plus exam.\n\n385\n00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.850\nBut they do expect you\nto know this technology.\n\n386\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.540\nA lot of the technology that Wes\ntalked about, such as the ISDN and\n\n387\n00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.410\neven the frame relay,\nyou're not gonna see them as prevalent,\n\n388\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.420\nanymore, in today's networking technology.\n\n389\n00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.930\nBut do they still exist?\n\n390\n00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:27.720\nYes.\n\n391\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.720\nDo they still expect to know a little\nbit about the functioning of them,\n\n392\n00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.120\nyes they do because it could be that your\nparticular network today is still using\n\n393\n00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.690\nsomething like this as a back\nup type of connection too.\n\n394\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.600\nThe ISDN still fairly popular,\n\n395\n00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.290\nespecially if we have zip phones on\nyour line as well, to be able to provide\n\n396\n00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.070\na different alternative network rather\nthan just your same ethernet network, too.\n\n397\n00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.660\nSo just kinda realize that all that\nis actually part of the plan and\n\n398\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.930\nthe idea of things that\nyou have available, okay.\n\n399\n00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.650\nNow with all this different technology,\n\n400\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.740\nthat means that I wish I could\ntell you that's the end.\n\n401\n00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.750\nBut there's not.\n\n402\n00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.310\nThere's plenty of more\ndifferent LAN technologies, but\n\n403\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.770\nwe're gonna save that for another part.\n\n404\n00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.400\nAnd that means it's a great place for\nus to sign off for this episode then.\n\n405\n00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.380\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n406\n00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n407\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.098\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore CompTIA Network Plus.\n\n408\n00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:25.772\n[MUSIC]\n\n409\n00:22:25.772 --> 00:22:29.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:16.157\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:19.165\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CompTIA Network+.\n\n6\n00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:26.180\nIn this episode we're gonna be continuing\nour thought process on WAN technologies.\n\n7\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410\nAnd here to help us with that is the\nmaster of all things CompTIA Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n8\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.170\nWelcome back Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.160\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Mike for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.190\nYeah, I better live up to that name for\nsure.\n\n11\n00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.340\nThat's right, we're coming back with\na part two on WAN technologies,\n\n12\n00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.280\nlike Mike's already told you.\n\n13\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.478\nAnd that's because I talked\nway too much in the first one.\n\n14\n00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:44.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now in all truthfulness guys,\n\n15\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.520\nseriousness, we got a lot of\ntechnologies that we can use\n\n16\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.880\nwhen we're traversing those carrier\nlinks out there, ISPs if you will.\n\n17\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.200\nAnd CompTIA doesn't really expect you to\nknow how to configure these things, but\n\n18\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.370\nthey do want you to know at least\nsome of the characteristics and\n\n19\n00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.880\nthe attributes of the technologies\nthat we use to connect LANs together.\n\n20\n00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.900\nWe're gonna start right off, we're gonna\nstart off with one that is known that is\n\n21\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.840\nknown as the autonomous transfer mode,\nATM.\n\n22\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.140\nThis is an interesting technology,\nit's a relatively fast technology.\n\n23\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.520\nIt's been around since the 90s.\n\n24\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.260\nATM, don't confuse this with the,\nwhat is it?\n\n25\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.470\nThe automated?\n\n26\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Teller machines?\n\n27\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.650\n&gt;&gt; Teller machines, yeah, thanks Mike.\n\n28\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.740\n&gt;&gt; I was looking for where to put\nmy card in and punch in my PIN, but\n\n29\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.280\nnot with this ATM, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.480\n&gt;&gt; No, not at all.\n\n31\n00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.970\n[LAUGH] ATM is one of those WAN links\nthat is, it's actually kinda cool.\n\n32\n00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.120\nIt's the core of a couple technologies\nthat we have, believe it or not.\n\n33\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.160\nIn fact, we talked about\nthe digital subscriber line,\n\n34\n00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.100\nwhat is it the access multiplexer,\nright, the DSLAM inside of DSL.\n\n35\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.080\nWell guess what?\n\n36\n00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.860\nYour DSL connection,\n\n37\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.960\nthat DSLAM what it's multiplexing to put\nthat signal on really is an ATM network.\n\n38\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.750\nAt the physical layer now,\nwhen we talk about the physical layer,\n\n39\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.600\nbecause an ATM by the way\nis OSI model layer 2.\n\n40\n00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.360\nIt's interesting in the fact that\nthe physical layer, this is actually going\n\n41\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.720\nover the fiber optic lines that\nwe've talked about SONET, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.460\nThe Synchronous Optical Networking\nTechnology, if I get that acronym right.\n\n43\n00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.080\nAnd then in the European states,\nin other countries,\n\n44\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.940\nyou might hear it called SDH and\nthat's the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy.\n\n45\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.810\nSo a couple different names.\n\n46\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.130\nOne's for ANSI there.\n\n47\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.380\nHere in the states and\n\n48\n00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.180\nthe other one is that International\nTelecommunications Union that\n\n49\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.770\nthey have over in Europe,\nso do be aware of that.\n\n50\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.280\nNow, one of the other things Mike that I\n\n51\n00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.062\nkind of find fascinating about this\ntechnology is that it's a fixed data size.\n\n52\n00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:36.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and one of the things\nthat I think makes it so fast, or\n\n53\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.020\nit helps, with the performance of it is\nthe fact that it's a fixed-size window.\n\n54\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.310\nAnd it's not that big either.\n\n55\n00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.240\nWhat, 53 bytes?\n\n56\n00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.630\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely!\n\n57\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.180\nAnd if you think about what that means for\nme,\n\n58\n00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.110\nif I'm gonna send Mike a letter, right?\n\n59\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.770\nAnd he knows exactly how big that\nletter's gonna be every time.\n\n60\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.010\nWell, he knows what?\n\n61\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.140\nI know how big of a folder I\nmight need to put it in, right.\n\n62\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.950\nPredictability, every time it goes\nthrough I know it's gonna be 53 bites.\n\n63\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.530\nIt's not like packet switching, right?\n\n64\n00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.620\nAnd we'll talk about that, we'll show you\na little bit more towards the end where\n\n65\n00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.030\nevery little packet could\nbe a difference in size.\n\n66\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.840\nSo, for instance, like TCP right.\n\n67\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, if you're talking\nabout a technology that's used as maybe\n\n68\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.910\na sliding window,\nit's recalculating every so\n\n69\n00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.820\noften how big we can make that packet and\nstill get good throughput.\n\n70\n00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.400\nThere's overhead involved in that.\n\n71\n00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.130\nAnd if a router or device says look\nat byte 53, I know that's the end.\n\n72\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.030\nI don't have to wait for the next piece\nto come in to see if it's the end,\n\n73\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.850\nI already know it;s the end I can send it,\nand so that's where we start to\n\n74\n00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.780\nsee a little bit of speed up is that\npredictability, hey last byte's here.\n\n75\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.995\nit's gone, I don't have to wait to see,\nwas this the end, or\n\n76\n00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.925\nwas there a little bit more I\nwanna try to shove in here.\n\n77\n00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:43.875\n&gt;&gt; And that's right, and\nyou couple something like that,\n\n78\n00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.535\nwe're going a little bit higher\nin the layers with like, TCP,\n\n79\n00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:50.125\nit's calling for re-transmissions and\ndiscarding information.\n\n80\n00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.180\nThis is connection oriented,\nand layer, too so\n\n81\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.310\none of the great things about is not only\nthe predictability that we're talking\n\n82\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.970\nabout as the fact that I have an end\nto end guaranteed communication\n\n83\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.360\nwhich is one those things that\ndoes make it a fairly fast.\n\n84\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.940\nAll right Mike,\nlet me see if I forgot anything on that.\n\n85\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.260\nI don't believe so just-\n&gt;&gt; We\n\n86\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.976\nmentioned that there we're\ncell switching as well?\n\n87\n00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:12.510\n&gt;&gt; Cell switching, that's right and\nI should say, and thank you for\n\n88\n00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.670\nreminding me there Mike.\n\n89\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.040\nThat the data units, right?\n\n90\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.100\nWe talk about packet-switching,\nwe talk about circuit-switching,\n\n91\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.120\nthe old PSTN lines and stuff?\n\n92\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.470\nWell this is self-switching.\n\n93\n00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.240\nAnd again, those 53-byte cells,\nas they call it,\n\n94\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.760\nare the unit of data measurement that\nwe're gonna put onto that technology.\n\n95\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.700\nAll right, so the next one we gotta talk\nabout, It's actually been around for\n\n96\n00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.400\na very long time and we're still using it\ntoday just because of its flexibility.\n\n97\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.150\nNow, what we have here is\nsomething known as PPP.\n\n98\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.360\nPPP, again, has been around for\na while, and let's go ahead,\n\n99\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.900\nI kinda drew a little slide here.\n\n100\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.480\nNow, PPP, the Point-to-Point Protocol,\nit's originally made for\n\n101\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.350\nthe serial point-to-point lines and\n\n102\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.490\nexpects to have some kinda dedicated\npath in between source and destination.\n\n103\n00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.330\nAnd then what PPP,\nthe point to point protocol does is it\n\n104\n00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.610\nallows us to encapsulate other layers or\nthree protocols like IP.\n\n105\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.430\nWe can encapsulate that and\nsend it through.\n\n106\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.260\nIt's made up of a few things and\n\n107\n00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.830\nwe do wanna make sure that we\nunderstand the components of.\n\n108\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.620\nAgain, remember the encapsulation part.\n\n109\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.440\nWe've kinda talked about\nthe encapsulation.\n\n110\n00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.360\nRemember with I always use like the\nRussian doll, we have a smaller doll and\n\n111\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.400\nthen we put a bigger one and\nthen a bigger one and\n\n112\n00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.600\nthen we wrap a bigger one around it.\n\n113\n00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.520\nWe can't really tell what that one\nin the middle, what color it is or\n\n114\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.180\nanything unless we were there putting\nit together, then maybe we do.\n\n115\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.289\nWell that's what PPP is doing.\n\n116\n00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.263\nAll right, see the point-to-point\nprotocol, really is just for\n\n117\n00:05:33.263 --> 00:05:35.730\nsending information over\na direct serial connection.\n\n118\n00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.280\nHowever, we can couple that with other\ntechnologies, like some of them higher\n\n119\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.960\nlayer technologies if we need to\nimplement things like routing.\n\n120\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.590\nSo the encapsulation of multiple protocols\nis something that we need to be aware of.\n\n121\n00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.140\nIt also uses what's known as an LCP guys,\n\n122\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.330\nI know, another acronym,\nthat's the link control protocol.\n\n123\n00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.120\nI just want you to be aware of that\nin case they ask you on the exam.\n\n124\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.580\nThe other thing that it also has is\na group or a family as they call it,\n\n125\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.410\na family of network control protocol.\n\n126\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.659\nSo those are the three major components\nthat we wanna be aware of PPP.\n\n127\n00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.570\nIt's a full duplex communication\nthat is something also to know.\n\n128\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.680\nThis is a layer 2 technology,\n\n129\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.490\nif you're talking about OSI\nlayer 1 of the TCP/IP model.\n\n130\n00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.380\nWhich in other episodes, we will talk\npretty extensively about the OSI and\n\n131\n00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.500\nthe TCP/IP models.\n\n132\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.510\nBut, we want as we go through this course,\nthat when you are watching the OSI model.\n\n133\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.710\nLet's say you start watching the OSI model\nfirst which is what I really needed to\n\n134\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.510\ndo when I was studying\nthat place because theory,\n\n135\n00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.820\nwhoa, I don't know what packets look\nlike as they go across the wire.\n\n136\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.440\nI don't know if they have nice pink\nlittle ribbons or anything like that.\n\n137\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.130\nSo the theory was a little bit different.\n\n138\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.009\nSo if some of theory that we throw\nwhen we say OSI and TCP/IP models,\n\n139\n00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.930\nmake sure you check those episodes out.\n\n140\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.800\nAnd then come back and watch these, so\nyou'll know where on the OSI model and\n\n141\n00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.750\nthose TCP/IP models that it does apply.\n\n142\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.520\nAll right, a couple of variants of PPP is\nyou can also do this over Ethernet and\n\n143\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.500\nyou can do this over ATM and\nthose variants are called PPP OE.\n\n144\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.320\nI can only imagine that's for\nEthernet, right?\n\n145\n00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.950\nAnd PPP OA or\nthat's Point to Point Protocol over ATM.\n\n146\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.410\nAnd keep in mind why we say,\nwe have to say over ATM and over Ethernet.\n\n147\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.500\nWhat layers of the OSI model did they set?\n\n148\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.660\nWell they set on the same layer as PPP.\n\n149\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.640\nTCP IP where IP pockets, we're not\nworried about cuz that's a layer higher.\n\n150\n00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.660\nWhat else?\n\n151\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.080\nI'm gonna throw it in here, just because\nI want to mention the standards body\n\n152\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.550\nthat oversees the RFCs, this RFC is 1661.\n\n153\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.200\nNow, I don't expect you to get in there\nunless you're a geek and really want to.\n\n154\n00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.620\nBy all means, it'll help you out.\n\n155\n00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.370\nRFCs are requests for comments and\nthey're collegiate documentation, right?\n\n156\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.249\nIt really breaks down at a minute level,\n\n157\n00:07:58.249 --> 00:08:01.086\nalmost on an engineering level\nwhat this protocol is doing.\n\n158\n00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:05.354\nBut just in case they ask you again,\nRFC, request for comment 1661.\n\n159\n00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:08.907\nAnd I wanna mention the standards\nbody that oversees the RFCs.\n\n160\n00:08:08.907 --> 00:08:11.827\nBoy that's a lot of,\nthat can get tongue-tied real quick.\n\n161\n00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:16.229\n[LAUGH] And that's IETF, that's\nthe Internet Engineering Task Force,\n\n162\n00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.680\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n163\n00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.500\nNow there's another one here too,\nand you might see I haven't\n\n164\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.010\neven mentioned it on our slide here,\nthat I've also got multipoint PPP.\n\n165\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:30.445\nYou can have multiple serial connections,\nmultiple point-to-point connections.\n\n166\n00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:33.890\nAnd then what this basically says is that\nI can aggregate more than one of those\n\n167\n00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.330\nserial connections over\nthe same communication, and\n\n168\n00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.580\npotentially increase your bandwidth so\nthat'd be your multilink PPP.\n\n169\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.110\nAnd again, it's just more than one of\nthose point-to-point connections used\n\n170\n00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.919\nbasically bonded or aggregated together\nin order to get a higher bandwidth.\n\n171\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.028\nAll right, so\nI think we've got everything on PPP.\n\n172\n00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:55.210\nJust again, do keep in mind\nthe variants just in case it comes up.\n\n173\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.189\nWhich of these is a point\nto point technology?\n\n174\n00:08:57.189 --> 00:09:00.030\n[LAUGH] It might not be as easy as that.\n\n175\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.609\nIt might be something else that they word\nit, asking you for some of the variants.\n\n176\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.390\nAll right, so\nthe next technology we have, and\n\n177\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.570\nthis is kind of a fascinating\ntechnology for me, Mike.\n\n178\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.310\nThis is something called MPLS,\nand MPLS is kinda,\n\n179\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.958\nI wanna say the wave of the future but\nit's been around for a bit now.\n\n180\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.919\nIt's not like it's brand new technology,\nbut\n\n181\n00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:24.300\nit is one that can ultimately replace\nthings like frame relay and ATM.\n\n182\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.570\nNot saying that it will, but one of the\nthings that's great about something known\n\n183\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.570\nas the multi-label protocol\nswitching technology's exactly that.\n\n184\n00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.167\nThat it's not bound to any\none single protocol, and\n\n185\n00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:38.372\nthat's why hence the name multi-protocol.\n\n186\n00:09:38.372 --> 00:09:45.686\nIt can be used over things like ethernet,\nATM, Sonnet, frame relay, T1, T3, OC3.\n\n187\n00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:48.873\nAnd all those other acronyms too, which\nwe're gonna talk about the lease lines.\n\n188\n00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:52.310\nI mentioned that in the first part here\nguys, I haven't left you hanging on that.\n\n189\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.980\nSome of the T carriers and\noptical carriers,\n\n190\n00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.670\nwe're gonna talk about at\nthe end of this episode.\n\n191\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.550\nSo if that doesn't make sense just hold on\nguys, I won't leave you hanging on that.\n\n192\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.595\nSo back to MPLS,\n\n193\n00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:05.387\nwhen we look at multi-label protocol\nswitching it's kinda interesting.\n\n194\n00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:10.085\nBecause when you look at the customer's\ndevices, the end point, MPLS routers,\n\n195\n00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:12.755\nthey do kinda like a TCIP router does,\nright?\n\n196\n00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:15.336\nWhat does it do when it needs\nto pass information to a route?\n\n197\n00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:19.289\nIt looks up the next hop if you will,\nit looks up the route,\n\n198\n00:10:19.289 --> 00:10:22.841\nthe location,\nthe destination of the next hop, and\n\n199\n00:10:22.841 --> 00:10:27.310\nit puts that information in the header and\nit sends it on its way.\n\n200\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.190\nSo that starting point, the first\nMPLS router does something like that.\n\n201\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.290\nNow, it's not looking at IP addresses,\nright?\n\n202\n00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.720\nWe're talking about down here at layer\ntwo, and I've even heard [LAUGH] some\n\n203\n00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.686\npeople kinda joke around that\nthis is a layer 2.5 technology.\n\n204\n00:10:40.686 --> 00:10:43.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In between layer three and layer two,\n\n205\n00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.999\nbut the point is it's not tied to IP.\n\n206\n00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:51.942\nSo what the very first router does is it\nlooks really kind of like a destination,\n\n207\n00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:54.526\nthe destination router, right?\n\n208\n00:10:54.526 --> 00:10:57.837\nSo this router over here does the look up,\nand it says okay,\n\n209\n00:10:57.837 --> 00:11:00.920\nI see the destination router's over here.\n\n210\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.680\nWell let me look at the path, the logical\npath that it takes to get it there.\n\n211\n00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.790\nAnd what I'll do is that logical\npath will be determined,\n\n212\n00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.980\nor be denoted I should say,\nin the packet, by a label.\n\n213\n00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.570\nIt puts that label on it and\nthen it sends it out over figuratively,\n\n214\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.400\nwe'll say the wire, and\nit sends it out over the wire.\n\n215\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.590\nAnd then once it hits\nthe carrier's network,\n\n216\n00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.590\nall the carrier's network\nis looking at is the label.\n\n217\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.630\nIt doesn't have to do any routing\ndecisions like IP does, where at every hop\n\n218\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.250\nwe're inspecting the layer three header,\nor layer two header if you will.\n\n219\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.700\nThen the layer three header, and\nthen we just pass it on to the next top.\n\n220\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.680\nThis does all,\nthe very first router does all the lookup.\n\n221\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.880\nIt says what is the end end path?\n\n222\n00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.053\nLet me put a label representing that path,\nand\n\n223\n00:11:48.053 --> 00:11:50.520\nI'll send it out to the carrier's network.\n\n224\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.280\nThen once it hits the carrier's network,\nit moves pretty fast over that\n\n225\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.105\ncarrier's network cuz all it\nhas to do is look at the label.\n\n226\n00:11:57.105 --> 00:12:00.320\nRight, it doesn't have to make\na decision on which router to send it.\n\n227\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.280\nIt knows what the next\nrouter is based on that\n\n228\n00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.200\npredetermined path that has\nthe label associated with it.\n\n229\n00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.990\n&gt;&gt; So they're making no decisions,\nas you said,\n\n230\n00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.430\nI like that word you used,\nthe route is predetermined.\n\n231\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.400\nOnce it gets to them there is no well,\nlet me check and\n\n232\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.760\nsee which way is faster,\nit's going this way.\n\n233\n00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.490\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n234\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.740\n&gt;&gt; So faster then,\nbecause you've got less overhead,\n\n235\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.930\nless decisions being made\nby those carrier's routers.\n\n236\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.400\nBut then I would also\nthink maybe some issues,\n\n237\n00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.680\nif there's a change in the network,\n\n238\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.060\nunfortunately that packet's already\nlabeled and that's the way it's going.\n\n239\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there could be that, absolutely.\n\n240\n00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.930\nWhat's interesting too, Mike, is that the\nend router actually strips off the label,\n\n241\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.320\nand then normal IP process\nhappens after that.\n\n242\n00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.270\nSo while it's on the carriers network,\nit's doing the label switching, and\n\n243\n00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.240\nthat's all those carrier network\nMPLS routers are looking at.\n\n244\n00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.480\nBut it's interesting is that once\nit does hit this router right here,\n\n245\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.680\nthe MPLS router will remove that label.\n\n246\n00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.340\nAnd then from there,\n\n247\n00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.120\nthe normal IP process does, to get it to\nits final destination and its delivery.\n\n248\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.850\nSo again, very versatile.\n\n249\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.161\nAnd that's one of the great things\nabout MPLS, it's here to stay and\n\n250\n00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:05.006\nI've read some stuff that says it's\ngonna replace this and replace that.\n\n251\n00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:09.390\nAnd well if it did replace this, this\nepisode would be a lot shorter, right.\n\n252\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.009\n[LAUGH] We wouldn't be talking\nabout all those old technologies,\n\n253\n00:13:12.009 --> 00:13:14.016\ncuz it hasn't completely\nreplaced everything.\n\n254\n00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:17.070\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes those crystal balls\nget a little cloudy, don't they?\n\n255\n00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, absolutely.\n\n256\n00:13:19.306 --> 00:13:23.235\nAll right, so that looks like\nit takes care of a lot of our,\n\n257\n00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:27.908\nthe majority of our LAN technologies\nwhen it comes to bounded media.\n\n258\n00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:30.320\nNow we did talk a little\nbit about satellite, right,\n\n259\n00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.020\nunbounded radiated energy.\n\n260\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.989\nNow the next one that\nwe have to talk about,\n\n261\n00:13:33.989 --> 00:13:35.968\nwell these are cellular communications.\n\n262\n00:13:35.968 --> 00:13:39.150\nAnd there's quite a few of them,\nbut let's go ahead and\n\n263\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:43.025\njust introduce you to some of\nthe basics of the cell communication.\n\n264\n00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:46.520\nWe're gonna talk about each one of\nthese individually coming up, but Mike,\n\n265\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.690\nI'm gonna show you my\nlovely drawings here.\n\n266\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.232\nAll right, [LAUGH] well.\n\n267\n00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:50.737\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n\n268\n00:13:50.737 --> 00:13:51.644\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n269\n00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:55.730\nthe goal of cells, when we talk about\ncells what are we talking about?\n\n270\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.670\nBut we're essentially talking about\na radio tower that covers a certain\n\n271\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.280\ngeographical range, right.\n\n272\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.580\nNow this is not really the greatest\nexact kind of drawing,\n\n273\n00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.500\ncuz really guys, when it comes down to it,\na cell is trying to overlap, right?\n\n274\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.070\nI don't know if you guys have,\n\n275\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.920\nsome of you guys probably have been in\na dead zone when you've got your phone.\n\n276\n00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.132\nWell, what the companies try to do is they\ntry to make sure that all these towers,\n\n277\n00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:23.320\nright, they overlap so that we don't\nhave any gaps in the coverage.\n\n278\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.161\nWell that doesn't always happen,\nand you guys know.\n\n279\n00:14:25.161 --> 00:14:30.187\nI'm sure many of you guys [LAUGH] out\nthere probably traveled before and\n\n280\n00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:31.557\nyou're, [SOUND].\n\n281\n00:14:31.557 --> 00:14:34.810\nAnd you're like well wait a second, am I,\n[LAUGH] in fact our producers are going\n\n282\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.830\nmy gosh,\nwhat's wrong with the audio right now?\n\n283\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.002\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's what ends up happening,\n\n284\n00:14:39.002 --> 00:14:42.538\nright, because as Wes gets in his\nsuper shiny hot rod here, and\n\n285\n00:14:42.538 --> 00:14:47.575\nhe's driving along, driving along, driving\nalong, I got coverage, I got coverage.\n\n286\n00:14:47.575 --> 00:14:51.010\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nI don't have coverage, right?\n\n287\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.030\nSo what are these?\n\n288\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.900\nThese are the areas that aren't covered,\nright.\n\n289\n00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.840\nWe don't have an overlap in the cell,\nso we don't get signal, right.\n\n290\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.694\nAs my car, and\nyou know I love the car, right?\n\n291\n00:15:00.694 --> 00:15:02.034\nThat's my car, I swear guys.\n\n292\n00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.645\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:15:03.645 --> 00:15:04.269\n&gt;&gt; I've seen it in the parking lot,\n\n294\n00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:05.143\nI swear.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n295\n00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:06.059\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n296\n00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:07.633\njust don't tell the owner.\n\n297\n00:15:07.633 --> 00:15:11.051\n[LAUGH] So as we get farther and\nfarther away from the tower, right,\n\n298\n00:15:11.051 --> 00:15:12.710\nyou've looked at your phones.\n\n299\n00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.875\nHopefully not while you're driving, but\n[LAUGH] you've seen the bars, right?\n\n300\n00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:18.120\nWe don't have the greatest coverage.\n\n301\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.860\nAll right, well more can happen than that.\n\n302\n00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.320\nWhat happens if we leave our\nprovider's network, right?\n\n303\n00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.000\nAnd we start getting into the realm,\noops, a random text box on the screen, no.\n\n304\n00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.990\nAs we start [LAUGH] getting into\nthe cell coverage of other towers and\n\n305\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.450\nother carriers, well this is where\nyou gotta watch your bill, right?\n\n306\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.070\nDepending on what kind of bill you have,\n\n307\n00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.180\nif you ever heard the term roaming,\nwell what is roaming?\n\n308\n00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.841\nThat just means you're leaving your\ncarrier's defined network, and\n\n309\n00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:48.563\nthey have some kind of peering\nrelationship with other carriers that say\n\n310\n00:15:48.563 --> 00:15:51.999\nhey, can our users, and\nI don't know the bureaucracy behind it.\n\n311\n00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:56.182\nBut we're gonna sign into agreement that\nwhen our users go into the territory which\n\n312\n00:15:56.182 --> 00:16:00.139\nyour cell coverage covers, they're\ngonna go ahead and they're gonna roam.\n\n313\n00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:03.522\nBut of course our company has to\npay the other company a fee, so\n\n314\n00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:05.157\nguess what that translates?\n\n315\n00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:06.641\nYou have to pay the fee [LAUGH] as well.\n\n316\n00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:08.978\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's what it boils down to.\n\n317\n00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:14.191\nSo that's a little bit about, oops,\na little bit about the roaming, wow.\n\n318\n00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:16.525\nI don't know about magnification but\nthat does a lot for roaming.\n\n319\n00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:18.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I do want you guys to kinda see this,\n\n320\n00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.920\nthis is actually kinda cool.\n\n321\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.450\nI brought up a couple of websites\nbefore we started here and\n\n322\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.380\nthere are some that provide services.\n\n323\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.714\nSo, I'm not really making any money by\nshowing you the guys these sites, but\n\n324\n00:16:29.714 --> 00:16:32.960\nI will tell you, they're really cool,\njust in general, in what they do.\n\n325\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.541\nLet's say Mike came to me,\nmaybe he's the CIO of a company.\n\n326\n00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:42.100\nHe says, Wes, we're gonna roll\nout some technologies, right?\n\n327\n00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.870\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout those technologies.\n\n328\n00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:49.202\nBut I need you to find out how good of\ncoverage do we have in a certain area for\n\n329\n00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:51.875\nLTE, right, Long Term Evolution.\n\n330\n00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.587\nThe latest and greatest technologies,\n\n331\n00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:55.913\none of the fastest that we\nhave on the market right now.\n\n332\n00:16:55.913 --> 00:16:59.640\nWell, one of the cool things is is I can\ngo over here and I can pick my country.\n\n333\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.230\nAnd I've already done that ahead of time,\nguys,\n\n334\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.820\ncuz searching here can be\na little bit of a pain.\n\n335\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.230\nSo, I've got United States\nof America here.\n\n336\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:09.230\nBut Mike says, well you know what?\n\n337\n00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.680\nI want a specific carrier.\n\n338\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.760\nLet's say, for instance, T-Mobile USA.\n\n339\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:17.240\nSo I take T-Mobile USA and there's\na couple of other things and we're gonna\n\n340\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.083\ntalk about this LTE, and what this GSM is\nand CDMA, but it's a lot of statistics.\n\n341\n00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:24.307\nSo, I wanna show this guys\nsome cool stuff here,\n\n342\n00:17:24.307 --> 00:17:27.260\nreal cool before we start getting\ninto all the specifications.\n\n343\n00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.173\nAnd I can actually,\nif I want I can come in here and\n\n344\n00:17:31.173 --> 00:17:35.772\nI could drill down into Gainesville,\nif I want, right?\n\n345\n00:17:35.772 --> 00:17:37.170\nKeep scrolling in.\n\n346\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.470\nLet's see if I can go a little bit farther\nthere, and I can see the radio towers,\n\n347\n00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.600\nright, that are in the area.\n\n348\n00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.720\nAnd if I need to find out some\ninformation, I click on a radio tower,\n\n349\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.380\nI can see it's coverage area, as well as\nsee information related to the mobile\n\n350\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.500\ncountry code, or the mobile network code.\n\n351\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.250\nThis code, 260 here, this is actually\na T-Mobile code, if I look at the library,\n\n352\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.270\nlook at the information on it, I can find\ninformation about T-Mobile, what their\n\n353\n00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:09.510\nID's are, their frequency bands and\nstuff, their cell ID's, their 4G layout.\n\n354\n00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.610\nSo you can get a lot of good\ninformation here about these different\n\n355\n00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:13.510\ncellular networks.\n\n356\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.140\nThere's a couple more out here, I wouldn't\nmind showing you since we got the time.\n\n357\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.200\nHere's one, this is a open signal,\nthis is kinda cool here.\n\n358\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.800\nSo, maybe Mike says, I looked at T-Mobile\nand I'd like to see what Verizon has.\n\n359\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.240\nWell that's, we could do that too.\n\n360\n00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.180\nWe could come here and\nwe can do Gainesville US,\n\n361\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.310\nwe could say Verizon and\nthen we could choose show results.\n\n362\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.370\nNow this one is a little bit different.\n\n363\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.190\nAll right,\nthe interface is not quite the same, but\n\n364\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.560\nall in all, it's pretty much\ndoing close to the same thing.\n\n365\n00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.840\nWe could zoom in here, right?\n\n366\n00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.070\nAnd we can see the areas that\nwe don't have coverage, right?\n\n367\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.690\nLike those dead zones.\n\n368\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:51.490\nNow, the one that I really like,\nthis last one here is Ting.\n\n369\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:52.190\nTing is really cool.\n\n370\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.910\nNow, Ting is gonna offer you some kind of\nservice, so just a heads up on that but\n\n371\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.030\nthey've got a great coverage map for\nthe two different kinds.\n\n372\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.080\nLike, for instance, GSM and\n\n373\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.610\nI know my head's kinda covering it\nup right here like a CDMA map here.\n\n374\n00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.940\nSo we've got two different technologies\nthat we can look if we wanna\n\n375\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.620\nview their coverage.\n\n376\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.814\nSo we'll take our Global System for\nmobiles here.\n\n377\n00:19:12.814 --> 00:19:15.007\nAnd we'll choose, view.\n\n378\n00:19:15.007 --> 00:19:16.597\nAnd I really like this one, Mike.\n\n379\n00:19:16.597 --> 00:19:19.490\nIn fact, let me just go ahead and\nlet the map do the work for us.\n\n380\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.290\nThere we go.\n\n381\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.870\nLet the map do.\n\n382\n00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.175\nIt's all about the map, right?\n\n383\n00:19:23.175 --> 00:19:27.140\n[LAUGH] Now what I like about this one is\nlike in Fargo, this is one of the reasons\n\n384\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.290\nI really like this,\nyou can really spot the dead areas, right?\n\n385\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.790\nSo apparently I don't wanna be\ntraveling there with my phone.\n\n386\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.850\nAnd Mike don't ever go there.\n\n387\n00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:35.470\nI don't know if you'll\never make it out alive.\n\n388\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.260\nJust kidding guys out there in Fargo.\n\n389\n00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.230\nWe love you.\n[LAUGH] But you can see there that there's\n\n390\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.700\na pretty good gap in there and I can\ntell that that's gonna be a dead zone.\n\n391\n00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.300\nAnd maybe you have a business\nin that location and\n\n392\n00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.950\nyou're gonna need to do a lot of business.\n\n393\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.060\nYou're gonna have a lot of people that,\neverybody has cellphones today and\n\n394\n00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.927\neverybody needs cellphones today\nespecially in a business and more so\n\n395\n00:19:53.927 --> 00:19:55.398\nif your into something like sales.\n\n396\n00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:59.963\nSo these maps can help you out and\nkinda help you make a decision on what\n\n397\n00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:03.517\nyou might be purchasing or\nwhat might be best for you.\n\n398\n00:20:03.517 --> 00:20:05.089\nNow that been said,\n\n399\n00:20:05.089 --> 00:20:11.035\nlet's go to some of the stuff that I know\ngets a little statistic happy on us.\n\n400\n00:20:11.035 --> 00:20:13.120\n[LAUGH] But we have to do it right?\n\n401\n00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.875\nThe exam, they apparently like\nlines across their screen.\n\n402\n00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:21.500\nWe just have to know some of these things.\n\n403\n00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.700\nLike for instance, GSM, that's the Global\nSystems for Mobile, and I do have to,\n\n404\n00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.020\nI'm not kidding you guys,\nI do have to write some of this down.\n\n405\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.330\nBut we do want you to be aware of it.\n\n406\n00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.077\nIt is a full-duplex communication.\n\n407\n00:20:33.077 --> 00:20:34.940\nKeep in mind that with this one,\n\n408\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.760\nthis is one where your phones\nare easier to transfer.\n\n409\n00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.760\nIn fact,\nMike you gave me a phone a few months ago,\n\n410\n00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.970\nyou said, Matt, I am not using this\nanymore, it's just sitting in my house.\n\n411\n00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.910\nI know you have the same type of phone.\n\n412\n00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.100\nHere, you can go ahead and use that.\n\n413\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.700\nWell, if I've got a GSM network,\n\n414\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.660\none of the things about the GSM network is\nthat they're easier change phones, right?\n\n415\n00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.930\nBecause they all work\noff of the sim cards.\n\n416\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.120\nThat little card on the back of the phone\nthat if I wanna get a new phone, right?\n\n417\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.950\nIf I'm under contract usually we have\nto break the contract, you pay for\n\n418\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.170\na new phone, but either way,\nyou pay for the phone.\n\n419\n00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.240\nYou take the sim card that was in\nthe phone that came from your carrier and\n\n420\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.150\nthen you pop it in, all right?\n\n421\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.320\nThat's GSM.\n\n422\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.900\nBut they also have got other\ntechnologies out there,\n\n423\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.090\nlike Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA,\nwhich you might have seen on the screen,\n\n424\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.990\nwhen we were looking at\nthe different networks.\n\n425\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.790\nNow with CDMA, this is different.\n\n426\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.640\nAnd I would almost be willing to bet\nthat the phone that Mike gave me,\n\n427\n00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.760\nwas a CDMA phone, all right?\n\n428\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.075\nWell no it couldn't have been,\nbecause it wouldn't even have the chip.\n\n429\n00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:33.400\n[LAUGH] It didn't like the switching\nof the SIM card on that one, but\n\n430\n00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.430\nthe thing is,\nthe next one doesn't even have them.\n\n431\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.360\nThey're usually locked\nin by the manufacturer.\n\n432\n00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.160\nIf you are on a CDMA network,\nnot only are you on older technology but\n\n433\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.240\nyou also can't change your phone,\nthey're usually vendor locked or\n\n434\n00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.530\ncarrier lock with probably\nbe the better way to say.\n\n435\n00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.150\nCuz Samsung didn't lock the phone down and\nit was the carrier that did it.\n\n436\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.270\nSo, be careful that I\ndon't say vendor lock.\n\n437\n00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.220\nSamsung would be like,\nwe didn't do anything man.\n\n438\n00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:58.760\nWe just made some phones or iPhones or\nsomething like that, Apple.\n\n439\n00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.600\nAll right, that's a couple\n\n440\n00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.210\nof the foundational technologies\nthat had been around for a while.\n\n441\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.140\nA couple more that we need to talk about.\n\n442\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:15.392\nThe 3G technologies, this is the high\nspeed packet access plus, HSP+.\n\n443\n00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:19.614\nThis is an interesting technology,\nthis is a 3G technology.\n\n444\n00:22:19.614 --> 00:22:23.115\nIt has a 14 megabit downloads.\n\n445\n00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:26.666\nIt has 5.75 megs up.\n\n446\n00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:28.781\nNow that is, and EDGE.\n\n447\n00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:31.018\nEDGE is another 3D check technology.\n\n448\n00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:33.626\nI know, Mike, I'm going out of\nlittle bit of turn here, but\n\n449\n00:22:33.626 --> 00:22:37.030\nI wanna kinda group them together\nbased on their generation here.\n\n450\n00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.150\nEDGE.\n\n451\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.450\nI could never remember this\nacronym to save my life and\n\n452\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.120\nI don't think you are going\nto have to on the exam.\n\n453\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.450\nBut we wanna be consistent here.\n\n454\n00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.180\nEnhanced Data Rate for GSM Evolution.\n\n455\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.050\nThis is a pre-3G technology.\n\n456\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:54.820\nAnd it is doesn't really give too\nmuch statistics more than that.\n\n457\n00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.343\nI think that would be perfect for\nthe exam.\n\n458\n00:22:56.343 --> 00:22:58.590\nI don't think you really\nneed to know more than that.\n\n459\n00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.640\nBut we do have to talk a little\nbit about the 4G technologies.\n\n460\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.880\nCuz the 4G technologies can be\na little confusing, all right?\n\n461\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.340\nBecause primarily when we talk about 4G\ntechnologies, we're talking about two\n\n462\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.685\ntechnologies and one of them one out and\none of them is on the way out.\n\n463\n00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:19.260\n[LAUGH] Or, and\nthat's just an opinion here.\n\n464\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.260\nThe one that's on the way out\nis the 802.16, yes that's right,\n\n465\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:29.340\nIEEE 802.16 is the wireless\ninteroperability for microwave access.\n\n466\n00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.440\nIn a short one that's called WiMAX.\n\n467\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.988\nAnd WiMAX is also a 4G technology,\nbeen around for a bit.\n\n468\n00:23:36.988 --> 00:23:40.306\nIt's interesting because they\nput it in WAN infrastructure and\n\n469\n00:23:40.306 --> 00:23:44.185\ntechnically it's called a MAN technology,\nMetropolitan Area Network.\n\n470\n00:23:44.185 --> 00:23:47.210\nBut it's also used to connect\nWAN links to things like MAN so\n\n471\n00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.970\nI know why there's a blurring\nin the line here, on that one.\n\n472\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.130\nThe last one is long-term evolution,\nand that's our latest and\n\n473\n00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.950\ngreatest and current technology.\n\n474\n00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.040\nAnd that one is true 4G technology.\n\n475\n00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.740\nIt has 300 megabit, and I gotta make\nsure I get this right, uplink, right?\n\n476\n00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.430\nVersus a 75 megabit downlink.\n\n477\n00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.260\nSo very, very fast technologies.\n\n478\n00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.980\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n479\n00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.650\nLet's see here, Mike,\nI know we are running short on time.\n\n480\n00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.790\nSo I've got a little bit more, but\nI think we're gonna have to stop it short.\n\n481\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.511\nCuz I don't know if I can get it in\nthe time that you tell me we have left.\n\n482\n00:24:21.511 --> 00:24:22.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n483\n00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.080\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds like a plan, Wes.\n\n484\n00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.400\nAnd you heard it from Wes.\n\n485\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.020\nThat means we've got more to go over\nwhen it comes with WAN technologies.\n\n486\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.290\nBut we are, unfortunately,\nout of time for this particular episode.\n\n487\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.690\nSo we'll pause it here and\nwe'll come back and we'll finish it up.\n\n488\n00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.940\nBut we do thank you, Wes, for\nsharing all that information,\n\n489\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.180\na regular encyclopedia of knowledge\nwhen it comes to WAN technologies.\n\n490\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.750\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n491\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.700\nSigning off for IT PRO TV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n492\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.570\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n493\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.062\n&gt;&gt; And will see you next time.\n\n494\n00:24:49.062 --> 00:24:55.053\n[MUSIC]\n\n495\n00:24:55.053 --> 00:24:55.915\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:10.869\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:16.490\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexiting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.630\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe are doing our Comp TIA network plus.\n\n6\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.046\nAnd in this episode we are actually\ncontinuing our thought process on WAN\n\n7\n00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:25.070\ntechnologies.\n\n8\n00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.350\nThis will be a part three so\nif you missed part one or part two,\n\n9\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.460\nmake sure you go back and\nwatch those guys first,\n\n10\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.400\nit will probably make part\nthree make a little more sense.\n\n11\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.540\nOr maybe switch it up,\nwatch part three first.\n\n12\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.150\nWell, you know a little on the edge.\n\n13\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.620\nEither way, here with me to\nexplain this WAN technologies\n\n14\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.250\nis none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.040\nHow are you doing Wes?\n\n16\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.550\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay, looks like we're\nworking on a trilogy for sure.\n\n17\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080\nMaybe even a small mini series here,\nwho knows, by the time we're done,\n\n18\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640\nwe'll have a Stephen King novel.\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.760\nThat's right, but, like I said in the end\nof our or in the beginning of part two,\n\n20\n00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.740\nthere's a lot of WAN\ntechnologies out there and\n\n21\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.240\nwe wanna make sure,\nthat you got your bases covered.\n\n22\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.550\nJust in case, you know, they ask you,\n\n23\n00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.890\njust about any question that you\nmight come across on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.160\nAt least that's what we're shooting for\nwe're not saying that the exam can ask you\n\n25\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.930\na little bit more but for the most part,\nwe wanna make sure that you are prepared.\n\n26\n00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.200\nWell, that's exactly what we wanna do.\n\n27\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.900\nI better not say for the most part,\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n28\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.563\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and we all know with CompTia they\nlike current technologies, but you also\n\n29\n00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.247\nhave to know a little bit about older\ntechnologies that you might think, why?\n\n30\n00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.262\nBut when you get out\nthere in the real world,\n\n31\n00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:29.380\nyou will find that some of those\ntechnologies are still being used.\n\n32\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.570\nIt might be the only choice they have.\n\n33\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.290\nSo it's great that we're\nfamiliar with them,\n\n34\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.790\nthat way if we run into them\nwe'll be able to deal with that.\n\n35\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.720\nAs well as, as you said,\npass the exam, always important.\n\n36\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.290\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n37\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.895\nSo speaking of old technologies, we're\nnot talking about myself or Mike here,\n\n38\n00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:44.549\nwe're talking about [LAUGH] dialup.\n\n39\n00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.329\nDialup is one of those ones\nthat's been around for\n\n40\n00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.840\na good long while now and\nyou might be saying, what dial up?\n\n41\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.174\nWhat are you talking about man, well I\nhave to tell you don't think you won't see\n\n42\n00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:01.510\ndial up inside environments, where you\nknow, corporate environments today,\n\n43\n00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.397\nbecause I give you an example, one of\nour other hosts here used to work for\n\n44\n00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:08.903\nan insurance firm and they used\nto go to Disaster Recovery sites,\n\n45\n00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:13.474\nwhere the whole entire building or the\nnetwork was gone, it didn't exist anymore.\n\n46\n00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:16.341\nSo how do you jump on a package\nswitching network when you have nothing\n\n47\n00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.290\nto connect to?\n\n48\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.433\nWell, typically you have pstn lines,\nthe public switch telephone network lines\n\n49\n00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.954\nthere, so\nyou might see in a situation like that,\n\n50\n00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:27.156\nwhere they quite literally bring\nin banks and banks of modems.\n\n51\n00:02:27.156 --> 00:02:30.660\nLet's talk about a modem a little bit and\nin fact, I got a diagram here.\n\n52\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.680\nI want you to think about\nwhat the term modem.\n\n53\n00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.350\nModem stands for modulator demodulator.\n\n54\n00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.070\nAnd what that means is\nwe essentially have,\n\n55\n00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.650\ncoming from our computers we have these\n\n56\n00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.090\nbits depending on what layer of the OSI\nmodel, essentially ones and zeroes, right?\n\n57\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.880\nElectrical impulses, on, off, on, off.\n\n58\n00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.730\nWell PSTN lines don't work like that.\n\n59\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.270\nThese are typically analog lines,\nand what do they deal with?\n\n60\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.210\nWhat they do with the analogue signals but\nI want you to think of it this way.\n\n61\n00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.650\nOur computers deal with ones and\nzeros,electrical impulses, on and off but\n\n62\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.130\nthe phone lines deal with sounds.\n\n63\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.580\nSo how do we get something\nthat's just an electrical on and\n\n64\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.110\noff to translate into a sound, and\nthat's essentially what a modem is doing.\n\n65\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.580\nModulation is taking that digital signal,\nand converting those electrical ones and\n\n66\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.110\nzeros that we see into a tone.\n\n67\n00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.190\nAnd then taking that tone and sending it,\n\n68\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.500\ncombined with the carrier wave over\na long distances over these copper wires.\n\n69\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.410\nAnd that's those PSTN Lines.\n\n70\n00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.120\nThey're called Public Switch Telephones\nNetwork Lines, you hear him a lot called\n\n71\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.365\nPOTS2 and it's just Plain Old Tele,\nwhy I'd say television.\n\n72\n00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not television, telephone system or\n\n73\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.160\nservice.\n\n74\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.010\nAnd so, be aware of that.\n\n75\n00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.850\nNow have you, I don't even know if you\nguys have heard the dial-up sound.\n\n76\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.447\nIt's so funny that we've all heard it.\n\n77\n00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:42.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have you heard that sound once\n\n78\n00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.390\nor twice?\n\n79\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI mean, I can remember calling\n\n80\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.830\ntelephones and misdialing.\n\n81\n00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.850\nThese companies would\nhave their phone line,\n\n82\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.060\nand then their fax line a lot of\ntimes off by one number, right?\n\n83\n00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.830\nSo you'd misdial, and you'd end up\ndialing your fax, their fax line.\n\n84\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.480\nAnd of course it's a modem at\nthe other end answering the call, and\n\n85\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.940\nthere's this squeal and\nscritch coming out.\n\n86\n00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.295\nYeah, I absolutely remember that.\n\n87\n00:04:03.295 --> 00:04:05.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's fun and they have the hackers,\n\n88\n00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.360\nway back I wanna say the 60's, in fact\nWozniak are there for with Steve Jobs.\n\n89\n00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.840\nHim and Steve Jobs' Apple.\n\n90\n00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.750\nAll right, CEO's and\n\n91\n00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.430\nfounders actually made a couple of this\nwhere they could admit tones, right?\n\n92\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.880\nAnd they could basically jump on the PSTN\nnetwork and call anywhere in the world for\n\n93\n00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.090\nfree if they knew how\nto do the tones right.\n\n94\n00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.593\nSo your modem knows that tone,\nit already knows.\n\n95\n00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:29.955\nIt's configured, your telco configures it\nso that when it connects to the network\n\n96\n00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:34.570\nthrough that sound that you hear, there's\nactually a couple of things going on.\n\n97\n00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.590\nThere very first ones what's\nknown as a guard tone, right?\n\n98\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.500\nAnd you don't have to know this but\n\n99\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.760\nit's kinda interesting to hear\nsome of the stuff going on.\n\n100\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.770\nBut it's guard tone and it's essentially\nyour modem calling another modem saying,\n\n101\n00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.840\nhey is there anybody out there?\n\n102\n00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.390\nIs there a modem somewhere?\n\n103\n00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.190\nAnd then what happens is, through that\nseries of sound, you have what's known as,\n\n104\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.960\nthey both agree on one continuous tone and\nthat's called a carrier wave.\n\n105\n00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.980\nAnd all that does is it can be\ntransferred over very long distances and\n\n106\n00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.160\nthe modulation is just\ntaking that data signal and\n\n107\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.860\nalso converting it into a tone and then\n\n108\n00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.270\nplacing it right on top of that carrier\nsignal and sending it across the wires.\n\n109\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.280\nOn the other side, we reverse the process.\n\n110\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.513\nNow the chips inside of the modem that\nare doing that are called ADCs and\n\n111\n00:05:19.513 --> 00:05:21.770\nDACs, right.\n\n112\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.012\nAnother set of acronyms.\n\n113\n00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:27.160\n[LAUGH] .Analog to digital converters and\ndigital to analog converters.\n\n114\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.590\nSo you can always see,\nis it downstream or is it upstream?\n\n115\n00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.690\nDepends on which of\nthe chips are gonna be used.\n\n116\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.320\nThis doesn't have a very fast speed, a\nwhopping 56k, which is kinda interesting.\n\n117\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.920\nBut there again, don't count it out of\nyour everyday corporate type environment.\n\n118\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.690\nBecause like I said, when packet switching\nnetworks fail we typically have some kind\n\n119\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.310\nof dedicated connection that we can get\nto just by connecting to that local loop,\n\n120\n00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.150\njumping on it and\ntraversing the carrier's network.\n\n121\n00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, and if you've got\nthings that require 99.99% uptime and\n\n122\n00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.210\nwe do use these things for backups\nbecause my ISP occasionally goes down and\n\n123\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.650\nstruggles and cannot send my data out.\n\n124\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.040\nThe phone line is still there and\nas you were saying,\n\n125\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.190\nwhen you get emergency crews\ncoming in to neighborhoods or\n\n126\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.710\ntowns that have been flooded,\ntornados, hurricanes or whatever.\n\n127\n00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.569\nPutting back to cable system\nis not their priority, right?\n\n128\n00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.360\nThat's not on the top of their list.\n\n129\n00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.240\nWe need food, water, electricity,\nand telephone lines.\n\n130\n00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.510\nSo, those interns agents as you\nare saying, they're out there,\n\n131\n00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.300\nthey've got their cards where they\ncan send this data over phone lines\n\n132\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.150\nbecause that's one of the first things\nthat's gonna be brought back up.\n\n133\n00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n134\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.640\nSo, definitely not dial-up.\n\n135\n00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.780\nI know it's,\n\n136\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.620\nlike Mike said earlier there are older\ntechnologies that we just have to know.\n\n137\n00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.310\nIt's not that CompTIA us trying to teach\nyou a history lesson, they really aren't.\n\n138\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.740\nThese are viable technologies today,\neven if they seem a little bit antiquated,\n\n139\n00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.230\nJoe, should just be aware of them.\n\n140\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.870\n&gt;&gt; We also tend to forget that\nwe're a little bit lucky,\n\n141\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.840\nlike where I live here,\nhigh speed Internet access is everywhere,\n\n142\n00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.330\nI mean even the fast food chains and\nthe gas stations have Wi-Fi, right.\n\n143\n00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.800\nBut that's not the same\neverywhere in the world.\n\n144\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.610\nSome places dial-up might\nbe their best option.\n\n145\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.210\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n146\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.870\nAnd it's a low cost option at that.\n\n147\n00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.150\nSo that's one of the things,\nanother good thing about it.\n\n148\n00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.870\nEven though it's low speed,\nit is low cost too.\n\n149\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.040\nNow, the next technology I want to\ntalk about is something we see and\n\n150\n00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.880\nwe're seeing more and more of today, and\nthis is something called Metro Ethernet.\n\n151\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.830\nAll right.\nThis is actually a combination of words.\n\n152\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.350\nWhen we say Metro,\nwe're actually saying Metropolitan.\n\n153\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.970\nEthernet.\n\n154\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.530\nAnd I want you to think of this as\n\n155\n00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.360\nbasically a man technology that uses\nnative Ethernet communications.\n\n156\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.045\nNow, why would we want to\nconnect cities together?\n\n157\n00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:51.910\nAnd not a city together but within a city.\n\n158\n00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.479\nWhy would we want to run things\nlike ethernet technologies?\n\n159\n00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:00.297\nWell ethernet is relatively inexpensive\nwhen you compare it to something like\n\n160\n00:08:00.297 --> 00:08:03.874\na Sonic backbone or\neven a Sonic regional collector ring or\n\n161\n00:08:03.874 --> 00:08:05.922\neven the local collector rings.\n\n162\n00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:08.909\nThey're still a very,\nvery expensive technology.\n\n163\n00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:10.484\nVery fast for sure.\n\n164\n00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:13.713\nYeah, definitely very efficient,\nvery fast technology,\n\n165\n00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:16.119\nhas a lot of bandwidth\nthat you could obtain,\n\n166\n00:08:16.119 --> 00:08:20.770\nlike even some of the old optical carrier\nstandards or 10g in their past 10g today.\n\n167\n00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.560\nBut they're extremely expensive.\n\n168\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.390\nYou are going to pay a good price to\nbe on that summit or HTH base network.\n\n169\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.680\nSo, this is a lower cost implementation.\n\n170\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.810\nOne of the great things is,\nthis doesn't require things like gateway.\n\n171\n00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.750\nGateway devices that do translation\nfrom things like Sonnet.\n\n172\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.005\nWe have media convertors that\ngo from Sonnet, or single mode,\n\n173\n00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:48.430\nmulti-mode fiber right over to, things\nlike, for instance, copper based ethernet.\n\n174\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.380\nOr even that,\neven if you are going to fiber to fiber,\n\n175\n00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.810\nSonnet to fiber optic ethernet, there's\nstill a little bit of translation there.\n\n176\n00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.140\nThey're dissimilar protocols.\n\n177\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.470\nSo we need that gateway device.\n\n178\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.340\nWe need that router that's in there,\nthat can be very expensive in and\n\n179\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.670\nof its own self.\n\n180\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.460\nBut imagine being able to use a technology\n\n181\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.330\nthat you already have implemented\nin most of your lans.\n\n182\n00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.010\nI don't know how many lans, going to say\n99% of them out there but I don't have any\n\n183\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.415\nstatistical facts, just know that\nethernet is one of the most common lan\n\n184\n00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:19.230\ntechnologies, so if I can connect multiple\nbuildings with existing technology and\n\n185\n00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.730\nI can save money and\nget the benefits of it.\n\n186\n00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.860\nIt's one of the things that really\nmakes it a little bit more attractive\n\n187\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.090\nto the people who wanna buy it.\n\n188\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.710\nIt's comparative to, I say the wireless\ncomparison to this would be WiMAX.\n\n189\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.270\nNow dude, it is not an Ethernet-based\ntechnology, WiMAX, there again,\n\n190\n00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.210\nWiMAX is it's own protocol.\n\n191\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.780\nBut that would be like, that's\nthe wireless Metropolitan Area Technology.\n\n192\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.770\nAnd we're gonna look at different\ntypes of networks in another episode.\n\n193\n00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.870\nSo I'm just, Kind of brief and over here.\n\n194\n00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.030\nDon't let it bug you,\nwe are gonna get to it.\n\n195\n00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.290\nSo, this would be more of\na Wired Metropolitan Area Technology.\n\n196\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.920\nSo, that would be your metro ethernet.\n\n197\n00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.370\nAll right, so couple more things that\nwe're gonna talk about in this episode so\n\n198\n00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.520\nthat you can be aware of, and one of\nthe things I wanna talk about, we kind of\n\n199\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.180\ntalked about a little bit in the beginning\nof this episode but I wanna talk about\n\n200\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.960\nthe different types of network switching\nthat we have going on today, right.\n\n201\n00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.988\nThere's primarily three types.\n\n202\n00:10:18.988 --> 00:10:22.760\nOne, we mentioned at the beginning of\nthis episode, was it the last episode.\n\n203\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.750\nThe ATM, yeah.\n\n204\n00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.700\nLotawen technology, now I'm getting my\nepisodes messed up here but, we talked\n\n205\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.810\nabout cell switching Networks, the ATM\nnetwork right, it's a fixed linked size.\n\n206\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.990\nLet's talk about some of the other\nones and we'll get back to that one.\n\n207\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.970\nOne of the most common\ntechnologies that we have today or\n\n208\n00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.210\nwhat are known is packet\nswitching networks, all right.\n\n209\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.250\nAnd when we look at a packet switch\nnetwork, what are we actually looking at,\n\n210\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.890\nlet me go ahead and\n\n211\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.030\nchill you guys I've got a little bit of a\ndiagram right here, Packet switch network\n\n212\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.701\nis essentially a network that can use\na variable data unit size, right.\n\n213\n00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:59.734\nIt means if I send a package to Mike's\ncomputer well guess what, the next packet,\n\n214\n00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:03.120\nit might be a different size and\nthe next packet and the next packet and\n\n215\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.860\nthe other thing about packet switching\nnetworks and one of the reasons I know\n\n216\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.620\nthis little debatable and myth, but one of\nthe reasons that this really got started,\n\n217\n00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.000\nso that in wartime, if portions of\nthe network had been eradicated,\n\n218\n00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.840\njust gone, the packets could find and\nreroute themselves and\n\n219\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.974\nfind their destination of the end point.\n\n220\n00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:26.000\nBecause in packet switched networks,\nthere's no guarantee, and\n\n221\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.710\nalmost never does a packet follow the same\npath twice in a single communication.\n\n222\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.240\nNow I guess statistically, maybe it could.\n\n223\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.920\nYou never wanna say never.\n\n224\n00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.920\n&gt;&gt; At some point it probably\nhas to reuse a route.\n\n225\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.490\nBut it is pretty cool to think that\neach packet that's coming along,\n\n226\n00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.800\ncuz your data obviously has to get broken\nup into chunks, to be transmitted,\n\n227\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.750\nfollowing the rules of the protocol and\nas this packets are being transmitted,\n\n228\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.990\nconditions change.\n\n229\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.320\nThis route that was pretty fast all\nof a sudden that router is congested.\n\n230\n00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.000\nIt's got too much information\nit can't keep up.\n\n231\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.630\nSo, in the middle of my conversation,\nthe routers will say, hey,\n\n232\n00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.570\nlet's send the packets this way\nit's gonna be faster, so each and\n\n233\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.380\nevery packet can end up taking a different\nroute to get to the destination.\n\n234\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.120\nIt's fascinating to think\nthat it can do that.\n\n235\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.100\nPut it all back together at the other end,\nand you end up with your data.\n\n236\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nthat's one of the things that make,\n\n237\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.150\nyou know one of the packet switch\n&gt;&gt; Networks versatile, right?\n\n238\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.830\nNow there are some caveats to that.\n\n239\n00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.540\nThere's always gotta be one con.\n\n240\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.820\nIf there's a pro there's gotta\nbe a con in the mix, right?\n\n241\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.020\nAnd that seems to be the case with every\ntechnology is that because of the variable\n\n242\n00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.820\ndata unit size, there are tendencies for\ntransmission errors, right.\n\n243\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.960\nAnd that does happen.\n\n244\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.710\nBut that's why we use other protocols.\n\n245\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.520\nAt layer two, we use things like\nframe checks from sequences,\n\n246\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.130\nwhich basically mean I can look at the\npacket, or at the frame, technically, and\n\n247\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.770\nif it's good, I process it.\n\n248\n00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.010\nOr, in this case, store and forward,\nI forward it on to the next\n\n249\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.610\n&gt;&gt; Destination.\n\n250\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.730\nIf I don't, I let it go and\nI request for retransmission.\n\n251\n00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.140\nNow if it goes up in the higher layers,\n\n252\n00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.010\nthen what we do is,\nwe don't worry about here.\n\n253\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:54.980\nIt's the other devices.\n\n254\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.450\nAnd we use other technologies like\nconnection oriented services like\n\n255\n00:12:58.450 --> 00:12:59.700\nTransmission Control protocol.\n\n256\n00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.427\nNow, apparently I had a slide for\nthat to show you guys.\n\n257\n00:13:05.427 --> 00:13:07.730\n[LAUGH] Well,\nevery packet takes a different route.\n\n258\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.080\nSo we got a nice little color diagram\nthere showing you that packets yes,\n\n259\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.410\ncan take different routes.\n\n260\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.561\nNow that's in contrast to what we have\nknown as a circuit switch network.\n\n261\n00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:26.220\nA circuit switch network has a Single,\nphysical, dedicated connection.\n\n262\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.370\nNow, I want you to understand that that\ndoesn't necessarily mean that somebody's\n\n263\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.980\ngot one line, one copper wire,\none fiber optic wire and it's\n\n264\n00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.350\nrunning from your building to wherever it\nis that your sending to the destination.\n\n265\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.780\nThat's not really what it is.\n\n266\n00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.800\nWhat it means is that all of\nthe devices within the network.\n\n267\n00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.600\nWhen you need a circuit,\nthey all turn that one path on and\n\n268\n00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.130\nyou make a connection, right?\n\n269\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.740\nNow it could be virtualized\nconnection too,\n\n270\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.820\ncuz we've got different types of circuits,\nright?\n\n271\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.700\nWe've got permanent circuits.\n\n272\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.690\nPermanent virtual circuits\nhave more band width and\n\n273\n00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.040\nthey're typically used\nby the Teclo carriers.\n\n274\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.600\nAnd they're an always on type\nof phone call, if you will.\n\n275\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.260\nIf you want some kind of comparison, it's\nlike dialing I don't know the mood, and\n\n276\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.080\nleaving the phone off,\nprobably as bad as expensive.\n\n277\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.370\nBut we also have switch virtual circuits,\ntoo.\n\n278\n00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.190\nAnd switch virtual circuits are the ones\nthat more like your dial-up lines, right.\n\n279\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.000\nWhen I dial-in,\ndid I have a connection before hand?\n\n280\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.400\nNo, I didn't.\nBut when I dialed in, it's talking right?\n\n281\n00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.640\nThe modem is talking a carrier modem and\nthen we build up that connection.\n\n282\n00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.630\nIt maintains that connection, right?\n\n283\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.570\nThings like for\ninstance in the ISDN, right?\n\n284\n00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.330\nYou have those delta channels that\nare providing the signalling and\n\n285\n00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.680\nstuff between end to end points.\n\n286\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.260\nAnd that's one of the things to remember.\n\n287\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.780\nNotice that the path is\na single dedicated path that,\n\n288\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.100\nwhile I'm using it, nobody else can.\n\n289\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know I saw these\na lot when we would deal with\n\n290\n00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:50.490\ndemand dial connections between my\ncorporate office and my branch office.\n\n291\n00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.500\nSo when that connection was needed,\nit was brought up.\n\n292\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.780\nIt wasn't maintained all the time,\n\n293\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.560\nonly when I needed to send data over\nthere that can actually be brought up.\n\n294\n00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.380\nAnd at that point everything was analyzed\nand the circuit was created, the path all\n\n295\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.290\nthe data was gonna take was decided and\nall the data followed that same path.\n\n296\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.510\nThen our connection would be\nbrought down when we were done.\n\n297\n00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.230\nThe next time we bring it up.\n\n298\n00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.420\nIt might take a different path,\na build a different circuit.\n\n299\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.650\nSo circuit switched.\n\n300\n00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.100\nNow that circuit remains the whole\ntime that the transmission.\n\n301\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.260\nOnce that conversation or we're no\nlonger sending data, we bring it down.\n\n302\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.665\nSo you're switching\nthe entire path gets changed,\n\n303\n00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:28.435\nif it only had the beginning\nof that connection.\n\n304\n00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:30.835\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\nI do wanna make mention,\n\n305\n00:15:30.835 --> 00:15:34.195\nbecause I have said physical path,\nthere are virtual circuits, right?\n\n306\n00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:37.505\nLet's see if I can do this,\n\n307\n00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:41.975\ncuz we should always be modifying\ndiagrams, right, on the fly.\n\n308\n00:15:41.975 --> 00:15:43.275\nThat always works out well.\n\n309\n00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.811\nSo one of the great things\nabout a virtual circuit,\n\n310\n00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:50.688\nis the underlying hardware\nI'm oblivious to, right.\n\n311\n00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:55.561\nI know that I have a device on this\nside and a device on this side and\n\n312\n00:15:55.561 --> 00:16:01.612\nwhat the virtual circuit does is it says\nI'm gonna connect you to that virtual or\n\n313\n00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:04.502\ncreate this virtual path but notice,\n\n314\n00:16:04.502 --> 00:16:08.685\nI don't need to know\nthe infrastructure underneath.\n\n315\n00:16:08.685 --> 00:16:11.629\nThe carrier is taking care,\nall of that is hidden to me.\n\n316\n00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:15.880\nAll I know is that on this side I look,\nand I see a direct path to this side.\n\n317\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.134\nIf I was on this side, I would see\na direct path to the other side.\n\n318\n00:16:18.134 --> 00:16:23.133\nAnd all the stuff in the middle, as you\ncan see even with my diagram, all that web\n\n319\n00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:28.146\nof intertwined circuit-switching\nequipment, it gets hidden to me, right?\n\n320\n00:16:28.146 --> 00:16:32.374\nSo that's kinda what we see,\nnow understand that virtual circuits don't\n\n321\n00:16:32.374 --> 00:16:35.744\nhave to necessarily be\na circuit-switching technology.\n\n322\n00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.848\nSo let me be careful with that, and state\nthat, because if you've got a frame relay,\n\n323\n00:16:39.848 --> 00:16:41.969\nframe relay is a packet switching network.\n\n324\n00:16:41.969 --> 00:16:45.236\nBut it uses those, what is it?\n\n325\n00:16:45.236 --> 00:16:49.067\nI believe the DLCIs,\nthe Data Link Connection Identifier,\n\n326\n00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:51.707\nthat virtually identify the end points.\n\n327\n00:16:51.707 --> 00:16:55.750\nSo just keep in mind that virtual\ncircuits aren't something\n\n328\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.725\nthat really has to be dedicated\nto just circuit switching.\n\n329\n00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:03.674\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the sound of Mike's head\n\n330\n00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:04.945\nexploding, yeah.\n\n331\n00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:06.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n332\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.520\nNow I labeled this one wrong guys,\nlet me fix this one actually,\n\n333\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.510\ncuz I said circuit switch.\n\n334\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.550\nIt looks like I just copied and\n\n335\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.200\npasted, which is a lot of\nthe technical documentation.\n\n336\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.790\nI think they do the same\nthing as I read it.\n\n337\n00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.676\nIt's like, well you just said\nthe same thing on the other page,\n\n338\n00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:22.240\n[LAUGH] but I digress.\n\n339\n00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.509\nLet's go ahead and let's look at this.\n\n340\n00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:24.997\nCell-switched networks,\n\n341\n00:17:24.997 --> 00:17:29.156\nwe kind of talked about this when we were\nmentioning [LAUGH] ATM-based network.\n\n342\n00:17:29.156 --> 00:17:32.689\nJust keep in mind they use\na 53-byte fixed link cell.\n\n343\n00:17:32.689 --> 00:17:37.125\nAnd like Mike had pointed out in\nthe last episode it's predictability,\n\n344\n00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.314\nI know what's coming, all right?\n\n345\n00:17:39.314 --> 00:17:41.890\nWell, I want you to look at the two\ndifferent cells and I'm saying pack a bit.\n\n346\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.553\nLook at the two different\ncells that we have.\n\n347\n00:17:43.553 --> 00:17:48.240\nMike, does that data look like it's\n53 bytes like that one right there?\n\n348\n00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.023\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you have 53 bytes there,\nso whatever are you going to do?\n\n349\n00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:51.921\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, so\n\n350\n00:17:51.921 --> 00:17:54.925\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna add\nsomething known as filler data or padding.\n\n351\n00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:56.388\nWe're going to make sure.\n\n352\n00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:57.274\n&gt;&gt; It has to end up being 53 bytes.\n\n353\n00:17:57.274 --> 00:18:00.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you don't have an option,\nyou can't say, well,\n\n354\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.081\nmaybe I was a little lazy,\nI didn't really wanna pad.\n\n355\n00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:03.766\n&gt;&gt; 49 is close enough.\n\n356\n00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:07.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, close enough, that could\ncause transmission errors, right?\n\n357\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.237\nAnd we don't get those on\nyour ATM based networks.\n\n358\n00:18:10.237 --> 00:18:14.471\nWe know we got the predictability,\nso we put in that filler data and\n\n359\n00:18:14.471 --> 00:18:19.232\nit ends up being the filler data that\nextends that cell to what we expected to\n\n360\n00:18:19.232 --> 00:18:20.613\nbe, the 53 bytes.\n\n361\n00:18:20.613 --> 00:18:24.621\nAll right, Mike, now you thought\nthat mine was blown on that one,\n\n362\n00:18:24.621 --> 00:18:29.286\nwait until I serve up the next one,\nI tell you what, this one's gonna be fun.\n\n363\n00:18:29.286 --> 00:18:37.610\nNow, I told you guys that I was\ngonna get back to the lease lines.\n\n364\n00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.150\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take care of this.\n\n365\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.830\nI want you to have some of\nthe memorization down, and\n\n366\n00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.000\nguys I know what's memorization,\nit's like doing setups.\n\n367\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.770\nSo anybody looks at me knows\nhow much I like doing setups.\n\n368\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.690\nNot at all, so, but\nyou just have to do it for the exams.\n\n369\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.240\nSo make sure that you get some of\nthese information under your belt,\n\n370\n00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.360\nyou can always pause\nthe video if you need to.\n\n371\n00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.691\nAnd that next information that we\nhave our those T carrier lines, and\n\n372\n00:19:01.691 --> 00:19:03.538\nwe got to talk a little bit about them.\n\n373\n00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:09.176\nSo I've got a slide here and it does\nmention T-Carriers and E-Carriers, and\n\n374\n00:19:09.176 --> 00:19:14.402\nI'm gonna kinda, hopefully make this\na little bit easier for you guys.\n\n375\n00:19:14.402 --> 00:19:18.259\nCuz I know it's just a slew\nof information and then yes,\n\n376\n00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:21.720\nunfortunately its one of\nthose necessary evils.\n\n377\n00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.547\nWatch out about the first one, we have\nwhat's known as a T-Carrier system.\n\n378\n00:19:25.547 --> 00:19:30.330\nThe T-Carrier system was developed\nback in the 60s by Bell Labs.\n\n379\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.636\nIt's kinda interesting it was the same\ndecade that they were inventing\n\n380\n00:19:33.636 --> 00:19:34.360\nunits as well.\n\n381\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.710\nSo a lot of invention,\n\n382\n00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.510\ngood inventions were going on\nbell labs in the 60s apparently.\n\n383\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.832\nThey came up with a T-Carrier system and\n\n384\n00:19:41.832 --> 00:19:46.428\nthe T-Carrier system essentially what\nthat is for us is a channelized system.\n\n385\n00:19:46.428 --> 00:19:50.858\nA channelized system in the fact\nthat we have multi-flexure,\n\n386\n00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:55.130\nmultiple individual channels\nthat can be bonded together.\n\n387\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.930\nAnd if any user needs more bandwidth,\nwell the carrier discharges them for\n\n388\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:01.860\nan additional channel.\n\n389\n00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.210\nNow we have to standardize it so we know\nexactly how much bandwidth we are getting.\n\n390\n00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:06.980\nNow on this one,\n\n391\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:12.050\nI know my head is covering up the T-3\nhere is a little bit covered up there.\n\n392\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.772\nBut we see that the T-1, all right?\n\n393\n00:20:13.772 --> 00:20:20.312\nA T-1 line,\nit is an overall 1.544 Mb/s, all right?\n\n394\n00:20:20.312 --> 00:20:22.983\nNow, I want you to see\nthis 64 k right here.\n\n395\n00:20:22.983 --> 00:20:26.319\nThat is a commonality inside\na channelized service.\n\n396\n00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:29.938\nThe 64 k is make up of\nsomething that we call here,\n\n397\n00:20:29.938 --> 00:20:33.568\nwe call the digital signal hierarchy,\nall right?\n\n398\n00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:37.025\nAnd you might see this term, DS, DS0,\n\n399\n00:20:37.025 --> 00:20:41.516\nit's the individual channel there,\nit's 64 K.\n\n400\n00:20:41.516 --> 00:20:46.111\nAnd then, combinations of\nthe DS0 equal higher levels of\n\n401\n00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:48.655\nthe Digital Signal Hierarchy.\n\n402\n00:20:48.655 --> 00:20:52.871\nSo, you can see that what ends up\nhappening when we say that this T-1 line\n\n403\n00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:57.364\nhere, and guys I should not be the one\nthat ever attempts to teach you any math.\n\n404\n00:20:57.364 --> 00:20:59.278\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n405\n00:20:59.278 --> 00:21:02.616\nwhat happens is we've\ngot 24 of those ds0s.\n\n406\n00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:09.249\nAnd if you just multiply that up, 24 times\n64, you should get right around 1,544.\n\n407\n00:21:09.249 --> 00:21:12.115\nNow keep in mind there is\na little bit of overhead, but\n\n408\n00:21:12.115 --> 00:21:15.187\nwe've got 1.544 megabit transfer speeds,\nokay?\n\n409\n00:21:15.187 --> 00:21:17.037\nAnd that's how those\nnumbers are coming up.\n\n410\n00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:19.174\nIf somebody, let's say if somebody,\n\n411\n00:21:19.174 --> 00:21:22.489\nin th earlier days you can get\na fractional T1 line, right?\n\n412\n00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.485\nYou say,\nI only need two of those channels.\n\n413\n00:21:24.485 --> 00:21:29.202\nWell, you're getting 128, in fact,\nISDM uses two channels, right?\n\n414\n00:21:29.202 --> 00:21:32.844\nThat's how we get the 128K than an ISDN or\n\n415\n00:21:32.844 --> 00:21:37.182\na basic rate interface ISDN\nline would get, right?\n\n416\n00:21:37.182 --> 00:21:40.928\nThe primary rate interface,\nthat's 1.544 Mb/s, well,\n\n417\n00:21:40.928 --> 00:21:42.843\nguess how many channels that is?\n\n418\n00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:44.508\n&gt;&gt; I would say all 24.\n\n419\n00:21:44.508 --> 00:21:45.446\n&gt;&gt; All 24, right?\n\n420\n00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:47.414\nTechnically, 23.\n\n421\n00:21:47.414 --> 00:21:48.005\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n422\n00:21:48.005 --> 00:21:48.999\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n423\n00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:52.586\nthen the next one which Mike is still\nright, it's 24 is the Delta channel right?\n\n424\n00:21:52.586 --> 00:21:55.484\nSo that T-1 line gives us the basic or\n\n425\n00:21:55.484 --> 00:22:01.383\nthe primary rate interface that we would\nsee inside of an ISDN based network.\n\n426\n00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:07.999\nNow the T-3, that's just\nan aggregate of T-1 lines, right?\n\n427\n00:22:07.999 --> 00:22:11.941\nNow, like I said, I'm not gonna be the one\nto do the math there for you though.\n\n428\n00:22:11.941 --> 00:22:16.747\nBut I would almost bet if you would do,\nlet's see, we got a T-1 line,\n\n429\n00:22:16.747 --> 00:22:20.693\nwhat is it 28 I believe times\n1.544 megs if I got my.\n\n430\n00:22:20.693 --> 00:22:22.244\n&gt;&gt; 43.232.\n\n431\n00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:24.856\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and the overhead,\nyes that's right, and again,\n\n432\n00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:28.128\nthere's a little bit of overhead,\nbecause when you see the standards.\n\n433\n00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:33.053\nI got the standards right down to\nthe exact bit here, 44.736 megabytes or\n\n434\n00:22:33.053 --> 00:22:34.902\nmegabits, excuse me there.\n\n435\n00:22:34.902 --> 00:22:36.398\nI say that and I get it wrong.\n\n436\n00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:40.361\n[LAUGH] But\nthen we also have 672 channels.\n\n437\n00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:42.026\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n438\n00:22:42.026 --> 00:22:47.179\nAll right, well, 672 channels, again,\nkeep in mind that's 28 times 24,\n\n439\n00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:51.625\nand you should come up with 672,\nthat's how many channels you have.\n\n440\n00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:56.079\nSo you can see that it is all based off,\noriginally,\n\n441\n00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:59.534\nthat digital signal hierarchy, DS0.\n\n442\n00:22:59.534 --> 00:23:04.254\nSo you could technically say that,\nfor instance,\n\n443\n00:23:04.254 --> 00:23:08.768\nthis DS0 is the very first DS standards,\nDS1.\n\n444\n00:23:08.768 --> 00:23:12.564\nI think, I can't remember\nexactly how many, what is it?\n\n445\n00:23:12.564 --> 00:23:17.853\nDS1s 1.44 megabits, so\nthat would be 24 DS0, if you will.\n\n446\n00:23:17.853 --> 00:23:23.017\nAnd again, all a bunch,\nI know guys a bunch of standards but\n\n447\n00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:26.022\nwe do have to do it unfortunately.\n\n448\n00:23:26.022 --> 00:23:30.719\nNow, the next one, they call out the\nE-Carriers and I wanna put them in here.\n\n449\n00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:33.630\nWhat I didn't mention, and\nI'll go ahead and mention,\n\n450\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.451\nis that technically T-Carriers,\n\n451\n00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:39.410\nthat is the North American T-Carrier\nsystem that we have here in the States.\n\n452\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.605\nNorth America obviously,\nnot just the States.\n\n453\n00:23:41.605 --> 00:23:46.090\nBut they also have J-Carriers that\nfollow the exact measurements.\n\n454\n00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:50.990\nSo I could, technically,\ngo T-1 like this and I could do, J1.\n\n455\n00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.428\nAnd that would be the same standards\nthat they have in Japan for instance,\n\n456\n00:23:55.428 --> 00:23:56.154\nall right?\n\n457\n00:23:56.154 --> 00:23:57.901\nAnd the measurements are the same.\n\n458\n00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:00.307\nNow, with an organization or\n\n459\n00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:05.901\nconsortium that they have in Europe\ncalled CEPTs, CEPT if you will.\n\n460\n00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:09.571\nIt's the Conference of European Postal and\nTelecommunications Administration.\n\n461\n00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:12.141\nThey are the ones that\noversee the standards there.\n\n462\n00:24:12.141 --> 00:24:16.700\nThey're still following this\ndigital signal hierarchy but\n\n463\n00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.900\ntheir carrier system does\na little bit different.\n\n464\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.280\nInstead of 24 channels at the first level,\nit's 32 channels.\n\n465\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.760\nSo you could see that the bandwidth\nis a little bit higher there.\n\n466\n00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.640\nAnd not just in Europe,\nit's also Australia you go and\n\n467\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.593\nmention that too than the land\ndown under there as well.\n\n468\n00:24:33.593 --> 00:24:39.390\nE-3, just the same thing again, in Europe\nand our viewers out there in Australia.\n\n469\n00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.740\nIf you've got an E-3\nline it's an aggregate.\n\n470\n00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.850\nWhich is a little bit interesting.\n\n471\n00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:50.500\nIt's 16 of the E-1 lines for a total\nof 34.368 megabits or 510 channels.\n\n472\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:55.930\nSo again, guys I understand\nIt is a lot of memorization.\n\n473\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:01.870\nPlease have these in your tech tool bag,\nproverbial tech tool bag.\n\n474\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.502\nDon't actually carry\nanything into the booth.\n\n475\n00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:07.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But have these with you,\n\n476\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.700\nhave them memorized, guys.\n\n477\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.020\nIt's not something that's glamorous.\n\n478\n00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.510\nWe wanna be able to use\nthings like cable testers.\n\n479\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:15.030\nMaybe we wanna make cables.\n\n480\n00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.160\nWe wanna get in here.\n\n481\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.940\nLike Mike I know he's a server guru.\n\n482\n00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.090\nLoves getting in the server\noperating system.\n\n483\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.250\nThat's the fun stuff and\nI realize that guys.\n\n484\n00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.560\nThis is not so fun and\nwe do understand that.\n\n485\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.900\nBut it's one of those necessary evils for\nan exam cuz remember, like we've been\n\n486\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.890\nstressing through Net Plus series here,\nyou're learning a different language and\n\n487\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.720\nyou have to know the components of that\nlanguage to be able to speak it and\n\n488\n00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.090\nbe competent on your CompTIA exam.\n\n489\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.130\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Wes,\n\n490\n00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.610\nyou can make some of those numbers\npretty darn exciting if you ask me.\n\n491\n00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.850\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n492\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.130\nA lot of great information there and\nas Wes said.\n\n493\n00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.220\nA lot of this comes down to memorization.\n\n494\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.000\nFlash cards are what I\nused when I studied.\n\n495\n00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.650\nAnd I know Wes,\nwe've talked about that before.\n\n496\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.540\nJust you can get plain and simple.\n\n497\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:55.910\nGo get you some index cards or\n\n498\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.570\ntear up some pieces of paper and\nflip them over into until\n\n499\n00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.840\nyou can answer everyone of those every\ntime without looking at the back.\n\n500\n00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.150\nThere's a lot of electronic versions of\nflash cards you can go out there and get.\n\n501\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.640\nSo free, some paid, make your own.\n\n502\n00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.660\nBut, what ever you've got\nto do to memorize that.\n\n503\n00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.870\nSo hey, those are questions you should\nbe able to say bang, bang, bang.\n\n504\n00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.650\nThose are guaranteed right questions\non the exam cuz it's just facts.\n\n505\n00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.090\nThere is no I wonder\nwhat the best method is.\n\n506\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.130\nWhat was the next step in this process,\nit's straight up.\n\n507\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.960\nDo you know how many channels are in a T1?\n\n508\n00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.040\nIt's just memorization.\n\n509\n00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.654\nSo you should not miss those questions.\n\n510\n00:26:27.654 --> 00:26:28.730\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Mike.\n\n511\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.010\nAnd I did want to say one more thing.\n\n512\n00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.640\nAnd this is about a conversation\nthat you and I have many years ago,\n\n513\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.460\ntalking about that very fact,\nthose flash cards.\n\n514\n00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.060\nIt looks like it's difficult and\nI understand.\n\n515\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.500\nIt's not fun, but\nthese are softball pitches.\n\n516\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.330\nYou're measuring facts,\nyou don't have to conceptually understand,\n\n517\n00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.450\nwhat is the electrical current\nthat's going through this.\n\n518\n00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.870\nAnd what is the wave link look like.\n\n519\n00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.820\nI mean, that's beyond network plus but\nthis can be the ones that you knock out of\n\n520\n00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.090\nthe ballpark cuz you, just like Mike said,\nyou go in there you got a series of facts,\n\n521\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.590\nboom I can recall it from memory and\nI can get that right.\n\n522\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.070\nAnd it's not giving a scenario\nwhat did you do a, b, or c?\n\n523\n00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.460\nIt's just a softball pitch.\n\n524\n00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.120\nSo yes, like Mike said, I would agree.\n\n525\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic Wes.\n\n526\n00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.660\nWe appreciate

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:08.293\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:10.217\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:15.240\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.643\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CompTIA Network+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:24.096\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\nlooking in at cable types, connectors, and\n\n8\n00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:28.640\nthe tools that we use when we're working\nwith these cables and connectors.\n\n9\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.177\nAnd here to lead us on this fantastic\njourney, there's none other than Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:32.740\nWes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.590\nWelcome back, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, thanks for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.990\nThat's right, we've got a slew of cables\nand connector types to show you today.\n\n14\n00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.385\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nwe're gonna to jump right in to it.\n\n15\n00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:46.350\nAnd we're gonna kind of start it off with\ntalking about the different types of\n\n16\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.880\nmedia that we have out there.\n\n17\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.580\nSo we know what type of connectors\nwe could also see related to that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.790\nSo typically when you\ntalk about bounded media,\n\n19\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.390\nwhich is really what\nwe're talking about here,\n\n20\n00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.360\nyou primarily have two different types of\nmedia that we're gonna be using, right.\n\n21\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.500\nWe're gonna be using\na copper-based media of some sort,\n\n22\n00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.200\nand we're gonna use a fiber optic media.\n\n23\n00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.690\nNow there's different types\nof fiber optic media and\n\n24\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.470\nthere's different types of copper cabling.\n\n25\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.040\nAnd then we,\n\n26\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.410\nhave all different types of connectors\nthat connect to those as well too.\n\n27\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.660\nSo we have quite a few different\nconnectors that they want you to be aware\n\n28\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.960\nof on the exam, cable types and\nsome of the specifications.\n\n29\n00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.890\nSo that's what we're gonna look\nat right here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.330\nNow, one of the first one that I'm gonna\ngo ahead and talk about is a very,\n\n31\n00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.710\nvery popular connector that we find\nin our Ethernet-based networks.\n\n32\n00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.270\nAnd in fact,\n\n33\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.712\nI've already got one of the cables here\nthat has one of those connectors on it.\n\n34\n00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:36.290\nSo if we can actually take a look here, so\n\n35\n00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.250\nthis is what is known as\na twisted-pair cabling.\n\n36\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.260\nAnd we'll talk about the copper\nthat's inside of this.\n\n37\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.175\nSo one of the first things that they call\nout is what is known as an RJ11 jack.\n\n38\n00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:48.624\nAnd that's what this is,\nexcuse me, I'm sorry, RJ45.\n\n39\n00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:51.810\nWe'll talk about the RJ11 coming up.\n\n40\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.668\nAnd this type of connector is one of\nthe most common connectors that we\n\n41\n00:01:56.668 --> 00:02:00.117\nsee in LAN communications today,\nRJ45 jack.\n\n42\n00:02:00.117 --> 00:02:05.334\nIt started out it was called Registered\nJack 45, we just call it RJ45 jack.\n\n43\n00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:09.950\nThis is actually also known\nas an 8P8C connector,\n\n44\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.170\nbecause of the fact that it got, well,\nit's got eight individual pins here.\n\n45\n00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.120\nAnd it's got eight conductors\ngoing into the back of it too.\n\n46\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.285\nSo we could actually, I'll tell you what,\nif we switch back to my computer here.\n\n47\n00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:23.566\nWe'll go ahead and\ngive you another view of that, and\n\n48\n00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.350\nmake it a little bit easier for\nyou to see.\n\n49\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.006\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\ntype in the search engine here, RJ45 jack.\n\n50\n00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.890\nAnd you can see it kind of\nfills it out for me here.\n\n51\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.170\nLet's change the search up\njust a little bit there.\n\n52\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.176\nLet's go to Images, see what we find here.\n\n53\n00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.430\nThere we go.\n\n54\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.860\nI wanna change this,\nfilter this out a little bit here.\n\n55\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.860\nThere we go, there's a good one.\n\n56\n00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.544\nLet's go ahead and we'll visit this page.\n\n57\n00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:49.898\nAnd here's your RJ45 jack.\n\n58\n00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:54.110\nAnd that gives you a lot better\nview of what we're seeing here.\n\n59\n00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.478\nAnd notice that we have\neight individual pins.\n\n60\n00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:58.630\nYou can see four here, and then four here.\n\n61\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.250\nAnd what you do is,\nwith your twisted pair cabling,\n\n62\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.813\nyou actually strip the cabling off.\n\n63\n00:03:04.813 --> 00:03:09.328\nAnd what you end up having is eight\nindividual wires that come into\n\n64\n00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:10.899\nthe back of this jack.\n\n65\n00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.480\nAnd then the RJ45 is just\nreally the square box here.\n\n66\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.860\nIt really doesn't define what\nthe wiring is behind it.\n\n67\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.000\nIt is just really a specification for\nthis kind of a rectangular box here.\n\n68\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.184\nNow that's the RJ45 jack.\n\n69\n00:03:27.184 --> 00:03:31.020\nAgain, it's one of the most\ncommon LAN-based connectors.\n\n70\n00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.730\nIt's typically used with something known\nas unshielded twisted pair, that's UTP.\n\n71\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.860\nUnshielded, in the fact that\nwhen we talk about twisted pair,\n\n72\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.850\nwe're talking about twisted copper\nwires inside of the copper.\n\n73\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.360\nIn fact, you know what,\nI'll tell you what.\n\n74\n00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.630\nIf we can go back to the Sky kit,\nI'll show you exactly what I mean here.\n\n75\n00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.130\nI've actually got, this is a little\npiece of Cat 6 cable here.\n\n76\n00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.080\nAnd if we were to just,\n\n77\n00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.100\nI'm gonna try to do this without actually\ncutting the cable all the way through.\n\n78\n00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.920\nLet's see here.\n\n79\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.590\nLet's see if I can, there we go.\n\n80\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.149\n&gt;&gt; There's a phrase,\nthe right tool for the job.\n\n81\n00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.923\nThat was not it.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Have the right tool for\n\n82\n00:04:05.923 --> 00:04:06.625\nthe job, yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:09.754\nWell this is, it's a wire stripper,\nso it's close.\n\n84\n00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:12.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice there's no end on this,\n\n85\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.710\nthat's why I really didn't care.\n\n86\n00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.190\nBut Mike is absolutely right,\nthe right tool for the job.\n\n87\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.352\nI really shouldn't have pulled\nout the switch blade for that.\n\n88\n00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:20.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n89\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.450\nas you can see here, right,\nwe've got individual twisted pairs.\n\n90\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.600\nAnd these twists,\nthey're actually really good at helping\n\n91\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.190\nelectromagnetic interference or increasing\nits resistance, I should say, to EMI.\n\n92\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.130\nAnd what we do is, depending on\nthe wiring scheme, we would wire this.\n\n93\n00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.670\nAnd then we would put this\ninto the back of the jack.\n\n94\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.710\nAnd then, if I can grab some\nmore utilities here as well,\n\n95\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.100\nwhat we would do is we'd use one of\nthese cable crimpers here, right.\n\n96\n00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.340\nAnd we would put that cable crimper\non there, and we would crimp it down.\n\n97\n00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.320\nAnd what it does is, it takes that RJ45\njack and it locks it into place for us.\n\n98\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.860\nNow that being said,\nthat's one of the connectors that we have.\n\n99\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.787\nNow, the next connector that we need\nto look at is what's known as the RJ11.\n\n100\n00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:06.174\nI kinda mentioned it, but hey,\n\n101\n00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:10.250\nit's actually wrong to\nmention it in Ethernet lingo.\n\n102\n00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.430\nIt has nothing to do with Ethernet.\n\n103\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.436\nIt's more for\nthe old telephone-based systems.\n\n104\n00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:18.660\nIn fact, if I was, let's see if\nwe can do an RJ11 search here.\n\n105\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.052\nAnd we'll go back to our image search,\nwe'll do an RJ11.\n\n106\n00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:23.430\nThere we go.\n\n107\n00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.300\nAnd is this a Wiki Commons?\n\n108\n00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.112\nYeah, let's go ahead and\nview this image here.\n\n109\n00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:31.200\nAnd there you see the RJ11 jack.\n\n110\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.460\nNow, notice that we've got six\npins here and four connectors.\n\n111\n00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.380\nNotice there's three pins here,\nthree pins here.\n\n112\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.010\nAnd then we have the four connectors.\n\n113\n00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.240\nYou can see if you look inside\nof the female receptacle there,\n\n114\n00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.460\nnotice that there is only four\npins that it's connecting.\n\n115\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.350\nThat's the old RJ11 jack.\n\n116\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.930\nI say old, we still used it today.\n\n117\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.210\nIt's been around for a long time.\n\n118\n00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.230\nBecause it's one of the traditional\ntelephone jacks that we've been using for\n\n119\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.800\na long time.\n\n120\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.820\nBut if you have a, not a DSL, but if you\nhave something like a dial-up modem,\n\n121\n00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.480\nyou're still gonna see these and\nyou're gonna still see them in use.\n\n122\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.750\nLet's see here for the RJ11,\nagain, just remember\n\n123\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.060\nit typically is going to be four\ndifferent wires, four cables.\n\n124\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.200\nOr excuse me, four individual conductors.\n\n125\n00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.080\nNow, the other one that we have\nreally looks just like the RJ45 jack.\n\n126\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.560\nIt's really,\ndepends on the wiring standard.\n\n127\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.946\nAnd they call it out,\nit's kinda interesting.\n\n128\n00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.132\nThey call it out, it's a RJ48C.\n\n129\n00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:32.010\nWow, I've actually talked to somebody\nthat's dealt with things like T1 lines and\n\n130\n00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.928\nCSU/DSUs.\n\n131\n00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:36.700\nAnd that's what the 48C\nconnector is supposed to do.\n\n132\n00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.870\nIt's supposed to terminate T1 lines.\n\n133\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.320\nWell, it's kind of interesting.\n\n134\n00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.283\nWhen I asked that gentleman that,\nhe was like, what, RJ48C?\n\n135\n00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:46.729\nIt's an RJ45 jack wired different.\n\n136\n00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.295\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So technically,\n\n137\n00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:54.460\nthe RJ48C connector itself though,\nlooks just the same.\n\n138\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.450\nIt's a little bit wider,\nit's got ten pins here.\n\n139\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.360\nBut when it comes down to it,\nit's the wiring standard\n\n140\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.500\nbehind it that defines how\nthe communication's gonna happen.\n\n141\n00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.130\nThe RJ standard here\ndoesn't define the wire.\n\n142\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.870\nAnd we've got different wiring standards.\n\n143\n00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.170\nFor instance in RJ45 jacks, you'll see\na lot of times it could be pins one,\n\n144\n00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.530\ntwo, three and six, or it is pins one,\ntwo, three and six that are used.\n\n145\n00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.580\nAs you go up higher speeds in Ethernet,\nmore pins are used.\n\n146\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.940\nBut basically,\nthat's what we're dealing with.\n\n147\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.550\nHere in the RJ48C,\nit could be wired a little bit different.\n\n148\n00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.650\nYou could have one, two, four, five.\n\n149\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.380\nOr you could have one, two, seven, eight.\n\n150\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.380\nSo you can see essentially the standard\nis just a little bit different.\n\n151\n00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.890\nHowever, the little receptacle though\nis almost completely identical.\n\n152\n00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.530\nAll right, Mikey, so\nwhat else do we have here?\n\n153\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.230\nSo the next thing that we gotta look at is\n\n154\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.430\na cable that we don't use\na lot of much anymore.\n\n155\n00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.510\nAnd that's actually one,\nwe'll do another image search here.\n\n156\n00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.806\nAnd that's called an RS232 cable.\n\n157\n00:07:57.806 --> 00:08:04.219\nRS232 null modem cables, these were\nused for point-to-point connections.\n\n158\n00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:09.020\nAnd I don't really see one,\nwell there's a 25-pin.\n\n159\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:16.140\nThey call out 9-pin DB-25, so\nlet me go ahead and look for the DB-9.\n\n160\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.760\nI know every one of you guys have seen\na DB-9 that have seen a VGA monitor.\n\n161\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.605\nDB9 connector,\napparently we're going car shopping here.\n\n162\n00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that again, there we go.\n\n163\n00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.420\nThis is actually a DB-9 connector.\n\n164\n00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.358\nYou know it's a D shape and\nit's got nine pins.\n\n165\n00:08:33.358 --> 00:08:37.580\nWe use these primarily for console.\n\n166\n00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.740\nIn fact you can see one right here.\n\n167\n00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.240\nHere's a console cable.\n\n168\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.860\nI actually have one as I go off\nscreen here, and if we were\n\n169\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.130\nto check this cable out, you'll see that\ndown here, if we can look at the skycam,\n\n170\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:55.660\nwe end up having what is known as well,\nit's really just a serial port, right.\n\n171\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.580\nYou can see that this is\nthe female side of this port here.\n\n172\n00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.018\nAnd we use these for console cables.\n\n173\n00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:07.290\nThe old RS-232 null modem cable would\nhave had one of these on one side.\n\n174\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.560\n&gt;&gt; And then on the other side,\nwould've had a 25 pin connector, and\n\n175\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.800\nthese would plug in on\nthe back of computers.\n\n176\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.278\nYou can plug them into a modem,\nthey basically,\n\n177\n00:09:15.278 --> 00:09:18.930\ntheyr'e called null modem cable cuz they\nwould stimulate direct point to point\n\n178\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:24.920\nconnections between two computers\nwithout the presence of actual modem.\n\n179\n00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.100\nToday, when we're using a DB9,\n\n180\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.610\nyou can see this one's got\nan ethernet jack on the end.\n\n181\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.226\nWe're still using them as console cables,\n\n182\n00:09:32.226 --> 00:09:35.560\nbut a lot of times what they have is\nthey have an adapter on them too, so\n\n183\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.580\nthat you can plug them in the things like\nethernet based ports on your machines.\n\n184\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:46.480\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe DB-9 RS-232 null modem cable.\n\n185\n00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.340\nLet's go ahead and make sure what we\nhave here, that we mention everything.\n\n186\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.050\nAgain, remember it's used for\nthe serial point-to-point connections.\n\n187\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.680\nIt's a little dated.\n\n188\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:01.420\nWe don't really use it too much anymore,\nat least not the RS-232.\n\n189\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.990\nThat cable that I actually showed you is\nthe Cisco proprietary console cable used\n\n190\n00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.530\nin the DB-9 on one side.\n\n191\n00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.350\nBut then it flips over to ethernet again.\n\n192\n00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.060\nCuz it's trying to bring you\ninto more of a newer standard.\n\n193\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.270\nIn fact, if you actually have to put\nan adapter on one side of it that's USB so\n\n194\n00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.780\nit kind of obscures what it's\nactually doing even from there.\n\n195\n00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.\n\n196\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.110\nAnd a lot of our laptops that we're using,\n\n197\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.730\nwhen we go walking into that server closet\nand we need to connect to that router,\n\n198\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.200\ndon't have those type of\nconnectors on them anymore.\n\n199\n00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.910\nSo difficult to connect if\nthat's what they're using.\n\n200\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.420\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I mean you don't\neven see them on your devices.\n\n201\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.560\nIt's hard to find.\n\n202\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.240\nI guess I can't say it's hard to find,\n\n203\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.260\nit's hard to find the devices\nthat actually use them.\n\n204\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.960\nYou can still buy the cables.\n\n205\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.460\n&gt;&gt; I had an old satellite receiver\nbox that used one of those.\n\n206\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.260\nAnd I struggle, I had to get some\nadapters to be able to change\n\n207\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.080\nover to a technology I could\nactually plug into my laptop.\n\n208\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.600\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n209\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.470\nSo let's talk about\na couple other ones here.\n\n210\n00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:58.390\nNow, it's kinda interesting,\nI wanna mention the BNC connector.\n\n211\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.848\nCuz they call out a couple\nof kinda interesting things.\n\n212\n00:11:00.848 --> 00:11:05.790\nThey call that what is known as the BNC\ncoupler, and we'll look at that first, but\n\n213\n00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.830\nI think that's kind of putting\nthe carriage in front of the horse there,\n\n214\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.330\nif you will.\n\n215\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.410\nI wanna show you guys kinda what\na BNC connector looks like.\n\n216\n00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.860\nAnd this is going to\nbe your BNC connector,\n\n217\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.038\nBayonet Neill-Console or Concelman,\nor British Navel Connector.\n\n218\n00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:24.340\nI know there's a debate on who\nactually came up with it first.\n\n219\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.350\nBut BNC if you will, and\nthey call it a bayonet style\n\n220\n00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.900\nbecause there's a centralized\ncopper conductor in here.\n\n221\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.560\nAnd there's a few different kinds.\n\n222\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.290\nThere's actually an F connector\nwhich is a twist lock.\n\n223\n00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.290\nThis actually has a moving twist, I gotta\nbe careful when I say that cuz it's\n\n224\n00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.420\na screw on lock,\nis what the F connector is.\n\n225\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.500\nThis is a twist lock so I just gotta kinda\nbe careful on that terminology there.\n\n226\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.670\nAnd what this does is it usually has\non the other side it has a little\n\n227\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.540\nnotch in it.\n\n228\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.720\n&gt;&gt; And then you plug these together and\nthen you twist it and it locks together,\n\n229\n00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.670\nhence the term, twist lock, if you will.\n\n230\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.280\nNow, this is attached to,\nin this case, this is the, I believe,\n\n231\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.360\nyou can see on the standard\non the side here.\n\n232\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.415\nI know it's kind of hard to see, but\ndown here on this cable, they have an.\n\n233\n00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:12.200\nRG-59, this is for\nthe radio grade standards.\n\n234\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.783\nIn the earlier days,\nwe would have used things like RG-58 for\n\n235\n00:12:16.783 --> 00:12:19.320\nthicknet Ethernet cabling.\n\n236\n00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.690\nWe would have used the RJ-8 for\nthinnet cabling.\n\n237\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.360\nWe don't really use too many of\nthese coaxial cables for networking\n\n238\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.640\npretty much anymore, but they're still\nused heavily in things like video and\n\n239\n00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.900\nstuff and, but it doesn't really matter.\n\n240\n00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.680\nThe principle is all the same.\n\n241\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.880\nWhen you look at the cable itself,\nI know that's kinda hard to see.\n\n242\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.245\nYou'll see that there is\na centralized copper conductor.\n\n243\n00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:44.095\nThank you there, Mike, appreciate it.\n\n244\n00:12:44.095 --> 00:12:46.295\nThere's a centralized\ncopper conductor here.\n\n245\n00:12:46.295 --> 00:12:51.875\nAnd then what you have is this, I think\nthey call it dielectric insulation here,\n\n246\n00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:55.525\nso it doesn't allow electrical\ncurrent to flow through it.\n\n247\n00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:59.595\nAnd then on the outside you\ntypically have some kind of foil\n\n248\n00:12:59.595 --> 00:13:01.645\nbraided shield, if you will.\n\n249\n00:13:01.645 --> 00:13:02.795\nThis one's actually kinda cool.\n\n250\n00:13:02.795 --> 00:13:05.700\nAnd Mike pointed out,\nas we were talking off camera here,\n\n251\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.460\nbefore we started this episode, that he's\ndefinitely seen a shielding before at home\n\n252\n00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.090\nin some of the video application\nthat he has around his house.\n\n253\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.750\nAnd that's something that shielding\nis really good, because what it does\n\n254\n00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:21.640\nis it increases the immunity that this\ncable has to electromagnetic interference.\n\n255\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.750\nWith networking, we definitely want\nthat and certainly with video,\n\n256\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.630\nwe definitely want the quality to be good.\n\n257\n00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.490\nThis happens to be, on the other hand, let\nme go ahead and grab this other cable and\n\n258\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.550\nbring it over here,\ncuz we're talking about this one too.\n\n259\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.330\nThey do call that out in\nthe specifications, and\n\n260\n00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.430\nyou can see that this is what\nthe RJ-6 cable would look like.\n\n261\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.320\nSo you kinda see the difference\nbetween these two.\n\n262\n00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.670\nThis is, this looks like a monstrosity,\nnext to this one right here the RJ-59U.\n\n263\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.940\nThis is the RJ-6, and\nthis is what you commonly see.\n\n264\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.220\nThis is good for a multitude of type of\napplications, internet broadband if you\n\n265\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.610\nfor things like cable access, video and\naudio can go over these as well, and\n\n266\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.010\nyou can see that its got that shielding\naround the outside of it as well.\n\n267\n00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:13.280\nSo even though coaxial cable is not really\nused too much in networking anymore,\n\n268\n00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.840\nit's used all over the place.\n\n269\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.180\nAudio communications,\nradio transmissions and stuff like that.\n\n270\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.520\nSo you will see the coaxial\ncables out there.\n\n271\n00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.080\nMaybe not inside of your\nnetworking endeavors, but\n\n272\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.860\nyou'll definitely see those\ninside of your cabling endeavors.\n\n273\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.920\nNow one of things that they also mention\nis something known as a BNC coupler.\n\n274\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.140\nAnd that BNC coupler is where what\nhappens now [LAUGH] if I get almost\n\n275\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.210\nall the way and the cable, and I pull it,\nand it's not quite making it to the end.\n\n276\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.660\nNow obviously we're gonna\ndo a little bit preparing.\n\n277\n00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.360\nSo I'm being a little dramatic here.\n\n278\n00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.660\nBut what happens?\n\n279\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.610\nI need to attach another bit of cable.\n\n280\n00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:54.400\nI need to take two BNC connectors and\nconnect them together.\n\n281\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.610\nWell how do I do that?\n\n282\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.310\nWell that's where the BNC\ncoupler comes in.\n\n283\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.680\nSo I've actually got a picture pulled\nup here, did a little image search, and\n\n284\n00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.562\nwe're shopping with\nMike's credit card here.\n\n285\n00:15:03.562 --> 00:15:04.530\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He just doesn't know it yet.\n\n286\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.840\nAnd you can see, this is one of the T\nconnectors, this is a BNC T connector.\n\n287\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.250\nAnd they really don't call this out on\nthe exam, cuz this is the way you would\n\n288\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.270\nput in another drop on one\nof the old Thinnet cables.\n\n289\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.060\nIf you had to slave in another computer,\nwhat would you do?\n\n290\n00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.810\nYou would attach one end of\nthe BNC cable to one side,\n\n291\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.400\nthe other backbone BNC\ncable to the other side.\n\n292\n00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.420\nAnd then you would run a single\nBNC cable off of this T connector\n\n293\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.930\ninto the back of the network adapter\nthat would be on the computer itself.\n\n294\n00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.040\nBut these are the BNC couplers here and\nagain,\n\n295\n00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.800\nwhat it does, it allows you to\nconnect two BNC connectors together.\n\n296\n00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.310\n&gt;&gt; I like those images, too,\ncuz you can see the little,\n\n297\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.960\nI want to call them dog ears,\nthe little tips that stick up.\n\n298\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.990\nThere you got a really good shot of\nit there, cuz that's really that BNC,\n\n299\n00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.440\nit was easy to connect.\n\n300\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.430\nIt was push in and\nbasically a half a turn.\n\n301\n00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.997\nAnd I always tell people it's\na lot like if you've ever changed\n\n302\n00:15:57.997 --> 00:16:00.864\nthe old bulbs in your tail lights,\nyou know they're kinda like that.\n\n303\n00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:03.230\nYou got the two little\nTips that stick out.\n\n304\n00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.836\nYou push it in, twist it half way and\nit locks in place.\n\n305\n00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.540\nReally made for a secure connection.\n\n306\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.430\nSo, in cabling where the cable\nmight get pulled on or\n\n307\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:14.200\nunder any kinda strain,\nyou knew that thing was not coming off.\n\n308\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.600\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and you might need, and\nwe'll get into some fiber optic cables\n\n309\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.090\nthat use that same concept, Mike, where\nif you need a more thorough connection,\n\n310\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.350\nyou're in an industrial type application,\ndoesn't mean you have to be\n\n311\n00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:29.220\nan equipment manufacturing company or\nanything like that, but if you need a more\n\n312\n00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.970\ndurable connection, this is nice because,\nwell, we talk about it in A plus, right?\n\n313\n00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.110\nWe talk about it in server plus.\n\n314\n00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.010\nWe talk about vibration causes\nthings like chip creep, right?\n\n315\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, we've got BNC couplers.\n\n316\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.850\nCan we couple other cable technologies?\n\n317\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.170\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can, absolutely.\n\n318\n00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.310\nIf you get out that red handled,\ncable stretcher that we've got,\n\n319\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.990\nno, just kidding.\n\n320\n00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.310\nAs I'm picking on him,\nhe's not going to look for that.\n\n321\n00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.806\nBut there are times when we have to maybe\nput a coupler not between a coaxial cable\n\n322\n00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:58.459\nwith a centralized copper conductor, but\nremember that UTP cable that I showed you\n\n323\n00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:01.095\nand I showed you the individual\ncopper conductors in that.\n\n324\n00:17:01.095 --> 00:17:05.419\nWell that's got multiple conductors,\nif you will, wires and\n\n325\n00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:08.200\nsometimes you need a coupler for those.\n\n326\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.280\nNow, again, we were kind of joking around,\nthey're not the greatest thing to have.\n\n327\n00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.010\nThey will work,\n\n328\n00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.560\nbut they do kind of implement a little\nbit of signal loss there, if you will.\n\n329\n00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might not be\nthe best connection inside there.\n\n330\n00:17:19.885 --> 00:17:24.410\nUnfortunately, I've run into situations\nwhere you think you've got enough wire,\n\n331\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.070\nso you go.\n\n332\n00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.560\nAnd I was actually up in the attic\nat my house the other day and\n\n333\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.210\nrunning a wire, ended up having to go\naround a few obstacles in the attic and\n\n334\n00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.930\nended up about 15 feet\nshort with my cable.\n\n335\n00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.980\nSo now it's either, rerun the cable with\na long enough length, or use a coupler.\n\n336\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.941\n&gt;&gt; And I've actually made the other type\nof mistake, where I really only needed\n\n337\n00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:52.305\nabout 10 to 20 feet of wire, and\nI bought 100 foot cat cable.\n\n338\n00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:55.729\nAnd now I got this big rat's nest\nbehind my dresser that I'm trying\n\n339\n00:17:55.729 --> 00:17:58.800\nto hide from my wife because I\ndidn't do my planning right.\n\n340\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.710\nSo I've actually gone to the other\nside of the spectrum on that.\n\n341\n00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:02.910\nLet's go ahead and show you those guys.\n\n342\n00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.360\nWe'll bring up another,\nwe'll go shopping again here.\n\n343\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.590\nWe'll do a UTP coupler here.\n\n344\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:14.210\nAnd let's see what we can\nfind as far as images here.\n\n345\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.250\nLet's go ahead and\nchange that up a little bit there.\n\n346\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.530\nAnd do I actually have?\n\n347\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:23.450\nWell this is one, it really doesn't\nlook like much, but let me see.\n\n348\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.900\nI'm not really getting\nany good pictures there.\n\n349\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.450\nThere's one of them right there,\nheck, we'll use this one here,\n\n350\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.500\nmaybe they'll make some money\nby selling something there.\n\n351\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.310\nBut you could see here,\nwe got an RJ-45 connector on one side.\n\n352\n00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.040\nWell guess what?\n\n353\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.445\nOn the other side, it looks,\nwell just like that.\n\n354\n00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:44.602\n[LAUGH] So\nthey really don't look much different.\n\n355\n00:18:44.602 --> 00:18:49.758\nBut when it comes down to it, notice that\nthis is when you need to attach two,\n\n356\n00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:53.400\nyou need to connect two of\nthe twisted pair cablings.\n\n357\n00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.183\nAnd you can see that this one's rated for\nCAT6.\n\n358\n00:18:55.183 --> 00:18:59.168\nI don't now how well the performance\non that CAT6 cable would be, because\n\n359\n00:18:59.168 --> 00:19:03.850\nremember, and we'll look at the category\nstandards here, but CAT6 is a gig, gigabit\n\n360\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:08.113\ntransfer speeds and you really need\na solid connection to maintain that speed.\n\n361\n00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.172\nSo yes you can have those and,\nlike Mike said,\n\n362\n00:19:11.172 --> 00:19:15.878\nin a situation where it's not feasible for\nhim to take down a wall just so\n\n363\n00:19:15.878 --> 00:19:20.663\nhe could reroute one wire, this will\nbe worth its weight in gold for you,\n\n364\n00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:23.970\nbecause at least you'll\nbe able to use your wire.\n\n365\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.180\nYou might not get the best performance out\nof it, but at least you won't be high and\n\n366\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.590\ndry and stuck out and left without\na boat or out of the water there.\n\n367\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.380\nAll right, Mike, so I know that we're\nrunning a little bit short on time.\n\n368\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.680\nGuys, as you can see there's so\nmany cable types here.\n\n369\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.933\nWe haven't even scratched\nthe surface on things like fiber.\n\n370\n00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:46.607\nI have been mentioning terms like cat,\ncategories if you will, and\n\n371\n00:19:46.607 --> 00:19:48.418\nthose are from TIA-EIA.\n\n372\n00:19:48.418 --> 00:19:50.598\nWe've got a lot more to go Mike,\nbut I know, I could see,\n\n373\n00:19:50.598 --> 00:19:52.970\nthat we don't really have much\nmore time on the clock, do we?\n\n374\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.030\n&gt;&gt; I was getting ready to cut you off, so-\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes,\n\n375\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.080\nwe appreciate all of that information.\n\n376\n00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.980\nAs you said, I know there's many\nmore that we still have to go, but\n\n377\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.180\nwe'll have to save that for\nanother episode.\n\n378\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.000\nSo thank you for that information Wes,\n\n379\n00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.020\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n380\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.300\nRemember make your flash cards,\nlots of memorization here.\n\n381\n00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.270\nSigning off for\nITProTV I've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n382\n00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.920\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n383\n00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.101\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n384\n00:20:17.727 --> 00:20:23.636\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n385\n00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:26.569\nThank you for

Your watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:14.852\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nComp TIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:15.910\nI'm you show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.290\nThis actually a part two, and then\nthe previous episode you’re looking at\n\n8\n00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.400\ncable types, connectors types and\nalso tools that you use out in the fields.\n\n9\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.820\nWith us today we have Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.335\nWes Bryan to continue this explanation\nto show us some more of these tools.\n\n11\n00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:33.405\nThank you for being with us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:35.985\n&gt;&gt; And Cherokee, thanks for having\nme here as always, great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:41.005\nThat's right, we have a plethora of cable\ntypes and standards, and specifications.\n\n14\n00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.457\nYou might be asking yourself, well why in\never gonna see any of these in the real\n\n15\n00:00:44.457 --> 00:00:47.957\nword and the answer is, you absolutely\nwill see this in the real world.\n\n16\n00:00:47.957 --> 00:00:52.287\nSometimes we're going through some of the\naccount here, objectives we'll say okay,\n\n17\n00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:55.017\nwell this is an objective it\nmight be a little bit outdated,\n\n18\n00:00:55.017 --> 00:00:58.200\nmaybe you'll see it,\nmaybe you won't but I have to say for\n\n19\n00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.220\na large portion of pretty much\neverything here, you're gonna see.\n\n20\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.680\nNow, we've already talked about some of\nthe some of the technologies that are,\n\n21\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.120\nthey are a little outdated, right?\n\n22\n00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.170\nIn the first part of this,\nwe mentioned the ODB9 consoled cables.\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.080\nAnd you still see DB9 consoled cables,\nbut the DB25, right?\n\n24\n00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.370\nThe 25 pin connector.\n\n25\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.520\nRS32, no modem cable that would\nplug back in the back of a modem.\n\n26\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.750\nYou may or may not see those again,\nthey're really kind of outdated today.\n\n27\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.750\nWhen we need to make those\npoint-to-point communications.\n\n28\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.600\n&gt;&gt; It's been a while.\n\n29\n00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.390\n&gt;&gt; It really has, right.\n\n30\n00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.160\nWhat do we use today?\n\n31\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.560\nWe use things like ethernet cables and\n\n32\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.090\nwe'll show you an example of a console\ncable that we call a rollover cable, and\n\n33\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.430\nactually an adapter that\nit's going through too.\n\n34\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.480\nJust still allow you to do\nthose console connections.\n\n35\n00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.190\nNow we talked a little bit in\nthe last episode, the first episode,\n\n36\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.240\nif you will,\nwe talked about our RJ connectors.\n\n37\n00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.350\nWe talked about 11, we talked about 45,\nwe even talked about\n\n38\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.610\none that maybe you don't see a lot,\ncuz maybe you don't deal with lease lines,\n\n39\n00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.810\nand that was the RJ48C keep in mind\nit's still a registered jack, right?\n\n40\n00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.300\nIt's the rectangular receptacle\nif you will, that little\n\n41\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.160\nbox that really is what RJ stand for\nor defines if you will as a standard.\n\n42\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.715\nIt doesn't define the wiring, right.\n\n43\n00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:10.675\nIn the back, right.\n\n44\n00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.665\nWhen we look at the wiring of one\nof these twisted pair of cables.\n\n45\n00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:17.555\nThat whether it's an RJ45 jack or\nreally when it comes down to it,\n\n46\n00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:22.650\nyou can use RJ45 and even in\ntelecommunications, telephones today, or\n\n47\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.750\nRJ48C if I can remember that one, right.\n\n48\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.760\nIt's the wiring in the back of the plug,\nhow we arrange these conductors that\n\n49\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.480\nreally defines what the standard\nis that we are gonna be using and\n\n50\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360\nwhat technology we use it with.\n\n51\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.970\nNow, we also talked a little about\nyour coaxial implementations.\n\n52\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.480\nRemember, as a quick recap remember\nthat when we talk about twisted pairs,\n\n53\n00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.590\nwe're typically talking about\na pair of copper conductors\n\n54\n00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.760\nthat are twisted inside of the cable.\n\n55\n00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.880\nAnd those twists help to strengthen it's\nimmunity to electromagnetic interference.\n\n56\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.620\nRemember, with coaxial cable in the first\none, we kinda split one of these open.\n\n57\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.890\nWe got to see that centralized copper\nconductor that's right in the middle of\n\n58\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.640\nit, we say, gone by the wayside,\nyou're not really gonna see a RJ48 or\n\n59\n00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.300\nRJ8 cable anymore but\nyou still see coaxial.\n\n60\n00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.410\nIn fact, I actually grabbed this, stole\nthis, don't tell the production team,\n\n61\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.670\nI actually stole it piece of this\ncoaxial cable that they use for\n\n62\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.650\ntheir video production.\n\n63\n00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.909\nSo I want you to keep in mind that we\nreally don't use a lot of the coaxial\n\n64\n00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.611\ncabling for things like ethernet, like\nwe did back in the days of 10BASE2 and\n\n65\n00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.673\n10BASE-T when it was really prevalent.\n\n66\n00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.990\nBut today we still use at least,\nwe still use the heck out of this.\n\n67\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.680\n&gt;&gt; Security camera systems.\n\n68\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Very good, CCTV, thank you there.\n\n69\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.280\nI didn't think of my acronym right there.\n\n70\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.950\nAudio and video, right?\n\n71\n00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; In fact, most of the video production\n\n72\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.390\nequipment that's around here in the audio\nequipment are running these cables.\n\n73\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.810\nWhich is why I could sneak over\nto the production room and\n\n74\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.820\nsnag a little bit of that.\n\n75\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.710\n&gt;&gt; I won't tell.\n\n76\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.420\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell anybody,\n\n77\n00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.905\nit'll just be between you, myself and\nwell, the rest of the internet there.\n\n78\n00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.690\n[LAUGH] So we talked about that.\n\n79\n00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.850\nRemember, we talked also\nabout how you could,\n\n80\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.440\nwithout having to try to stretch the\ncable, you could put couplers in there.\n\n81\n00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.350\nKeep in mind you're gonna get a certain\nlevel of signal loss when you're\n\n82\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.160\nusing couplers.\n\n83\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.960\nAgain, it's better to just run\na straight cable rather than put\n\n84\n00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.790\na coupler in the middle but\nsometimes you have to, right?\n\n85\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.950\nSometimes you run cable, and\nmaybe you don't do your measurements,\n\n86\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.268\nmaybe there's a wall in the way,\na truss in the way if you're running it.\n\n87\n00:04:14.268 --> 00:04:15.710\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Through ceilings.\n\n88\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.320\nTemporary, right?\n\n89\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.730\n&gt;&gt; It could, that's another point\nCherokee, I didn't bring that up,\n\n90\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.740\nthat's a great point.\n\n91\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.350\nCherokee mentions well,\nwhat if it's temporary?\n\n92\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.160\nWhat if I just need to test is the major\ncable that I'm using right now,\n\n93\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.690\ncan I use it?\n\n94\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.696\nWell maybe I just need\nto extend it by four,\n\n95\n00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:30.520\nfive feet to be able to test the cable,\nso great point.\n\n96\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.770\nNow we also talked about BNCs,\nthose connectors right,\n\n97\n00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.100\nthat attach the coaxial cable,\nwe looked at a little bit of them.\n\n98\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.440\nWe looked at the twist lock.\n\n99\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.320\nI do wanna show you one that\nis a twisting connector.\n\n100\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.540\nAnd in fact, I've got a image search\nthat I pulled up on my screen here.\n\n101\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.310\nAnd if we check out, I think this is\nWiki commons here, let's go ahead.\n\n102\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.080\nI tell you what,\nlet's view the image here.\n\n103\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.300\nYeah, so this is from your wiki,\nyour comments Wikipedia here.\n\n104\n00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.040\nThis is actually a F connector.\n\n105\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.620\nYou might have seen this one before,\nright?\n\n106\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.140\nThese are at the back of cable modems.\n\n107\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.016\nIf you've ever had to hook up an old VCR.\n\n108\n00:05:04.016 --> 00:05:05.833\nPeople, what is a VCR?\n\n109\n00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:06.536\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n110\n00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.350\nthe coaxial cables that\ngo out of a top set box.\n\n111\n00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.130\n&gt;&gt; Bless your heart.\n\n112\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n113\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.610\nI'm gonna age myself here.\n\n114\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.410\nAnd then they go into the back of your TV.\n\n115\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.540\nSo you've probably seen\nthese connectors before.\n\n116\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.590\nKeep in mind these are F connectors and\n\n117\n00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.510\nthey do go on the ends of\nyour coaxial implementations.\n\n118\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.423\nSo that's a little bit about the F\nconnector keep in mind if you use RJ6 or\n\n119\n00:05:27.423 --> 00:05:31.291\nexcuse me, RG6 regardless to\ndistinguish those RJ registered jack.\n\n120\n00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:36.201\nYou use [INAUDIBLE] implementation\nyour TS1 line are G goes\n\n121\n00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:41.210\nback to the old radio great\nmilitary book even [INAUDIBLE] but\n\n122\n00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.540\nthat is RG6 and was used in some\nof the older RG59/U cables.\n\n123\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.960\nAll right, so let's see there, Cherokee.\n\n124\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.880\nWhat else do they call out?\n\n125\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.330\nNow they call out some other things that\nwe can see inside of structural wiring.\n\n126\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.966\nAnd they call out two different types\nof telephony based on termination\n\n127\n00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:05.381\nblock if you will aware that we can\nterminate the telephone cables.\n\n128\n00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:08.651\nAnd there's a couple different types there\nthat they mention something known as a 66\n\n129\n00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:10.625\nbar and\nI mention something as known 110 block.\n\n130\n00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:17.530\nNow, please understand guys, that with the\ncharacteristics of the 66 and 110 block,\n\n131\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.590\nthey are not telling you that in the 66\nblock you can attach 66 devices and\n\n132\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.410\nin the 110 block that you\ncan attach 110 devices.\n\n133\n00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.680\nThis is more about the electrical\ncharacteristics and\n\n134\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.280\nthe capabilities of the device,\nand that capability if you will.\n\n135\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.930\nThe characteristic defines\nwhere it's gonna be used and\n\n136\n00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.200\nwhat it's gonna be used to terminate.\n\n137\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.380\nIn fact, if we pull up my screen here\nI've got one of the old 66 blocks here.\n\n138\n00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.150\nAnd you can see,\nyou've probably seen these.\n\n139\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.490\nYou find them in your building somewhere.\n\n140\n00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.490\nWhere there's usually typically a bare\nwall with like concrete blocks and\n\n141\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.382\nusually a lot of times, a big piece of\nplywood just bolted right into the wall.\n\n142\n00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:53.109\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] or something?\n\n143\n00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:54.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.\n\n144\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.770\nAnd then what this does\nis this terminates these.\n\n145\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.910\nYou use a punch down tool.\n\n146\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.840\nAnd, I don't know that if\nI had the punch down tool.\n\n147\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.620\nWe'll talk a little bit\nmore about that coming up.\n\n148\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.580\nBut a punch down tool, what it does is\nit allows you to embed the wire, and\n\n149\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.900\nwhat it does is it strips the wire,\nit embeds it, and then trims the wire off.\n\n150\n00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.160\nHence when we say the 66 punch down block,\nor the 66 block.\n\n151\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.160\nNow these are something that you'll see\ninside of the, like a CPE as they call it,\n\n152\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.510\nthe Customer Premise Equipment.\n\n153\n00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.710\nThe 110 block is something that you\nusually see, instructional wiring and\n\n154\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.160\nit's usually like to terminate things,\nlike within the Telco carrier's company,\n\n155\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.070\nbecause when you look at 110 block,\nyou can see that\n\n156\n00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.680\nthere's a lot more to it then just\na small, couple of strips of plastic here.\n\n157\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.650\nSo again, keep in mind that the 110,\nthe electrical characteristics, allow for\n\n158\n00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.550\na higher bandwidth.\n\n159\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.278\nWhich is typically why you'd see\nit used in structural wiring and\n\n160\n00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:50.749\ninside of things like the Telco companies,\nmore so than you will in your CPUs or\n\n161\n00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:52.814\nyour customer premise equipment.\n\n162\n00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:56.117\nAll right, so now that gets us\ninto the fun stuff, all right?\n\n163\n00:07:56.117 --> 00:07:58.160\nNow we're gonna talk\nabout something known.\n\n164\n00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.700\nAs copper media, we've already really\nbeen talking about copper media, but\n\n165\n00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.238\nwe've gotta kinda look more at some of\nthe characteristics of copper media for\n\n166\n00:08:07.238 --> 00:08:07.870\nthe exam.\n\n167\n00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.570\nAnd a couple of things that they call out,\n\n168\n00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.150\none of the things is what's known as\nshielded versus unshielded copper media.\n\n169\n00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.020\nIn fact, if we can go to the sky cam here,\n\n170\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.227\nI've got a couple of\ndifferent examples here.\n\n171\n00:08:19.227 --> 00:08:23.072\nAnd if I can get them into the camera,\nthat coaxial cable that I kind\n\n172\n00:08:23.072 --> 00:08:27.480\nof massacred on camera the other day to\nkind of show you what was inside of it.\n\n173\n00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.619\n&gt;&gt; Looks like a brillo pad in there.\n\n174\n00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:30.180\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is.\n\n175\n00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.500\nIt looks like somebody tried to,\nI don't know, wash it down and\n\n176\n00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.960\nthen turned on the garbage compactor or\nsomething.\n\n177\n00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.960\nBut it's definitely been through the 568W,\nor\n\n178\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.200\nthe Wes Standard here,\nI've been torturing this.\n\n179\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.840\nBut notice there's a foil\nshielding around it.\n\n180\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.670\nAnd in fact,\nthe coaxials go a little bit farther,\n\n181\n00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.960\nthey've even got a braided shielding.\n\n182\n00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.760\nAnd that stems even from the earliest\ndays of networking when we were still\n\n183\n00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.150\nusing this cable.\n\n184\n00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.050\nWell, the shielding here\nstrengthens its immunity to EMI,\n\n185\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.880\nor electromagnetic interference.\n\n186\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.930\nNow you have two different\ntypes of cables for\n\n187\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.080\ntwisted wire as well,\ntwisted-pair cabling too.\n\n188\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.820\nThis just happens to be what's\nknown as unshielded twisted pair,\n\n189\n00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.890\nand you can see, there's no foiling\naround the outside of this.\n\n190\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.726\nThat is what is known as UTP,\nor unshielded twisted pair.\n\n191\n00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:22.594\nI'll give you an example of where you\nwould see a shielded twisted pair.\n\n192\n00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:26.318\nWe talked about the RJ45 jacks,\nand the RJ45 jacks for\n\n193\n00:09:26.318 --> 00:09:32.300\nyour ethernet based networks typically are\ngonna be using unshielded twisted pair.\n\n194\n00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.840\nHowever, I will tell you though, that if\nyou're using the RJ, make sure I get the J\n\n195\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.850\nright, there, RJ48-C, and you're using\none of these wiring schematics for\n\n196\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.760\nterminating things like your T1 lines,\nthat's gonna be a shielded cable.\n\n197\n00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.101\nIt's gonna have the twisted pair, and\n\n198\n00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.280\nit's gonna have a shielding\naround the outside of it.\n\n199\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.400\nSo now what we have is kind\nof like a double protection.\n\n200\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.380\nAnd again,\nit doesn't completely eliminate it, but\n\n201\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.960\nit at least increases its resistance\nto electromagnetic interference.\n\n202\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.080\nNot only do we have the shields, but\n\n203\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.660\nwe also have the twist\nwithin the cable itself.\n\n204\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, when we look at\nthese different types of cables,\n\n205\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.310\nwhen we talk about shielded, unshielded,\n\n206\n00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.530\nwhat are we talking about\nas far as price-wise?\n\n207\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.662\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's a great question.\n\n208\n00:10:13.662 --> 00:10:18.027\nAny time you talk about shielding,\nyou talk about more components,\n\n209\n00:10:18.027 --> 00:10:19.768\nmore [CROSSTALK] material.\n\n210\n00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:20.620\nThat's right, exactly.\n\n211\n00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.461\nMore material inside of the cable,\nit typically means the more money they're\n\n212\n00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:26.660\ngonna charge you, the less money\nyou're gonna have in your wallet.\n\n213\n00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.598\nSo you have to be careful with that.\n\n214\n00:10:28.598 --> 00:10:33.293\nYou have to weigh the benefits versus the\nprice because maybe if you're running CAT\n\n215\n00:10:33.293 --> 00:10:36.645\n6 cable and you only need CAT 6 or\nyou need gigabit speeds,\n\n216\n00:10:36.645 --> 00:10:40.325\nwell, then your CAT 6 cable's\nprobably gonna be fine.\n\n217\n00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:45.255\nBut what if that CAT 6 cable, you have no\nchoice but to run it next to an elevator?\n\n218\n00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:46.745\nWell, unfortunately,\n\n219\n00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:50.655\nthe elevator is gonna give off a lot\nof electromagnetic interference.\n\n220\n00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:53.390\nThat's right, and\nthen if you add the shielding to it,\n\n221\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.950\nyou end up strengthening\nits resistance to EMI.\n\n222\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.798\nSo, you have to be careful where\nyou're gonna run these cables to,\n\n223\n00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:06.815\ncuz that'll define, again,\nwhat type you need to buy.\n\n224\n00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:11.485\nNow, one more time, if we can go to\nthe sky cam here, I do wanna talk about\n\n225\n00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:17.751\nsomething else, and that is plenum\nversus non-plenum, if you will, cabling.\n\n226\n00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:22.661\nNow, plenum, all right,\nplenum is a material that when it burns,\n\n227\n00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:25.089\nit doesn't give off a toxic gas.\n\n228\n00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:30.530\nAnd you might say, well wait, Wes,\nhow does that relate to wiring in general?\n\n229\n00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.140\nWell we also have something known as PVC.\n\n230\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.710\nIn fact, this is an example.\n\n231\n00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.750\nI believe this is an example of PVC,\nI can probably see it.\n\n232\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.320\nIt doesn't say plenum or not.\n\n233\n00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.120\nNo, I can't see, it is verified on here.\n\n234\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.880\nBut if it is a plenum cable,\nthen chances are, well,\n\n235\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.180\nyou're gonna see that it's a lot\nstiffer than the non-plenum, okay?\n\n236\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.030\nAnd plenum, the reason we want,\nif I can say that right,\n\n237\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.920\nwhere we would want to run plenum is\nin things like air handling spaces.\n\n238\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.350\nWhen we look at plenum, plenum is where,\n\n239\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.820\nif we have fire breaks, we're gonna\nwanna run these through fire breaks.\n\n240\n00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.380\nBecause not only does the jacket,\nplenum jacket, it doesn't give off a toxic\n\n241\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.990\ngas when burnt, the other thing is is that\nthe jacket, the reason the cable is so\n\n242\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.360\nstiff is because it really tightly\nwraps around these twisted cables.\n\n243\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.070\nNow, I can tell this is non plenum.\n\n244\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.860\nIt kinda looks like there's a lot\nof space in between those wires.\n\n245\n00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.000\nWell, non plenum, not only is it PVC,\npolyvinyl chloride, for\n\n246\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.310\nthe jacketing, that polyvinyl chloride,\nwhen burnt, gives off a toxic gas.\n\n247\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.340\nAnd then, and I know it's kind of hard to\nsee, there's an air space in here, right?\n\n248\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.420\nAnd that air space, well, think about what\nfire needs to expand, it needs oxygen.\n\n249\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.300\nSo, if it's trying to deplete all the\noxygen out of the room, and we've got some\n\n250\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:51.170\noxygen trapped into the small pocket\nwithin this cable, well, guess what?\n\n251\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.977\nIf you run non-plenum cable\nthrough your fire break walls,\n\n252\n00:12:53.977 --> 00:12:56.354\nyou've essentially negated\nthe fire break wall.\n\n253\n00:12:56.354 --> 00:13:00.104\nBecause the fire can travel through\nthis cable and make it into an area that\n\n254\n00:13:00.104 --> 00:13:04.230\noriginally, according to your building\ncode, it shouldn't have been there.\n\n255\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.110\n&gt;&gt; Now all those clues that Wes was\njust telling you about with the tighter\n\n256\n00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.450\njacketing and everything, and I don't\nknow if you guys can still see this from\n\n257\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.570\nthe overhead, but sometimes,\nit should say on there some kind of codes.\n\n258\n00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:24.590\nAnd usually, it'll be CMG or MMG for\nthe non-plenum there, or CM or NP.\n\n259\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.600\nI don't see that,\nlike you said, on this one.\n\n260\n00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.080\nBut sometimes you can use\nthe information that's printed\n\n261\n00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.580\non the actual cable to\nclue you in as well.\n\n262\n00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.210\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and you know what,\nwe could go even farther than that.\n\n263\n00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.949\nI know I'm gonna test our producers out\nhere because I'm gonna grab this big old\n\n264\n00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:42.493\nbox and\nsee [CROSSTALK] if I can put that one,\n\n265\n00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:46.117\nit really is because I've actually\ngot a box of CAT 6 cable.\n\n266\n00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.115\nLet me see if we can get\nthis into the screen here.\n\n267\n00:13:49.115 --> 00:13:51.375\nAnd lot of information, right?\n\n268\n00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:55.260\nRIght here on the side for us,\nhere, I can see that this is UTP.\n\n269\n00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.050\nNow remember what Cherokee said?\n\n270\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.440\nWhat were those numbers?\n\n271\n00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.060\nCM, CMR, CMP, CNX,\nwhich one did you say again?\n\n272\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.652\n&gt;&gt; It should be CMP or MMP for\n\n273\n00:14:06.652 --> 00:14:09.787\nnon-plenum [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, for\n\n274\n00:14:09.787 --> 00:14:12.690\nplenum, and we can see right there,\nthat's CM, guys.\n\n275\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.850\nYou notice that the check\nmark isn't there?\n\n276\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:20.321\nSo this is a non-plenum grade cabling,\nand I can see that it's CAT6.\n\n277\n00:14:20.321 --> 00:14:23.810\nI can see that it's unshielded,\ntwisted pair.\n\n278\n00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.970\nAll right, now,\nwhat if I don't have the box?\n\n279\n00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.500\nWell like Cherokee pointed out,\non this side, she mentioned,\n\n280\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.170\nand it's funny I say that and\nI can't, there it is, there we go.\n\n281\n00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.440\nYou can see some writing.\n\n282\n00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.760\nAnd I know it's kind of hard\nto see what's actually here.\n\n283\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.757\nBut it will tell you\nright on the side here,\n\n284\n00:14:42.757 --> 00:14:46.522\nit says verified to TIA EIA 568 standard,\nright?\n\n285\n00:14:46.522 --> 00:14:48.343\nAnd I know that's hard to see,\n\n286\n00:14:48.343 --> 00:14:50.138\nalthough it's okay-\n&gt;&gt; Plenum.\n\n287\n00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:51.225\n&gt;&gt; Plenum?\n\n288\n00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:54.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; This is the plenum grade, okay.\n\n289\n00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.980\nAll right, let me see here.\n\n290\n00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.270\nYeah, it does kind of look like, okay, so\napparently, this is the platinum grade.\n\n291\n00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:05.530\nAnd I guess I should have found out,\nbecause you can barely move the cable.\n\n292\n00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.980\nThe cable doesn't like to move,\nand that's a good thing.\n\n293\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.700\nYes, there we go.\n\n294\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.700\nThank you, thank you, Cherokee.\n\n295\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.740\nAnd notice how this one moves fairly easy.\n\n296\n00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.550\nThis one, not so much.\n\n297\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.697\nAnd like I said, that should have been\na telltale sign sometimes with the CAT6\n\n298\n00:15:17.697 --> 00:15:21.502\nbecause there's extra-\n&gt;&gt; They already have that internal-\n\n299\n00:15:21.502 --> 00:15:22.018\n&gt;&gt; They do,\n\n300\n00:15:22.018 --> 00:15:26.605\nthey've got an internal plastic sleeving\nto make sure that the cables, the pairs,\n\n301\n00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:28.750\ndon't need to be overlapping in a way.\n\n302\n00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.990\nSo, you can see them right there, and you\ncan see the UTP at the top of this box, so\n\n303\n00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.850\nit's unshielded twisted pair.\n\n304\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.796\nAgain, if this happened to be like\nsomething, a different implementation\n\n305\n00:15:38.796 --> 00:15:42.756\nwhere maybe you needed shielded twisted\npair, it would say it right there.\n\n306\n00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:46.360\nAnd again, you can find the information\non the side of the box.\n\n307\n00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.865\nYou can see the central\nconductor right there, right?\n\n308\n00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:53.100\nAnd we can see that it is a solid\ncopper conductor versus stranded.\n\n309\n00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.736\nYou can also see, if I can get my\nhand in the right position here.\n\n310\n00:15:55.736 --> 00:15:57.285\nThat we've got a gauge, right?\n\n311\n00:15:57.285 --> 00:16:01.309\nThe 23 AWG there that's\nthe American Wire Guide or\n\n312\n00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:05.070\nWire Gauge and\nI could see that it's four pairs.\n\n313\n00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.275\nSo, we have four twisted pair\nat a 23 gauge wire there.\n\n314\n00:16:09.275 --> 00:16:13.735\nSo all that information can be\nfound right on the side of the box.\n\n315\n00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:16.895\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, with all this information\nthat you're giving us so far,\n\n316\n00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:21.635\nyou said plenum versus non-plenum, what\nwould I choose to use more than the other?\n\n317\n00:16:21.635 --> 00:16:25.490\nI know you said that one doesn't\ncreate any kind of toxic fumes so\n\n318\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.240\nwould there be a particular environment?\n\n319\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.501\nLike you spoke about before,\n\n320\n00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:31.837\nreally environments will dictate which\ntype of materials we should be using.\n\n321\n00:16:31.837 --> 00:16:34.797\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nif it's a fire code, right and\n\n322\n00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:38.950\nyou'll have to pay attention to\nwhatever your local fire code is.\n\n323\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.953\nYou have a fire marshal there and\nthe fire marshals come around and\n\n324\n00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:43.820\nthey do their inspections, all right?\n\n325\n00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.443\nIf you have an error handling space,\nif you have a HVAC system,\n\n326\n00:16:47.443 --> 00:16:50.510\nthe heating, ventilation and\na C system, right,\n\n327\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.650\nair handling spaces, you're\ntypically gonna be running in there.\n\n328\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:17:00.370\nAnywhere, where there is air handling\nsystems, typically you'll run those.\n\n329\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.080\nEverywhere else pretty\nmuch is gonna be UTP,\n\n330\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.080\nit's gonna be unshielded twisted\npair just because the added expense.\n\n331\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.660\nIf we could save money where we don't need\n\n332\n00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.530\nthe security benefits of plenum\nthen well we can use it there.\n\n333\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.330\nSo for instance,\nif I happen to be running a drop cable,\n\n334\n00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.270\nthat would be unshielded twisted pair,\nright.\n\n335\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.860\nIf I've got my servers in the server\ncloset and we run a patch cable from\n\n336\n00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.890\nthe server to the patch panel, typically\nthat's gonna be unshielded twisted pair.\n\n337\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.880\nSo you do see areas like that.\n\n338\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.280\nLet's see here.\n\n339\n00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.110\nWhat else do we got?\n\n340\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.750\nWe got a lot of stuff here,\na lot of good stuff.\n\n341\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd I'm sorry, I keep messing you up here.\n\n342\n00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.452\nAnd just ignore me for today.\n\n343\n00:17:36.452 --> 00:17:40.370\nBut yes, I wanted to fact check here since\nthere was a little bit of confusion.\n\n344\n00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.670\nBut general purpose cables\nare barged with those CMG's.\n\n345\n00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.821\nSo that would be the none point of-\n&gt;&gt; Okay, got you, got you, very good.\n\n346\n00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:47.958\n&gt;&gt; Stick with what we said the first time.\n\n347\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.981\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No problem there.\n\n348\n00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:50.551\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n349\n00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:54.117\n&gt;&gt; So some of the things that we also\ngotta look at are, for instance,\n\n350\n00:17:54.117 --> 00:17:57.571\ncoaxial cables, and\nwe've been talking a lot about them guys.\n\n351\n00:17:57.571 --> 00:18:00.482\nBut I want to go ahead and make sure\nthat you've got your standards down,\n\n352\n00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:02.724\nin fact, I've got a couple here,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n353\n00:18:02.724 --> 00:18:05.660\nwe'll go back to the sky cam and\nwe'll do a little bit more show and tell.\n\n354\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.790\nNow, this one right here and, like I said,\nour production staff's gonna say,\n\n355\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.290\nnow I know where all those cables went,\nthat looks familiar.\n\n356\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.890\nAnd it's even wire, it ain't got\ngood cable management going on here.\n\n357\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.490\nAnd they're gonna have a hard\ntime with me, or a good time,\n\n358\n00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.180\nafter the show is done here.\n\n359\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.510\nThis is one of the older RJ-59,\nI believe this is an RG,\n\n360\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.605\nexcuse me, I get that in there eventually.\n\n361\n00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:32.610\nRG-59, you can see that it's a fairly\nthinner cable than what we use today.\n\n362\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:38.590\nAgain, still heavily used inside\nof audio and video applications.\n\n363\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.530\nAnytime you got voice or CCTV,\nyou're gonna still be seeing this.\n\n364\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:47.920\nThis is an older application and it was\nused in like older cable television.\n\n365\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.750\nThis is the newer implementation and\nman you can, I mean,\n\n366\n00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.280\nthis is a serious cable here.\n\n367\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.460\nThis is what we use today.\n\n368\n00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:59.787\nThis is the RG-6 cable versus the RG-59.\n\n369\n00:18:59.787 --> 00:19:05.677\nAgain, they do kind of call those out,\ndo we just keep in mind the RG59,\n\n370\n00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:12.930\ncommonly used today in CCTV, low powered\nvideo RF, low cost and short distances.\n\n371\n00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.760\n&gt;&gt; So Wes,\nthese cables kind of look similar.\n\n372\n00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.850\nAre we able to use them interchangeably or\n\n373\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.790\ndo they have the same electrical\nproperties or how does that work?\n\n374\n00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:25.840\n&gt;&gt; They both have, for instance,\nthey require a resistance of 75 ohms.\n\n375\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.190\nAgain, if you're talking\nabout something like RG-59,\n\n376\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.698\nit's not gonna stand up to\nthe things that the RG-6 cable is.\n\n377\n00:19:32.698 --> 00:19:39.150\nFor instance, RG-6 has better\nsignal quality to start with.\n\n378\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.850\nThe RG-6 has greater\ndistances over the RG-59.\n\n379\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.690\nSo, you do have to pay attention to\nthe implementations, I mean we're-\n\n380\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.280\n&gt;&gt; So take consideration,\n\n381\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.180\nnot just haphazardly.\n\n382\n00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.530\nI found this, it'll work.\n\n383\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n384\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.170\nJust because it fits doesn't mean\nthat you're supposed to use it so and\n\n385\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.700\ndo another thing like Cherokee\nmentioned earlier, pay attention,\n\n386\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.955\nif you don't happen to have a box if it's\njust comes in a bag like this if you\n\n387\n00:20:01.955 --> 00:20:04.740\ncould see this was terminated already for\nus.\n\n388\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.810\nWe got this cable this way.\n\n389\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.220\nJust look at the information\nthat's on the side of the cable.\n\n390\n00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.660\nIt tells you what it's rated for,\nit tells you what type of cable it is,\n\n391\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.930\nit give you some information and\n\n392\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.660\nthen you could always check whatever\nit is that you're attaching this to.\n\n393\n00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.880\nAnd just make sure that the documentation\nsays that that's the cable\n\n394\n00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.298\nyou are supposed to use.\n\n395\n00:20:20.298 --> 00:20:25.250\nAnd again, kinda back to your question,\nthe RG-59, shorter distances,\n\n396\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.860\ndoes have a lower cost because if you\nlook at this cable one more time.\n\n397\n00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.290\nI mean there's a lot of\nmeat to that cable, right.\n\n398\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:32.367\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Comparatively,\n\n399\n00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:36.260\nI mean you can see it's almost\ntwice the size of the cable, and\n\n400\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:40.190\nyou can see, all the extra braided\nshielding that they put in this one.\n\n401\n00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:46.460\nSo this is a really good cable, and\nit really does good with long distances.\n\n402\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:51.410\nAll right, well that takes us to some\ncabling standards that I want you to\n\n403\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.550\nbe aware of but Cherokee,\nI am looking at the time and I tell you,\n\n404\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.160\nI think it's gonna take a little bit\nmore than the time that we have to show\n\n405\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.250\nyou guys a little bit about TIA/EIA-568A,\n568B.\n\n406\n00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.990\n&gt;&gt; No worries, Wes,\nwe'll actually take the time,\n\n407\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.840\nseparate it out and then we'll be able\nto focus really on this next episode.\n\n408\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.730\nBut thank you for\n\n409\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.990\nshowing us the different cabling types\nthat we have so far in this episode.\n\n410\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.180\nI think we'll go ahead and wrap it up and\nremember I'm your show host,\n\n411\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.960\nCherokee Boost\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n412\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.052\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n413\n00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:27.938\n[MUSIC]\n\n414\n00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:31.509\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.125\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:15.228\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.228 --> 00:00:16.680\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.100\nIn the past couple of episodes, we've been\nlooking at different connector types,\n\n7\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.520\ndifferent connectors and the different\ntools that we use for those cabling types.\n\n8\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.760\nThis is actually part three, so with us\ntoday in studio we have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.260\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.530\nThat's right, boy,\n\n12\n00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.660\nthere is a lot to cover when it comes to\ndifferent cable types and connectors.\n\n13\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.640\nIt seems like we have a never\nending battle with this, so\n\n14\n00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.560\nhopefully we're gonna shed\nsome light on it yet.\n\n15\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.126\nWe did have just a little bit more cuz\npretty much what we've been talking about\n\n16\n00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:50.410\nit's been copper media.\n\n17\n00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.940\nWe've got a few more characteristics and\nattributes of copper media that we want\n\n18\n00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.790\nyou to look at and then we're gonna\ndeal a little bit with fiber.\n\n19\n00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.460\nWe’re also gonna talk a little\nbit about media conversion and\n\n20\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.630\nreally what that means for us.\n\n21\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.670\nEven show you a couple of\nthe devices that do media conversion\n\n22\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.640\nwhen we go from one format to another.\n\n23\n00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.730\nSo we've got some additional things that\nwe kind of wanna look at in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.990\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna start off.\n\n25\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.253\nI left off talking about cabling and\nhow we wire cables up,\n\n26\n00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:18.350\nwe're gonna mention that.\n\n27\n00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.295\nBut I figured we weren't gonna rush\nyou through it, and we'll go ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:22.992\nstart here.\n\n29\n00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:26.307\nSo I do wanna talk about a concept\nthat they call out on the exam,\n\n30\n00:01:26.307 --> 00:01:30.627\nthey call out what is known as a crossover\ncable, the straight-through cable and\n\n31\n00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:34.344\nanother one if you're not familiar\nit's called the rollover cable.\n\n32\n00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.200\nSo let's go ahead and\ntalk about what we mean when we say that.\n\n33\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.280\nWhat we're talking about is, we're not\ndefining the little, for instance,\n\n34\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.250\nwe've been talking briefly about\nthe RJ45 jack that we see so commonly\n\n35\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.410\ninside of our LAN-based technologies,\nEthernet technologies, right?\n\n36\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.180\nWhen we talk about RJ45 though,\nkeep in mind that what that does is that\n\n37\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.300\nreally just defines what\nthe shape of the connector is.\n\n38\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.170\nNow what we're talking about when we\nmention things like straight-through\n\n39\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.940\ncable, when we talk about a crossover\ncable, or the rollover cable, now what\n\n40\n00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.490\nwe're talking about is not the receptacle,\nbut how do these wires get arranged and\n\n41\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.670\nthen put back into the back of that\nlittle RJ45 jack and then crimp down.\n\n42\n00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.930\nThat's what really defines what type cable\nit is and what purpose we will use it for.\n\n43\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.950\nSo let me go ahead and let me,\nI've got a diagram up here and\n\n44\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.610\nI want you to keep in mind that\nwe've already mentioned this,\n\n45\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.340\nthat the RJ45 jack is also called\nthe 8P8C connector, right?\n\n46\n00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250\nAnd that's because, well, why?\n\n47\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.630\nThere are 8 individual pins,\nsome contacts if you will.\n\n48\n00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.040\nThere are 8 individual conductors.\n\n49\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.840\nSo we have 8P, pins, 8C, conductors.\n\n50\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.490\nSo be careful with that,\nit's not connectors, it's conductors.\n\n51\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.403\nNow, how they are arranged from one end of\nthe cable to the other side of the cable,\n\n52\n00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:03.193\ndefines whether they're straight-through,\nor crossover, or rollover.\n\n53\n00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:06.950\nNow the straight-through cable is one\nof the most common cables that we use\n\n54\n00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.290\nwhen we're connecting, for instance,\n\n55\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.070\nwe're connecting a device from the back of\nthe network adaptor, let's say on a PC or\n\n56\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.700\nserver, and\nwe plug it straight into a switch.\n\n57\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.415\nOr we plug that server into a patch panel,\n\n58\n00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:20.650\nwhat we're using is what's known\nas the straight-through cable.\n\n59\n00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.290\nAnd by looking at the cable there's really\nnot much you can tell that really is a,\n\n60\n00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.280\nhow do I know this is\na straight-through cable, right?\n\n61\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.620\nWell, if I didn't make it,\nI have to kind of look.\n\n62\n00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.371\nI have to kinda look at the ends, and I\nhave to look at the color arrangement and\n\n63\n00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:38.590\nI gotta see,\nare they the same on both sides?\n\n64\n00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.580\nBecause that's the key\npoint to keep in mind.\n\n65\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.760\nNotice in my diagram here on one side,\neight pins map up to the same conductor,\n\n66\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.130\nor wires, conductors map up to\nthe same pins on the other side.\n\n67\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.570\nSo pin 1, right?\n\n68\n00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.350\nBy the way, you have this order or\narrangement of the color coding, right?\n\n69\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.560\nTypically you have a white stripped\nwith the color, and then a solid color,\n\n70\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.550\nwhite stripe, solid color, white stripe\nwith that color, then solid color.\n\n71\n00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.785\nSo I just kinda used a dotted lines here,\nit makes it easier for\n\n72\n00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.600\nWes's artistic abilities here.\n\n73\n00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.740\nSo just imagine, if you will,\nwe're gonna play make believe here,\n\n74\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.160\nand the dotted line would be\nthe one with the stripe, but it's,\n\n75\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.180\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty universal.\n\n76\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, so the white stripe or\nthe orange stripe here.\n\n77\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.990\nSo we end up having orange to orange.\n\n78\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.600\nAnd we have, notice the green on 3,\nand a green on 6.\n\n79\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.160\nAnd then we have the blue on 4 and 5.\n\n80\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.490\nAnd brown on 6 and 7, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.863\nWell, this is called a straight through\ncable because the same conductors that\n\n82\n00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:45.236\nare on pin 1 is the same exact conductor\nall the way through from end-to-end of\n\n83\n00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:49.242\nthis cable is the same conductor on\nthe pin on the other side of the cable.\n\n84\n00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:53.715\n&gt;&gt; So what your saying is, Wes, that you\nwould follow that wiring schematic exact\n\n85\n00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:56.668\nsame when your terminating\nboth ends of that cable?\n\n86\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:00.049\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and\nto kind of build on that,\n\n87\n00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.844\nI kind of mentioned this term T568.\n\n88\n00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.280\nWell, what the heck does that even mean?\n\n89\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.220\nWell that's actually TIA,\nTelecommunication Industry Association.\n\n90\n00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.240\nGosh, I can't remember,\nElectronic Industries Alliance.\n\n91\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.840\nIt's hard to remember\nwhat TIA/EIA stood for,\n\n92\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.980\neven though EIA doesn't really\nexists this much anymore.\n\n93\n00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.360\nThis was a wiring standard that this\norganization, they standardized.\n\n94\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.912\nThey basically said that if\nyou're following this standard,\n\n95\n00:05:25.912 --> 00:05:30.080\nthen it doesn't matter if I've got\nthis cable, Cherokee comes in and\n\n96\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.750\nsays, hey, I got a box of these\ncables that are already to go.\n\n97\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.260\nWe know that if they're 568 whatever,\n\n98\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.300\nthat they're gonna be\nfollowing a certain standard.\n\n99\n00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.970\nWell, 568B actually follows\nthis standard right here.\n\n100\n00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.050\nSo I can really just label\nthis as 568B standard.\n\n101\n00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.500\nNow what does that mean?\n\n102\n00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.900\nWell, that means my orange conductors,\nall right?\n\n103\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.810\nMy orange conductors\nare gonna be on pins 1 and 2.\n\n104\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.400\nMy green conductors are gonna\nbe on pins 3 and 6.\n\n105\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.730\nNow let's step back a second and,\nwhat the heck are these pins even doing?\n\n106\n00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.710\nIt's nice to know what\nthe colors are doing but\n\n107\n00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.480\nlet's talk a little bit more\nabout what the pins are doing.\n\n108\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.050\nWell, what you end up having here,\n\n109\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.940\nis you end up having two of\nyour transmission lines, right?\n\n110\n00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.850\nThese are your send lines if you will.\n\n111\n00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.699\nSo, if I'm sending information\nfrom one to computer to the next,\n\n112\n00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.049\nI end up getting my transmission lines.\n\n113\n00:06:27.049 --> 00:06:30.801\nThe next lines here,\nare sentially the receive lines and\n\n114\n00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:34.959\nthat's pins 3 and 6 if you will,\nthese are all receive line.\n\n115\n00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:40.244\nNow if the send lines are the receive\nlines, or I should say conductors,\n\n116\n00:06:40.244 --> 00:06:45.702\nare the same on both sides and in the 1\nand 2 spots is your orange in the 3 and\n\n117\n00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:52.049\n6 spot the recipient lines are green,\nthen that means your running 568 B, right?\n\n118\n00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:56.647\nSo this is a 568 B straight-through cable.\n\n119\n00:06:56.647 --> 00:06:59.524\nWell, how do I know if I'm running that?\n\n120\n00:06:59.524 --> 00:07:02.480\nWell, we could take the time and\nI could sit there and I could tell you.\n\n121\n00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.680\nIt's can be really hard to do on this CAT\n6 cable cuz this is a factory made cable\n\n122\n00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.850\nand they do really good on sheaving\nthat all the way up to the conductors.\n\n123\n00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.899\nSo, that's gonna be very,\nvery hard to see.\n\n124\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.710\nOr I can do like, I think Cherokee you\nmentioned this in the last episode, right?\n\n125\n00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.910\nI could just read the information\non the side of the cable.\n\n126\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.200\nAnd then hopefully we've got\nenough of that cable to do that.\n\n127\n00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.520\nBut this being a factory built cable,\nwe shouldn't have a problem with that.\n\n128\n00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.148\nAnd I'm pretty sure if I look,\nsure enough.\n\n129\n00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:31.990\nAnd I know, you guys won't be\nable to see this on camera but\n\n130\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.137\nI got a TIA/EIA-568 standard on here.\n\n131\n00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:38.240\nSo we can see exactly what\nthe cabling standard is.\n\n132\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.760\nNow, that's a straight through cable.\n\n133\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.380\nWhat about a crossover cable?\n\n134\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.810\nWell, I want you to kind\nof see what's happening.\n\n135\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.844\nAnd I'll save the rollover cable for\n\n136\n00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:49.932\nlast because these are two\ncables that we commonly use.\n\n137\n00:07:49.932 --> 00:07:54.767\nNow remember that I told you an old modem\ncable you can basically simulate a point\n\n138\n00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:59.984\nto point connection between two computers\nwithout having the presence of the modem.\n\n139\n00:07:59.984 --> 00:08:02.527\nWell, we don't really use\nthose cables too more,\n\n140\n00:08:02.527 --> 00:08:06.330\nto make these point to point direct\ncommunications between two computers.\n\n141\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.190\nToday we use things like crossover cables.\n\n142\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.119\nAnd what's happening here, the reason we\ndon't need a connectivity device, right.\n\n143\n00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:15.170\nUnlike the straight through cable,\n\n144\n00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.940\nit's the switch that's doing\nthe forwarding between the ports and\n\n145\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.505\nchanging it from the fact that it received\nit on the transmit lines, and it sends it\n\n146\n00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:27.300\nout a port on the right recipient line or\nthe receive lines, right?\n\n147\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.381\nWell, that's the connectivity\ndevice doing that forwarding.\n\n148\n00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:35.711\nIf I make a crossover cable, I don't need\nto do the forwarding between two network\n\n149\n00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:39.564\nadapters, why, because when I send it out,\nlet's say, on this side.\n\n150\n00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:41.902\nAgain, remember your wiring standard,\nright?\n\n151\n00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:43.735\nWe're doing 568, oops.\n\n152\n00:08:43.735 --> 00:08:46.293\nWe're doing a bunch of\nspecial characters there.\n\n153\n00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:47.835\nLet's try that in English.\n\n154\n00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:50.138\n568B on one side.\n\n155\n00:08:50.138 --> 00:08:52.330\nBut now I want you to notice what happens,\nright?\n\n156\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.680\nAnd you guys are a smart crowd out there,\nyou could see,\n\n157\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.750\nwe have a crossing over, right?\n\n158\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.300\nA crossing of the streams, things\nthat we're not supposed to do, right?\n\n159\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.160\nEspecially when the Stay Puft\nMarshmallow Man is chasing you.\n\n160\n00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.450\nBut right in the middle,\nwhat you see is that the recipient line,\n\n161\n00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.770\nlet's go back to this here again.\n\n162\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.300\nLet's see if I can do\nthis a little easier.\n\n163\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:16.880\nCan always modify diagrams on the fly\nbecause that always works out well.\n\n164\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.870\nAll right, so\nnow we've got transmit lines and\n\n165\n00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.770\nwe've got the receive lines on one side,\nright?\n\n166\n00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.430\nBut I want you to notice what happens\nright in the middle of this cable,\n\n167\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.600\nat least some point in this cable.\n\n168\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.770\nNotice that the receive\nlines on this side crossover\n\n169\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.350\nto the transmit lines on this side, right?\n\n170\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.450\nAnd then I have, for instance,\nI can also do that to pins one and two.\n\n171\n00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.046\nAll right, so that means when this side\nof the cable, which we'll go ahead,\n\n172\n00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:51.737\nand I'll explain here in a second\nwhat this side means for us.\n\n173\n00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:54.806\nThis is actually the other standard, 568A.\n\n174\n00:09:54.806 --> 00:09:56.810\nAnd I'll come back to that in a second.\n\n175\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.470\nBut what that means is that\non one side of this cable,\n\n176\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.500\nthey're gonna receive something that was\ntransmitted on the other end of the cable.\n\n177\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.032\nReverse that order completely and\non the 568B side,\n\n178\n00:10:08.032 --> 00:10:11.941\nwe're gonna send information\nthat's gonna crossover, and\n\n179\n00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.940\nthe 568A side is gonna turn\ninto the receive lines, right?\n\n180\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.385\nSo that is how the crossover cable does.\n\n181\n00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:21.750\nIt's actually doing the switching for\nus, if you will,\n\n182\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.880\nright there in the middle of the cable.\n\n183\n00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.660\nNow, I want you to know that the pins\nthat are used in here, right?\n\n184\n00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.150\nSame thing on both sides.\n\n185\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.699\nThe wiring standard is what differs here.\n\n186\n00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:33.229\nAll right.\n\n187\n00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:34.540\nThe pins don't change.\n\n188\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.130\nThe pins, this is a hardware adapter.\n\n189\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.570\nIt's a hardware component.\n\n190\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.240\nRight, I'm not getting in there and\n\n191\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.190\nmanipulating the pins, with a magnifying\nglass and a soldering iron.\n\n192\n00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.700\nWell, I'd probably solder my foot\nto the ground, trying to do that.\n\n193\n00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.760\nBut you don't manipulate the pins,\nwhat you do is you manipulate the wiring\n\n194\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.190\nstandard, if you will, that's in the back\nof the little receptacle or plug,\n\n195\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.450\njack in this case,\nthat plugs into the adapter itself.\n\n196\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.970\nSo that's the crossover cable.\n\n197\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.350\nKeep in mind, we use that for\npoint-to-point communications when you\n\n198\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.750\ndon't wanna go through\na connectivity device.\n\n199\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.597\nYou might say, well, wait, West.\n\n200\n00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:09.849\nWhere would I ever use\nsomething like this?\n\n201\n00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:11.150\nIP cameras, right?\n\n202\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.060\nI had to actually do\nthis with an IP camera.\n\n203\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.560\nWe got a bunch of IP cameras in.\n\n204\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.600\nThey had been bought from another company.\n\n205\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:22.630\nThey had static IP address in them and\ndidn't set them to DHCP so\n\n206\n00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.870\nthere was no way that we could\nplug them into our networks and\n\n207\n00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.520\njust have them just pull\none of our IP addresses.\n\n208\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.980\nSo I had to get a crossover cable,\ntake my laptop and\n\n209\n00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.740\nplug it right into the back\nof the jack on the IP camera.\n\n210\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.480\nNow, I don't have to worry about\nthe fact that I don't have an IP address\n\n211\n00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.940\ncoming off of a connectivity device.\n\n212\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.920\nI got a direct connection to\nthe back of the IP camera and\n\n213\n00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.510\nI can now work with it without having\nto go through the connectivity device.\n\n214\n00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.502\nSo, there's a place where you\nwill see crossover cables.\n\n215\n00:11:49.502 --> 00:11:51.385\n[LAUGH] Now the last one.\n\n216\n00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:52.252\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n\n217\n00:11:52.252 --> 00:11:53.000\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say.\n\n218\n00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.620\nLet me make one more mention before\nI kinda move on out of here.\n\n219\n00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.710\nHow do I know if it's crossover cable?\n\n220\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.180\nWell, if I build it,\nI know it's a crossover cable.\n\n221\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.116\nIf I don't, I might just have to just\ndo the whole, hey, let me look here and\n\n222\n00:12:06.116 --> 00:12:08.410\nfigure them out, right?\n\n223\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.840\nSometimes, you might\nhave a crossover cable.\n\n224\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.080\nSometimes you might just\nbuild a crossover cable.\n\n225\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.685\nBut definitely, keep in mind that a\ncrossover cable's nothing more than a 568B\n\n226\n00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:20.871\non one side, and 568A on the other.\n\n227\n00:12:20.871 --> 00:12:24.918\n&gt;&gt; And Kurtis reminds us in the chat that\nif you do have a fluke networking device.\n\n228\n00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:28.546\nSome kind of a networking utility like\nthat, a tool that would be able to,\n\n229\n00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:31.998\ndepending on how money you put forth,\nor your organization puts out,\n\n230\n00:12:31.998 --> 00:12:34.580\nwould be able to tell\nthose pinouts as well.\n\n231\n00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.750\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, and\nthat would save so much time.\n\n232\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.660\nThose Fluke, man.\n\n233\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.203\nFluke, if you guys\naren't familiar with it.\n\n234\n00:12:41.203 --> 00:12:44.663\nFluke is probably one of the best\nnetworking tool companies out there.\n\n235\n00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:49.752\nIn fact, I've got client tools around\nhere, for my self stuff, but yeah.\n\n236\n00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:53.613\nFluke is a very, very good product,\nnot that we're making any money but\n\n237\n00:12:53.613 --> 00:12:55.651\nthey make some really good products.\n\n238\n00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:58.495\nAll right, so the crossover\ncable again might be sometime,\n\n239\n00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:01.894\njust have to identify because I made it,\nor if somebody else has made it,\n\n240\n00:13:01.894 --> 00:13:03.930\nI might have to just inspect those cables.\n\n241\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.843\nAnd then even if I inspect\nthe wiring in those cables,\n\n242\n00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:10.596\nI might have to do [LAUGH] like what\nchat room says, is to turn around and\n\n243\n00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:13.667\nplug them into some kind of cable tester,\nregardless.\n\n244\n00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.839\nAnd make sure that each one of the pins\nlights up, lets me know that we have\n\n245\n00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:20.430\nelectrical communication across\nevery one of the conductors.\n\n246\n00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.050\nNow that being said,\nwe've got another one.\n\n247\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.700\nNow, the other one is kind of interesting\nin the fact that, well, where do we see,\n\n248\n00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.830\nI hear a lot of people ask,\nwell, the rollover cable.\n\n249\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.310\nWhat is the principle of the rollover\ncable and why do we use it?\n\n250\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.710\nWell, the rollover cable, really guys,\nall I want you to know for\n\n251\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.220\nthe exams, it does exactly that.\n\n252\n00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.660\nPin one on one side of\nthe cable maps to pin eight,\n\n253\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.610\npin two, pin seven and\nyou can see that rolling over.\n\n254\n00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.730\nAll right, well where do we actually\nsee these cables at use today.\n\n255\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.230\nWell, these cables really are, for\ninstance like your consoled cables.\n\n256\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.080\nIn fact, I've got a consoled cable.\n\n257\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.320\nWe'll go ahead and we'll bring this\nconsoled cable up from to the sky camera\n\n258\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.380\nto kinda jump of camera here for a second.\n\n259\n00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:06.460\nAnd you can typically tell the, and\nI'll take this adapter off of here for\n\n260\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.970\na second cuz we can show\nyou a couple of things.\n\n261\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.180\nYou can typically tell\nthe crossover cable.\n\n262\n00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.400\nAgain, this is a consoled cable\nthat one of our other hosts\n\n263\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.870\nuses to consoled into a Cisco switch.\n\n264\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.530\nThis is actually Cisco proprietary,\nbut it is still a rollover cable.\n\n265\n00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.210\nAnd remember we talked\nabout the DB9 connector.\n\n266\n00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.410\nWell, right there is your DB9 connector.\n\n267\n00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.860\nAnd that goes potentially to\na console port on the switch.\n\n268\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.420\nHowever, we also have an adapter\nhere that allows it to plug in via,\n\n269\n00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.450\nI say that wrong.\n\n270\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.160\nThe Ethernet plug goes into the switch and\nthis goes into your computer,\n\n271\n00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.510\nif you don't have a consoled\nport on your computer.\n\n272\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.690\nWell, you can go basically DB9 to USB,\nso as a heads up.\n\n273\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.799\nBut this is the rollover cable, and\n\n274\n00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:54.877\nthe rollover cable essentially is\nthe way that we make connections,\n\n275\n00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:59.885\nconsoled connections into our connectivity\ndevices when we need to work with them.\n\n276\n00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:00.991\n&gt;&gt; West, this one's pretty flat.\n\n277\n00:15:00.991 --> 00:15:02.270\nAre they all gonna be like that?\n\n278\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.850\n&gt;&gt; They are, and\nthat's one of the things they do.\n\n279\n00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.710\nIt's a good point to mention there.\n\n280\n00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.280\nNotice that it is flat, like you said.\n\n281\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.080\nAnd they do that so that you know\nexactly what type of cable this is.\n\n282\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.460\nAnd it's easily distinguishable,\nso that we know, hey,\n\n283\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.290\nthat's not a crossover cable.\n\n284\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.171\nThat's not a straight cable, or straight\nthrough cable, I guess It's a flat cable.\n\n285\n00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:21.906\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n286\n00:15:21.906 --> 00:15:25.218\nthey do make it obvious there, and you\ncould tell with a flat cable there that,\n\n287\n00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:27.191\nthat is going to be one\nof the rollover cables.\n\n288\n00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:29.790\n&gt;&gt; I've seen some flat straight\nthroughs just for like,\n\n289\n00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.955\naesthetic purposes, but\nwhen it's coupled with this slight blue\n\n290\n00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:33.850\ncolor, then-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n291\n00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.520\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty, you're pretty sure\nto have the lower cable there.\n\n292\n00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Yet that always,\nthat always confused me cuz I always said,\n\n293\n00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.460\nI always tell people that yeah,\njust look for the flat cables.\n\n294\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.027\nThose are gonna be your rollover cables.\n\n295\n00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:48.332\nAnd then, yeah, you go into a place where\nthey're selling cutsie type network\n\n296\n00:15:48.332 --> 00:15:51.160\nconnectivity cables and\nstuff, and you got a flat,\n\n297\n00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.812\nalmost looks like a ribbon cable so,\ngo figure.\n\n298\n00:15:53.812 --> 00:15:56.090\nHowever, I will tell you\nmore in a corporate world.\n\n299\n00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.048\nThat's gonna be your rollover cable.\n\n300\n00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.035\nSo, definitely know that for the exam.\n\n301\n00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:03.786\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, you've been saying\nCAT throughout this show, so\n\n302\n00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:06.270\nwhat the heck are we talking about here,\nwhat is CAT?\n\n303\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, we mentioned that standards\nbody called TIA/EIA, right?\n\n304\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.820\nTelecommunications Industry association\nelectronics industry alliance,\n\n305\n00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.790\nthey're just, they're an international\nstandards, or, they're actually,\n\n306\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.890\nI don't know if they're international.\n\n307\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:20.870\nI know they're here in the US.\n\n308\n00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.760\nI believe they are, in fact, I don't think\nthey are international because I wanna say\n\n309\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.290\nthat they're governed by ANSI, which is\nthe American National Standards Institute.\n\n310\n00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.410\nHence, it would be here in the states.\n\n311\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.140\nBut either way, I digress.\n\n312\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.360\nThey are a standards body.\n\n313\n00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.979\nAnd they govern things like\ntelecommunications and\n\n314\n00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:37.955\nelectrical mechanics and our cables.\n\n315\n00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.185\nWell, you remember we\nwere mentioning 568 A.\n\n316\n00:16:40.185 --> 00:16:43.660\nAnd that is the commercial\nwiring standard from TIA/EIA.\n\n317\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.752\nWell, they also grade cables,\n\n318\n00:16:45.752 --> 00:16:50.870\ncables based on their transmission\nspeeds and they are called categories.\n\n319\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.430\nRight?\n\n320\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.130\nActually, I got a little chart here guys.\n\n321\n00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.267\nAnd I know this is not,\nreally isn't the fun stuff and\n\n322\n00:16:56.267 --> 00:17:00.665\nnobody really likes just straight\nstatistics here guys and I apologize but\n\n323\n00:17:00.665 --> 00:17:02.509\nwe have to know it for the exam.\n\n324\n00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:04.639\nBecause again, remember,\nyou're learning a different language.\n\n325\n00:17:04.639 --> 00:17:06.583\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Isn't the first\nplace you see it either.\n\n326\n00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:07.762\n&gt;&gt; No it's not.\n\n327\n00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:11.100\nIf you're taking A plus,\nI would know these.\n\n328\n00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.880\nIf you're taking Net Plus,\nyou're obviously watching now.\n\n329\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.600\nIf you're taking Server Plus,\nI would know these and maybe even in so\n\n330\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.930\nmuch as Security Plus.\n\n331\n00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.480\nI'm not so sure about Security Plus,\nbut they really teach you,\n\n332\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.520\nthey do ask you a lot of\nbasic networking stuff\n\n333\n00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.640\npretty much through a lot of the very\nbeginning of the CompTIA exam.\n\n334\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.150\nSo this is a good thing to know for\n\n335\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.630\nnot just this exam but\nquite a few of the CompTIA exams.\n\n336\n00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.060\nSo when we talk about categories,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n337\n00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.760\nWell, the first category that\nTIA EIA really recognizes,\n\n338\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.170\nyou might hear some other standards out\nthere and I'll talk briefly about those.\n\n339\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.420\nBut the first one that Tia really\ncalls out and recognizes a Category 3.\n\n340\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.380\nThese were our first ethernet cables.\n\n341\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.230\nNow, notice I have\nan ethernet name by them.\n\n342\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.710\nI want you to know them by\ntheir naming standard too.\n\n343\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.760\nWhen ethernet first\nwent into twisted pair,\n\n344\n00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.780\nwe were only talking about\nten megabit transfer speeds.\n\n345\n00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.060\nNow, I know you might be thinking,\nwell, my goodness, ten megs.\n\n346\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.040\nWho's going to be using a cable like that?\n\n347\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.590\nWell, telephones.\n\n348\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.250\nTelephones still use CAT3 cables.\n\n349\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.400\nAnd maybe even try to upgrade them to\nCAT5 today, but you might still see some\n\n350\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.740\nTelephone cables that are only using\nhalf the wires inside of of there so\n\n351\n00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.150\nthey still use them for\ntelecommunications today.\n\n352\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.700\nDon't count them out.\n\n353\n00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.290\nCAT5 cable,\nCAT5 cable that's the internet.\n\n354\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.870\nThat's why we moved up to\na hundred bit mega interspace.\n\n355\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.850\nNow, let's talk about\nthis distances here for\n\n356\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.650\na second cause they will\nbe a little confusing.\n\n357\n00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.780\nNow, there's little bit of\na typo here because I wanna\n\n358\n00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:42.150\nbe careful on this one because\ntechnically CAT5e is gigabit speeds.\n\n359\n00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:47.020\nYou can achieve gigabit speeds with, and\nI've done a lot of reading on this and\n\n360\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.480\nI've heard some people say,\nwell it's only certified for 250 Megs.\n\n361\n00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.280\nIt's actually standardized for\ngigabit speeds, but just keep in\n\n362\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.250\nmind that there is some back and\nforth on whether that's the case or not.\n\n363\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.160\nI'm just going to go ahead and go with the\nname and that CAT5e is a gigabit standard\n\n364\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.940\noffering you gigabit speeds:\none gigabit per second.\n\n365\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.910\nSo you say then wait a second,\nwhat's the difference between that and\n\n366\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.260\nthe CAT6 cable All right.\n\n367\n00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.910\nAnd here's our quality of the signal goes,\nall right.\n\n368\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:21.240\nWhen you look at the CAT6 cable,\nCAT6 is Gigabit Ethernet but\n\n369\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.160\nCAT6 can also support\n10G base networks too.\n\n370\n00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.890\nTechnically, CAT5 can support 10G\nnetwork maybe at a foot [LAUGH] But\n\n371\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:34.340\nit's not gonna do the 55 meters\nthat you can get out of 6a.\n\n372\n00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.390\nSo, please keep that in mind.\n\n373\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.790\nLast is CAT6 augmented as it's known,\nCAT6a.\n\n374\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.670\nAnd CAT6a was for\n\n375\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.820\napplication that needed 10 g speeds at\nthe full distance of a hundred meters.\n\n376\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.930\nNow, what do I mean by full distance?\n\n377\n00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.170\nAll of these different standards\nI want you to know for\n\n378\n00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.430\nthe exam just in case they ask you.\n\n379\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:59.341\nOne of the things that'll make it easier\non yourself is when you can remember one\n\n380\n00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:04.270\nattribute is the same for every single\nCAT cable, man does that make it easier.\n\n381\n00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:10.042\nAll CAT cables have a maximum\ndistance of 100 meters, 328 feet.\n\n382\n00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Those generalizations sure come\nin handy on an exam, don't they?\n\n383\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.490\n&gt;&gt; They really do and\nthey can save you a lot,\n\n384\n00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.440\nespecially if it's one question that you\ncan get three or four answers right, or\n\n385\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.400\none answer that you get three or\nfour questions right.\n\n386\n00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.690\nI'm not sure if you can but\nit does make it a lot easier.\n\n387\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.570\nHowever, I did put a note in here because\nI want you to understand that with\n\n388\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.990\nCAT6 and CAT6a,\nwhen you talk about 10G speeds,\n\n389\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.350\nwe'll talk about in other episodes\nwe'll talk about 10G based T,\n\n390\n00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:41.370\nwe'll talk about 10G based T, all right?\n\n391\n00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:46.000\nTo get 10 gig, 10 G speeds,\nwhat you're gonna need is not just a 50,\n\n392\n00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.360\nyou won't get that at 100 meters.\n\n393\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.830\nYou're only gonna get 10 G at\n55 meters in a CAT6 cable.\n\n394\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.740\nWith CAT6 augmented, however,\nyou could sustain the 10 G speeds out\n\n395\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.960\nto the full traditional length of a CAT\ncable and that's one thing to understand.\n\n396\n00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.800\nThat's what I mean by the full length\nbecause it doesn't matter what CAT cable,\n\n397\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.490\nif you want to go over 100 meters, you got\nto implement what is known as a repeater.\n\n398\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.850\nSo that's why I say full length\nof 100 meters or 328 feet.\n\n399\n00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.300\nNow, I don't know which question\nthey might give you on the exams, so\n\n400\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.010\nI want you to remember both meters and\nfeet.\n\n401\n00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.330\nIf you're still here in the States\non the empirical system where\n\n402\n00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:29.760\nyou're everywhere else that's using\nmetric, noble, just in case they ask you.\n\n403\n00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.802\nBut that's a little bit\nabout the CAT standards and\n\n404\n00:21:32.802 --> 00:21:36.280\nI would know these CAT standards\nwhen it comes to the exam.\n\n405\n00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.830\nLet's see here.\n\n406\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.630\nThe next thing that we're going to\ntalk about is fiber optic cables and\n\n407\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.030\nwhen we talk about fiber optic cables,\nwe really are kind of departing from\n\n408\n00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.350\nthe traditional copper cable\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n409\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.890\nbecause now we're talking\nabout an optical light source.\n\n410\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.870\nSo there are characteristics\nthat you have to be aware of for\n\n411\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.000\nthis cable in order to pass the exam.\n\n412\n00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.030\nAnd I went ahead and I've got a little\ndiagram drawn up for us here.\n\n413\n00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.160\nAnd I wanna talk about the two\ndifferent fiber mode types,\n\n414\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.060\nor fiber modes, if you will.\n\n415\n00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.946\nOne is known as multi-mode and\none is known as single mode.\n\n416\n00:22:12.946 --> 00:22:17.265\nNow, with multi-mode, what are the\ncharacteristics of multimode that we want\n\n417\n00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:18.855\nyou to be aware of for the exam.\n\n418\n00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:22.835\nThey call it multimode because you\nhave multiple optical light sources.\n\n419\n00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:24.275\nAnd what you have is a core.\n\n420\n00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:27.185\nYou have an outer cable, well,\nyou've got a few things.\n\n421\n00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:31.060\nIn fact, let's go ahead and I'll tell you\nwhat, and let's bring up the Skycam and\n\n422\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.440\nI'll kinda show you guys what's\ninside of this cable here.\n\n423\n00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.421\nInside a fiber-\n&gt;&gt; What did you do to this [CROSSTALK]\n\n424\n00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.511\n&gt;&gt; Fiber cable, yeah,\n\n425\n00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:39.700\nyou typically don't wanna be doing this.\n\n426\n00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.340\nFiber optic cable's expensive, but\n\n427\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.330\nwe happen to be here at the studios and\nwhen they were putting together\n\n428\n00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.580\nsome of our communications they\nleft a couple of these behind.\n\n429\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.970\nSo guys, this is a what,\nI think six-strand cooper.\n\n430\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.850\nIs it six strands of fiber in this?\n\n431\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.120\nI believe it might be five, but\n\n432\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.430\nI think it's six strands of\nfiber in here- it's five.\n\n433\n00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.720\nAlright, so there's the multiple\nfibers in here, all right?\n\n434\n00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.390\nAnd you say, well, yeah,\nI can see a rat's nest here, but\n\n435\n00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.310\nthese are strengthening fibers.\n\n436\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.520\nAnd then you also have this little\nstrengthening plastic in here.\n\n437\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.670\nSo what you have is,\nyou have an outer piece of cladding,\n\n438\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.460\nand that is what's known as 125 microns.\n\n439\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.030\nNow you might be asking yourself,\nwait a second, Why is that so important?\n\n440\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.370\nWhy should I know that?\n\n441\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.770\nWell, there's a standardized\nsize to all of these and\n\n442\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.810\nwhich type of mode you get will\nreally dictate how big the core is.\n\n443\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.770\nOne of the good things it's easy to\nremember is that the outside protective\n\n444\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.550\njacket here is always 125 microns,\nso that's easy to remember.\n\n445\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.841\n&gt;&gt; So you're not gonna be able\nto tell if it's multi-mode or\n\n446\n00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.678\nsingle-mode looking at the diameter alone.\n\n447\n00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:49.565\n&gt;&gt; That's right because they will be\nidentical in the difference choices\n\n448\n00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:50.198\nthat you have.\n\n449\n00:23:50.198 --> 00:23:54.121\nBut you can see, inside of this then,\nwe have the little fiber optics.\n\n450\n00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:56.957\nRight?\nAnd these are little strands of glass and\n\n451\n00:23:56.957 --> 00:23:59.540\nthen the outside is the cladding.\n\n452\n00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.960\nAnd what happens is is this\ncladding is reflective.\n\n453\n00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.830\nThey call it refraction, but\nit basically keeps the light that is\n\n454\n00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:11.410\ntravelling down the little glass cores\ninside of this fiber optic cable,\n\n455\n00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.280\ninside of the fiber optic cable here.\n\n456\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.564\nYou can also see that we\nhave this blue coating.\n\n457\n00:24:17.564 --> 00:24:18.677\nFor the most part,\n\n458\n00:24:18.677 --> 00:24:22.790\nyour cat cables don't really follow\nany kind of color coordination.\n\n459\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.550\nI mean if you like blue, get blue.\n\n460\n00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:25.377\nIf you like gray, get gray.\n\n461\n00:24:25.377 --> 00:24:27.494\n&gt;&gt; I mean I think the military does, but\n\n462\n00:24:27.494 --> 00:24:30.250\noutside of that it's kind of here and\nthere.\n\n463\n00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.993\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but\nthe fiber optics isn't that way.\n\n464\n00:24:31.993 --> 00:24:37.080\nIn fact fiber optics,\nyou're gonna see is a blue cable.\n\n465\n00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.509\nAnd I can show you that, cuz I actually\nhave a spool of it right here, and you-\n\n466\n00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:42.059\n&gt;&gt; You sure do.\n\n467\n00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:43.105\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n468\n00:24:43.105 --> 00:24:45.399\n&gt;&gt; You can see that it is a blue type\n\n469\n00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:47.170\nof cable here, right?\n\n470\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.003\nAnd that's actually the spool\nthat that came off, and\n\n471\n00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:51.858\nyou can see the blue coloring here.\n\n472\n00:24:51.858 --> 00:24:54.058\nThis is your fiber optic cable.\n\n473\n00:24:54.058 --> 00:24:58.128\nBut I wanna go into a little bit\nmore about what the modes mean, and\n\n474\n00:24:58.128 --> 00:25:01.474\nsome of those statistics\nthat we'll see on the mode.\n\n475\n00:25:01.474 --> 00:25:06.403\nSo we can go back here to my screen,\nyou'll see that the multimode,\n\n476\n00:25:06.403 --> 00:25:09.697\nall right, multiple light sources, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:09.697 --> 00:25:14.260\nAnd your outer core\ndiameter is a 125 microns.\n\n478\n00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.881\nAll right, a little mu symbol\nthere that Greek greek letter for\n\n479\n00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:20.078\nm is mu, actually stands for micron.\n\n480\n00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:26.182\nMicron is 1 millionth of a meter and\nyou can see here, that we have 50 or\n\n481\n00:25:26.182 --> 00:25:32.107\n62.5 microns as far as diameter\nof the core instead multi-mode.\n\n482\n00:25:32.107 --> 00:25:37.028\nAll right, now that's not\na range please keep that mind,\n\n483\n00:25:37.028 --> 00:25:41.160\nthat's not 50 to 62.5, it's either or.\n\n484\n00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.157\nYou'll see that they\ncome in two varieties.\n\n485\n00:25:43.157 --> 00:25:47.069\nNow due to the spacing\ninside of this core,\n\n486\n00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:51.330\nit allows for\na lot of signal loss, all right?\n\n487\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.392\nAnd due to that it's not\nreally precise if you will,\n\n488\n00:25:54.392 --> 00:25:57.881\nthis is typically gonna be\nmedium to short ranges, right?\n\n489\n00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:01.935\nMaybe inside of a building,\nand when we say short ranges,\n\n490\n00:26:01.935 --> 00:26:07.333\nI've seen two common standards,\n330 meters, also seen 550 meters.\n\n491\n00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:11.015\nThey do call out some that go\nup to about 2,000 or so, but\n\n492\n00:26:11.015 --> 00:26:15.588\nthose are the common ones,\n330 meters and 550 meter cable lengths.\n\n493\n00:26:15.588 --> 00:26:19.800\nSo you could see,\nrelatively short distances\n\n494\n00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.410\nversus something like\nyour single mode fiber.\n\n495\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:28.542\nNow with your single mode fiber,\nthe core is ultra concentrated, right?\n\n496\n00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:29.576\nIf you will,\n\n497\n00:26:29.576 --> 00:26:32.589\nif I was to put a target system on here-\n\n498\n00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:33.103\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; You can see it.\n\n499\n00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:35.484\nYes, it fires this laser.\n\n500\n00:26:35.484 --> 00:26:36.782\nAnd it's a laser,\n\n501\n00:26:36.782 --> 00:26:42.470\na single point of light down the center of\nthat cable essentially to the other side.\n\n502\n00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.094\nSo we gotta worry about things like bends\ninside of a cable, because if it bends,\n\n503\n00:26:46.094 --> 00:26:47.388\nyou can create signal loss.\n\n504\n00:26:47.388 --> 00:26:49.568\nThat's why when you have things like,\n\n505\n00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:52.750\nyour single mode fiber running\ninto your server closet.\n\n506\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:57.267\nYou'll typically have a bend that'll\nbe on the side of the server rack,\n\n507\n00:26:57.267 --> 00:27:02.167\nit's called a radius is bent, to make\nsure that the cable maintains a radius.\n\n508\n00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:02.891\n&gt;&gt; And what do you mean?\n\n509\n00:27:02.891 --> 00:27:04.358\nSo just look at\nthe manufacturer's rating on how?\n\n510\n00:27:04.358 --> 00:27:04.875\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n511\n00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:05.399\n&gt;&gt; Okay, perfect.\n\n512\n00:27:05.399 --> 00:27:07.748\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\nAnd if you wanna ever check that out,\n\n513\n00:27:07.748 --> 00:27:09.872\nwe've got a whole episode on Server+,\n\n514\n00:27:09.872 --> 00:27:13.010\nCompTIA Server+ that would\ntalk more in depth about that.\n\n515\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.718\nIf you wanna know a little bit more about\nthe insides of the datacenter and stuff.\n\n516\n00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:17.375\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n517\n00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:18.609\n&gt;&gt; Now, 9 microns, remember that?\n\n518\n00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:22.620\n125 microns for the diameter,\n9 microns for the core.\n\n519\n00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.156\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, was it you that was talking\nabout the diameter of a strand of hair in\n\n520\n00:27:27.156 --> 00:27:29.325\ncomparison to these microns here?\n\n521\n00:27:29.325 --> 00:27:30.022\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n522\n00:27:30.022 --> 00:27:30.992\n&gt;&gt; Have you heard that comparison before?\n\n523\n00:27:30.992 --> 00:27:31.923\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I have not.\n\n524\n00:27:31.923 --> 00:27:36.395\n&gt;&gt; Okay, when you think about\nthe diameter of these cores it's so tiny.\n\n525\n00:27:36.395 --> 00:27:41.025\nYou might want to be thinking about\ncomparing it to something the size of\n\n526\n00:27:41.025 --> 00:27:43.200\nthe diameter of a string of hair.\n\n527\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.301\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, that's actually\ninsane when you think about that.\n\n528\n00:27:46.301 --> 00:27:46.988\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n529\n00:27:46.988 --> 00:27:50.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Especially if people are gonna\nbe putting these cables together.\n\n530\n00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.380\nYou imagine how small of a cord\nis to terminate these cables?\n\n531\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.110\nThat's why it's typically gonna\nbe somebody that's it's gonna be\n\n532\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:57.060\na professional level.\n\n533\n00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.070\nNow, you typically use things like\nfield fusion splicers and stuff.\n\n534\n00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.676\nIt's not something that you break\nout a copper cable crimper and\n\n535\n00:28:03.676 --> 00:28:04.954\ncrimp them together.\n\n536\n00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:10.241\nBut the single mode fiber, keep in mind,\nthis is pretty much the longest\n\n537\n00:28:10.241 --> 00:28:15.170\nbounded transmission media we\nhave on the face of the Earth.\n\n538\n00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:20.351\nAnd you could see distances anywhere\nfrom 10,000 kilometers all the way up to\n\n539\n00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:26.506\n40 kilometers, 10,000 meters, I meant to\nsay, so 10 kilometers to 40 kilometers.\n\n540\n00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:31.834\nIn fact, our transatlantic cabling that\nconnects continents together, is typically\n\n541\n00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:36.810\nmade by these large chunks of, multiple\ncombinations of single mode fiber runs.\n\n542\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.700\n&gt;&gt; And I think it really depends on\nthe manufacturing process as well.\n\n543\n00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.610\nThere's not any set distances like we saw\nwith our copper cabling that you had.\n\n544\n00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.640\nThey have a little bit\nmore fluctuations there.\n\n545\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so let's go ahead and the\nother thing that I wanna do is show you\n\n546\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.320\nmultimode cable and\nshow you a single mode cable.\n\n547\n00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.123\nSo we'll go ahead and\nlet's go to the sky cam here and\n\n548\n00:28:58.123 --> 00:29:01.198\nwhat we're gonna do is I've\ngot a couple of cables here.\n\n549\n00:29:01.198 --> 00:29:05.810\nAnd what's interesting is like before\nI can't really tell them apart.\n\n550\n00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.480\nAll right, I mean if you look at these,\n\n551\n00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.795\nwell these cables look from the outside\nthey kinda look identical, right?\n\n552\n00:29:12.795 --> 00:29:15.798\nWell this is another one of\nthose type of cables, and\n\n553\n00:29:15.798 --> 00:29:17.721\nthis is a single mode cable here.\n\n554\n00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:22.930\nAnd I could tell that it's single mode,\nand I don't think you guys can see that.\n\n555\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:29.153\nBut right there next to my finger\nis a 9 and it says a /125.\n\n556\n00:29:29.153 --> 00:29:34.091\nWell what that's telling me is\nthat the core to this fiber optic\n\n557\n00:29:34.091 --> 00:29:35.776\ncable is 9 microns.\n\n558\n00:29:35.776 --> 00:29:39.125\nAnd then like we've already established,\n\n559\n00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:44.200\nthe outer part of that core\nis 125 microns in diameter.\n\n560\n00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:50.849\nBut this is a single mode cable, and\nif I was to break open one of these bags.\n\n561\n00:29:50.849 --> 00:29:55.226\nThis is actually a multimode cable and\n\n562\n00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:59.476\nI can't remember if it says it on it.\n\n563\n00:29:59.476 --> 00:30:04.537\nAnd I believe it does, I believe this\nsays 50 125, it might say 62.5 125.\n\n564\n00:30:04.537 --> 00:30:09.129\nLet me check here real quick, but that's\none of the great things about the cables,\n\n565\n00:30:09.129 --> 00:30:10.710\nyou can typically find out.\n\n566\n00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.710\nYep, so this one, kinda hard to see and\n\n567\n00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.660\nI'm not gonna break this cable up too\nmuch cuz it literally will break it.\n\n568\n00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.780\nThere's glass cores in there.\n\n569\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.971\nThis one actually says\n50/125 which lets me know,\n\n570\n00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:26.914\ndue to it's diameter,\nnot only on an exam question.\n\n571\n00:30:26.914 --> 00:30:32.019\nBut out there in the real\nworld knowing that 50/125\n\n572\n00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:37.570\nas far as the microns,\nit has to be a multi-mode fiber cable.\n\n573\n00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:41.720\nSo notice that the cables\nlook almost identical.\n\n574\n00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.872\nThere's not really much, I mean there's\na couple of connectors that will talk\n\n575\n00:30:44.872 --> 00:30:47.470\nabout coming up, and probably have\nto go into another part here.\n\n576\n00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.900\nBut you can see that from the most\npart these cables are the same.\n\n577\n00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.366\nAnd yes, that's exactly why you can see\nthat these standards are important.\n\n578\n00:30:55.366 --> 00:31:00.303\nNot only for an exam standpoint,\nbut also in the real world.\n\n579\n00:31:00.303 --> 00:31:03.347\nIf Cherokee was to tell me right now,\nhey Wes,\n\n580\n00:31:03.347 --> 00:31:06.560\nI need this the single mode fiber cable,\nright?\n\n581\n00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.261\nWell how do I know that that's\na single mode fiber cable?\n\n582\n00:31:09.261 --> 00:31:12.347\nOr if she says, hey,\nwe're gonna patch this down,\n\n583\n00:31:12.347 --> 00:31:14.530\nI need the multimode cable, right?\n\n584\n00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.031\nWell, how do I actually know?\n\n585\n00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:21.716\nAnd even having the information\nwritten on these cables,\n\n586\n00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:25.661\nif I don't know what a 50/125 is,\n\n587\n00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:30.660\nif I don't know what a 62.5 or a 9/125 is.\n\n588\n00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.717\nThen I don't know whether these are single\nmode cables or multi-mode cables.\n\n589\n00:31:33.717 --> 00:31:37.481\nSo understanding the standards,\nboy that's redundant.\n\n590\n00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.067\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Making sure you understand\n\n591\n00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:43.351\nthose standards is not only something\nthat's important for CompTIA exam.\n\n592\n00:31:43.351 --> 00:31:46.433\nBut it's also important for\nthe real world and\n\n593\n00:31:46.433 --> 00:31:51.460\nunderstand why fiber optics is\nsuch a fast transmission system.\n\n594\n00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.516\nLots of bandwidth, we don't have\ndevices that can flicker on and\n\n595\n00:31:55.516 --> 00:31:58.098\noff producing an optical signal enough to\n\n596\n00:31:58.098 --> 00:32:02.098\nsaturate the fiber optic cables\ncompletely that we have today.\n\n597\n00:32:02.098 --> 00:32:06.980\nSo the cables, or the technologies\nthat are transferring this data,\n\n598\n00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:11.630\nactually have to speed up to catch\nup with the cable's abilities.\n\n599\n00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.575\nHowever, I will tell you that one of\nthe great things about the fiber optics\n\n600\n00:32:14.575 --> 00:32:16.787\nis they're immune to\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n601\n00:32:16.787 --> 00:32:19.826\nNow you do have to worry about\nthings like splices and breaks,\n\n602\n00:32:19.826 --> 00:32:21.350\nyou have to worry about bends.\n\n603\n00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.387\nWe have somebody in the chat\nroom that mentioned,\n\n604\n00:32:23.387 --> 00:32:26.014\nthey are still susceptible to\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n605\n00:32:26.014 --> 00:32:29.115\nBecause the back always seems to\nfind them digging them up, and\n\n606\n00:32:29.115 --> 00:32:33.170\nthen you got a $12,000 troubleshooting\nticket that you have to deal with.\n\n607\n00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.964\nSo immunity to electromagnetic\ninterference, gonna be a lot better with\n\n608\n00:32:36.964 --> 00:32:40.465\nyour fiber optic cables than it's\ngonna be with your copper media.\n\n609\n00:32:41.895 --> 00:32:45.000\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, I hate to say it, but\nI think we have reached a part four.\n\n610\n00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.882\nBecause we have some additional tools and\n\n611\n00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:49.363\nsome other types of connectors\nthat we do wanna cover.\n\n612\n00:32:49.363 --> 00:32:51.697\nBut we are out of time for\nthis episode, so\n\n613\n00:32:51.697 --> 00:32:55.692\nstay tuned guys we do have some\nmore information headed your way.\n\n614\n00:32:55.692 --> 00:32:57.207\nWe're gonna call it quits for\nthis episode.\n\n615\n00:32:57.207 --> 00:32:58.915\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n616\n00:32:58.915 --> 00:32:59.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n617\n00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.744\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.Tv.\n\n618\n00:33:04.613 --> 00:33:11.328\n[MUSIC]\n\n619\n00:33:11.328 --> 00:33:12.896\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.344\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.443\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:18.073\nI'm your show host Cherokee Booss.\n\n6\n00:00:18.073 --> 00:00:21.503\nWe've made it through a part one,\na part two, three, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:26.197\nyes, now we're at a part four, for\nour cable types, tools, and connectors.\n\n8\n00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:30.236\nSo with us today in studios, we have Mr.\nWes Bryant to continue speaking upon these\n\n9\n00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.671\ndifferent types of cable\nthat we have available.\n\n10\n00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:33.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Thanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.300\nYeah, we're working on a miniseries here,\nfor sure.\n\n12\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.050\nNot too much longer and we'll be in\nthe territory of a Stephen King novel.\n\n13\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.550\nBut we had a little bit more,\n[LAUGH] and I said, you know what?\n\n14\n00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.191\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna make sure that category wise,\n\n15\n00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:51.159\nthis is gonna be in one show, but\nit's actually been a series of shows now.\n\n16\n00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.351\nBut at least the categories all the same\nbecause well, as you've guys have seen if\n\n17\n00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.383\nyou've watched the past three episodes,\nthere's a lot to know for the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:00.735\nAnd we want you to be prepared for it.\n\n19\n00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:03.645\nAnd we wanna make sure that you\nhave some of the statistics and\n\n20\n00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:07.140\nspecifications under your belt as\nyou prepare to go in the exam booth.\n\n21\n00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.760\nOr, if you just happen to be somebody that\nmaybe just kinda refreshing your skills,\n\n22\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.750\nmaybe certification's not\nsomething that you're trying.\n\n23\n00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.160\nYou just kinda wanna know, hey I remember\nnetworks way back in the 80s and\n\n24\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.330\nthe mid 80s, late 80s.\n\n25\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.090\nAnd then maybe they're\njust trying to update.\n\n26\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.810\nSo either way, it's all good.\n\n27\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.150\nBut we wanna make sure that\nyou have those specifications.\n\n28\n00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.230\nAnd what we're gonna move into is,\nin the last episode we left off kinda\n\n29\n00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.400\ntalking about fiber optic cabling and\nwhy the standards are important to you.\n\n30\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.990\nAnd really why you should\nget them under your belt,\n\n31\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.000\nwhether you are in\na certification endeavor or\n\n32\n00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.600\nyou're just out there in the field.\n\n33\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.510\nBut we also now wanna take and talk\na little bit more about how do we take,\n\n34\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.060\nif I've got a copper based media and\n\n35\n00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.150\nsend signals over a media that maybe\nis using optical light, or vice-versa.\n\n36\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.830\nAnd that's there something\nknown as media converters.\n\n37\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.750\nWhen we have, for instance,\n\n38\n00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.080\na copper-based twisted pair, remember than\nwhen we talk about things like Ethernet,\n\n39\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.600\nEthernet Physical layer defines\nthings like fiber-optic cabling and\n\n40\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.560\ntwisted pairing going back 30,\n40 years ago, coaxial cable, as well.\n\n41\n00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.949\nWell, those are two completely different,\ndissimilar medias and\n\n42\n00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.863\nwe know that the reason we go\nthrough standardization is so\n\n43\n00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:23.499\nthat we have some kinda interoperability\nbetween dissimilar systems.\n\n44\n00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.285\nSo, do we have many interoperability here?\n\n45\n00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:27.600\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n46\n00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.450\nLet me go and show you what I mean.\n\n47\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.535\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n48\n00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:32.180\nSo you could just conceptually\nunderstand what we mean, right?\n\n49\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.784\nWhen we talk about multi-mode fiber, like\nwe mentioned towards the end of the last\n\n50\n00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:39.248\nepisode, we talked about how there were\nmultiple light sources a lot of times.\n\n51\n00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:44.920\nHigh powered LEDs versus a single\nlight source that is singlemode fiber.\n\n52\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.060\nSo, very generically,\nwe have converters out there that allow\n\n53\n00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.966\nus to take a singlemode media, if you\nwill, or singlemode transmission and\n\n54\n00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:57.817\nconvert it over to multimode and\nthen, vice versa as well.\n\n55\n00:02:57.817 --> 00:03:00.846\nNow, with the last two,\nI really just kinda jumbled them together.\n\n56\n00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:05.730\nAnd the reason I say that is because they\nalso call out things like a multimode or\n\n57\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.694\nfiber the Ethernet,\nEthernet to a multimode.\n\n58\n00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:11.581\nWell guys, when it comes down to\nit what are these really doing,\n\n59\n00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:14.317\nit's really about copper media\nto an optical light source.\n\n60\n00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:17.540\nSo I went ahead and put it in here\ntogether, whether it's ethernet you're\n\n61\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.070\ntalking about, UTP unshield the twisted\npair you're talking about coaxial with\n\n62\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.620\na single central copper conductor,\nyou're still talking about copper medias.\n\n63\n00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.660\nSo you're going from an optical light\nsource to electromagnetic impulses and\n\n64\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.100\nvice versa, if you will.\n\n65\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.070\nAnd the same thing goes\nwith singlemode too, right.\n\n66\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.730\nWe can say singlemode and coaxial.\n\n67\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.360\nWe can say singlemode to Ethernet,\nand then flip those terms around.\n\n68\n00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.120\nIn the end, really, what is it?\n\n69\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.920\nIt's singlemode to some\ncopper based medium.\n\n70\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.270\nNow what do these media\nconverters look like?\n\n71\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.092\nWell, in the earlier days,\nwe would have what are known as GBICs.\n\n72\n00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:53.751\nAnd I tell you what, let's go shopping\nhere with some of Cherokee's money here.\n\n73\n00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:58.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go look at the old GBIC,\n\n74\n00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.759\nthat's a Gigabit Ethernet converter.\n\n75\n00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:04.575\nThere's one.\nOne right here.\n\n76\n00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:09.095\nAnd, in the old days,\nI wonder if I can view that, there we go.\n\n77\n00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:11.415\nMake sure that we're doing\nour commons wiki here.\n\n78\n00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:14.505\nIn the older days, for\ninstance the ST connectors, right?\n\n79\n00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.204\nThese are the standard tip connectors,\nor straight tip connectors.\n\n80\n00:04:18.204 --> 00:04:18.972\nYou would have two.\n\n81\n00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:21.990\nAnd they'd plug into this converter.\n\n82\n00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.810\nAnd then in the back of them,\nyou would have some copper based media,\n\n83\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.760\nwhether it was an Ethernet adapter.\n\n84\n00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.480\nYou could plug,\nthese are little modules if you will.\n\n85\n00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.840\nToday though what you have is,\nthese are really a thing of the past.\n\n86\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.310\nNot saying that you won't\nsee them out there.\n\n87\n00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.790\nBut they're more of an older technology.\n\n88\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.750\nAnd they don't allow for\nreally good port density.\n\n89\n00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.460\nAnd what we mean by port density is,\n\n90\n00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.930\nif we look at the switch, you look at the\ndevice that these are on, the bigger, or\n\n91\n00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.590\nwhatever, the module is,\nthe less devices you can connect to it.\n\n92\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.360\nSo, they went to this form factor, that's\nactually an SFP, if I get that right.\n\n93\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.758\nI always have to make it's, so we're\nnot talking about sun tan lotion here.\n\n94\n00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:04.625\nSmall form factor pluggable module, SPF is\nthe sun tan lotion, that's not what we're\n\n95\n00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.599\ntalking about, we're talking\nSmall Form Factor Pluggable Modules.\n\n96\n00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.544\nAnd this is gone through a couple\nof different standards to it.\n\n97\n00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.950\nI think currently we've got SFP+.\n\n98\n00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.050\nBut these are the modules that you see.\n\n99\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.870\nAnd I tell you,\nwe're gonna test our producer out there.\n\n100\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.160\nIf we could switch over\nto the Skycam here.\n\n101\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.030\nI actually got a couple of\nthese ready to go for us.\n\n102\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.210\nAnd I know they're kind of hard to see but\nthese are what we're using today right.\n\n103\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.455\nThese are the same thing,\nthese are the small,\n\n104\n00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:36.162\nthe SFPs there if you will,\nsmall formfactor plugable modules, and\n\n105\n00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:39.670\nthey really just slide\nright into the switch here.\n\n106\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.720\nNow I know it's kind of hard to see\nhere but we've got two ports, and\n\n107\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.220\nwe've got a port that will plug in\nthere and a port that'll plug in here.\n\n108\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.720\nSo if you have, for instance,\nI believe this is our LC connector.\n\n109\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.580\nLet's see if we can do this.\n\n110\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.250\nOne of the older ones here.\n\n111\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.680\nMight have that upside down.\n\n112\n00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.560\nThere we go.\n\n113\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.070\nAnd you just basically plug that in here,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.075\nAnd then you can see how small that is.\n\n115\n00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:06.265\nWe can plug more than one of the modules\ninto the switch provided that's\n\n116\n00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:06.975\nwhat we have.\n\n117\n00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:10.365\nThat's essentially a module that's\nallowing you to do media conversion.\n\n118\n00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:14.385\nWhen we look at media conversion, we're\nessentially talking about taking that\n\n119\n00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:19.465\nfiber optic optical light source,\nwe talk about turning around and\n\n120\n00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:23.190\nconverting it to a copper media and\nvice versa.\n\n121\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.450\nHowever, I will tell you today though,\nyou're gonna see these more than you will\n\n122\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.490\nsee the other ones that you were showing,\nthe earlier GBICs.\n\n123\n00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.320\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Wes what you're saying\nis that I could have a switch that\n\n124\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.690\nsupports this conversion.\n\n125\n00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.410\nAnd because my switch\nis also plugged into,\n\n126\n00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.030\nthe AC is receiving electrical current,\nI can go ahead, because we\n\n127\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.850\nknow that with our copper cabling,\nall right, there's electrical impulses.\n\n128\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.976\nI can take that light and\nperform that conversion.\n\n129\n00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:55.080\nBut, there are also devices that\nperform these conversions and\n\n130\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.753\na switch is not involved.\n\n131\n00:06:56.753 --> 00:06:59.009\nTo just have a separate little converter.\n\n132\n00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.079\nAnd it's kind of crazy if you think about\nit, because if you go from optical media,\n\n133\n00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:09.370\nlight impulses, and you don't have that\nprevious existing electrical pulse.\n\n134\n00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.350\nYou're going to need AC source, right?\n\n135\n00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.890\nSo, that's something I\nwould need to think about.\n\n136\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you exactly.\n\n137\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.645\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n138\n00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:19.508\nLet me show you what some of those\nexternal boxes that she was talking about.\n\n139\n00:07:19.508 --> 00:07:20.682\nIf you talk about for\n\n140\n00:07:20.682 --> 00:07:24.908\nsomething like this more shopping\nhere on [LAUGH] Cherokee's dime here.\n\n141\n00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:26.577\nLet me show you a little bit more.\n\n142\n00:07:26.577 --> 00:07:29.376\nIf we talk about for instance,\n\n143\n00:07:29.376 --> 00:07:34.230\none of the singlemode to\nmultimode media converter.\n\n144\n00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.350\nYou can see that they're not all modular,\nif you will,\n\n145\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.690\nlike we've seen this little\none being pluggable.\n\n146\n00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.080\nNotice this external box here, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.880\nAnd you can see that we're talking\nabout multimode to singlemode here, and\n\n148\n00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.440\nit's got two ports on the outside.\n\n149\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.260\nSo yes, you could have something\nthat's completely external to\n\n150\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.490\nthe switch itself doing\nthat conversion for you.\n\n151\n00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.789\nSo, please understand\nthat more often than not,\n\n152\n00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:59.925\nwhat you're gonna see is something\nlike this in the server closet.\n\n153\n00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:02.843\nThat doesn't mean you wouldn't\nsee these devices here.\n\n154\n00:08:02.843 --> 00:08:04.740\nObviously they get very expensive.\n\n155\n00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.331\nAnd you can see the external\nones out there likewise too.\n\n156\n00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.548\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about the media converters.\n\n157\n00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:14.332\nThe other thing I wanna talk\nabout because they do mention it,\n\n158\n00:08:14.332 --> 00:08:15.890\nwe talked about couplers before.\n\n159\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.000\nI think I'll go ahead and\nmention that here.\n\n160\n00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.754\nWhen we look at a fiber optic coupler,\nright, again,\n\n161\n00:08:21.754 --> 00:08:26.834\npretty close to what we've seen with\nsome of the other couplers, right?\n\n162\n00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:28.960\nThe concept is essentially the same.\n\n163\n00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.690\nWe've got two fibers, right?\n\n164\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.310\nYou can't really stretch them, right?\n\n165\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.700\nWell, I could put a coupler on one.\n\n166\n00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.667\nAnd if I could extend it\nout a little bit further,\n\n167\n00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:40.780\nand it allows me the ability\nto extend two pieces of fiber.\n\n168\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.953\nHowever, better to do\nyour homework first and\n\n169\n00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:45.247\nmake sure you have plenty\nof length of the cable.\n\n170\n00:08:45.247 --> 00:08:48.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say, if you don't\nhave someone who's trained in terminating\n\n171\n00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:50.740\nthose, you normally buy\nthem to a pre-cut size.\n\n172\n00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.991\nSo, like you said,\ndo your homework ahead of time,\n\n173\n00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.410\nmake sure you've got that\nrun measured out correctly.\n\n174\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.990\nYou probably won't have to use these.\n\n175\n00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.020\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, most definitely.\n\n176\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.940\nAll right, so that takes us to the next\ntopic that we kind of wanna look at, and\n\n177\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.810\nwe're gonna continue to do\na little bit of shopping here.\n\n178\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.860\nI wanna talk about some of the connectors,\nand\n\n179\n00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.280\na couple of them, I'm gonna show you here,\nwe'll demonstrate them.\n\n180\n00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.780\nI've got them sitting next to me.\n\n181\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.720\nOne, I do not,\nbecause this is an older connector, and\n\n182\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.310\nthis is known as the straight tip,\nor standard connector.\n\n183\n00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.530\nAnd you can see, it's kind of\nlike this bayonet style here, and\n\n184\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.580\nit really looks like a BNC connector.\n\n185\n00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.422\nIf you've seen the earlier episodes where\nwe showed you the BNC connector, and\n\n186\n00:09:29.422 --> 00:09:33.470\nit had that twist to lock,\nthat's exactly what the ST connector is.\n\n187\n00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.320\nThe difference is, let's say,\nit's a fiber optic connector, right?\n\n188\n00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.760\nI really don't have that one to show you\nhere and a couple of the other ones I do.\n\n189\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.890\nSo know the straight tip or standard tip\nconnector, again, it's an older connector.\n\n190\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.140\nIt's not that it's completely obsolete,\nlike the old biconic connectors and\n\n191\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.860\nstuff, it is out there, but\ndo be aware of it at least for\n\n192\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.570\nthe exam,\neven if you don't see it in the field.\n\n193\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.800\nNow there are a couple\nof other ones here too,\n\n194\n00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.520\nlet me make sure I get all of these right.\n\n195\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.240\nI can actually show you these.\n\n196\n00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.430\nThe cable that I'm using right here,\nif we can go to the sky cam,\n\n197\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.510\nthis actually uses two connectors\nthat are in your list here.\n\n198\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.990\nOne here,\nthis is called the subscriber connector.\n\n199\n00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.770\nI know,\nI think I misspoke earlier when I said ST,\n\n200\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.459\nremember, ST is straight tip or\nstandard tipped connector.\n\n201\n00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:27.493\nI said subscriber connector, that's wrong,\nthis is the subscriber connector,\n\n202\n00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.240\nthis is the SC connector.\n\n203\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.870\nAnd you can see,\nit really is a box connector,\n\n204\n00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.662\nit's usually done in a duplexing scenario.\n\n205\n00:10:36.662 --> 00:10:40.110\nAnd there's little, if I can get\nthis without actually breaking it,\n\n206\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.468\nyou can actually switch these from,\nlet me see if I can get the lock off.\n\n207\n00:10:45.468 --> 00:10:49.040\nThere we go.\nThere are two strands of fiber, right?\n\n208\n00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.740\nAnd you have a transmission line,\nand then you have a recipient line.\n\n209\n00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.030\nSo transmit,\nreceive depending on which side.\n\n210\n00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.160\nAnd if you only had them in a half duplex\nconfiguration, well, you could use one,\n\n211\n00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.252\nbut typically, they're paired together.\n\n212\n00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:04.670\nAll right,\nthis is an older connector as well.\n\n213\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.780\nOne of the things that you can\nsee in relationship to our SFPs\n\n214\n00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:14.750\nis that just one of these boxes\nis almost as big as this SFB.\n\n215\n00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.756\nSo we kind of run into the problem with\nthese older connectors that we would in\n\n216\n00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:24.780\nthe G Mix is that it doesn't allow for\na good amount of port density, right?\n\n217\n00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.010\nWe kind of waste space in the switches.\n\n218\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:31.790\nAnd every inch of your server closet is so\nexpensive.\n\n219\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.360\nYou just don't want that.\n\n220\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.650\nSo we have what's known\nas the LC connector,\n\n221\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.670\nand I've heard this called\nmany different things.\n\n222\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.280\nI've heard it called the little connector,\nI've heard it called the local connector,\n\n223\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.810\nand more currently, and I think a little\nbit more correct is the lucent connector.\n\n224\n00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.220\nThe lucent connector being, I believe,\nthe company that was responsible for\n\n225\n00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.010\ninventing it.\n\n226\n00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.560\nI'm not sure on that last bit.\n\n227\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.702\nBut please know that I've also heard it\ncalled the locent connector, L-O-C-E-N-T,\n\n228\n00:11:58.702 --> 00:11:59.250\nI believe.\n\n229\n00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.470\nIt might be C-I-E-N-T, but\neither way, it is an LC connector.\n\n230\n00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.070\nThat's what the standard calls it.\n\n231\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.190\nAnd they're identical,\nexcept for one thing.\n\n232\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.620\nNotice that I almost have\ntwo of these connectors,\n\n233\n00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.060\nI can put in just one of these.\n\n234\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.600\nSo, we've pretty much moved,\nand I'll show you a current,\n\n235\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.760\nthis is a multi-mode cable here.\n\n236\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.420\nAnd this is a current cable.\n\n237\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:26.445\nAnd if you'll notice, both sides of\nthis cable are LC connectors, right?\n\n238\n00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:29.815\nBoth sides are the LC connectors,\ncuz that's typically what we're using.\n\n239\n00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:33.796\nBut if you had an older system that was\nusing one of the earlier subscriber\n\n240\n00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:38.050\nconnectors, or standard connector,\nSC, gotta get those acronyms right.\n\n241\n00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.822\nAnd you were connecting\nit to a newer connector.\n\n242\n00:12:43.822 --> 00:12:46.242\nWell, then you have that\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n243\n00:12:46.242 --> 00:12:49.830\nBut then once you move your\ndevices to the newer connector,\n\n244\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:54.517\nyou can get rid of these older cables, and\nyou can move to one that has LC to LC.\n\n245\n00:12:54.517 --> 00:12:59.193\nNow Cherokee, we were kinda talking about,\nbefore we even started here, Cherokee was\n\n246\n00:12:59.193 --> 00:13:03.383\nkind of mentioning, you're gonna talk\nabout those covers that are on there.\n\n247\n00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:06.630\nLet's go ahead and show you that,\nwhat she was talking about.\n\n248\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.960\nNotice that this one, and\nI know it's kinda hard to see there,\n\n249\n00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.950\nguys, there isn't a cover here.\n\n250\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.740\nYou can actually see the little plastic\ntop there, that's right, it is.\n\n251\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.190\nThat's exactly what it is, and I can't see\ndown there, but I don't think you can,\n\n252\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.700\nbut right behind this is the fiber,\nall right?\n\n253\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.930\nBut I want you to notice that this\none kind of looks covered up.\n\n254\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.250\nSo, what's that about?\n\n255\n00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.868\nWell, that's actually just, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I got it.\n\n256\n00:13:31.868 --> 00:13:34.365\n&gt;&gt; As I throw it, she caught that too,\nbelieve it or not, good catch.\n\n257\n00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.940\n[LAUGH] Sorry to throw\nthings at you there.\n\n258\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.740\nThat's actually a cover trying\nto protect the fiber and\n\n259\n00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.820\ntake Cherokee's eye out, apparently.\n\n260\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.190\nAnd it protects the cable.\n\n261\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.360\nYou can see that these,\nthis is a brand new cable.\n\n262\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.280\nIn fact, I better get this back to\nthe production guys, that crew, or\n\n263\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.570\nthey're gonna get on me.\n\n264\n00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:54.910\nThis is a brand new fiber cable that I\njust took out for this episode here.\n\n265\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.020\nAnd notice how both of them\ngot the connectors on it.\n\n266\n00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:01.010\nIn fact, it's not so\nuncommon to see that, right?\n\n267\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.363\nThis is one of the SFBs that [LAUGH]\nI actually pulled out of the server\n\n268\n00:14:05.363 --> 00:14:06.310\ncloset here.\n\n269\n00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.348\nWe gotta make sure we don't tell our-\n&gt;&gt; Is everything working right now?\n\n270\n00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:10.630\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I don't know, we'll find\nout, depends on if this is streaming live.\n\n271\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.050\n[LAUGH] But in all seriousness, guys,\nthis has got a plastic cover on it.\n\n272\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.599\nCuz if it didn't, and I plugged this in,\n\n273\n00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:19.588\nwe've essentially got optical light\nsources triggering our eyeballs there.\n\n274\n00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:22.340\nAnd worst case scenario, as you guys see,\n\n275\n00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.940\nI could take Cherokee's\neyeball out with one of those.\n\n276\n00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.710\nSo, the covers that you have on these,\n\n277\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.710\nare typically to protect the connectors\nthemselves, that's your LC connector.\n\n278\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.700\nSo we've looked at the ST connector,\nright?\n\n279\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.380\nRemember, that's the one that\nwe got on the screen here.\n\n280\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.180\nThe ST connector is the older connector.\n\n281\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.185\nWe have also got the SC connector,\nsubscriber or standard connector.\n\n282\n00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:47.650\nI've heard the names defined both,\nSC, just remember that.\n\n283\n00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.190\nLC connector, I always remember that cuz\nit's half the size of the SC connector.\n\n284\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.247\nSo, and this might be a way that\nyou can remember it on the exam,\n\n285\n00:14:55.247 --> 00:14:59.173\nI remember back when I was taking my very\nfirst NetPlus exam quite a few years ago,\n\n286\n00:14:59.173 --> 00:15:00.653\nthat's how I remembered it.\n\n287\n00:15:00.653 --> 00:15:03.608\nThey said it's half the size when they\nwere describing its characteristics.\n\n288\n00:15:03.608 --> 00:15:07.350\nThey said well, it's half the size,\nit's easier just to pull up two cables.\n\n289\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:11.700\nIt's half the size of the SC connector,\nso I, instead of calling it\n\n290\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.620\nthe local connectors, they were defining\nit, I called it the little connector.\n\n291\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.120\nOnly to find years later,\nwhen I was studying this,\n\n292\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.430\nthat they also call it that as well.\n\n293\n00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.540\nSo I was trying to remember it\nby remembering its true name.\n\n294\n00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.440\n&gt;&gt; Great minds think alike.\n\n295\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, that's right.\n\n296\n00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.590\nSo, that might help you on the exam.\n\n297\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.860\nI don't know if they're\ngonna ask you this,\n\n298\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.550\nI don't know if they say something\nlike well, out of all of these,\n\n299\n00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.500\nyou have a transmission speed of such and\nsuch.\n\n300\n00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.910\nWhich of these connectors will attach to\na media that will allow you to do that?\n\n301\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.260\nAnd again, I have no clue.\n\n302\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.250\nBut the point is,\nunderstand the technology, so\n\n303\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.640\nthat regardless of what they ask you on\nthe exam, you will be prepared for it.\n\n304\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.840\nAll right there, Ms Cherokee, let's see.\n\n305\n00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.510\nThere's a couple other things,\nwe talked about GBICs,\n\n306\n00:15:52.510 --> 00:16:00.520\nthe Gigabit Interface Converters,\nright, media converter.\n\n307\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.330\nWe looked a little at the SFPs.\n\n308\n00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.170\nThe current standard for that is SFP Plus.\n\n309\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.563\nI'm sure that it's a lot better\nadding the plus than it is to not.\n\n310\n00:16:09.563 --> 00:16:11.146\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n311\n00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:12.133\n&gt;&gt; It polishes?\n\n312\n00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:16.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's about one of the last\nfew things I'd like to touch on.\n\n313\n00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:22.400\nAnd that is how the actual\nconnector itself is polished.\n\n314\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.500\nSee you gotta understand that when we're\ntalking about a core we're talking about\n\n315\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500\ncore like Cherokee mentioned in the last\nepisode that literally is the the size\n\n316\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.820\nof a human hair.\n\n317\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.290\nAll right, well, I'll pull a human hair\noff, we'll put it up to the camera, and\n\n318\n00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.850\nlet me know if you can polish that,\nput two hairs together and\n\n319\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:43.825\nthen close them off in a way that they're\nnot even a fraction of a micron off.\n\n320\n00:16:43.825 --> 00:16:47.815\nWhen we talk about splicing them together,\nor if we talk about the type\n\n321\n00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:52.385\nconnectors and how they make connections\ninto whatever the connectivity device is.\n\n322\n00:16:52.385 --> 00:16:54.045\nAnd they really call out two.\n\n323\n00:16:54.045 --> 00:16:57.105\nThey call out what's known as\nan angle physical connector or\n\n324\n00:16:57.105 --> 00:16:59.415\nan ultra physical connector, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.257\nAngle physical connector is\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n326\n00:17:02.257 --> 00:17:05.523\nIt means that the tip of\nthe connector itself,\n\n327\n00:17:05.523 --> 00:17:09.390\nif you were to magnify it,\nit would have an angle on it.\n\n328\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.730\nIt would have an angle connection, right.\n\n329\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.440\nAnd the APC, or the Angled Physical\nConnector, they're typically green.\n\n330\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.740\nYou can typically spot these, the\nconnectors themselves cuz they are green.\n\n331\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.520\nThere's an eight degree\nangle that's polished.\n\n332\n00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.460\nAnd they're commonly seen with\nthings like ST connectors.\n\n333\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.000\nThose older ST connectors.\n\n334\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.550\nThe straight tip connectors or\n\n335\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.690\nstandard tip depending on\na couple of different names.\n\n336\n00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.620\nThe other one is the UPC and\nthat's the Ultra Polished Connector.\n\n337\n00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.900\nAnd that is typically used for\nthe LC connectors, I believe.\n\n338\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.820\nI made I note because I\nwill not remember that.\n\n339\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.050\nYeah, it's LCUPC.\n\n340\n00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.790\nSo you might see that\nwhere you're buying it and\n\n341\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.680\none of the standards says LC, so you know\nwhat's this connector to start with and\n\n342\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.620\nit might say LC UPC and\nyou know that's the degree of angle.\n\n343\n00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.870\nThere is no angle, it is a just a straight\npolish and it makes a solid contact\n\n344\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.905\non the Ultra Physical Connector,\nor UPC type of connector.\n\n345\n00:18:04.905 --> 00:18:10.210\nAll right, let's see here,\nI'm sure I'm forgetting everything.\n\n346\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.090\nSo, we've talked about, yeah, we've talked\nabout some of the different standards.\n\n347\n00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.420\nThere are a couple more.\n\n348\n00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.480\nIn fact, there is one more that\nI kind of want to talk about,\n\n349\n00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.230\nthat I did see, I didn't mention it.\n\n350\n00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.180\n&gt;&gt; Is he okay?\n\n351\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthe mechanical transfer register jack.\n\n352\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.560\nThis is an interesting one as well.\n\n353\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.680\nIn fact, let's go ahead.\n\n354\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.460\nI'll tell you what,\nwe will do a search for it right now.\n\n355\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.660\nMT, mechanical transfer register jack.\n\n356\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.635\nWell, I've got to try and\nremember those names there.\n\n357\n00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:42.390\nDoesn't look all that fancy, does it?\n\n358\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.840\nIt really doesn't look too fancy, right?\n\n359\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.800\nHere is your mechanical\ntransferred registered jack.\n\n360\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.536\nIn fact I like this picture\nthey have over here.\n\n361\n00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:53.132\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead,\nlet's view it, there we go,\n\n362\n00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.860\nnow you could see it kinda from the side,\nall right?\n\n363\n00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.500\nSo, you also have that, you had your\nmechanic transferred register jack.\n\n364\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.880\nThis is essentially two fibers.\n\n365\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.480\nYeah, there you could\nbarely see it right there.\n\n366\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.149\nKinda like this cable that we've been,\n\n367\n00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:07.320\nactually both of this cable\nlike throw them around.\n\n368\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.865\nCherokee, watch out,\nI'm gonna hit you with more stuff here.\n\n369\n00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:10.355\n[LAUGH] So just like these,\n\n370\n00:19:10.355 --> 00:19:14.400\nthey're essentially terminating\ntwo ends of a fiber, right?\n\n371\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.161\nAnd then the mechanical\ntransfer registered jack,\n\n372\n00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:21.244\nit's commonly used for multimode fiber.\n\n373\n00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:24.790\nThe other one that I didn't mention\nis what if you are in a situation.\n\n374\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.020\nI just remembered this one.\n\n375\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.780\nI remember, I was mentioning the LC.\n\n376\n00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.910\nSo, I just commonly thought\nI'd mentioned the FC.\n\n377\n00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:31.850\nAnd I did not.\n\n378\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.610\nThe FC is a connector that uses\na thread on type connector.\n\n379\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.300\nAnd I want you think of\nindustrial environments.\n\n380\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.100\nIn fact, let's go ahead,\nwe might as well since we're spending so\n\n381\n00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.070\nmuch of Cherokee's money.\n\n382\n00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.760\nLet's keep doing this.\n\n383\n00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.712\nIt's pretty fun, isn't it?\n\n384\n00:19:43.712 --> 00:19:47.675\n[LAUGH] Let's do the FC fiber connector.\n\n385\n00:19:47.675 --> 00:19:51.180\nAnd we'll look this up.\n\n386\n00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:51.710\nThere we go.\n\n387\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.200\nIs that a, yeah, there we go.\n\n388\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.550\nProbably one of the best\npictures of one I've seen there.\n\n389\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.730\nThere we go.\n\n390\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.930\nNotice the threading on this.\n\n391\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.220\nNotice this, it's still a Bayonet,\nreally looks like an ST\n\n392\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.770\nconnector with a lot more hardware\naround the outside of it.\n\n393\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.930\nAnd this is where you could see,\n\n394\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.220\nthey kinda put it over like\nthese screw holes here.\n\n395\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.980\nWhere if you need a,\nit's a furrow connector.\n\n396\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.370\nI mean,\nthere's a reason they call it that.\n\n397\n00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.610\nIt's for heavy duty industrial\napplications where maybe you\n\n398\n00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.890\nhave a worry about vibration and stuff.\n\n399\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.620\nWell, everything in a server closet\nvibrates, as far as the servers go.\n\n400\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.260\nBut who knows?\n\n401\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.150\nMaybe you're in an industrial application.\n\n402\n00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.870\nMaybe you've got like a SCADA\nsystem that you're trying\n\n403\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.580\nto monitor somewhere that\nneeds fiber optic connection.\n\n404\n00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.930\nAnytime you need the mechanics of\nthe connector itself to be more durable,\n\n405\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.150\nthis is what you're gonna use.\n\n406\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.980\nYou're gonna use that furrow connector.\n\n407\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.900\nThis is a single mode connector.\n\n408\n00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.208\nAgain, it's typically done in\nindustrial type implementations.\n\n409\n00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:48.670\nWell, Ms. Cherokee, I tell you what,\nit's been a long road,\n\n410\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.750\nbut that's just about got\nall of the standards.\n\n411\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.210\nKeep in mind that when it\ncomes to these standards guys,\n\n412\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.990\nI know it is a lot of information guys.\n\n413\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.060\nWe want you to know that you can do this,\nokay?\n\n414\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.110\nGet these standards under your belt.\n\n415\n00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.270\nIf you're taking the exam,\nit's gonna be very important.\n\n416\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.260\nBut they're also important if\nyou're out there in the field and\n\n417\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.360\nyou have to make a decision\non what kind of cable to get.\n\n418\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.265\nWhich one would you get?\n\n419\n00:21:10.265 --> 00:21:11.150\nWill you get a coupler?\n\n420\n00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.560\nWhy would you get a coupler?\n\n421\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.410\nWhy wouldn't I get a Cat cable that's a\n120 meters versus one that's a 100 meters?\n\n422\n00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.960\nIt seems like a lot and I know it is.\n\n423\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.270\nBut as you study this more and more often,\n\n424\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.176\nit's gonna become more of a thing of\nthe past and it's gonna help you.\n\n425\n00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:29.307\nWhen you go into the exam booth make sure\nthat if they ask you these questions on\n\n426\n00:21:29.307 --> 00:21:32.067\ncables, types, and connectors,\nyou're gonna have them right.\n\n427\n00:21:32.067 --> 00:21:34.088\nAnd you're not only gonna\nbe able to pass the exam,\n\n428\n00:21:34.088 --> 00:21:36.460\nyou're gonna knock it out of the ballpark.\n\n429\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.440\nWell thank you Mr.\nWes Bryan for joining us today.\n\n430\n00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.370\nI know we were able to get through all\nthose different episodes, but we made it.\n\n431\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.130\nThat was a lot of information,\nso congratulations to you guys.\n\n432\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.713\nAnd if you need to, go ahead and\nwrite flashcards because like Wes said,\n\n433\n00:21:49.713 --> 00:21:51.123\nnot only for exam purposes,\n\n434\n00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:55.150\nbut in real life this information is not\ngoing to be going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n435\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.020\nSo go ahead and\nsoak it all up and absorb it.\n\n436\n00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.980\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off on this particular show.\n\n437\n00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.831\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n438\n00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:04.010\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n439\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.929\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPro.TV.\n\n440\n00:22:09.205 --> 00:22:14.588\n[MUSIC]\n\n441\n00:22:14.588 --> 00:22:17.041\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

--> 00:00:21.370\nin today's episode we are back with\nmore on our network plus series.\n\n10\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.410\nThat's right.\n\n11\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.120\nYeah, who doesn't love network plus\nseries, it's awesome stuff and of course,\n\n12\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.912\njoining us in the studio today,\nour mentor, our guide, right?\n\n13\n00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:32.960\nHe's gonna walk us down the path\nof network enlightenment.\n\n14\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.690\nThat is our good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n15\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.080\nWes, welcome back.\n\n16\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.078\n&gt;&gt; Now, hopefully that path leads\nto clarity and understanding.\n\n17\n00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:39.812\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Not doom and gloom, that's right.\n\n18\n00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:40.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Networking, anyway.\n\n19\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.642\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:44.569\nWe're gonna be talking about,\nwell network topologies today.\n\n21\n00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.169\nIt's something that you\nkinda have to know cuz there\n\n22\n00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:50.833\nare a series of network topologies that\njust in general in the real world,\n\n23\n00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:54.860\nyou should know and you should\ndefinitely know these for the exam.\n\n24\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.620\nSome of these,\nwe don't see too much in network anymore,\n\n25\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.452\nso some of them probably\nhave gone by the wayside.\n\n26\n00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:03.948\nBut nonetheless,\nwe do have to know about them.\n\n27\n00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:07.110\nSo, we're gonna be looking\nat differentiating between\n\n28\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.630\ncommon network topologies\nhere in this episode.\n\n29\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.020\nAll right, so let's just start with\na network topology and in general,\n\n30\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.520\nregardless of what one you choose or\nwhich one you maybe are working with.\n\n31\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.992\nKeep in mind that a network topology, what\nit does is, it describes the arrangements\n\n32\n00:01:25.992 --> 00:01:30.937\nof the nodes on the network and their\nrelationship if you will to one another.\n\n33\n00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:34.136\nAnd we've got a few different types,\nin fact, we'll go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.680\nwe'll just jump right in and one of\nthe very first ones that they call out is\n\n35\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.160\nsomething known as the mesh topology.\n\n36\n00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.630\nNow, the mesh topology really is for\nredundancy.\n\n37\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.771\nWhen it comes down to it, it's a very\nexpensive type of network to implement.\n\n38\n00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.950\nAnd you do see them in\ndifferent environments.\n\n39\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.250\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here\nto understand what a mesh network is,\n\n40\n00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.120\njust keep in mind,\n\n41\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.020\nthat one device has connectivity to\nall other devices within the network.\n\n42\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.730\nSo for instance, in things like routing\ntopologies, in the WAN links outside\n\n43\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.068\nof your network, your ISPs,\nthey try to implement redundancy, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:13.668\nSo that if one router goes down and\nwe still have access to another router.\n\n45\n00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:18.551\nKeep in mind that with a mesh network and\nthose redundant connections, every device\n\n46\n00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:24.080\nbeing connected to every other device,\nit's a very expensive implementation.\n\n47\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.270\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that,\nas you add a single device,\n\n48\n00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.600\nyour connection start to get very,\nvery exponentially larger.\n\n49\n00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.120\nHence, why this is a very\nexpensive implementation.\n\n50\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.300\nIt does give you the benefit\nof redundancy though.\n\n51\n00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.530\nMultiple paths to send the information\nin case one device does go offline.\n\n52\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.920\nNow you also have a form of wireless\nmesh-type networks as well like for\n\n53\n00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.429\ninstance an Ad-hoc.\n\n54\n00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:56.770\nAd-hoc mode, this basically means you got\nlike an independent basic service set.\n\n55\n00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.910\nThere's no access point, and each network\nadapter can communicate with every\n\n56\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.739\nother node within this\nwireless mesh network.\n\n57\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.200\nThey also call out additional\nthings too like the partial mesh.\n\n58\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.130\nAnd, this also happens,\nespecially for instance,\n\n59\n00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.140\nwhen you talk about things like your\ncore backbone routers where it's almost\n\n60\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.650\na full mesh, maybe just not quite, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.750\nWe still do have some limited redundancy,\na certain amount of redundancy, but\n\n62\n00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.350\nit's not fully redundant.\n\n63\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.930\nMeaning the fact that, each device, you're\ngonna come to one device that doesn't have\n\n64\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.569\nconnections to every other\ndevice in the network.\n\n65\n00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.028\nYou can see this in stub based network\nwhere it's really just one route in\n\n66\n00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:42.316\nthe network and\none route out of the network and then,\n\n67\n00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:47.380\nconnects back to the rest of the mesh,\nhence, the name partial mesh, all right.\n\n68\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.070\nSo, we've got another one here,\nand this is one that,\n\n69\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.040\nthe next one here is an oldie but goodie,\nand that's called the bus that networks.\n\n70\n00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.160\nNow, as far as networking communications,\n\n71\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.220\nyou don't really see these bus-based\nnetworks much anymore if at all.\n\n72\n00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.510\nAnd that's because they're\nnot very scalable, right?\n\n73\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.463\nThese are the ones that we talked about\nin an earlier episode that are using\n\n74\n00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:10.393\ncontention-based media access.\n\n75\n00:04:10.393 --> 00:04:14.888\nAnd with the contention-based media access\nthat means everybody's striving for\n\n76\n00:04:14.888 --> 00:04:17.120\nthe communication on the wire.\n\n77\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.700\nThat means,\nif one device sends communication\n\n78\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.490\neverybody else will receive it.\n\n79\n00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.910\nEverybody else will hear it.\n\n80\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.120\nIt just means that,\nwhatever the destination is,\n\n81\n00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.510\nis the only one that actually\nprocesses the information.\n\n82\n00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.740\nSo, bus networks, not very expandable or\nscalable, if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.040\nCuz keep in mind,\nthat if I add a couple of devices\n\n84\n00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.910\nto this centralized backbone cable,\nwell, what am I doing?\n\n85\n00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.480\nI'm increasing the contention, right?\n\n86\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.670\nIf every device hears every\nother device and I add more,\n\n87\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.750\nit's like adding more people\nto the conference line.\n\n88\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.040\nEventually, you have a mess of\ncommunication, if you will.\n\n89\n00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.148\nThe other thing, too,\nabout this type of network is,\n\n90\n00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:01.270\nwhen we talk about things like\nthe redundancy, if one of these devices,\n\n91\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.194\nlet's say, I don't know,\nlet's pick one here.\n\n92\n00:05:04.194 --> 00:05:07.430\nMaybe one of these devices goes offline,\nright?\n\n93\n00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.150\nWell, if this device goes offline,\nwhat happens to the rest of the network?\n\n94\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.486\nWell, it's a bust communication.\n\n95\n00:05:14.486 --> 00:05:18.558\nAnd unfortunately, what ends up happening\nis that, even though it's only one\n\n96\n00:05:18.558 --> 00:05:22.451\ncomputer that's going offline,\nwe essentially lose communication on all\n\n97\n00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:27.160\nthe other devices, so, you could kind\nof see the limitation to it, right?\n\n98\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.360\nIt's not scalable, one device fails and\nwe lose all communication.\n\n99\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.160\nSo bus networks really\nare a thing of the past.\n\n100\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.470\nNow buses in general,\nI want you to be careful because we still\n\n101\n00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.690\nuse bus-based technology but today,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n102\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.050\nLike for instance,\nwe use serial bus interfaces.\n\n103\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.360\nUSB is a classic example of\na serial bus that we use.\n\n104\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.410\nOne host device controlling up\nto 127 other devices, right?\n\n105\n00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.932\nThat's a bus type network.\n\n106\n00:05:54.932 --> 00:05:57.990\nFireWire, FireWire has been around for\na long time.\n\n107\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.460\nThat's a serial bus interface.\n\n108\n00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.320\nSo, even though we're not using it\nas a network communication per se,\n\n109\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.060\nwhere we hook our network\nadapters up to it,\n\n110\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.620\nyou see still bus technologies\ninside of your communications today,\n\n111\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.250\njust a little bit different than\nwhat they were in the old days.\n\n112\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.860\nAll right, what else do we have?\n\n113\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.570\nWell, we've got some of\nthe other ones here.\n\n114\n00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.360\nRing networks, right?\n\n115\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.950\nRing networks, these are well it depends,\n\n116\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.470\nsome of them we don't use anymore, some\nof them are still used fairly heavily.\n\n117\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.781\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about a ring network, right?\n\n118\n00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.220\nWith a ring network, you typically have\nupstream and downstream neighbors.\n\n119\n00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.080\nSo for instance if we're\nfocus on this computer here,\n\n120\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.078\nwe have a downstream neighbor and\nan upstream neighbor.\n\n121\n00:06:40.078 --> 00:06:42.850\nAnd what does that really mean,\nwe say downstream and upstream.\n\n122\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.185\nWell, in the early ring-based networks,\nthese are unlike our bus networks.\n\n123\n00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:51.075\nThese are what are known\nas deterministic media.\n\n124\n00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:55.177\nIn deterministic media, unlike the\ncontention based media that we mentioned,\n\n125\n00:06:55.177 --> 00:06:59.114\nremember, every device is guaranteed\naccess to the communication medium.\n\n126\n00:06:59.114 --> 00:07:03.051\nSo, a downstream neighbor means,\ndownstream because the,\n\n127\n00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.681\nessentially the communications\nare travelling in a single direction.\n\n128\n00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:12.386\nNow that doesn't mean every ring topology\nuses a unidirectional communication and\n\n129\n00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:16.860\nI'll give you an example like in SONET\nandFiber Distributed Data Interface.\n\n130\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.640\nHowever, one of the benefits to this is,\n\n131\n00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.495\nthe fact that every device does\nget time on the wire, all right?\n\n132\n00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.905\nNow, some of the examples\nof the ring topologies\n\n133\n00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:32.165\nthat we've had in yesteryear\nwas the IBM Token Ring.\n\n134\n00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:36.096\nNow I mentioned\nIBM Token RIng in IEEE802.5.\n\n135\n00:07:36.096 --> 00:07:41.111\nIEEE802.5 is the IEEE's working group for\na token ring.\n\n136\n00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:43.358\nSo you might be asking yourself,\nwell, wait a second, Wes,\n\n137\n00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.030\nthat sounds a little redundant.\n\n138\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.699\nWell, let's understand that IBM was\nessentially the one that first invented\n\n139\n00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:50.838\nthis technology.\n\n140\n00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:53.716\nAnd in February of 1980,\nall of these different companies,\n\n141\n00:07:53.716 --> 00:07:56.715\nthey had their standards and\nthey wanted to get them standardized.\n\n142\n00:07:56.715 --> 00:08:00.924\nAnd the IEEE Form the 802 working\ngroup and said, okay, well,\n\n143\n00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:03.880\nyou got ethernet out there, we see that.\n\n144\n00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.490\nLet's standardize that,\nIBM, you got Token Ring.\n\n145\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.430\nLet's go ahead and standardize that.\n\n146\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.250\nBut the formal standardization under 802.5\n\n147\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.960\nis slightly different than\nIBM's implementation of it.\n\n148\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.814\nHowever, jeep in mind they're\nboth a token ring technology.\n\n149\n00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:21.967\nNow that's a single ring technology, and\n\n150\n00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:26.179\nsome of you maybe that have\nseen the token ring adapters.\n\n151\n00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:28.841\nThey were actually a dual ring topology.\n\n152\n00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.216\nEven though I didn't draw it in here,\n\n153\n00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:35.161\nI wanna talk about some more\ndominantly dual ring topologies.\n\n154\n00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:38.678\nAnd that was something known as\nfiber distributed data interface.\n\n155\n00:08:38.678 --> 00:08:43.404\nAnd with FDDI, one of the things about\nfiber distributed data interface\n\n156\n00:08:43.404 --> 00:08:45.661\nis a very expensive to implement.\n\n157\n00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:48.668\nIt's scaled up really rather nicely.\n\n158\n00:08:48.668 --> 00:08:53.743\nIt was a relatively fast\ncommunication method for the time.\n\n159\n00:08:53.743 --> 00:08:55.728\nIt'd give you 100 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n160\n00:08:55.728 --> 00:09:00.058\nAnd you can use both of the rings\nif you wanted to aggregate them and\n\n161\n00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:03.310\ndo port bonding or\nlink aggregation if you will.\n\n162\n00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.843\nAnd we can send 100 megabits over one and\n100 megabits over the backup line,\n\n163\n00:09:07.843 --> 00:09:09.428\nthe primary and secondary.\n\n164\n00:09:09.428 --> 00:09:11.646\nAnd essentially get 200 megabits.\n\n165\n00:09:11.646 --> 00:09:16.130\nAnd at the day, that was lightning fast,\nbut it was very expensive.\n\n166\n00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.350\nSo when ethernet started to surpass it,\nand you can get 100 megabits\n\n167\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.940\nafter an ethernet connection,\nyou could bond them together and\n\n168\n00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.640\ntwo ports could give you 200 megs,\nit was a much cheaper implementation.\n\n169\n00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:31.580\nEthernet kinda shadowed fiber-distributed\ndata interface, and then once we got\n\n170\n00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.910\nup to the gigabit ethernet,\nit pretty much signaled a death blow.\n\n171\n00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.794\nAnd again, it doesn't mean that you won't\nfiber distributed data interface systems\n\n172\n00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:42.532\nout there, but they are kinda rare today,\nbecause the technology is more legacy.\n\n173\n00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:47.525\nHowever, what's not technology is\na dual ring technology that we use\n\n174\n00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:49.904\nout there on the Internet today.\n\n175\n00:09:49.904 --> 00:09:52.969\nAnd that's the SONET,\nthe synchronous optical networking.\n\n176\n00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:57.508\nAnd I probably should go ahead and mention\nand kinda fix this slide a little bit and\n\n177\n00:09:57.508 --> 00:10:00.648\nput /SDH in there for\nsynchronous digital hierarchy,\n\n178\n00:10:00.648 --> 00:10:02.678\nif you're in the European states.\n\n179\n00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:09.100\nIf you're here in the US, we use SONET and\nthis is also a dual ring fiber technology.\n\n180\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.910\nAnd you can also use both primary and\n\n181\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.000\nsecondary rings for\ncommunication purposes, if you want.\n\n182\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.895\nAnd this is where we can get some pretty,\npretty fast speeds.\n\n183\n00:10:18.895 --> 00:10:24.873\nI know that OC 192 in ethernet\nLAN/WAN are very close,\n\n184\n00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:29.022\nboth at around 9.953 or gigabits,\n\n185\n00:10:29.022 --> 00:10:33.916\njust under 10G, but\nSONET goes beyond that.\n\n186\n00:10:33.916 --> 00:10:38.830\nAnd we've got some extremely\nfast speeds if we are talking\n\n187\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.849\nabout these dual ring topologies.\n\n188\n00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:45.492\nHowever, keep in mind that they\nare expensive to implement.\n\n189\n00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:48.498\nThese are not cheap implementations.\n\n190\n00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:51.517\nSo that's a little bit about the ring\ntopology, do be aware of that.\n\n191\n00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:55.310\nIf they give you a question\non the exam about, hey,\n\n192\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.102\nwhich one of these is\nan example of a ring topology,\n\n193\n00:10:59.102 --> 00:11:03.269\nyou might wanna be aware of this for\nyour exam purposes.\n\n194\n00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:06.935\nNow one of the most common\ntopologies that we have in existence\n\n195\n00:11:06.935 --> 00:11:11.036\ntoday is probably this one right here and\nthat's the star topology.\n\n196\n00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:13.090\nAnd the star topology,\n\n197\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.540\nthis is where we start to get node\nisolation if we get a failure.\n\n198\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.150\nSee, one of the things I didn't mention,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n199\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.175\njump back over before I forget.\n\n200\n00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:27.560\nIs that when you had ring topologies like\nToken Ring, and one of these devices went\n\n201\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.935\noffline, essentially you\nbrought down the whole network.\n\n202\n00:11:30.935 --> 00:11:35.298\nOne of the good things about\nthe resiliency of things like fiber\n\n203\n00:11:35.298 --> 00:11:41.073\ndistributed data interface, is they can\nroute traffic around the failed device.\n\n204\n00:11:41.073 --> 00:11:43.665\nUsing that secondary\nring if they needed to.\n\n205\n00:11:43.665 --> 00:11:48.352\nSo they can basically, let's say, if\nthis device here decides to fail, right?\n\n206\n00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:51.234\nAnd this device is going\nto try to communicate,\n\n207\n00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:53.404\nwell, it can reverse the traffic.\n\n208\n00:11:53.404 --> 00:11:56.840\nIt can actually communicate\nwith the node that it needs to\n\n209\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.070\ntalk to by reversing the order\nof the communication.\n\n210\n00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.737\nEssentially giving you\na little fault tolerance,\n\n211\n00:12:02.737 --> 00:12:06.280\nunlike what token ring would do\nwhich would bring the network down.\n\n212\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.389\nThat's why I had to kinda\npreface the star topology.\n\n213\n00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:13.483\nBecause of the fact that\nthe star topology, you can see,\n\n214\n00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.546\nhas a central connectivity device and\n\n215\n00:12:15.546 --> 00:12:19.610\nall nodes are arranged more like\na star pattern around them.\n\n216\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.640\nBut one of the great things\nabout this type of technology\n\n217\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.450\nis that if I lost a single node,\nit just isolates that node.\n\n218\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.100\nAll the other devices\ncan still communicate.\n\n219\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.520\nNow this isn't without its faults, right?\n\n220\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.810\nI mean,\nthis does have its problems too because\n\n221\n00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.630\nthe connectivity device is\nstill a point of failure.\n\n222\n00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.570\nI lose the connectivity device,\nthen, well,\n\n223\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.270\nI lose all communications\nwith the network.\n\n224\n00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.960\nSo it's not without its failures, right?\n\n225\n00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.994\nYou still have to implement\nmaybe two switches, right?\n\n226\n00:12:45.994 --> 00:12:48.758\nMaybe redudant connections to the switch.\n\n227\n00:12:48.758 --> 00:12:51.549\nIf high availability, right,\nyou need access to your devices,\n\n228\n00:12:51.549 --> 00:12:53.541\nyour network communications are important.\n\n229\n00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:57.395\nBut this is definitely\none of the most common.\n\n230\n00:12:57.395 --> 00:12:59.960\nExpansion is relatively easy, right?\n\n231\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.840\nIf I need to expand, all I do is go\nahead and add another device here.\n\n232\n00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.300\nAnd if we've got a open\nport on the switch,\n\n233\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.130\nwe just plug it right into the switch,\nright?\n\n234\n00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.000\nSo this is very scalable,\nand it's easily scalable.\n\n235\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.570\nLet's see,\nmake sure that I didn't forget anything.\n\n236\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.020\nAnd again, just remember that a single\nconnection only isolates that node.\n\n237\n00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.600\nBut you still have\nthe single point of failure.\n\n238\n00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.431\nThen they call out the hybrid.\n\n239\n00:13:28.431 --> 00:13:31.537\nAnd the hybrid is usually maybe a mistake.\n\n240\n00:13:31.537 --> 00:13:32.071\n[LAUGH]\n\n241\n00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:33.174\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't-\n\n242\n00:13:33.174 --> 00:13:34.130\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Think of the best of\n\n243\n00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.005\nall worlds, right?\n\n244\n00:13:35.005 --> 00:13:37.823\nI like this, and I like that,\nlet's slam those together, chocolate and\n\n245\n00:13:37.823 --> 00:13:38.921\npeanut butter kinda thing.\n\n246\n00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:42.148\n&gt;&gt; Hey, perfect, we can think of it as\nReese's Peanut Butter Cups for short.\n\n247\n00:13:42.148 --> 00:13:46.079\nBut a lot of times the way these happen\nis because you have things like company\n\n248\n00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:46.642\nmergers.\n\n249\n00:13:46.642 --> 00:13:49.429\nDan's company's\nimplementing this typology.\n\n250\n00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.216\nWorks completely fine,\nthere's nothing wrong.\n\n251\n00:13:51.216 --> 00:13:53.898\nLet's not fix it until we break it, right?\n\n252\n00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:57.161\nMy company, right,\nhas this type of topology.\n\n253\n00:13:57.161 --> 00:13:58.589\nWe do a merger, right?\n\n254\n00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:00.500\nThere's an acquisition here.\n\n255\n00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.810\nWell, we've got two different network\ntopologies, but they both work.\n\n256\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.880\nNow they're under one umbrella company, so\nwe get what's known as the hybrid, right,\n\n257\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.770\nthe Frankenstein type network.\n\n258\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.980\nAgain, a lot of times we might not\nset out to build these this way,\n\n259\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.400\nbut they certainly can happen.\n\n260\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.188\nSometimes it might be a little bit\ndifficult to manage and maintain them.\n\n261\n00:14:20.188 --> 00:14:24.443\nBut just be aware that a hybrid is\nusually a combination of two or\n\n262\n00:14:24.443 --> 00:14:28.955\nmore of the different topologies\nthat we've talked about so far.\n\n263\n00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:31.322\nNow, that being said,\nwe've got another one.\n\n264\n00:14:31.322 --> 00:14:35.108\nAnd this one, it comes in many,\nmany different forms.\n\n265\n00:14:35.108 --> 00:14:38.416\nAnd that's what's known as\na point-to-point topology.\n\n266\n00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:41.493\nNow there are many different\npoint-to-point topologies.\n\n267\n00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:45.841\nBut let's talk a little about what any\ntype of point to point communication\n\n268\n00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:46.610\nis, right?\n\n269\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.120\nThis is an exclusive,\ndedicated connection, all right?\n\n270\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.232\nWhether it's physical or\nlogical between two endpoints, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:55.232 --> 00:14:57.310\nAnd I'll talk about what\nI mean by the logical-\n\n272\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.201\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Whole protocol based\n\n273\n00:14:58.201 --> 00:14:58.731\noff of it, right?\n\n274\n00:14:58.731 --> 00:14:59.695\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n275\n00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:00.716\n&gt;&gt; Point to point protocol.\n\n276\n00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:04.497\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's why we've got PPP\nbecause of the fact that we had serial\n\n277\n00:15:04.497 --> 00:15:05.860\npoint to point based links.\n\n278\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.820\nSo what are some of the benefits, right?\n\n279\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.930\nYou get the inherent security, right?\n\n280\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:16.215\nIf I have a single dedicated\nconnection between two endpoints,\n\n281\n00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:19.780\nright, it's really gonna be only\naccessible to the end users.\n\n282\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.289\nAnd it's not accessible by other parties,\nand\n\n283\n00:15:21.289 --> 00:15:22.881\nthat's one of the things\nthat's great about it.\n\n284\n00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.284\nConstant connection, right?\n\n285\n00:15:25.284 --> 00:15:29.640\nWe don't need to establish a connection\nbefore we communicate, right?\n\n286\n00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.190\nLet's see, choice of bandwidth speeds.\n\n287\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.500\nA lot of times you can aggregate multiple\nlinks, like in the case of lease lines.\n\n288\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.270\nIf you're doing T1 lines, T3 lines,\n\n289\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:42.310\nyou're using your digital signal\nhierarchy, using DS1, DS3s.\n\n290\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.180\nSo you can aggregate links, too.\n\n291\n00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.249\nYou also have your choice of\nservice level agreements, right?\n\n292\n00:15:47.249 --> 00:15:49.875\nThey can be tailored to\na specific business needs.\n\n293\n00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:53.109\nSo, let's go ahead and give you some\nexamples here of some different point to\n\n294\n00:15:53.109 --> 00:15:54.574\npoint technologies that we have.\n\n295\n00:15:54.574 --> 00:15:59.380\nWe'll kind of zoom in on one of them\nthat does not look like the one I want.\n\n296\n00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.488\nThere we go that's the one I want.\n\n297\n00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:03.490\nLet's go ahead and let's start basic.\n\n298\n00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.750\nAll right, this is a very basic\npoint to point communication, right.\n\n299\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.760\nYou have your RS,\n\n300\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.030\nserial based RS 232 no modem cables\nthat we really don't use too much for.\n\n301\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.840\nThe standard's still there because you\nmight find old switches where you're still\n\n302\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.530\nusing a nine port db console port cable.\n\n303\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.077\nAnd the 25 pin cable a lot of times\nwould go on things like the modem.\n\n304\n00:16:25.077 --> 00:16:27.202\nSo this would be a no modem cable.\n\n305\n00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:30.267\nIf I need to communicate directly\nwith let's say an IP camera I can\n\n306\n00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:31.450\nmake a crossover cable.\n\n307\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.271\nAnd I can plug it into\nthe network adapter on my laptop.\n\n308\n00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:37.626\nAnd I could plug it directly into the\nethernet port on the back of the IP camera\n\n309\n00:16:37.626 --> 00:16:42.270\nand it handles, the crossover handles\nthe transmit and receive lines, right?\n\n310\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:47.460\nAnd that is a direct point to point\nconnection between two machines.\n\n311\n00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.950\nBut there's other types of point-to-point\ncommunications too, right?\n\n312\n00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.670\nYou have switched circuit,\n\n313\n00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.168\ncircuit switched point-to-point\ncommunications like over PTSN lines.\n\n314\n00:16:56.168 --> 00:17:00.793\nNow, even though this is considered\nmore of an on-demand type of\n\n315\n00:17:00.793 --> 00:17:06.429\npoint-to-point communication,\nwhen you use the dial-up and you connect,\n\n316\n00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:11.561\nthere is a circuit that is built\npoint-to-point between the caller and\n\n317\n00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:17.985\nthe person that's receiving the call, so\nan example of a point-to-point connection.\n\n318\n00:17:17.985 --> 00:17:21.161\nYou also have things like Virtual\npoint-to-point connections,\n\n319\n00:17:21.161 --> 00:17:25.059\nconnections that appear to you as their\npoint-to-point I can see the endpoint but\n\n320\n00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:28.917\nI don't really have to worry about stuff\nin the middle, and ISP is handling that.\n\n321\n00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:33.467\nSo things like your VPN connection, that\nis a logically established point to point\n\n322\n00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:37.170\ncommunication that uses tunneling and\nencryption.\n\n323\n00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.656\nFrame relay, multiple label\nprotocol switching is another\n\n324\n00:17:40.656 --> 00:17:44.766\none that uses a kinda like a logical\npoint-to-point communication.\n\n325\n00:17:46.661 --> 00:17:48.740\nLace lines we've kinda mentioned as well.\n\n326\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:54.710\nThings like your T1, your E1 in Europe and\nJapan, J1 connections, right?\n\n327\n00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.190\nOther things too, right?\n\n328\n00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.090\nSatellite, satellite is\na point-to-point communication, right?\n\n329\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.730\nBetween a source and endpoint,\nfor instance, two radio towers.\n\n330\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.431\nWhat else do we have?\n\n331\n00:18:06.431 --> 00:18:08.301\nAnd then we've got, and\n\n332\n00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:13.580\nthat's an example of some of\nthe point-to-point communications.\n\n333\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.660\nBut then they also call things out, for\n\n334\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.290\ninstance, point-to-multipoint\ncommunications.\n\n335\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.250\nWell this is pretty much\nkinda like the same concept.\n\n336\n00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.452\nOne of the classic examples I can\ngive you is a PBX system, right.\n\n337\n00:18:25.452 --> 00:18:26.820\nPrivate branch exchange.\n\n338\n00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.850\nA call comes in, there's one connection.\n\n339\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.320\nBut there's a potential for that PBX,\nthat private branch exchange\n\n340\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.570\nto send that out to multiple end points\nthrough their extension numbers, right?\n\n341\n00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:42.520\nThings like an ISP can have multiple\nsingle point of reference to multiple\n\n342\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.570\nsatellite communications.\n\n343\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.960\nTypical tel comm providers like\nyour local tel comm providers.\n\n344\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.170\nYou got a single point coming off the ISP\nleading into like different neighborhoods.\n\n345\n00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.780\nRight, your local branch connections.\n\n346\n00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.650\nThese are all considered multi,\n\n347\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.420\nor point-to-multipoint\ntype of communications.\n\n348\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.890\nJust keep in mind we're talking about\na nexus, a center point-to-multiple\n\n349\n00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.980\nend points, right, but is a point-to-point\ncommunication, that's point-to-multipoint.\n\n350\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.810\nSo another example,\nyour mainframe communications.\n\n351\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.125\nA mainframe is a single entity that\nmultiple terminals are connected to it.\n\n352\n00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:21.560\nThat's an example of a point-to-multipoint\ncommunication as well.\n\n353\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.824\n&gt;&gt; It seems like a physical\nstart topology as well.\n\n354\n00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:25.737\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it absolutely is.\n\n355\n00:19:25.737 --> 00:19:28.726\nIf we were to take that start topology.\n\n356\n00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:32.220\nAnd I'm gonna mess up my lines,\nguys, really bad.\n\n357\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.830\nLet me, well actually, I'm going to\nmake some more lines apparently.\n\n358\n00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.740\nIf I grab my switch,\nI don't know if I can do this.\n\n359\n00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.533\nYou can kind of see-\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n360\n00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:41.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can kind of see that it is.\n\n361\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.320\nYou're absolutely right, Dan.\n\n362\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.130\nIt's a point-to-multipoint communication.\n\n363\n00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.551\nAll right, so do keep that in mind.\n\n364\n00:19:48.551 --> 00:19:50.400\nAll right, Dan, what else do we got here?\n\n365\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.972\nI know we're running\nclose to the end of time.\n\n366\n00:19:52.972 --> 00:19:54.560\nThat's point-to-multipoint now,\n\n367\n00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.800\nprobably two of the most common\nnetworking implementations today.\n\n368\n00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.320\nWhen we talk about topologies,\nas far as your connectivity devices start,\n\n369\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.920\ntopology is gonna be\nthe way that you're going.\n\n370\n00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.210\nHowever, we do have some models that\nwe need you to keep in mind here.\n\n371\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.680\nAnd probably the most common networking\nmodel slash topology that we have today Is\n\n372\n00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.698\nwhat's known as the client server.\n\n373\n00:20:15.698 --> 00:20:17.670\nNow I got a little diagram here.\n\n374\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.539\nBut let's understand what\nclient-server relationship is.\n\n375\n00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:23.690\nRemember, we said topology describes\nthe nodes and the relationship.\n\n376\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.540\nNot just their layout, but\nthe relationship to one another.\n\n377\n00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.480\nI have clients, well what are clients?\n\n378\n00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.440\nClient is an operating system\nthat is requesting resources\n\n379\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.110\nfrom another operating system.\n\n380\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.740\nServers on the other hand are those\noperating systems that are listening\n\n381\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.630\nout for those requests for services.\n\n382\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.106\nAnd they say, here's the service you need.\n\n383\n00:20:46.106 --> 00:20:52.794\nYou need a file server, NFS, Samba,\nSMB if you're in Windows land.\n\n384\n00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:57.739\nEmail server, you need to send an email\nserver I'm listening out here on port 25,\n\n385\n00:20:57.739 --> 00:21:01.150\nport 110, or\nport 143 send your email to me, right.\n\n386\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:06.305\nSo the server is listening and\ngoing to reply with those resources.\n\n387\n00:21:06.305 --> 00:21:08.780\nClient-server model guys,\nvery easy for the test.\n\n388\n00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.386\nJust keep in mind, clients are requesting\nresources, servers are providing them.\n\n389\n00:21:13.386 --> 00:21:19.383\nThe last type of topology that we have Is\nwhat's known as the peer-to-peer model.\n\n390\n00:21:19.383 --> 00:21:23.729\nNow the peer-to-peer model\nis lacking of a server.\n\n391\n00:21:23.729 --> 00:21:27.200\nNow let me be very careful\nwith this one too.\n\n392\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.215\nBecause your server could potentially\nbe a peer in a workgroup.\n\n393\n00:21:34.215 --> 00:21:39.740\nPeer-to-peer workgroups are ones in which\nevery single node within the network\n\n394\n00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.530\ncan request a service or\nprovide a service.\n\n395\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:44.120\nThat's why they call them peers.\n\n396\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.797\nDan and I are peers in the fact\nthat we're both hosts here.\n\n397\n00:21:47.797 --> 00:21:51.870\nBut at any one time we could\nalso be doing the SME work too.\n\n398\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.460\nSo we're doing both.\n\n399\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.430\nWell, the same thing happens\nwith a peer-to-peer network.\n\n400\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.449\nPeer-to-peer networks are a completely\nde-centralized models so\n\n401\n00:21:58.449 --> 00:22:00.092\nthey're not very scalable, right?\n\n402\n00:22:00.092 --> 00:22:02.195\nWhen it comes to user-management, right?\n\n403\n00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:06.480\nWe call a buzzword today Identity and\nAccess Management.\n\n404\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.836\nEach individual node\nmaintains a user database.\n\n405\n00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:15.713\nAnd the reason this becomes complex to\nadminister to is because if I wanted\n\n406\n00:22:15.713 --> 00:22:18.478\nsomebody to have access on this machine.\n\n407\n00:22:18.478 --> 00:22:23.134\nLet's say I have to give him\na user account on that machine.\n\n408\n00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:26.900\nBut the problem is, that user account's\ngonna do nothing for this computer.\n\n409\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.260\nSo if I want Dan to have access on\nthis computer, well guess what.\n\n410\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.110\nI've got to sneaker net it over, and\n\n411\n00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.140\nI've got to create Dan\nan account on this computer.\n\n412\n00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.480\nAnd you can start to see, we're only\ntalking about three computers and\n\n413\n00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.160\none user here.\n\n414\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.190\nWhat if I have 50 users on my network?\n\n415\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.100\n&gt;&gt; So in peer-to-peer it's just a complete\nlack of any centralized management?\n\n416\n00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:44.600\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n417\n00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.340\nTake centralized administration and\nthrow it right out.\n\n418\n00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.780\nUnlike where we get the benefits\nof the client server model,\n\n419\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.770\nwhere the server itself could be\ndoing something, for instance,\n\n420\n00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.560\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol,\nit could be running a directory service.\n\n421\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.331\nNow all I do is I create Dan\na user account, an identity here.\n\n422\n00:23:03.331 --> 00:23:06.529\nAnd now because it's\nproviding me that service,\n\n423\n00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:10.488\nthat authentication and\nidentity access, he can log in to any\n\n424\n00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:14.923\none of these machines using the account\nthat I created on the server.\n\n425\n00:23:14.923 --> 00:23:18.179\nCan see the that administration\nbecomes a little bit more flexible and\n\n426\n00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.515\na lot more easy to maintain.\n\n427\n00:23:19.515 --> 00:23:20.970\nSo those are the last two.\n\n428\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.370\nAgain two common models,\n\n429\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.000\nmost common model in a business enterprise\nis gonna be your client server.\n\n430\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.957\nEven in the cloud today and\nthen on your home networks or\n\n431\n00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:30.577\neven very small businesses.\n\n432\n00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:33.830\nMaybe you're gonna be using\nthe peer-to-peer network.\n\n433\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.760\nBe aware of what these topologies are.\n\n434\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.285\nNot only for the exam but so you know\nthe lingo when you're gonna support\n\n435\n00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:42.989\nthe network and then you can make\nthe decisions about what network topology\n\n436\n00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:45.891\nmight be best for\nyou to implement inside of your company.\n\n437\n00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.140\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n438\n00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.293\nThanks so much for\nexplaining the different topologies so\n\n439\n00:23:50.293 --> 00:23:54.343\nwe now should have a pretty good grasp of\nwhy is a bus different than a star and\n\n440\n00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:56.789\nnow we can speak\nintelligently about that and\n\n441\n00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:00.295\nmore importantly answer questions on this,\nexams about that.\n\n442\n00:24:00.295 --> 00:24:02.515\nSo really good stuff we\nappreciate you doing that for us.\n\n443\n00:24:02.515 --> 00:24:06.873\nWe appreciate our good viewers out there\nfor joining us today but it looks like\n\n444\n00:24:06.873 --> 00:24:10.800\nwe've come to the end of another\ngreat episode from here at ITProTV.\n\n445\n00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.560\nWe thank you, Wes.\n\n446\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.800\nWe thank you good people.\n\n447\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.960\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n448\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.924\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n449\n00:24:16.924 --> 00:24:20.054\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n450\n00:24:20.054 --> 00:24:26.018\n[MUSIC]\n\n451\n00:24:26.018 -->

watching\n\n4\n00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:19.090\nITProTV\n&gt;&gt; In this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.416\nwe'll be looking at network\ninfrastructure implementations.\n\n6\n00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:23.696\nSo, what does that mean?\n\n7\n00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:24.776\nWell, we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:28.770\nWes Bryan in studios today to go ahead and\ndecipher this information.\n\n9\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.166\nSo what are we looking at today, Mr. Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's interesting.\n\n11\n00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.652\nBecause when they say,\nnetwork implementation,\n\n12\n00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:34.908\nwhat we've been talking about cables.\n\n13\n00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:36.815\nWe've been talking about all\ndifferent kinds of things.\n\n14\n00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.565\nAren't those network implementations?\n\n15\n00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:39.807\nWell, yes and no.\n\n16\n00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:44.358\nThose are the components within a network\nimplementation and I think rightfully, so\n\n17\n00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:47.583\nthey could have labeled this\ngeographical coverage area and\n\n18\n00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:50.570\nit would have meant pretty\nmuch close to the same thing.\n\n19\n00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.835\nSo yes, there are some different\ntypes of implementations,\n\n20\n00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:57.605\ndepending on what geographical\ncoverage area we're talking about and\n\n21\n00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.147\nwe'll get more into that as we\nprogress though this episode here.\n\n22\n00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:04.701\nWell, we gonna talk about maybe some\ntechnologies, maybe some acronyms\n\n23\n00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.955\nthat you've heard before and\nwe gonna try shed some light on them.\n\n24\n00:01:07.955 --> 00:01:12.835\nSo, we gonna talk about things like LANs.\n\n25\n00:01:12.835 --> 00:01:14.083\nWe'll talk about WANs.\n\n26\n00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:20.512\nWe gonna talk about MANs and\nI briefly mentioned\n\n27\n00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:26.145\nsome other things like pants, and cans.\n\n28\n00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:30.809\nAnd let's start out with one of the very\nfirst type of networks that maybe even you\n\n29\n00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:34.250\nguys are viewing at home from and\nmaybe don't even know it.\n\n30\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.855\nThat's something known as the local area\nnetworks, something known as a LAN and\n\n31\n00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:40.083\nwell, what is a LAN?\n\n32\n00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:44.489\nA LAN is really nothing more than a single\ngeographical area under the control,\n\n33\n00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.880\na network, if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.057\nThat's spans a single\ngeographical area and\n\n35\n00:01:49.057 --> 00:01:52.908\nis under the control of\na single administrative body.\n\n36\n00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:55.150\nNow, I know what you're\nprobably wondering out there.\n\n37\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.351\nWell, wait a second.\nWho is that administrative body that's in\n\n38\n00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.090\ncharge of my network,\nif I am in a LAN viewing us from home?\n\n39\n00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.422\nYou are.\n\n40\n00:02:04.422 --> 00:02:08.520\nNow that doesn't mean that you set\nthe network up, I wanna come down to it.\n\n41\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.674\nIt's going to be your network and\nyou are in control of it.\n\n42\n00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:14.839\nWhat I mean by that is that\nI have my home network,\n\n43\n00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:20.105\nCherokee has her home network and these\nare different geographical locations.\n\n44\n00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.069\nNow LANs, if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.240\nWhen I say,\nsimilar geographical locations,\n\n46\n00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.380\nthey could be multiple\nfloors in a building.\n\n47\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.257\nSo please understand that, but multiple\nfloors in that building are typically.\n\n48\n00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:34.958\nIf they're supporting some kinda\nlocal area network, it means that\n\n49\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.822\na single entity is going to be in\ncontrol of that one local area network,\n\n50\n00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:45.510\nregardless of the fact that it spans\nmultiple floors within a building.\n\n51\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.316\nNow, one of the things that we can see.\n\n52\n00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:48.729\nIn fact, I kind of pulled up a LAN here.\n\n53\n00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.998\nI got a little diagram of a LAN here on\nmy desktop and LANs are typically, again,\n\n54\n00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:54.610\nself-contained networks.\n\n55\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.166\nThis is some of the things that\nyou can see inside of them.\n\n56\n00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.770\nThey are self-contained and they're\ntypically using some kind of high speed\n\n57\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.792\nshort range transmission medium and what I\nmean by high speed, you might think well,\n\n58\n00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:10.137\nI've got a gigabit network and\nI'm not getting a gigabit speed for sure.\n\n59\n00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:13.623\nWell, a gigabit network is a pretty\nfast network when you compare another\n\n60\n00:03:13.623 --> 00:03:17.006\ntechnology that we'll get into when\nwe talk about wide area networks.\n\n61\n00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:18.330\nSo, the local area network.\n\n62\n00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.628\nKeep in mind, it is one of our\nmost popular local area network\n\n63\n00:03:22.628 --> 00:03:26.030\ntechnologies that we\nhave today is Ethernet.\n\n64\n00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.820\nEthernet is a land-based technology and\nwe are seeing it crossover into\n\n65\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.240\nsome of the other type of networks, but\nwe'll talk about those when we get there.\n\n66\n00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.868\nAnd so, keep that in mind.\n\n67\n00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:43.224\nWe typically need some kind of gateway\ndevice if we're gonna communicate with\n\n68\n00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.410\nother LANs, the Local Area Networks.\n\n69\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.164\nYou could see, for instance,m servers.\n\n70\n00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:48.324\nYou could see workstations.\n\n71\n00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:52.596\nYou could see switches all\ninside of this network type.\n\n72\n00:03:52.596 --> 00:03:56.531\nNow, that is in contrast to another type\nof network that is known as a wide area\n\n73\n00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:57.086\nnetwork.\n\n74\n00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:58.827\nNow with the wide area network,\n\n75\n00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:02.080\nthey typically span multiple\ngeographical locations.\n\n76\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.387\nNow that is code, if you will for\n\n77\n00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:08.152\ntypically tying multiple\narea networks together.\n\n78\n00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:13.797\nSo if I have company and\nthey span multiple geographical locations,\n\n79\n00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:18.650\nI could have four different\nlocal area networks.\n\n80\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.192\nNow, the difference here is this\nwhole entire network becomes the WAN.\n\n81\n00:04:23.192 --> 00:04:27.623\nIn fact, one of the simple examples of the\nlargest WAN in the world is what we know\n\n82\n00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:29.860\nas the internet today.\n\n83\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.216\nNow, you may not know that.\n\n84\n00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:33.123\nBut underneath, it's really nothing, but\n\n85\n00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:36.774\na bunch of local area networks all holding\nhands passing traffic through each other.\n\n86\n00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:40.769\nAnd while media's a little bit different,\nRyan, we see things inside of like, for\n\n87\n00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.581\ninstance, our local area networks.\n\n88\n00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:47.357\nOne of the most common local\narea network implementations\n\n89\n00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:50.970\nthat we see is for instance, the Ethernet.\n\n90\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.898\nNow out here on the internet or\nthe wide area network, I should say and\n\n91\n00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:56.201\ngive me a second here.\n\n92\n00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:02.770\nIt looks like it's trying to, yeah,\nlet me get this circle out of here.\n\n93\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.040\nIt's not letting me, there we go.\n\n94\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.900\nSo you see inside of our local\narea networks that makes it\n\n95\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.260\na little bit easier,\nyou'll see things like Ethernet.\n\n96\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.178\nOur Ethernet is what the technologies\nthat we typically we use to\n\n97\n00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:21.290\nconnect the devices within\nour local area networks.\n\n98\n00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.815\nHowever, when we talk about WAN based\ntechnology is we have other types of\n\n99\n00:05:23.815 --> 00:05:26.638\ntechnologies that we typically don't\nimplement inside of a local area network.\n\n100\n00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:33.010\nLong range transmission medium,\nit's typically in control or\n\n101\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:40.444\nis being control by an internet service\nprovider or a carrier's network.\n\n102\n00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:43.913\nAnd what I mean by wide area,\nWAM technologies, if you will.\n\n103\n00:05:43.913 --> 00:05:48.793\nWide area network, we're talking about\nthings like SONET, if you're in the states\n\n104\n00:05:48.793 --> 00:05:53.360\nhere and it's according to\nthe American National Standards Institute.\n\n105\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.002\nHowever, if you're in Europe,\n\n106\n00:05:55.002 --> 00:05:58.169\nit's gonna be the International\nTelecommunications Union and\n\n107\n00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.449\nI do believe that's the telecommunication\nstandard sector, if you will and they call\n\n108\n00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.513\nit SDH, the synchronous digital hierarchy,\nbut there are other technologies.\n\n109\n00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:09.151\nThat's not the only technology that we've\n\n110\n00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:12.223\nseen out there that is\na more WAN based technology.\n\n111\n00:06:12.223 --> 00:06:15.232\nWe've seen things like, for\ninstance, we've seen frame relay.\n\n112\n00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:18.787\nFrame relay is another one of\nthose WAN based technologies\n\n113\n00:06:18.787 --> 00:06:20.680\nthat we're seeing out there.\n\n114\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.692\nWhat are some of the other\nstandards that we see?\n\n115\n00:06:22.692 --> 00:06:25.890\nWell, we see things like,\nfor instance, ATM.\n\n116\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.421\nATM is another one of those\nWAN based technologies.\n\n117\n00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:34.342\nSo, notice that we're using a different\nset of technologies to communicate\n\n118\n00:06:34.342 --> 00:06:40.820\nwithin the local area network than we are\nto communicate across a wide area network.\n\n119\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.724\nNow when I say, wide area network this is\ncould be a company that owns more than\n\n120\n00:06:45.724 --> 00:06:50.250\none local area network and those links\nthat connect them together round\n\n121\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.129\noverall in compass their\nwide area network.\n\n122\n00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.762\nIt could be something like\nthe internet where maybe this LAN\n\n123\n00:06:57.762 --> 00:07:00.735\nhere is a toy company, I don't know.\n\n124\n00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:05.497\nLet say, LAN 1 here is a toy companies,\nlocal are network.\n\n125\n00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:10.652\nAnd then over here, we have like parts,\ntoy parts maybe and these\n\n126\n00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:16.766\nstill form what is known as a WAN link\neven though they're two separate LANs.\n\n127\n00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:20.214\nThey're not owned by the same company,\nbut it's still a WAN link,\n\n128\n00:07:20.214 --> 00:07:23.312\nbecause it's connecting two\nwide area networks together.\n\n129\n00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:24.457\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n130\n00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:28.660\nSo, you can see some of the technologies\nthat you see inside of your wide\n\n131\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.652\narea networks.\n\n132\n00:07:29.652 --> 00:07:31.403\nAgain, some of the ones that\nwe've already talked about.\n\n133\n00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:35.140\nThings like your SONET,\nthings like ATM, frame relay.\n\n134\n00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.804\nDifferent standards that we see.\n\n135\n00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:38.048\nDifferent communication methods.\n\n136\n00:07:38.048 --> 00:07:43.655\nAnd in fact, as the technology progresses,\nwe need to make sure that, for\n\n137\n00:07:43.655 --> 00:07:48.728\ninstance, we have defined links\nthat allow us to bridge the media,\n\n138\n00:07:48.728 --> 00:07:53.194\nif you will from a land based\nnetwork over to a land network.\n\n139\n00:07:53.194 --> 00:07:57.857\nFor instance,\nwe have SONET-based networks in an OC,\n\n140\n00:07:57.857 --> 00:08:01.640\nwhat was it, OC192 is just under a 10G.\n\n141\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.210\nIt's essentially\na 10G-based WAN technology.\n\n142\n00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.190\nWell, how do we communicate to the LAN\nwith that WAN-based technology?\n\n143\n00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.215\nWe've talked about in other episodes,\nabout things like media converters.\n\n144\n00:08:12.215 --> 00:08:16.487\nSo this is where we need to implement\nsomething like a 10G-based technology\n\n145\n00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:20.045\nwhere we have Ethernet and\nwe can connect it to the WAN interface so\n\n146\n00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.810\nthat we can get communication.\n\n147\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.750\nSo, you can see that LANs have their\nown protocols that they follow\n\n148\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.710\nversus the Wide Area Network,\nthat has its own set of protocols and\n\n149\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.750\ntechnology to move the information\nalong between the different ISPs.\n\n150\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.650\n&gt;&gt; It's such a weird concept sometime\nwhen you're thinking about this.\n\n151\n00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.120\nAnd you just mentioned 192OC,\n\n152\n00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.860\nwe're talking really high-speed\nconnections for those weigh-ins.\n\n153\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.160\nAnd I don't know why but I always think\nabout it like this, Wes, if someone were\n\n154\n00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.970\nsprinting, like in the Olympics, and then\nthey just came to an immediate halt, and\n\n155\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.470\ndropping down to those lower speeds,\nthat it's\n\n156\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.330\nkind of gets you thinking in that way,\nshifting, okay, from the WAN to the LAN.\n\n157\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.963\nWe normally don't see those speeds\non our local area networks, right?\n\n158\n00:09:04.963 --> 00:09:06.390\n&gt;&gt; No, we really don't.\n\n159\n00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.890\n&gt;&gt; It is all those different protocols,\nand so,\n\n160\n00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.640\nknowing the difference is key here.\n\n161\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.502\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and again, it's all\nabout learning that language, right?\n\n162\n00:09:14.502 --> 00:09:17.772\nI need to know that if I'm talking about a\nWAN technology like Cherokee mentions then\n\n163\n00:09:17.772 --> 00:09:19.880\nI'm gonna be using something different.\n\n164\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.620\nThan what I would be using\ninside of my local area network.\n\n165\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.176\nAnd, let's say that you are somebody\nthat is supporting a network and\n\n166\n00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:27.630\nyou have to call up your ISP.\n\n167\n00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.308\nAnd you have to make a determination,\nwhat kinda dmarker are we gonna get right?\n\n168\n00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:36.129\nThe DMARC demarcation point just basically\nmeans that this is the point where\n\n169\n00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:40.285\nthe carrier's network comes into yours and\nyou attach to the carrier's network.\n\n170\n00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:42.010\nIt's really about the point\nof responsibility.\n\n171\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.010\nBut when it comes down to it we need to\nknow what kind of connections we have\n\n172\n00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.040\ninside of our local area networks,\nversus our wide area networks so\n\n173\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.430\nthat we can ensure that we're\nsetting up our networks properly.\n\n174\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.030\nAnd if we don't know these basic,\n\n175\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.990\nbasic network implementations,\nit could be a very bad day at the office.\n\n176\n00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.840\nSo understand what your WANs are and\nunderstand what your LANs are.\n\n177\n00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.890\nAgain, LAN very generically self-contained\nnetwork typically connected with high\n\n178\n00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:13.880\nspeed short-range media, versus long-range\nmedia in our WAN technologies and\n\n179\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.290\na different set of protocols and\nit will be important for the exam.\n\n180\n00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.340\n&gt;&gt; That is true, the actual acronyms that\nWes just gave you are gonna be the ones\n\n181\n00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.350\nspecifically that CompTIA calls out.\n\n182\n00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.920\nBut don't fret if someone says GAN for\nglobal area network, it's just a little\n\n183\n00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.120\nmore definitive they're saying, hey this\nis an international wide area network or\n\n184\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.200\nsometimes, people from the military\nwill say BAN for base area network,\n\n185\n00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.390\ndon't say that's not correct because\nit's just a little more definitive.\n\n186\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.080\nBut with what Wes is saying is what's\ngoing in line with the CompTIA objectives.\n\n187\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.520\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting that you\nmentioned that, Cherokee,\n\n188\n00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.610\ncuz I do remember some of the earlier\nobjectives and they did mention GAN.\n\n189\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.140\nYou might be mentioning, well,\nwhy are we kinda breazing over it?\n\n190\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.000\nBecause it's such a confusing term.\n\n191\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.610\nA global area network.\n\n192\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.002\nReally what is the difference between\na global area and a wide area network?\n\n193\n00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:05.848\nHonestly, I really don't know other\nthan the fact that maybe you can say\n\n194\n00:11:05.848 --> 00:11:10.750\nthe global area network is still under\na single body, or even a company.\n\n195\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.885\nYou can have a company, I think of\nMicrosoft and somebody like Samsung,\n\n196\n00:11:15.885 --> 00:11:19.814\nand Apple, massive organizations\nthat are worldwide, right?\n\n197\n00:11:19.814 --> 00:11:20.318\n&gt;&gt; Tomato, tomato.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n198\n00:11:20.318 --> 00:11:21.716\n[LAUGH] That's exactly it.\n\n199\n00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:23.406\nAnd that's where it gets confusing.\n\n200\n00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:25.070\nSo I'm glad to see that they\n\n201\n00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.112\ndon't get hung up on it too much\nbecause it does get confusing.\n\n202\n00:11:29.112 --> 00:11:31.030\nAnd then, we might as well and\n\n203\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.970\nwe can do this to completion, completeness\nor completion, if I can say that right.\n\n204\n00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.955\nI can't do it grammatically but\nI can hopefully do it conceptually here.\n\n205\n00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:41.730\n[LAUGH] And that's the other one.\n\n206\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.020\nThis isn't in the list but\nwe'll throw it out here guys for you.\n\n207\n00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.160\nAnd that's also a campus area network.\n\n208\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.265\nAnd they don't really call that one in.\n\n209\n00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:51.900\nAnd a campus area network could\nbe almost seen in a way that\n\n210\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.140\nit could be a wide area network,\nit could be a metropolitan area network,\n\n211\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.460\nwhich I will get to the metropolitan\narea network here in a second.\n\n212\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460\nUsually what you have is you have,\n\n213\n00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.090\na network that can be spread out\nall over a city, all over a county.\n\n214\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.140\nAnd let me give you an example.\n\n215\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.902\nWe're here in Gainesville and\nwe have the UF campus here.\n\n216\n00:12:08.902 --> 00:12:14.440\nUF is a massive academic institution.\n\n217\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.340\nThey have buildings all over Gainseville\nand they also have some dedicated\n\n218\n00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.210\nlinks that are their links that they\ncontrol between those buildings.\n\n219\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.340\nSo when I say this,\n\n220\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.070\nwhen I say the definition of\na campus area network is typically\n\n221\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.470\na dispersed network that's under the\ncontrol of a single academic institution.\n\n222\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.730\nWell, that's technical for the fact\nthat in our case, you know UF, UF owns\n\n223\n00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.610\nthe building that's on this street and all\nthe way across the county, if you will.\n\n224\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.820\nAll the way across the city.\n\n225\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.060\n&gt;&gt; And I lived in south Florida,\nand they had a research facility,\n\n226\n00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.800\na UF research facility,\ndown in Homestead, so go figure.\n\n227\n00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.770\n&gt;&gt; So you can imagine that.\n\n228\n00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.530\nThere, gives you an example of\na large campus area network.\n\n229\n00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.210\nSo you can see that it's still UF that\nis the administrative body over it.\n\n230\n00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.400\nDo they use some ISP networks?\n\n231\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.070\nI'm sure they do.\n\n232\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.400\nI'm sure they use a mixture of ISP and\nthey probably got maybe even some of their\n\n233\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.360\nown dedicated fiber going between those\nbuildings but they control each one of\n\n234\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.400\nthose locations that encompasses\nthe larger campus area network there.\n\n235\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.460\n[LAUGH] So know those.\n\n236\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.150\nNow the next one that we wanna\nmention is something known as\n\n237\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.890\na metropolitan area network.\n\n238\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.970\nAnd a metropolitan area network also has,\n\n239\n00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.040\nagain it's one of these terms that\nsometimes it's in the eye of the beholder.\n\n240\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.720\nI want you to think of metropolitan areas,\nnow we're not talking about a single\n\n241\n00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.270\ngeographical area, and not necessarily\nlarge expanses of geographical areas.\n\n242\n00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.650\nBut we're talking more of like a city or\na county, right,\n\n243\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.690\nin which we can offer some kind\nof a network connectivity, but\n\n244\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.490\nyou don't have to necessarily be\na part of the wide area network.\n\n245\n00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.120\nNow, where can see this?\n\n246\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.054\nLet me give you an example.\n\n247\n00:13:56.054 --> 00:13:58.083\nSo, for\ninstance I've got a little diagram here.\n\n248\n00:13:58.083 --> 00:13:59.063\nAnd more so,\n\n249\n00:13:59.063 --> 00:14:04.510\nI want you to think of the diagram\nhere as these two technologies really.\n\n250\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.940\nWe have what is known as the Wireless\nInteroperability for Microwave Access.\n\n251\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.670\nThis is WiMax.\n\n252\n00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.560\nAnd it's another one of those technologies\nthat blurs the line between wide area\n\n253\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.265\nnetwork and a metropolitan area network\nbecause in some documentation you'll see\n\n254\n00:14:19.265 --> 00:14:23.780\nWiMax on a wireless wide\narea network communication.\n\n255\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.550\nThey'll call it a WWAN, just throw another\nrock in a compound of understanding there.\n\n256\n00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.385\nBut technically it really is, it's 802.16.\n\n257\n00:14:31.385 --> 00:14:35.286\nIt's the IEEE 802.16, and\nit is a formal MAN specification,\n\n258\n00:14:35.286 --> 00:14:37.740\nthe metropolitan area network.\n\n259\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.970\nBut I want you to think of it as\na wireless communication that allows\n\n260\n00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.280\nyou to communicate across the entire city.\n\n261\n00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.520\nOr the entire county.\n\n262\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.410\nLittle bit about WiMax,\nthey do call WiMax out for the exam,\n\n263\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.820\nso there's some things that we want you to\nknow about that so that you'll be ready.\n\n264\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:57.470\nKeep in mind that this has a speed of\nup to around 30 megabit per second.\n\n265\n00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.530\nIt is yesterday's technology\ncompared to LTE that we've\n\n266\n00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.740\ntalked about when we talked\nabout our WAN technologies.\n\n267\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.723\nRemember we talked about\nlong-term evolution.\n\n268\n00:15:05.723 --> 00:15:08.898\nWell, long-term evolution really\nwon out as a 4G technology,\n\n269\n00:15:08.898 --> 00:15:12.120\nbecause of the 100 megabit\ndownloads that they have.\n\n270\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.800\nHowever, keep in mind that WiMax is one\nof those that can fall under not only\n\n271\n00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.740\na wireless wide area network but\nthe metropolitan area network likewise.\n\n272\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.470\n&gt;&gt; I think you're so right on that point\nbecause it was a really great idea\n\n273\n00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.480\nif you think about it, but\njust that war over the cellular networks,\n\n274\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.540\nI don't think anyone saw them blowing up\nas rapid at a rate as which they did.\n\n275\n00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.840\n&gt;&gt; It's probably akin to\nsomething like the dot com boom.\n\n276\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.436\nRight?\nWe didn't think, nobody thought,\n\n277\n00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.100\nnobody was prepared with the dot com boom.\n\n278\n00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:43.811\nI certainly know that ICANN or the INO\nwasn't, these big Internet standards\n\n279\n00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:48.380\norganizations, or they would have\nhad the foresight to plan larger.\n\n280\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.244\nWe just didn't think about that.\n\n281\n00:15:49.244 --> 00:15:52.558\nSo yeah as you see the technology,\nespecially with mobile.\n\n282\n00:15:52.558 --> 00:15:55.520\n&gt;&gt; Well the Internet.\nThat's right, and if you think about it,\n\n283\n00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.518\nthe BYOD trend.\n\n284\n00:15:56.518 --> 00:15:57.018\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n285\n00:15:57.018 --> 00:15:59.560\nThat really skyrocketed,\n\n286\n00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.400\nhaving to come up with\na better technology.\n\n287\n00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.820\nThat's why, Max, you have other\ntechnologies out there that they call out\n\n288\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.990\non the exam that I want to mention,\nand that's Metro Ethernet.\n\n289\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.980\nWhy do they call it Metro Ethernet?\n\n290\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.730\nWell, Metro Ethernet comes from\nmetropolitan area network.\n\n291\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.683\nThey're talking about\na man-based ethernet.\n\n292\n00:16:18.683 --> 00:16:22.435\nAll right, and what we mean by that\nis really, if you think about it,\n\n293\n00:16:22.435 --> 00:16:25.025\nthere are fiber optic standards out there,\nand\n\n294\n00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:28.735\nCherokee actually we were talking\nbefore the show, a day or so ago.\n\n295\n00:16:28.735 --> 00:16:32.040\nYou'd asked me, hey, when am I\ngonna mention the base standards?\n\n296\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.420\nI said, I'm never gonna mention\nthem until the standards come up,\n\n297\n00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.520\nand, of course, open mouth, insert foot,\ncuz I am gonna mention one here.\n\n298\n00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.240\nFor instance, 10gbase Right?\n\n299\n00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.640\nWe're talking extended reach,\nwe're talking 40 kilometers.\n\n300\n00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.710\nThat's 40,000 meters, all right.\n\n301\n00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.350\nSo, I want you to think about that in\nrelation to where you live, your city,\n\n302\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:55.570\nyour county, or\nif you're in In another country or\n\n303\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.680\nin Europe, just think about\nyour geographical location.\n\n304\n00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.900\n40 kilometers, that's 25 miles,\njust right around, I think, 25 miles.\n\n305\n00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.310\nThat is a very long cable and\nthat's one cable, right?\n\n306\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.310\nSo, we have the ability to\n\n307\n00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:17.260\ngive metropolitan area connections\nover ethernet-based technologies.\n\n308\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.930\nNow you might ask yourself, why would\nI want an ethernet-based technology?\n\n309\n00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:27.000\nWell, expense, it is very, very costly\n\n310\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.620\nto implement something like SONET, your\nSynchronous Optical Networking, right?\n\n311\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.520\nFiber optic technology,\ndual ring topology,\n\n312\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.230\nvery fast but very, very expensive.\n\n313\n00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.470\nImagine if you could get\nthe same distances and\n\n314\n00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.770\nclose to the same speeds, but\nyou didn't have all the cost.\n\n315\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.390\nYou didn't incur the high cost, and\nthat's one of the things that makes\n\n316\n00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:50.470\nMetro Ethernet attractive,\nis the fact that it does offer a low cost\n\n317\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:56.240\nimplementation where otherwise you\nreally wouldn't have the lower cost.\n\n318\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.340\nSo, that's one of the things is that,\nand the other thing too, Cherokee,\n\n319\n00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.100\nI might mention there\nIs the fact that you're\n\n320\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.920\nalways using internal ethernet\nbased technologies, right?\n\n321\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.930\nWe were talking about knowing the WAN\nversus the LAN technologies, because you\n\n322\n00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.370\nhave a different set of protocols and\na different set of technologies, right?\n\n323\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.780\nThe whole entire 10g physical\nlayer of the OSI model,\n\n324\n00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.280\nwas implemented to match\nthe speeds of Sonnet.\n\n325\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.790\nWe came out with a whole new standard\njust so we would have something for\n\n326\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.490\nthe interoperability.\n\n327\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.470\nImagine taking that out.\n\n328\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:30.030\nI don't need that interoperability,\ncuz I'm going ethernet to ethernet.\n\n329\n00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.440\nThere isn't any conversion there.\n\n330\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.390\nSo you have existing ethernet\ntechnologies in your LAN, and\n\n331\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.800\nnow if you don't need a great spanse,\n\n332\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.386\nlike an IS you probably need a mix of\nboth, you can implement those technologies\n\n333\n00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:46.120\nthat allow you You to use ethernet\nin a shorter reach environment.\n\n334\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.450\n&gt;&gt; And it's such a cool time because we\nhave these scientific researchers and\n\n335\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:55.250\nengineers who are always trying to come up\nwith better ways to go ahead and connect.\n\n336\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.520\nAnd I always joked around, Wes, and\nI said, I lived out in the woods.\n\n337\n00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.810\nAnd I said, if I won the lottery,\n\n338\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.640\nI would Build myself a WiMAX tower and\noffer it to my neighbors.\n\n339\n00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.770\nBut who knows?\n\n340\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.250\nPeople do, you have these smaller\ncompanies that go ahead and\n\n341\n00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.710\nhave the funding to set that up so\nanything is possible here.\n\n342\n00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.660\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n343\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.260\nAnd I'm glad Glad you made that point too,\nbecause that's another thing that's\n\n344\n00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.300\nreally really attractive to people that\nmaybe want to implement Metro ethernet\n\n345\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.360\nis the fact that, how about four or\nfive companies,six, seven companies,\n\n346\n00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.370\ngetting together and\nsaying hey we can't afford.\n\n347\n00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Like a co-op?\n\n348\n00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.610\n&gt;&gt; That exactly.\n\n349\n00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.060\nWe'll all put a little bit of money and\nwe'll fund this together.\n\n350\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.370\nAnd we'll lay the ethernet lines.\n\n351\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.120\nAnd now our companies can use it and\nWe essentially own those lines.\n\n352\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.130\nNow understand, so\nthat's still a lot of infrastructure.\n\n353\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.980\nWe still gonna have to\nsupport the infrastructure.\n\n354\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.730\nBut there might be a point where you\ndon't have to go through an ISP.\n\n355\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:42.780\nNow you 86 the ISP.\n\n356\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.900\nNow I'm not telling you.\n\n357\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.790\nIf you work for an ISP guys,\nwe're not trying to take your fire.\n\n358\n00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.590\n&gt;&gt; No, mine's pretty bad, right?\n\n359\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.095\nSo it was bad.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n360\n00:19:48.095 --> 00:19:50.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So,\n\n361\n00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.120\nyeah that's a metropolitan\narea base network.\n\n362\n00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.220\nAnd I do want you to remember\nthe 802.16 just incase\n\n363\n00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.740\nit comes up at your WiMAX technologies.\n\n364\n00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.880\nI do have a couple more of specification\nI wanna mention about why WiMAX\n\n365\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.610\nbefore I forget.\n\n366\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; You have a couple of different types of\n\n367\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.810\nstations, you have mobile stations,\n\n368\n00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.000\nyou have once that are\n&gt;&gt; Fixed.\n\n369\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.840\nIf you have a mobile station you're\ntalking about a ten mile coverage area.\n\n370\n00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.290\nIf you're talking about a fixed station,\n\n371\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.080\none that's not moving,\nYMAX can offer distances up to 30 miles.\n\n372\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.680\nWe're talking about the same wireless\n&gt;&gt; Arrange\n\n373\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.760\nas what I was mentioning about the Around\nwhat it is that we're committing\n\n374\n00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.430\nto do to support the student\nwith challenging behaviour.\n\n375\n00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.040\nAt measurement plan, we need to make sure\nwe're putting together a data collection\n\n376\n00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.250\nmethod that's feasible and accurate.\n\n377\n00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.260\nSo, we can't be asking teachers to\ncarry out Than one of the longest,\n\n378\n00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.100\nsingle longest bounded transmission\nmediums we have on the face of the Earth.\n\n379\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.030\nAll right, Cherokee, let's see.\n\n380\n00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.160\nWhat are some of the things\nthat we have to tackle?\n\n381\n00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.710\nThis is gonna be a fun one.\n\n382\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:51.810\nThis is one I actually really,\nreally like.\n\n383\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.800\nBecause it's something that you\nguys probably use on a daily basis.\n\n384\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.800\nAnd this is something known as LANs,\nso [LAUGH] LAN the acronym still\n\n385\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.130\nstands the same, it's stays the same,\nit the Local Area Network but\n\n386\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.950\nnow what we're talking about\nis a wireless communication.\n\n387\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.180\nAll right now, I want you guys to\nunderstand that wireless communications\n\n388\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:17.970\nare governed Over by the IEEE\nunder the 802.11 standards.\n\n389\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.080\nGuys, I'm not gonna leave you\nhanging on 802.11 standards,\n\n390\n00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.485\nwe're gonna talk about, A B G N and A C.\n\n391\n00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:26.135\nWe'll talk about AC.\n\n392\n00:21:26.135 --> 00:21:28.735\nWe might even throw AD in there just for\nthe heck of it.\n\n393\n00:21:28.735 --> 00:21:29.975\nBut we're gonna talk about those.\n\n394\n00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:31.605\nThey don't really mention those here.\n\n395\n00:21:31.605 --> 00:21:35.725\nWe're gonna push those off to\na conglomeration of standards that we need\n\n396\n00:21:35.725 --> 00:21:36.445\nto talk about.\n\n397\n00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:41.320\nBut we do need to mention it\nhere that 802.11 is the I triple\n\n398\n00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.950\nEs governing or\nworking group, if you will,\n\n399\n00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.970\nthat oversees wireless local\narea network communications.\n\n400\n00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.270\nNow I do wanna talk a little bit about the\narchitecture behind a wireless network.\n\n401\n00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.610\nIt is important to understand that\nthere are different components.\n\n402\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.920\nAnd it would be easy to say, well we got a\nwireless router We got a wireless device,\n\n403\n00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.310\nthey communicate, and\nthat's all we need to know.\n\n404\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.910\nWell, no.\n\n405\n00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:03.790\n&gt;&gt; That'd be too easy.\n\n406\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.320\n&gt;&gt; That would be way too easy.\n\n407\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.240\nI'm sure you've taken a couple\nof these COMT exams before.\n\n408\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.670\nIt's not gonna be as generic as that.\n\n409\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.560\nSo let's get a little\nbit more specific here.\n\n410\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.650\nI've got another little diagram here.\n\n411\n00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.220\nI wanna talk about just the individual\ncomponents of what a wireless network\n\n412\n00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.600\nis made up of.\n\n413\n00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.810\nYou have what known as a DS,\nmost of these are abbreviated,\n\n414\n00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.380\nI'll help you with\nthe abbreviations here guys.\n\n415\n00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.480\nYou might see DS instead of\ndistributed system, what is that?\n\n416\n00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.120\nThat's your wired connection They call\nan access point a lot of times they call\n\n417\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.820\nit a wireless access point,\nit's not a wireless device.\n\n418\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.380\nMany people don't know that, don't think\nof it that way but your wireless access\n\n419\n00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.710\npoint is actually a wired device and\nit is connected directly into.\n\n420\n00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.080\nYour distribution system.\n\n421\n00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.960\nSo I have a wired connection that\ngoes right into the wireless, or\n\n422\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.010\nthe wired distribution system.\n\n423\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.250\nNow, the AP, also known as an access\npoint, sometimes called a WAP,\n\n424\n00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.830\nwireless access point.\n\n425\n00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.910\nThe access point is what's\nknow as a men in Jing device.\n\n426\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.240\nIt is managing the communications for the\nwireless local area network of the WLan.\n\n427\n00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.780\nThen you have what are known as STA's.\n\n428\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.050\nSTA guys very basically, is a station.\n\n429\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:23.000\nIf I was to say to you guys in\nconversation outside of an exam-type,\n\n430\n00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.560\nYou know a situation.\n\n431\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.950\nYou're going to say, I've got five\nwireless devices that my AP's talking to.\n\n432\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.180\nWould I correct you?\n\n433\n00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.480\nNo, I wouldn't correct you.\n\n434\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.870\nA station is a wireless device\nthat's managed by an AP.\n\n435\n00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.700\nTechnically, like you said earlier,\ntomato tomotto.\n\n436\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.393\nWe're just kinda arguing\nover the dotted i.\n\n437\n00:23:43.393 --> 00:23:43.962\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So\n\n438\n00:23:43.962 --> 00:23:47.076\nyou want to make sure they understand\nthe technical terminology here.\n\n439\n00:23:47.076 --> 00:23:48.610\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n440\n00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.319\nAnd that's exactly why we need\nto know these technologies.\n\n441\n00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:57.149\nNow I also want to talk about something\nknown as a basic service set.\n\n442\n00:23:57.149 --> 00:24:02.038\nAnd you could see this abbreviated\nI just mention the abbreviation so\n\n443\n00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:07.513\nif you're ever in a documentation,\nright, and you come up here and you say,\n\n444\n00:24:07.513 --> 00:24:12.610\nthis is BSS1, BSS2, and on, and\non, and on, Basic Service Set.\n\n445\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.422\n&gt;&gt; You're not talking\nabout irritable bowel.\n\n446\n00:24:13.422 --> 00:24:14.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n447\n00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:17.638\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Basic Service Set, if you will, just,\n\n448\n00:24:17.638 --> 00:24:19.050\nbasically?\n\n449\n00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.400\nBasic Service Set what it means is it\nmeans we have a single access point\n\n450\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.230\ncontrolling the communications\non that wireless network.\n\n451\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.970\nWe also have a component inside of\nwireless networks that's called an SSID\n\n452\n00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:31.900\nand that's the Service Set Identifier.\n\n453\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.290\nGuys, I want you to think of it\ngenerically as the network name.\n\n454\n00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.510\n&gt;&gt; The WiFi name.\n\n455\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.330\n&gt;&gt; Right, when I pull up my phone,\nright, and I'm doing a wireless scan,\n\n456\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.890\nand I'm looking for\nthe ITProTV wireless network, right?\n\n457\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:45.880\nI see a whole bunch of names.\n\n458\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.860\nNow, I'm only looking for\n\n459\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.830\nthe one that's ITProTV, but I can see\na whole bunch of other names in that list.\n\n460\n00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.850\nAnd that's because my\nwireless device isn't\n\n461\n00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.420\na station on any of\nthose wireless networks.\n\n462\n00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.670\nBut what it's doing is what's\ncalled a station to AP probe.\n\n463\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.010\nIt's constantly sending out these signals\nsaying, hey, is there anybody out there?\n\n464\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:05.700\nI'm over here.\n\n465\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.260\nHey, is there anybody out there?\n\n466\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.000\nWell, the access points,\nthe wireless access points,\n\n467\n00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.140\nthey're configured to respond back\nto the probe with a response.\n\n468\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.360\nAnd that response is what generates\nthat network list for you.\n\n469\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.467\nNow, the one that you connect to,\nyou put in your authentication,\n\n470\n00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:25.648\nyou connect to it and\nyou join that network, right?\n\n471\n00:25:25.648 --> 00:25:28.375\nYou identify the network with the,\nI believe,\n\n472\n00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:32.750\nit's a 32-bit Alphanumeric string\ncalled the service set identifier.\n\n473\n00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.210\n&gt;&gt; And now you're a station.\n\n474\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nAnd\n\n475\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.270\nthat's right, and\nthen you become a station.\n\n476\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.980\nIt's not until you join the network\nthat you actually become official STA\n\n477\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.750\nas a part of the basic service set.\n\n478\n00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:49.940\nNow, the next thing that we have is what\nis known as a this is called an ESS.\n\n479\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.720\nThis is an Extended Service Set,\nall right?\n\n480\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.100\nIt's also a Wireless Local Area Network\nimplementation.\n\n481\n00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.750\nHowever, what I want you to notice is that\nan extended service set is when we have\n\n482\n00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:06.940\ntwo, in this case, two or more access\npoints, multiple basic service sets.\n\n483\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:12.360\nBut what they're doing right now\nis they're configured as one\n\n484\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.290\nlarge wireless network that's\ncalled an Extended Service Set.\n\n485\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.980\nNow, what that means is that these\ndevices, and this is really good,\n\n486\n00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.860\nfor instance, in wireless devices.\n\n487\n00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.730\nSo this whole entire network really\nis the extended service set.\n\n488\n00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.731\nAnd what's good about this,\nlet me go ahead and take some of\n\n489\n00:26:29.731 --> 00:26:34.120\nthese circles out here, is that,\nlet's say that I do have a laptop, right?\n\n490\n00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.890\nAnd I move from the range of one network,\n\n491\n00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.200\nand I start removing out of\nthe range of that network.\n\n492\n00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.290\nNow if these weren't configured as an ESS,\nright,\n\n493\n00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:53.080\nthey have two independent just\ncompletely independent SSIDs.\n\n494\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:58.150\nWell, as I move into the range of the next\naccess point, what am I gonna have to do?\n\n495\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.665\nWell, at the very least,\nwe're gonna get a change of the network.\n\n496\n00:27:00.665 --> 00:27:02.593\n[CROSSTALK] That's right.\n\n497\n00:27:02.593 --> 00:27:08.330\nAnd I'm going to have to be able to Know\nthe password of that second access point.\n\n498\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.980\nAnd I'm gonna have to sign in.\n\n499\n00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.520\nNow, if I've already done that, then it,\nfor the most part, looks seamless to me.\n\n500\n00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.340\nBut there is still some\ndisconnect because we have\n\n501\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.950\ntwo different devices managing\ntwo completely separate networks.\n\n502\n00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.970\nHowever, if I configure them\nas a Extended Service Set,\n\n503\n00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:31.190\nwhen this laptop or mobile device\nmoves from within the coverage\n\n504\n00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:36.650\narea of this first access point and\nloses its signal and\n\n505\n00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:41.240\nstarts to come into the area of this\naccess point, well, guess what?\n\n506\n00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.940\nThey're all answering to the same ESS ID.\n\n507\n00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.440\nSo to them it looks like\none massive network.\n\n508\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.570\nAnd we just disconnect ed from one and\nwe connected to the other one.\n\n509\n00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:53.130\nSo we get that seamless transition,\n\n510\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.490\nand this is really good in areas where\nyou have things like multiple floors.\n\n511\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:02.195\nYou have, for instance, in something like\na hospital where the hospital ends up you\n\n512\n00:28:02.195 --> 00:28:06.920\nhave multiple floors within\na massive building and you need that\n\n513\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.635\nseamless connectivity regardless of\nwhere the doctors, the nurses or\n\n514\n00:28:11.635 --> 00:28:15.590\nmaybe even the guests and visitors happen\nto be roaming through the building.\n\n515\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.590\nSo that is important, keep that in mind.\n\n516\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.940\nThat's the Extended Service Set.\n\n517\n00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.510\nKeep in mind, the Extended Service Set,\nwhat it does is it combines two or\n\n518\n00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.240\nmore basic service sets and\nthey all become one giant network.\n\n519\n00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.630\nThere's one more that I want you to know\nwhen it comes to wireless architecture,\n\n520\n00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:42.570\nand this one is one that is independent\nof a distribution system and\n\n521\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.200\neven more so\nindependent of a managing accerss point.\n\n522\n00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.130\nWhat happens is the stations kind of work\nas a station and an access point, and\n\n523\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.620\nthey form what's known\nas a mesh mode network.\n\n524\n00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.690\nThat is called an independent\nbasic service set.\n\n525\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.700\nThey call it independent because it's\nindependent of a managing device.\n\n526\n00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.760\nIt's independent of\nthe distribution system, and\n\n527\n00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.135\nthis is also sometimes called\nad hoc networks, right?\n\n528\n00:29:08.135 --> 00:29:13.445\nIt's where a network adapter can\nbe configured to communicate\n\n529\n00:29:13.445 --> 00:29:16.825\nwith other wireless adapters, and they\nform this mesh network, but they don't\n\n530\n00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:21.080\nhave a centralized connectivity device\nthat is managing the communications.\n\n531\n00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.160\nEvery device can communicate\nto every other device,\n\n532\n00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.910\nwhich is different when you\nhave a managing access point.\n\n533\n00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.440\nBecause station one here can't\njust talk directly to station two.\n\n534\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.900\nIt has to go through the access point.\n\n535\n00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.140\nAnd then the access point,\n\n536\n00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:40.230\nas the managing device, controls\nthe communication going to station two.\n\n537\n00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.590\nWhen we have something like\nan independent basic service set,\n\n538\n00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.010\nstation one wants to talk to station two,\nit just does that.\n\n539\n00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.000\nThere isn't an access point in between.\n\n540\n00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.110\nSo those are your wireless area networks.\n\n541\n00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.730\nNow, know these terms.\n\n542\n00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.460\nKnow what an access point is,\nknow what a station is.\n\n543\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.180\nKnow what a distribution system is.\n\n544\n00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.330\nKnow what the basic service set,\nextended service sets are, and\n\n545\n00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.950\nthe independent basic service set as well.\n\n546\n00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.460\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n547\n00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.150\nexplaining the wireless technical\nterms in this technical series.\n\n548\n00:30:11.150

00:00:12.240\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.108\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.472\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:21.875\nThis is actually continuation of part\ntwo where we were looking at network\n\n7\n00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.086\ninfrastructure implementations.\n\n8\n00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.216\nThere was a lot to cover,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.910\npick up right where we left off.\n\n10\n00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.185\nAnd with us today is Mr. Wes Bryan in\nstudios to help us with these topics.\n\n11\n00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.625\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.023\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Cherokee, for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:38.516\nThat's right, I talked a lot\nin the very first part here.\n\n14\n00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:40.945\nAnd we had quite a few\nthings to go through, and\n\n15\n00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.325\nI didn't manage to make\nit through them all.\n\n16\n00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.432\nSo we're coming back with a part two.\n\n17\n00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:48.848\nI wanna go ahead and recap, cuz there's\none of the things that I wanted to\n\n18\n00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.704\nmake mention, if you're following\nus from the first part,\n\n19\n00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.788\nabout wireless local area networks\nthat I didn't touch base on.\n\n20\n00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.223\nSo let's go ahead real quick and\njust kind of recap where we left off.\n\n21\n00:00:58.223 --> 00:01:01.172\nAnd then I want to mention\nsomething known as hotspots.\n\n22\n00:01:01.172 --> 00:01:03.520\nAnd it is something that's\ncalled out on the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.140\nSo we wouldn't be doing you any\njustice if we didn't cover it here.\n\n24\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.950\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.300\ngo back to the diagram that we\nwere using in the first part here.\n\n26\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.000\nRemember that we talked about a basic\nservice set and that is a single wireless\n\n27\n00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.290\nlocal area network under the control\nof a single access point.\n\n28\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.955\nRemember that we also talked about\nthe extended service set, right?\n\n29\n00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:35.124\nThe ESS and that is one where we\nhave two or more basic service sets\n\n30\n00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:41.845\nthat are configured to both respond to\na single extended service set identifiers.\n\n31\n00:01:41.845 --> 00:01:44.825\nSo think about it as two basic\nservice sets, two access points or\n\n32\n00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:49.852\nmore that are basically servicing\nan entirely larger network, right?\n\n33\n00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:53.042\nIt gives us the ability to extend\n\n34\n00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:57.472\nthe coverage of our networks if\nyou will in which we can have\n\n35\n00:01:57.472 --> 00:02:02.110\nmore than just a single access point\nmaintaining that larger wireless network.\n\n36\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.290\nWe also talked about\nthe independent basic service set,\n\n37\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.070\nsometimes known as add-hoc mode.\n\n38\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.298\nKeep in mind, it's called independent\nbecause it's independent of an access\n\n39\n00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.516\npoint or a distribution system, the DS.\n\n40\n00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:18.087\nKeep in mind that every computer or every\nwireless station if you will, can act like\n\n41\n00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:22.547\nan access point or a station and they can\ncommunicate directly with one another.\n\n42\n00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:26.466\nAnd that leads me to the point that I\nforgot to mention in the last episode here\n\n43\n00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:31.020\nin wireless local area networks and\nthat is what is known as the hotspot.\n\n44\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.164\nThe ability to take your wireless device,\nyou can do a couple of things.\n\n45\n00:02:35.164 --> 00:02:39.293\nYou can turn it into an access point, you\ncan also turn it into a tether as well,\n\n46\n00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:42.174\nwhere you can do kinda like\nthe old Internet connection\n\n47\n00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:43.630\nsharing that we used to do.\n\n48\n00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.720\nWe don't do much anymore,\nbut we used to do.\n\n49\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.900\nAnd it allows other devices to connect\nthrough and be a tethering if you will,\n\n50\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.575\nthrough that one devices Internet\nconnection, if it's a hotspot.\n\n51\n00:02:57.575 --> 00:03:00.820\nEspecially you gotta watch these again,\nbecause these could be open, and\n\n52\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.790\nthey can be public networks.\n\n53\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.390\nSo you wanna make sure that\nyou have your devices,\n\n54\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.190\nif they do happen to attach to a hotspot,\nmake sure that they are secured.\n\n55\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.734\nSo keep in mind that you don't\nwanna ever connect to a hotspot,\n\n56\n00:03:13.734 --> 00:03:16.752\nif you have any concerns about security.\n\n57\n00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.845\nBecause they are definitely\na security concern.\n\n58\n00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:22.962\n&gt;&gt; And goodness even if your own device,\nyou also wanna be concerned with the costs\n\n59\n00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:25.673\nsometimes, if you're using\nlike a mobile device.\n\n60\n00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:32.180\nI might fire a cellphone as a hotspot, you\nhave to be careful of those data charges.\n\n61\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do have to do that, and\n\n62\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.895\nwe also gotta keep in mind that when we\ntalk about wireless local area networks.\n\n63\n00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:41.392\nTypically what we're not talking\nabout is like a GSM network, or\n\n64\n00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:43.780\nthe database cellular networks.\n\n65\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.609\nHowever, where that does come into play is\nwhen you turn off your Wi-Fi connection,\n\n66\n00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.920\nand you realize you're still streaming\nNetflix over the data connection.\n\n67\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.428\nSo yeah, it can still get you.\n\n68\n00:03:54.428 --> 00:03:56.822\nYou definitely gotta be careful with that.\n\n69\n00:03:56.822 --> 00:04:00.726\nNow there were a couple of other ands,\nif you can say.\n\n70\n00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:06.031\nWe've taken care of the wide area network,\nthe WAN, the LAN.\n\n71\n00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.471\nWe took care of the WLAN and\n\n72\n00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:10.490\nthe metropolitan area\nnetworks we've talked about.\n\n73\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.862\nAnd I just briefly mentioned\nthe wireless wide area technology,\n\n74\n00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:15.710\ncuz WiMAX kinda I don't know.\n\n75\n00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.449\nIt's a weird technology.\n\n76\n00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:26.090\nIt has multiple implementation depending\non who's considering its technology?\n\n77\n00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.230\nAgain it's also sometimes called\na wireless wide area network.\n\n78\n00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.970\nNow the next thing we gotta talk\nabout are our personal area networks.\n\n79\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.854\nAnd these are kind of interesting\ncuz they do call out on the exam,\n\n80\n00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:36.592\nthey call out personal area networks.\n\n81\n00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:40.607\nBut what they don't call out is wireless\npersonal area networks which are a little\n\n82\n00:04:40.607 --> 00:04:41.488\nbit more common.\n\n83\n00:04:41.488 --> 00:04:46.788\nIf you talk about a personal area network,\nyou could really consider something\n\n84\n00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:51.784\nlike for instance a printer, a computer,\nand maybe a void phone, right?\n\n85\n00:04:51.784 --> 00:04:55.840\nIt's all part of your little\npersonal area network, right?\n\n86\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.305\nWhen we talk about geographical locations,\nwe're talking about you,\n\n87\n00:05:00.305 --> 00:05:02.583\nyou are the geographical location.\n\n88\n00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.529\nSo typically-\n&gt;&gt; A real short proximity.\n\n89\n00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.595\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for instance, and\nI didn't spell that right and\n\n90\n00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:10.933\nI'll have to make sure that I\nspell it right in the notes too.\n\n91\n00:05:10.933 --> 00:05:13.534\nFor instance, a personal area network.\n\n92\n00:05:13.534 --> 00:05:17.873\nThey're typically calling a wired\nconnection so you can see things like IEEE\n\n93\n00:05:17.873 --> 00:05:22.445\n1394, code for fire wires,\nlet's not get overly technical here.\n\n94\n00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:27.794\nBut also know as fire wire, this is\ntechnically a personal area network.\n\n95\n00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:30.730\nWe'll look at UPS,\nthis is a personal area network.\n\n96\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.739\nAnd people don't really think of it like\nthat because a lot of times when we have\n\n97\n00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:38.712\nUSP connection we say, well I've got\n12 connections to that computer.\n\n98\n00:05:38.712 --> 00:05:43.748\nI've never really used all 12 connections.\n\n99\n00:05:43.748 --> 00:05:44.853\nAnd even more so\n\n100\n00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:50.710\nwhen you think about a single port\ncontheoretically hold up to 127 devices.\n\n101\n00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.937\nSo that is a personal area network.\n\n102\n00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:56.332\nNow in reality land, right?\n\n103\n00:05:56.332 --> 00:05:57.650\nLet's go back to the real world.\n\n104\n00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.873\nChances are you're not gonna probably\nput 127 devices for the contention-\n\n105\n00:05:59.873 --> 00:06:01.701\n&gt;&gt; I don't even have 127.\n\n106\n00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.895\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, because the contention\n\n107\n00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:03.576\nwould be so great.\n\n108\n00:06:03.576 --> 00:06:05.646\nWho knows if you could actually\ncommunicate across the line?\n\n109\n00:06:05.646 --> 00:06:07.190\nBut theoretically, it is possible.\n\n110\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.200\nSo it really does lend itself\nto a personal area network.\n\n111\n00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.981\nKeep in mind with FireWire or IEEE 1394,\n\n112\n00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:18.362\nwe have 63 devices that can be connected,\nright?\n\n113\n00:06:18.362 --> 00:06:21.188\nUSB and FireWire, they communicate\na little but different, right?\n\n114\n00:06:21.188 --> 00:06:24.758\nFireWire is gonna be one that's good for\nlarge contiguous files.\n\n115\n00:06:24.758 --> 00:06:28.572\nThat's one of the reasons we're using\nlinks like high definition video and\n\n116\n00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:29.771\nweb cams, and stuffs.\n\n117\n00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:34.284\nUSB's a little bit different, while some\nof the speeds seem very impressive, and\n\n118\n00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:38.230\nfor the most part technologies speed\nwise have been fairly impressive.\n\n119\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.136\nThe way it needs to break down, and\nsegment down in order to cross that wire\n\n120\n00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:46.299\nmakes it a little bit less sufficient for\nlarge continuous files like videos.\n\n121\n00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:49.883\nIt does really good with small\nburst files like smaller text file,\n\n122\n00:06:49.883 --> 00:06:52.771\nthe whole bunch of them,\ndoes really good with that.\n\n123\n00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:56.070\nI do wanna make mention some\nof the speeds that you'll see.\n\n124\n00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.061\nFireWire has a couple of speeds there,\nthe FireWire 400.\n\n125\n00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:04.457\nOne of the things I like about the naming\nconvention is that it is 400 megabit\n\n126\n00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:05.286\ntransfer speeds.\n\n127\n00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:06.761\nThey do have the Fire-\n&gt;&gt; Not too complicated there.\n\n128\n00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:08.002\n&gt;&gt; No it isn't.\n\n129\n00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:11.390\nFireWire 800 is 800\nmegabit transfer speeds.\n\n130\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.540\nKeep in mind that a couple different\ntypes of connectors that you could see,\n\n131\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.090\nyou could see a square connector which\nis a four pin connector, it's unpowered.\n\n132\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.650\nYou have also the six pin bullet\nshaped connector that is powered.\n\n133\n00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.601\nWe also have some USB standards to\nbe aware of when it comes to their\n\n134\n00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:27.684\ntransmission speeds.\n\n135\n00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:31.463\nWe've already mentioned how many devices\nthat can be on these individual PAN type\n\n136\n00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:33.040\ntechnologies.\n\n137\n00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.920\nKeep in mind that USB going all the way\nback to 1.1, don't really think you'll see\n\n138\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.920\ntoo many of those devices any more,\nbut you never know.\n\n139\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.942\n12 megabyte transfer speeds and then 480\nmegabyte transfer speeds for USB 2.0.\n\n140\n00:07:44.942 --> 00:07:49.260\nFinally, USB 3.0,\nwe're talking 5 gigabyte transfer speeds.\n\n141\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.140\nAnd the last one,\nmore current one is trying to keep up\n\n142\n00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.730\nwith the Thunderbolt technology that\nwe'll mention here in a second.\n\n143\n00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.793\nAnd that is USB3.1 and that is a 10-gig\nspeed, and that leads us to Thunderbolt.\n\n144\n00:08:00.793 --> 00:08:06.510\nThunderbolt technology that is find\nprimarily on a lot of your Mac, Devices.\n\n145\n00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.493\nIt is not just something\nthat's specific to Mac.\n\n146\n00:08:08.493 --> 00:08:12.230\nIt actually was started between\na coalition in Apple and Intel.\n\n147\n00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.300\nIntel originally I think called\nthe technology light pink and then,\n\n148\n00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.800\nas it's matured it's become\nwhat's knows as Thunderbolt.\n\n149\n00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.680\nYou can daisy chain,\n\n150\n00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.660\nI believe it's seven devices along\nthe Thunderbolt, let me check.\n\n151\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.070\nYeah, seven devices.\n\n152\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.690\nWhich means it's a lot like some of the\nother technologies that we see, typically,\n\n153\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.400\nwhere you have a host device.\n\n154\n00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.580\nAnd we're gonna get into Bluetooth\ncoming up, so, a lot of these kinda\n\n155\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.540\nenter these technologies kinda have\nsome similarities between them.\n\n156\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.940\nBluetooth is another one of those\ntechnologies that can have seven devices.\n\n157\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.660\nYou have one master device and\nthen you have seven slave devices.\n\n158\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.820\nNow you don't hear that terminology\nmuch anymore for obvious reasons.\n\n159\n00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.820\nIt really does have a Negative.\n\n160\n00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.000\nIt's such as-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n161\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.721\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n162\n00:08:54.721 --> 00:09:00.835\nSo you might the master device being\nthe device that is the host controller and\n\n163\n00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:04.610\ncontrols the devices, so\ndo keep that in mind.\n\n164\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.450\nThunderbolt does allow you seven devices.\n\n165\n00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:11.285\nNow, that leads us into something that's\nnot on the exam that I do feel that we\n\n166\n00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:14.954\nwouldn't really be doing you a lot of\njustice if we didn't put it in here.\n\n167\n00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.283\nBecause just because it's not\nmentioned on the exam objectives,\n\n168\n00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:19.718\nI do want you to keep in mind.\n\n169\n00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:24.411\nThat CompTIA does say right in their\nobjectives, we reserve the right to add,\n\n170\n00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:27.410\nmodify, or\nchange these objectives at any time.\n\n171\n00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.310\nSo I want to throw in the wireless\npersonal area network\n\n172\n00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.110\ntechnologies as well.\n\n173\n00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:39.420\nAnd this was actually standardized under\nthe IEEE as 802.15 and there are a series\n\n174\n00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.170\nof wireless personal area\nnetwork communications, WPAN.\n\n175\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.600\nBoy, we get these acronyms confused\nreal quick, at least I can.\n\n176\n00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.330\nThe first one, Bluetooth.\n\n177\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.357\nWe'll go ahead,\nif you check out my screen here,\n\n178\n00:09:53.357 --> 00:09:55.301\nI want you to remember\nthese 802 standards.\n\n179\n00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:57.684\nThat's 802.15.1.\n\n180\n00:09:57.684 --> 00:10:01.030\nBluetooth has been around for\na good long while now.\n\n181\n00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.320\nI'm gonna mention a couple of the\nstandards that I want you to be aware of.\n\n182\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.210\nDo keep in mind that it is a relatively\neasy communication to set up.\n\n183\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.480\nIt goes through a pairing process.\n\n184\n00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.130\nYou have one device that's set into\nwhat's known as discovery mode.\n\n185\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.730\nYou set another device into this discovery\nmode, and now they can find each other.\n\n186\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.230\nWhen they end up finding each other,\nin order for them to communicate and\n\n187\n00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.350\nstart being basically to exchange data,\nthey go through a pairing process.\n\n188\n00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.180\nAnd the pairing process could be\ndone one of two different ways.\n\n189\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.355\nYou could have non-authenticated\npairing process.\n\n190\n00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:39.212\nI'll give you an example, I got this\nlittle, speaker that I use when I'm out\n\n191\n00:10:39.212 --> 00:10:42.520\nback and doing something\nout back on the back porch.\n\n192\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.940\nAnd, I take that Bluetooth speaker\nout there and I turn it on, and\n\n193\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.110\nI turn my cellphone on and my Bluetooth.\n\n194\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.740\nThey can see each other, but\nthen I just click on the device.\n\n195\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.088\nIt's called a Hexxl I think it's\nwhat it's called, the speaker is.\n\n196\n00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:57.200\nI find its name because it's discoverable,\nright,\n\n197\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.720\nI can find it and then what they do is\nthey enter into this trust relationship.\n\n198\n00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.160\nAnd they exchange some\nsecurity information.\n\n199\n00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.300\nAnd part of that security information\ncould be a pre-shared key,\n\n200\n00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.340\nlike a PSK, which is just a PIN\nreally you have to enter.\n\n201\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.407\nCheck the documentation on the device\nbecause there's nothing that formally says\n\n202\n00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:16.577\nyou have to enter a PIN.\n\n203\n00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:20.276\nWhich is what made one of the very first\nBluetooth implementations very easy\n\n204\n00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:20.810\nto spoof.\n\n205\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.350\nWe had things like the Blue Snarfing\nattacks and Blue Jacking attacks.\n\n206\n00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.160\nIt's a little bit harder,\nit's not that it can't happen anymore,\n\n207\n00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.470\nbut there's security built-in to the later\nrevisions of the The Bluetooth standard.\n\n208\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.320\nAnd speaking of Bluetooth revisions,\n\n209\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.100\nthere's a couple here that\nI want you to be aware of.\n\n210\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.350\nWe have the Bluetooth basic\nrate which is 2.0 And\n\n211\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.590\nthen we have what's\nknown as Bluetooth EDR.\n\n212\n00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.570\nYou might see BD EDR and or\nBR EDR and that's enhanced data rate.\n\n213\n00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.200\nThat's the 2.1 so\nwe see 2.0 Is the basic rate.\n\n214\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.160\nAnd then you see BR EDR\nwhich is Bluetooth.\n\n215\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.780\nAnd I keep saying B, yeah,\nit's BR Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate.\n\n216\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.170\nNow, one of the great things is\nBluetooth is very, very ideal for\n\n217\n00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.790\na short range continuous connection for\nthings like streaming audio.\n\n218\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.060\nVery, very good for that.\n\n219\n00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.920\nKeep in mind when we say short range\nwe're typically talking about somewhere\n\n220\n00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.330\nbetween 10 meters or 32.8 feet.\n\n221\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.940\nYes, there comes some of those\nconversions there that you have to do.\n\n222\n00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:32.550\nI don't think you guys have to be\nexperts at the standard, right.\n\n223\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.788\nYou don't have to do the conversions, but\nI would definitely know your ten meters.\n\n224\n00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:41.473\n&gt;&gt; Pretty common.\n&gt;&gt; 1 meter, 10 meter, 100 meter, so,\n\n225\n00:12:41.473 --> 00:12:47.270\n3.28 feet, 32.8 feet, and\n328 feet, for those conversions.\n\n226\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.430\nNow, there's a newer one.\n\n227\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.340\nAnd in fact, Cherokee and I,\n\n228\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.890\nwe were kinda talking about this\none before we started the episode.\n\n229\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.370\nAnd this is a really cool technology,\nI like it.\n\n230\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.860\nAnd Bluetooth has been known\nto be very power hungry.\n\n231\n00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.065\nIn the past, when you were\nusing Bluetooth Communications.\n\n232\n00:13:02.065 --> 00:13:03.601\nThey said that if you're not using it,\n\n233\n00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:06.069\ntell it off because what happens\nis it drains your battery out,\n\n234\n00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:08.790\neven if your devices are connected and\nthey're not communicating.\n\n235\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:09.890\nAnd why is that?\n\n236\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.870\nWell they actually, believe it or not,\n\n237\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.380\nprior to Bluetooth 4.0, 3.0 and\nbeyond, but definitely with 4.0.\n\n238\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.750\nYour devices would have to go\nthrough a re-pairing process.\n\n239\n00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.783\nSo what I mean by re-pairing\nis not a broken connection.\n\n240\n00:13:25.783 --> 00:13:29.242\nBut even though they had already\nentered into that trust relationship in\n\n241\n00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:32.980\nthe pairing process, periodically,\nthey had to redo that again.\n\n242\n00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.430\nWell, that takes power,\n\n243\n00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.990\nright, it takes CPU cycles in\norder to go through that process.\n\n244\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.820\nAny time you talk about CPU cycles,\nyou talk about more power.\n\n245\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.800\nSo, it's very power hungry.\n\n246\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.500\nSo what's known as Bluetooth with LE.\n\n247\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.880\nYou might see Bluetooth WLE,\nthat's with low energy.\n\n248\n00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.440\nOne of the great things about\nthe Bluetooth that we have today\n\n249\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.360\nis the fact that it can pair up with\nthe devices, just like we did prior.\n\n250\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.770\nBut then it can send out signals that\nactually shut those devices down.\n\n251\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.125\nNow in the past, if I shut a device down\nthat was paired with a Bluetooth device\n\n252\n00:14:12.125 --> 00:14:15.620\nand I shut both of those devices down and\nI turned them back on.\n\n253\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.208\nWell, they'd have to go through the\npairing process and reconnect and, again,\n\n254\n00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:20.560\nmore energy.\n\n255\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.610\nWe didn't really see it, it's not\na lot of time that it would take, but\n\n256\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.300\nit's more energy.\n\n257\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.371\nSo it's definitely costing\nyou on your battery life.\n\n258\n00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:32.760\nWell, with Bluetooth 4.0 and beyond,\nor the newer modern Bluetooth,\n\n259\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.530\nwhat it can do is it can actually have\nlike a central type nerve device.\n\n260\n00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:40.500\nThat host device that's controlling the\nother seven devices that it's connecting.\n\n261\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.650\nIt sends signals out,\nshut those devices down.\n\n262\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.130\nAnd when it turns those devices back on,\nthey're already paired up.\n\n263\n00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.160\nIt doesn't have to go\nthrough that process again.\n\n264\n00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.536\nAnd then the other thing,\nwhen they say low energy,\n\n265\n00:14:52.536 --> 00:14:56.169\nwhat they mean is that the batteries in\nthose devices that are using Bluetooth.\n\n266\n00:14:56.169 --> 00:15:00.387\nIt could be really a battery that's\nless than the size of a dime and\n\n267\n00:15:00.387 --> 00:15:02.810\nthe battery can last for ten years.\n\n268\n00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.240\nIn fact I've heard some articles that say,\nCherokee,\n\n269\n00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.150\nthe battery will outlast\nthe devices that they're in.\n\n270\n00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.070\nSo, yeah, so that's a really good thing.\n\n271\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.010\nWhen you say ten years on a battery,\n\n272\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.820\nI mean we look at the little\nthe CMOS batteries.\n\n273\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.950\nWhat are they the 2032 three volt\nbatteries I believe they are.\n\n274\n00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.050\nThey tell you those get three year lives.\n\n275\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.485\nNow some of you are probably saying I've\nnever changed a CMOS battery in my life\n\n276\n00:15:27.485 --> 00:15:29.317\nand I bought my computer eight years ago.\n\n277\n00:15:29.317 --> 00:15:30.771\nYou're lucky [LAUGH].\n\n278\n00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:34.298\nBecause typically in an Enterprise\nenvironment, we don't leave that chance.\n\n279\n00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:38.494\nEvery three years we change those\nbatteries, cause they're just a typical\n\n280\n00:15:38.494 --> 00:15:42.242\nwatch battery, they don't have\na longevity of life, if you will.\n\n281\n00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.357\n&gt;&gt; An ounce of prevention.\n\n282\n00:15:44.357 --> 00:15:47.064\nWhat is it, an ounce of preparation?\n\n283\n00:15:47.064 --> 00:15:48.433\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, I'm not sure.\n\n284\n00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:53.292\nJust make sure that you definitely pay\nattention to what the Bluetooth standard\n\n285\n00:15:53.292 --> 00:15:55.920\nis that you're implementing.\n\n286\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.730\nNow, I did mention kind of the what\nthe earlier Bluetooth's really good for.\n\n287\n00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.085\nWhat you're gonna see more and more\ntoday with the newer Bluetooth is IoT,\n\n288\n00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:08.549\nsince we have the expansion\nof the internet of things.\n\n289\n00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:13.022\nIt is perfect to put one of these little\nBluetooth receivers on that small board\n\n290\n00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:15.271\nwith very little power requirements.\n\n291\n00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:18.010\nBecause Internet of Things\nare typically small devices, and\n\n292\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.600\na lot of times they have things\nlike ARM based processors.\n\n293\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.130\nWhich in an advanced risk machine,\nas ARM stands for,\n\n294\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.571\nthey're known for\nbeing low-powered processors.\n\n295\n00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:33.947\nSo you stick a low-powered wireless\ncommunication, unbounded communication,\n\n296\n00:16:33.947 --> 00:16:35.142\non that board as well.\n\n297\n00:16:35.142 --> 00:16:37.855\nAnd now you have something that's\nvery economically feasible and\n\n298\n00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:39.800\ntypically can keep\nmanufacturing costs down.\n\n299\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:47.880\nAnd that's one of the many reasons IOTI is\nblowing up today, as far as popularity.\n\n300\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.828\nDo wanna mention some of the speeds here.\n\n301\n00:16:50.828 --> 00:16:55.812\nThe older Bluetooth\nstandard would be 760k.\n\n302\n00:16:55.812 --> 00:16:57.350\nThere was actually a one meg total.\n\n303\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.795\nIt was 760k data, and\nthen a 232 kilobyte voice channel but\n\n304\n00:17:02.795 --> 00:17:06.667\nit doesn't take a lot of bandwidth for\nvoice.\n\n305\n00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:12.730\nEDR, when it comes to 2.0,\nwe're talking about 2.1 megs.\n\n306\n00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.598\nWe look at EDR 2.1, we have three megs.\n\n307\n00:17:15.598 --> 00:17:20.785\nAnd then, with high speed, 3.0,\nwe're talking 24-meg transfer speed.\n\n308\n00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:23.614\nSo you can see that\nthey've definitely come\n\n309\n00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:27.059\na long way from the earlier\nbandwidth of just one meg.\n\n310\n00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.640\nWhen really your data\nwas only going at 768K.\n\n311\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.868\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe Bluetooth standard.\n\n312\n00:17:34.868 --> 00:17:38.416\nThere are other ones, this one for\ninstance SIGb, I just threw in here for\n\n313\n00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:38.939\nyou guys.\n\n314\n00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:41.962\nBecause it's popular\ntechnology that's out there.\n\n315\n00:17:41.962 --> 00:17:45.003\nEspecially when we have things like\nsmart technologies that are doing home\n\n316\n00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:46.300\nautomation.\n\n317\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.692\nZigBee, I'm' not sure if it'll show\nup on the exam or your standards.\n\n318\n00:17:49.692 --> 00:17:54.592\nBut I do want you to\nknow that it is 802.15.4.\n\n319\n00:17:54.592 --> 00:17:59.311\nAnd you can see one, two, three and\nfour are all of these obviously\n\n320\n00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:03.870\nwireless personal area network\ncommunication technologies.\n\n321\n00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.230\nBut they're really centered towards\nthings like home automation if you will.\n\n322\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.850\nYeah, home automation, medical devices,\n\n323\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:17.770\ndata collection, things like this,\nit makes them very, very handy.\n\n324\n00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.250\nA couple of other technologies\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n325\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.410\nOne that's been around for\na very long time and\n\n326\n00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.060\ndoesn't seem like it's gonna be going\nanywhere anytime soon and that's IR.\n\n327\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.090\nSome of you guys might recognize them,\nthat's Infrared.\n\n328\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:34.804\nInfrared is a wireless, very finicky\nline of sight communication that\n\n329\n00:18:34.804 --> 00:18:39.615\nis overseen by\nthe Infrared Data Association, the IRDA.\n\n330\n00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:42.095\nAnd there are different standards here.\n\n331\n00:18:42.095 --> 00:18:44.772\nLet's talk a little bit about\nthe communication though,\n\n332\n00:18:44.772 --> 00:18:46.200\nbecause it is very sensitive.\n\n333\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.582\nEven things like, and I'm not picking on\nsmokers out there, I smoked for 20 years.\n\n334\n00:18:49.582 --> 00:18:54.020\nBut even something as simple as cigarette\nsmoke in between the receiver and\n\n335\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.663\nthe transmitter.\n\n336\n00:18:55.663 --> 00:18:56.537\n&gt;&gt; Bay windows.\n\n337\n00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:58.335\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nbright sunlight, right.\n\n338\n00:18:58.335 --> 00:19:01.532\nBecause if you think of infrared, if you\nlook at the electromagnetic spectrum,\n\n339\n00:19:01.532 --> 00:19:03.090\nit sits just outside of visible light.\n\n340\n00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.410\nSo any bright light\ncould really affect it.\n\n341\n00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.462\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n342\n00:19:07.462 --> 00:19:10.890\nAgain, very, very close when we\ntalk about transmission range.\n\n343\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.210\nThe actual standard is\naround one meter but\n\n344\n00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.730\nthen depends on how\nyou're implementing it.\n\n345\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.435\nYou do have things like low power\nto low power implementations,\n\n346\n00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:20.450\nthat can take it down to 0.2 meters.\n\n347\n00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:25.000\nYou do have standard to low power which\ncan be 0.3 meters when you talk about your\n\n348\n00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.060\nactive functional ranges.\n\n349\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.100\nOverall, just typically think\nof one meter, ten feet,\n\n350\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.180\nI think you'll be doing good for the exam.\n\n351\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.739\nOne meter is 3.28 feet, let me get\nthat right, sorry about that guys.\n\n352\n00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:40.480\nJust under four feet, make sure I'm\ngetting my conversion, my numbers right.\n\n353\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.873\n[LAUGH] The other technology is,\n\n354\n00:19:42.873 --> 00:19:47.049\nlet me tell you a little bit\nabout ZigBee technologies.\n\n355\n00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:47.883\nThere are two.\n\n356\n00:19:47.883 --> 00:19:50.907\nThere are some other things that\nI kinda wanna throw out there and\n\n357\n00:19:50.907 --> 00:19:52.654\nmake sure that we cover here for you.\n\n358\n00:19:52.654 --> 00:19:56.997\nAgain, a 2.4GHZ channel or GHz spectrum.\n\n359\n00:19:56.997 --> 00:20:00.996\nIf we talk about the 2.4 GHz spectrum\nthis is the ISM band, the industrial,\n\n360\n00:20:00.996 --> 00:20:02.700\nscientific, and medical band.\n\n361\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.700\nThat is the unlicensed band that you\nhave so many other things in today.\n\n362\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.621\nSo you do have to worry about things\nlike interference with these devices\n\n363\n00:20:11.621 --> 00:20:15.670\nbecause Bluetooth also\noperates in that spectrum.\n\n364\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.100\nYour 802.11 devices also\noperate in that spectrum.\n\n365\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.220\nAnd let me be more specific about that.\n\n366\n00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.198\nYour b, g, and n devices do.\n\n367\n00:20:25.198 --> 00:20:30.453\nAC, on the other hand,\noperates in the five gigahertz spectrum.\n\n368\n00:20:30.453 --> 00:20:35.699\nSo we don't really have to worry about\nthat too much when we talk about 802.11AC.\n\n369\n00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:41.882\nAll right, and 16 channels,\n250 kilobit transfer speeds and\n\n370\n00:20:41.882 --> 00:20:46.884\nup to 100 meters in range for\nZigBee technologies.\n\n371\n00:20:46.884 --> 00:20:49.885\nAll right, so\nthe last one I wanna talk about in this,\n\n372\n00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:53.505\nwireless personal area network\ncommunications, that is NFC.\n\n373\n00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:57.369\nThat's near field communication.\n\n374\n00:20:57.369 --> 00:21:00.615\nI went ahead and just figured that this\nwould be a good wireless personal area\n\n375\n00:21:00.615 --> 00:21:01.740\nnetwork communication.\n\n376\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.390\nBecause near field communication, well,\n\n377\n00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.621\nfirst of all it's an OSI\nlayered two specification.\n\n378\n00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:11.420\nAnd it's our specification for\npeer to peer communications.\n\n379\n00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.940\nFor instance,\nif I have a file on my mobile device.\n\n380\n00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.842\nI have NFC, I could configure things like\nNFC tags and I could put it on a printer.\n\n381\n00:21:19.842 --> 00:21:23.389\nOf if the printer already had\nits NFC radio built into it.\n\n382\n00:21:23.389 --> 00:21:25.554\nWhere I could take my phone and\nI could the touch the printer.\n\n383\n00:21:25.554 --> 00:21:30.418\nAnd it transfers that over a peer\nto peer communication from\n\n384\n00:21:30.418 --> 00:21:32.566\nmy device to the printer.\n\n385\n00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:34.811\nSo NFC, let's see here,\n\n386\n00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:40.129\nI don't really think we have to\nknow too much more about that.\n\n387\n00:21:40.129 --> 00:21:43.972\nNFC does use the link\nlayer control protocol.\n\n388\n00:21:43.972 --> 00:21:46.870\nI might mention that, the logical link.\n\n389\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.580\nExcuse me, let me get that acronym right.\n\n390\n00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.198\nLogical Link Control Protocol,\nbecause there's an LLMN, and\n\n391\n00:21:52.198 --> 00:21:56.826\nthat's Link Local Multicace Name\nresolution, so different technology there.\n\n392\n00:21:56.826 --> 00:22:00.178\nLogical link control protocol, [LAUGH] and\n\n393\n00:22:00.178 --> 00:22:05.681\nthat's actually pretty much based\noff of what we know as 802.2.\n\n394\n00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:12.710\nThe MAC sub layer of actually the logical\nlink control of the data link layer.\n\n395\n00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can never really remember,\nlooking at this list,\n\n396\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.850\nif it was actually on the objectives or\nnot.\n\n397\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.469\nBut when I would teach this,\nI would always put it on there as well.\n\n398\n00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:25.157\nBecause it's one of those newer,\nmore emerging technologies.\n\n399\n00:22:25.157 --> 00:22:28.840\nAnd we're seeing it with all of our\nwallet-less payment systems and\n\n400\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.500\ndifferent options out there.\n\n401\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.850\nSo I don't think that\none's going away either.\n\n402\n00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.400\nSo NFC's a good one to know.\n\n403\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.990\n&gt;&gt; It really is, and we'll probably\nsee a lot more applications for it.\n\n404\n00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.380\nThat's one of the ones that I can\nthink of off the top of my head.\n\n405\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.738\nIn fact, our building manager here,\none of the things he did\n\n406\n00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:49.380\nis he used to set up NFC tags that\nwould do profiles for his phone.\n\n407\n00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, when he would go to\n\n408\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.185\nhis home, right?\n\n409\n00:22:51.185 --> 00:22:52.210\nHe's in a home environment.\n\n410\n00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.666\nHe didn't have to worry about music,\nthe volume and everything.\n\n411\n00:22:55.666 --> 00:22:56.750\n&gt;&gt; I had those before.\n\n412\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.044\n&gt;&gt; And\nhe would touch it to the NFC tag and\n\n413\n00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.728\nit would configure a profile on his phone.\n\n414\n00:23:01.728 --> 00:23:04.250\nSo there are a lot of different\napplications that you can use for it.\n\n415\n00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.994\nI will make mention, there was a mention\nin our chatroom, a very good thing.\n\n416\n00:23:08.994 --> 00:23:10.850\nWell it's not a good thing,\nI'm glad they mentioned it though.\n\n417\n00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:12.918\nIs that we do have to watch with ZigBee.\n\n418\n00:23:12.918 --> 00:23:14.889\nZigBee is an unsecured protocol.\n\n419\n00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:17.374\nAnd if you've got a lot of\nhome automation devices.\n\n420\n00:23:17.374 --> 00:23:20.241\nThe last thing you want is\nsomebody getting in there and\n\n421\n00:23:20.241 --> 00:23:21.995\nturning your blinds up and down.\n\n422\n00:23:21.995 --> 00:23:25.428\nTurning your lights on and off,\n[LAUGH] if you've been attacked.\n\n423\n00:23:25.428 --> 00:23:28.928\nSo please do keep that in mind.\n\n424\n00:23:28.928 --> 00:23:32.474\nNow, the next thing that we're gonna talk\n\n425\n00:23:32.474 --> 00:23:36.524\nabout is an interesting concept,\nI have to say.\n\n426\n00:23:36.524 --> 00:23:40.579\nBecause this is a large infrastructure.\n\n427\n00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:46.808\nThey call it out, it's got an ICS,\nInformation Control Systems, if you will.\n\n428\n00:23:46.808 --> 00:23:52.160\nOr SCADA, being the Supervisory Control\nand Data Acquisition.\n\n429\n00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.569\nVery crazy, crazy acronym there.\n\n430\n00:23:55.569 --> 00:23:57.750\nBut these are necessary systems.\n\n431\n00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.204\nAnd being large systems,\nit's not uncommon that you might work in\n\n432\n00:24:02.204 --> 00:24:05.953\nthe field with them, so\nit is good to know what they are.\n\n433\n00:24:05.953 --> 00:24:08.565\n&gt;&gt; Like we were just talking about,\nbefore we started the show,\n\n434\n00:24:08.565 --> 00:24:10.685\ntalking about The Kennedy Space Center,\nright?\n\n435\n00:24:10.685 --> 00:24:11.961\nAnd I don't know why, but\n\n436\n00:24:11.961 --> 00:24:15.510\nNASA always comes to mind when I'm\nthinking about these SCADA systems.\n\n437\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.610\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, water treatment facilities,\nfor instance, nuclear power plants,\n\n438\n00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.650\nany time you have a series of\nsensors that you need to control,\n\n439\n00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:23.700\nyou need some kind of system.\n\n440\n00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.300\nYou need to not only be able to control\nthat, you need to be able to monitor it,\n\n441\n00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.860\nbut how do we monitor things?\n\n442\n00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.050\nTypically through system logs and\ndynamic reports, right?\n\n443\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.950\nSo we need to be able to acquiesce that\ndata I guess, so it would be the way,\n\n444\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:36.770\nit's acquisition.\n\n445\n00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.870\nWe need to be able to collect\nthat into a central location.\n\n446\n00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.620\nSo let's go ahead and let's look at some\nof the components that are in here, and\n\n447\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.740\nI'll kind of walk you through\nwhat these are, all right?\n\n448\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.480\nThese are essential components\nof any SCADA system, right?\n\n449\n00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.690\nLet's start with the basics.\n\n450\n00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:50.780\nYou're in network+, why?\n\n451\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.960\nWell, network communications,\nnetwork+ is important,\n\n452\n00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.390\nright, when we talk about networks.\n\n453\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.750\nWell, that is the foundation for a SCADA\nsystem, is network communications, right?\n\n454\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.227\nThese can be your typical\nnetworks that you have and\n\n455\n00:25:02.227 --> 00:25:04.598\nyou see every day within\nyour LAN environments.\n\n456\n00:25:04.598 --> 00:25:09.139\nIf you end up having a SCADA system that\nspans multiple geographical locations,\n\n457\n00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:13.430\nthen you very well could be mixing WAN\ntechnologies with LAN technologies.\n\n458\n00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.480\nSome of them that you implement within\nyour own company and you maintain and\n\n459\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.240\ncontrol, portions of it could go\nacross an ISPs network or even more,\n\n460\n00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.430\nyou could have SCADA systems now\nwith the cloud beating out there\n\n461\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.250\nthat are maintained by cloud providers.\n\n462\n00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.480\nSo you have your network communications,\n\n463\n00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.270\nnow, how do I interact with\none of these SCADA systems?\n\n464\n00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.780\nWell, that's where the HMI comes in.\n\n465\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.060\nIt's just a human interface, right.\n\n466\n00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.100\nWe need to have one of those in order to\nbe able to communicate with these devices.\n\n467\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.080\nNow, we've got a couple\nof other things here.\n\n468\n00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.740\nWe've got the supervisory system and\n\n469\n00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.560\nthe supervisory system is, need to be\nable to find out this information, right.\n\n470\n00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:58.380\nI need somebody maybe on site to look at a\nspecific component within my SCADA system.\n\n471\n00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.280\nI need that human interface, right,\n\n472\n00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.240\nI need a way that I can communicate\nwith maybe just a specific system.\n\n473\n00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.200\nBut overall, standing back and not\nlooking and focusing on micromisms, but\n\n474\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.140\nthe macro, right,\nthe macromism of the whole thing,\n\n475\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.030\nI need a way that I can basically\noversee all the operations collectively.\n\n476\n00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.510\nGain that information, then even\nimplement things like controls too.\n\n477\n00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.180\nSo how do we control the system?\n\n478\n00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.410\nAnd that's where these two left and\nright here, RTU and PLCs come into play.\n\n479\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.660\nRTU is a remote terminal unit also\ncalled a remote telemetry unit,\n\n480\n00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.720\nright, measuring different statistics and\nstuff like that.\n\n481\n00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.570\nAnd then we need a way in which\nwe can have somebody that can\n\n482\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.640\nactually send commands.\n\n483\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.276\nWe've got these, what are known, PLC,\nprogrammable logic controllers as well.\n\n484\n00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:54.120\nAnd with the PLCs, keep in mind,\ntheir input-output controllers,\n\n485\n00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.910\nthey're connected directly to\nthe sensors or the field instruments and\n\n486\n00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.270\nthey output information too.\n\n487\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.980\nThey can do things like output information\nof the remote telemetry units as well.\n\n488\n00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.310\nSo, let's go ahead and\nkind of put this into perspective.\n\n489\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.780\nAnd what we mean is, for instance,\nremotes, think of remote, right?\n\n490\n00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.910\nI got remote site, I have a remote\ntelemetry unit or terminal unit as they\n\n491\n00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:20.690\nmight call it hooked to a series of\nsensors, maybe temperature, maybe pressure\n\n492\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:25.860\nif you will, maybe a quantity of liquid\nwhether it's fuel or something like that.\n\n493\n00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.600\nAnd it reports wirelessly if you will,\nto a radio tower that\n\n494\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.620\nthen communicates with the internet and\nhit your network communications, right.\n\n495\n00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.600\nJust think of any network\ncommunications that you use.\n\n496\n00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.220\nBut then you have your PLCs, right.\n\n497\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.350\nYour program logical controllers\ninput-output systems that\n\n498\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.130\ncan actually make,\ncan control the different components.\n\n499\n00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:50.050\nWhy maybe its industrial, maybe it's for\ninstance, you have camera systems, right,\n\n500\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.660\nwhere you need to view cameras.\n\n501\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.810\nSo basically, what people can do\nis with the programming interface,\n\n502\n00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.640\nthey can interact with these PLCs, and\n\n503\n00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.020\neven the remote telemetry units too and\nwe get that interaction.\n\n504\n00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:06.710\nNow, remember we said the HMIs, right,\nwe mean our human interface there and\n\n505\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.980\nwe'll have those, too.\n\n506\n00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.090\nAnd then, finally, we'll have some kind of\nsupervisory system where we're collecting\n\n507\n00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.910\nall these information.\n\n508\n00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:18.630\nAnd then, we might have a team to probably\ndo have a team that's gonna oversee this\n\n509\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.460\ninformation, maybe make decisions as\nto who's gonna implement changes.\n\n510\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:29.408\nSo, that's gonna be all part of whatever\nyour company's infrastructure is.\n\n511\n00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:33.940\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, looking at all these moving\ncomponents that we have here, with\n\n512\n00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:39.420\nthe PLCs, and just all the interworking\nelements here, how important is security?\n\n513\n00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.160\nI mean if one of those PLCs was\ncompromised remotely and it just kind of\n\n514\n00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.280\nmakes you think in a whole new\nrealm with all our automation.\n\n515\n00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.370\n&gt;&gt; That is a great statement.\n\n516\n00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.230\nWhen we talk about people, and\nwe talk about things like you'll\n\n517\n00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.700\nhear all the time, terrorist attacks, what\ndo you think they're trying to attack?\n\n518\n00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.590\nThey're trying to attack\nthese SCADA systems,\n\n519\n00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:03.725\nbecause they can make decisions on\nnuclear power plant facilities.\n\n520\n00:29:03.725 --> 00:29:08.010\nThey're great example,\nwater treatment plants, right?\n\n521\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.900\nSo this is what they're\nactually trying to attack.\n\n522\n00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.220\nSo security is of the utmost\nimportance on any system,\n\n523\n00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.310\nbut especially systems like that,\nwhere really control and govern access and\n\n524\n00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.030\ncontrol things like our large\nindustrial systems out there.\n\n525\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.110\nAll right,\nwell that takes us pretty much to one last\n\n526\n00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:30.320\ntopic that I wanna mention here real quick\nand we really gotta talk about that.\n\n527\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.942\nAnd that's something known as medianets.\n\n528\n00:29:31.942 --> 00:29:36.260\nNow, I wish I had a fancy diagram for\na medianet, but unfortunately, I do not.\n\n529\n00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.500\nThey call out a couple of things like VTC,\nvideo teleconferencing,\n\n530\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.040\nyou know these are optimized,\nthese that works are highly optimized.\n\n531\n00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.189\nThey have the protocols for transporting\nthings like video and audio and\n\n532\n00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:49.108\nthat's becoming more and more important.\n\n533\n00:29:49.108 --> 00:29:52.507\nIn fact, you guys watching right now and\nare trying to study for\n\n534\n00:29:52.507 --> 00:29:56.015\nthis exam know how important it\nis to get video to your network.\n\n535\n00:29:56.015 --> 00:30:01.510\nWell, imagine a portion of your\nnetwork that really is structurally\n\n536\n00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.720\nimplemented and optimized for just that.\n\n537\n00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.790\nYou can see things like\nreal-time communications.\n\n538\n00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.040\nWe can't have things\nlike jitter in our lines.\n\n539\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.970\nWe can't have stuttering in our videos.\n\n540\n00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.300\nSo these are protocols or components\nthat implement things like quality of\n\n541\n00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.730\nservice to ensure a certain bandwidth or\na certain type of communication.\n\n542\n00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:24.981\nYou'll see that some of\nthe protocols that are used with\n\n543\n00:30:24.981 --> 00:30:28.426\nvideo teleconferencing, if I can say that.\n\n544\n00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:33.861\nH232, for instance,\nyou'll see H, I say 232,\n\n545\n00:30:33.861 --> 00:30:37.922\nI meant 323, let's get that around.\n\n546\n00:30:37.922 --> 00:30:43.318\nH2.64 is another one SIP, Session\nInitiation Protocol, that is used inside\n\n547\n00:30:43.318 --> 00:30:48.540\nof voice over IP communications,\nis also used in technologies like this.\n\n548\n00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.690\nYou have a couple of different\ntypes of medianets, for instance,\n\n549\n00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.040\nyou have what are known as dedicated,\n\n550\n00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.510\nwhere all the components\nare packaged into a single device.\n\n551\n00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.797\nYou do have desktop-based video\nteleconferencing systems,\n\n552\n00:30:59.797 --> 00:31:04.075\nwhere it's just a piece of software that's\nrunning on my machine that allows me to\n\n553\n00:31:04.075 --> 00:31:08.105\nuse my webcam on my laptop to connect to\nthe overall network in order to do video\n\n554\n00:31:08.105 --> 00:31:09.233\nteleconferencing.\n\n555\n00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:13.264\nFor instance, I worked with this one\ncompany that used what was known as a life\n\n556\n00:31:13.264 --> 00:31:17.048\nsize high definition conferencing system,\nwhere the camera itself was\n\n557\n00:31:17.048 --> 00:31:21.826\nlike $40,000 and it used its own dedicated\nproprietary communication system, but\n\n558\n00:31:21.826 --> 00:31:25.550\nessentially it just connected\nright to our ethernet based LAN.\n\n559\n00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.640\nHowever, I will tell you that\nthat was a dedicated system.\n\n560\n00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.060\nThe whole proprietary nature of\neverything in that was all built-in so\n\n561\n00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.890\nyou would buy their system and\nthen they would provide you access and\n\n562\n00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.190\nthey give you an example\nof the desktop-base.\n\n563\n00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.707\nYou could also piggy back off that and you\ncould connect to that system with a piece\n\n564\n00:31:44.707 --> 00:31:48.222\nof software that was running on a PC that\ndidn't require you to have the dedicated\n\n565\n00:31:48.222 --> 00:31:50.770\nsystem, if you didn't happen\nto be in that building.\n\n566\n00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.330\n&gt;&gt; And something even\nprobably a little more common\n\n567\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.908\nwould be like a gaming console device\nconnecting to the PlayStation Networks.\n\n568\n00:31:57.908 --> 00:32:01.899\nAnd also you mentioned a media network,\nhave you even seen,\n\n569\n00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:06.046\nyou've been to conferences and\nCS shows and things like that,\n\n570\n00:32:06.046 --> 00:32:10.442\nbuildings that are housing these\nevents all the time Even higher.\n\n571\n00:32:10.442 --> 00:32:14.529\nIt had people on staff, all those network\nengineers, to make sure that they can\n\n572\n00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:18.230\nhandle all the different guests and\nthe vendors at these events, so.\n\n573\n00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.780\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\ncuz there's a lot of bandwidth.\n\n574\n00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.620\nAnd that's one thing to keep in mind is\nwhen we talk about real time traffic,\n\n575\n00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.590\nwe're not talking about\nthe traditional traffic.\n\n576\n00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:29.570\nLike for instance, if I'm doing a file\ntransfer for an TP server, right.\n\n577\n00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.680\nMy file transfer, it can handle\na little bit of packet delay, right,\n\n578\n00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.930\nit just takes longer, right.\n\n579\n00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.740\nYou're like, gosh, that progress\nbar is gonna take forever, right.\n\n580\n00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.590\nBut what it can't do really good\nwith is packet lost, right.\n\n581\n00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.930\nWhy?\nBecause that causes file\n\n582\n00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.670\ncorruption, right.\n\n583\n00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:46.260\nI can't transfer a file and think that I'm\ngonna maintain the integrity of the file\n\n584\n00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.890\nif I drop a few packets\nthat make up that file.\n\n585\n00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.330\nHowever, it's a little bit different\nwhen you talk about realtime streaming\n\n586\n00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:54.880\ntype data.\n\n587\n00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.830\nData that needs real time delivery,\nit can handle a little bit of packet loss,\n\n588\n00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.040\nbut what it can't handle is the delay.\n\n589\n00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.100\nSo if I'm talking to somebody\n\n590\n00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.642\nin a video conference I don't want them\nregrabbing my transmission later and\n\n591\n00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:13.740\nrebuilding it and we step back a couple\nof seconds in the conversation\n\n592\n00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.050\nwhile everybody else moves forward,\nbecause their packets didn't get dropped.\n\n593\n00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.070\nSo that is one thing to keep in mind,\nis that real time delivery can\n\n594\n00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:27.510\nusually handle a moderate amount of packet\nloss but what it can't handle is delay.\n\n595\n00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.070\nOlder traditional technologies,\nlike something like FTP,\n\n596\n00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.690\nthat can handle a moderate amount,\nor a lot of delay really, but\n\n597\n00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.620\nwhat they can't handle is packet loss.\n\n598\n00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.280\nSo it is different, we call them\nconverged networks today, right?\n\n599\n00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.640\nAlmost every network that we have in\nplace today is a converged network,\n\n600\n00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.020\ncuz it's converging the three\nmajor communications types, right?\n\n601\n00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.110\nVoice, data, and video.\n\n602\n00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.360\nSo know a little bit\nabout your media nets,\n\n603\n00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.410\nknow about SIP,\nSession Initiation Protocol.\n\n604\n00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:02.490\nWe mentioned examples of like H323,\nH320, but I really wanna know, I\n\n605\n00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:07.940\nreally want you to know the main one here\nas far as media, that's just remembering\n\n606\n00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.800\nyour session initiation protocol just\nin case they ask you on the exam.\n\n607\n00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.900\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I think that does bring\nus to this second portion\n\n608\n00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.170\nof our Network Infrastructure\nImplementation Episodes.\n\n609\n00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.880\nSo, in the first episode we're kinda\nlook in more why they're in network\n\n610\n00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.540\ntechnologies, but\nyou did cover all the different ends.\n\n611\n00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:30.070\nAnd then in this show, we focus on\na lot of short range communications.\n\n612\n00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:34.020\nAnd then you also really explained\nhow Scotty systems works.\n\n613\n00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.720\nSo, thank you for doing that for\nus today and thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n614\n00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.130\nWe do have more network\n+ headed your ways.\n\n615\n00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.810\nSo stay tune, but for\nthis show, we'll wrap up.\n\n616\n00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.666\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n617\n00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:45.233\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n618\n00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:47.363\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n619\n00:34:47.363 --> 00:34:55.874\n[MUSIC]\n\n620\n00:34:55.874 --> 00:34:58.864\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV\n\n",

00:00:08.215\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.836\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:11.962\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.814\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.740\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPROTV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.096\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, we're back with more on our net\n\n9\n00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:24.363\nplus series from CompTIA and\nof course joining us in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:28.077\nit would be like a day without sunshine\nif we didn't have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:29.392\nMr. Wes, how's it going today, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:30.490\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.360\nYou raised that bar kind of high,\ndidn't you.\n\n14\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.360\nHopefully, you'll stick around and\nhelp me hold that bar up.\n\n15\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.530\nThat's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's all him.\n\n16\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.166\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.620\n[LAUGH] That's right, guys.\n\n18\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.200\nWe are coming back at you\nwith more of that Net Plus.\n\n19\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.160\nAnd we get to well,\nwhat are we talking about today?\n\n20\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.280\nWe get to talk about addresses.\n\n21\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.203\nAnd one of the most important really\ncomponents within our network that allow\n\n22\n00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:52.505\nus to even communicate with a network so\nthat's what we're gonna be talking about.\n\n23\n00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.160\nWe're gonna be talking about IPv4.\n\n24\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.624\nThe Internet Protocol version 4 and\nIPv6 and\n\n25\n00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:59.909\nwe'll be talking about MAC\naddresses as well and then mixed in\n\n26\n00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.350\nthere a little bit in here will be things\nlike your different communication types.\n\n27\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.145\nAnd then we'll probably end this little\nmini series that we're gonna create here\n\n28\n00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:09.029\nwith subnetting.\n\n29\n00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:13.718\nSo you guys will be hopefully wiser when\nit comes to the ways of taking a larger\n\n30\n00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:17.100\nnetwork and\ndividing it into multiple smaller ones.\n\n31\n00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.994\nBut so that being said, let's go ahead and\nlet's kick it off with IPv4.\n\n32\n00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:25.090\nLet's talk about, well,\nthe Internet protocol, IP in general.\n\n33\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.810\nWell, whether you're talking about 4 or\nyou're talking about 6 we're talking about\n\n34\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.970\nthe identifier that allows us to\ncommunication a TCP/IP based networks.\n\n35\n00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.320\nSee, IPs, IP addresses if you will,\n\n36\n00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.940\nI want you to think about your\ncell phone number that you have.\n\n37\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.950\nOr any number that you have to dial,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.110\nIn order to communicate across\nthe telephone based network\n\n39\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.710\nI have to have a telephone number, right?\n\n40\n00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.442\nI have to know the endpoints telephone\nnumber in order to make a call.\n\n41\n00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.546\nAnd likewise if somebody's gonna call me,\nthey have to know,\n\n42\n00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.258\nwe always say those digits to dial in\norder to send a communication my way.\n\n43\n00:01:57.258 --> 00:02:01.770\nWell, in TCP/IP based network,\nwe use what are known as IP addresses.\n\n44\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.936\nIn order to, one, identify networks and\nidentify the nodes of the networks too.\n\n45\n00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:10.705\nSo when it comes to TCP/IP\nthe protocol stack,\n\n46\n00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:14.180\nhow do we get information\nbetween source and destination?\n\n47\n00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.700\nWell, one of the key tickets there\nis going to be that IP address.\n\n48\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.223\nSo, let's talk a little bit about\nthe structure of an IP address, and\n\n49\n00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:22.610\nsee what that means for us.\n\n50\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.690\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here.\n\n51\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.020\nI wanna kind of break this down.\n\n52\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.680\nWe're gonna do this\na couple different ways.\n\n53\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.490\nI want you think of an IP address\nas having two components ,much\n\n54\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.350\nlike a street name does.\n\n55\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.460\nIf you look at a street address,\nexcuse me,\n\n56\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.780\na street address is typically\nmade up of two components, right.\n\n57\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.036\nWe have what's known as a house number,\nand we have what's known as a street name.\n\n58\n00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:48.390\nInside of IP addresses,\nyou have two components.\n\n59\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.579\nYou have what's known as a, and\nwe're gonnao kind of reverse the order so\n\n60\n00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.697\nyou can see where they're\nkind of comparative.\n\n61\n00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:57.871\nWe have what's known as a network ID,\nand we have what's known as a node ID,\n\n62\n00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:59.977\nwhich kind of looks like the house ID.\n\n63\n00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:04.751\nAnd let's go ahead and let's use some kind\nof addressing structure that maybe, well,\n\n64\n00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.961\nlike house numbers and street names\nyou're a little bit more familiar with.\n\n65\n00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:13.234\nSo if we have a network, all right,\nand we have to deliver traffic to that\n\n66\n00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:18.016\nnetwork I want you to think about nodes as\nmore as like being houses on the street.\n\n67\n00:03:18.016 --> 00:03:21.597\nI want you to think about the network as\nbeing kind of like a street name, right,\n\n68\n00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:24.070\nwe're gonna have,\nwhen we deliver traffic, right?\n\n69\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.900\nWe have an IP address and, again,\nI want you to think just for\n\n70\n00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.830\nnow of that IP address being kinda\nlike a street address, right?\n\n71\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.880\nI've got a series of numbers here for\nthe house, name or the house number, and\n\n72\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.030\nI've got a series of information here for\nthe street name.\n\n73\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.380\nNow, if we take this and we kind of\nlook at it a little bit different,\n\n74\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.440\nsomething that you're gonna,\nlike I said that we see commonly.\n\n75\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.365\nI want you to think of it more\nof something like this, right.\n\n76\n00:03:49.365 --> 00:03:52.272\nIf you're going to be delivered a package,\nright,\n\n77\n00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:56.790\nI want you to think of a mail carrier\ndelivering a package to your street.\n\n78\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.370\nThere are a few things that that delivery,\nthat mail carrier\n\n79\n00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.570\nneeds to keep in mind in order to get that\ninformation where it needs to go, right?\n\n80\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.300\nThere are a couple of components.\n\n81\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.820\nThere's a little list,\nthat this mail carrier keeps, right?\n\n82\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.550\nAnd when the mail carrier says, okay I\nneed to deliver information to your house\n\n83\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.020\nDan, right, well,\nwhat's the first thing it needs to know?\n\n84\n00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.360\nIt doesn't really cares, at this point,\n\n85\n00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.100\ntoo much about what the house number is,\nright?\n\n86\n00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.292\nBecause I want you to think\nabout that number, 4210.\n\n87\n00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:28.492\nHow many houses in the United States,\ndo you think,\n\n88\n00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:31.047\nhave a number of 4210 on their house?\n\n89\n00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:33.788\nWell, I don't know, honestly,\nbut there's probably quite a few,\n\n90\n00:04:33.788 --> 00:04:35.660\nat least more than one, right?\n\n91\n00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.800\nSo, it isn't that the mail carrier\ndoesn't care about the house.\n\n92\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.240\nBut if they're gonna deliver information\nto Dan's house, first of all,\n\n93\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.760\nwhat do they have to know,\nhow to get to the street, right?\n\n94\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.130\nBecause it is something that groups our\nhouses together, right, is the street.\n\n95\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.800\nWell, just like IP addresses,\nthey're grouped together in a network and\n\n96\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.680\nnodes within a network have\ntheir own identifiers.\n\n97\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.900\nSo not only can I identify the network or\nin this case the street that these houses\n\n98\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.880\nare on, I can also identify the house\nnumbers uniqueness along that street.\n\n99\n00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.150\nNetworks are the same way.\n\n100\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.250\nRight, in a network I have one network\nportion of an address that identifies\n\n101\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.420\nthat all these computers are on the same\nnetwork, and then I have a portion of that\n\n102\n00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.090\naddress that uniquely identifies\nthem much like our house numbers.\n\n103\n00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.300\nNow, when we need to make a decision\non that, I want you to think about it,\n\n104\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.929\nwhat do I make a decision on,\n\n105\n00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:35.050\nhow I know that these houses\nare on the same street, all right.\n\n106\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.860\nDo I use their house number?\n\n107\n00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.960\nNo, I don't use their house number.\n\n108\n00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.410\nIn fact,\nlet me give you another example here.\n\n109\n00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.370\nLet's say that we've got two streets,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.810\nWhat am I gonna look at to find out\nare these three houses on the same street?\n\n111\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.409\nJust like if I have to find out\nare nodes on the same network?\n\n112\n00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.313\nWell, here with our street addresses we\nneed to look at the portion that's unique\n\n113\n00:05:59.313 --> 00:06:02.813\nto them to find out if they're\non the same street, right.\n\n114\n00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:04.640\nAnd I don't need their house numbers.\n\n115\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.010\nThis does me no good, right.\n\n116\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.260\nThat portion of the address\ndoes me absolutely no good.\n\n117\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.440\nBecause I know that there's potentially\na possibility that there's gonna be a 410\n\n118\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.940\nsomewhere out there across the United\nStates that's not unique at all.\n\n119\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.120\nSo when I need a little\nbit more uniqueness, so\n\n120\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.790\nwe go farther than this guy's too, right?\n\n121\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.640\nWe put cities there, we put zip codes to\nmake it more unique across a larger area.\n\n122\n00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.332\nBut we're just looking at the IP address,\n\n123\n00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:29.312\nso we're just looking at\nstreet names now right?\n\n124\n00:06:29.312 --> 00:06:32.410\nI need the street name.\n\n125\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.020\nThat's how I have to figure out\nare these houses on the same street?\n\n126\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.080\nNow if we go back to our IP addresses,\n\n127\n00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.080\nright, I want you to keep thinking\nof street addresses, right?\n\n128\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.820\nThat means that by analogy if there's\na portion of this address that uniquely\n\n129\n00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.260\nidentifies the house or the node\nthere must be a portion of it that\n\n130\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.050\nuniquely identifies these three\ncomputers as being on the same network.\n\n131\n00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.020\nAnd that's what's known\nas the network portion.\n\n132\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.940\nSo that's why I said when you look\nat the way an IP address is built,\n\n133\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.170\nas it's broken up, it's broken\ndown into a couple of portions.\n\n134\n00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.770\nNow, I've reversed the order just for\nconsistency here.\n\n135\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.425\nWe have a street name which is also\nknown for IP addressing as a network ID.\n\n136\n00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:20.208\nThe network ID uniquely\nidentifies multiple, well,\n\n137\n00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:24.430\nit uniquely identifies the network for\none, right?\n\n138\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.189\nI need to know that there's a network\none over a net Network two.\n\n139\n00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.615\nI need to know there's a main\nstreet over a 22nd street.\n\n140\n00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:36.115\nSo the node portion then\nuniquely identifies\n\n141\n00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:39.975\nevery one of the computers\nwithin that network.\n\n142\n00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.278\nJust like a house number\non a street address\n\n143\n00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:47.975\nuniquely identifies each\nindividual house on that street.\n\n144\n00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:49.915\nSo coming back to our analogy here,\n\n145\n00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:54.649\nwhen this mail carrier finally gets to the\nright street, well, we found out the road.\n\n146\n00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:56.202\nWe know where the road is.\n\n147\n00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:59.776\nNow, if I wanna deliver Traffic\nto the right house, what do I do?\n\n148\n00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:02.147\nOr in this case, packages or your mail.\n\n149\n00:08:02.147 --> 00:08:05.440\nWell, then now I gotta look to\nsomething a little bit more specific.\n\n150\n00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.760\nAnd it's specific to that street.\n\n151\n00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.490\nWe're still using the same address.\n\n152\n00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.690\nIt's all used as one portion, but\n\n153\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.670\nnow the mail carrier looks at something\nthat's specific and unique on the street.\n\n154\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.753\nAnd in that case it's the numerical\nvalue [LAUGH] of your house numbers.\n\n155\n00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:19.760\nWell, guess what?\n\n156\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.750\nThat's no different than\nif I'm in a network.\n\n157\n00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.030\nIf I'm in a network,\nonce I've identified that,\n\n158\n00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.680\nhey I know,\nlet me see if I can bring that out here.\n\n159\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.993\nAnd I'll show you guys how we know this,\n\n160\n00:08:30.993 --> 00:08:36.065\nthat I know that the network,\nstreet name is this right here.\n\n161\n00:08:36.065 --> 00:08:41.172\nI can also tell through a process that\nwe'll talk about a little bit later,\n\n162\n00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:45.238\nthat I have unique node portions,\n10.20 and .30.\n\n163\n00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:47.045\nAnd that's something to keep in mind,\n\n164\n00:08:47.045 --> 00:08:49.687\nwe have certain rules in\nnetworks that we have to follow.\n\n165\n00:08:49.687 --> 00:08:53.999\nJust like you have certain rules that if\nyou have an address, a public address that\n\n166\n00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:59.090\nyou're going to be getting mail delivered\nto has to follow some same rules too.\n\n167\n00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.880\nSo think about your street names.\n\n168\n00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.880\nLet's not get picky with duplexes and\n\n169\n00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.640\napartment numbers because then\nit gets all sorts of confusing.\n\n170\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.466\nBut let's just say all we have\nare houses on that street.\n\n171\n00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:15.043\nI cannot have two houses that\nhave the same house number.\n\n172\n00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:20.018\nIf I have two houses on that same\nstreet that have 4210, mail carrier's\n\n173\n00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:23.720\ngonna get to that road and say-\n&gt;&gt; Which one does it go to?\n\n174\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.280\n&gt;&gt; Which one, right?\n\n175\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Because there's two,\nand they're drunk anyway\n\n176\n00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.913\n&gt;&gt; They're not paying attention.\n\n177\n00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:30.950\nSo we get what's known as a conflict.\n\n178\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.270\nThat same problem can manifest itself\nbecause we have rules of addressing\n\n179\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.370\nnodes on a network.\n\n180\n00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.420\nI cannot have two nodes that\nhave the same node ID portion.\n\n181\n00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.000\nThose have to be unique.\n\n182\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.630\nAll right.\nLet's look at some of the rules.\n\n183\n00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.320\nI told you.\n\n184\n00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.880\nYou know what the street rules\nare with your street addresses.\n\n185\n00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.165\nSo what are the rules of IP\naddressing is that every node,\n\n186\n00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:56.540\nif they're gonna be considered\nto be on the same network,\n\n187\n00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.590\nstreets, have to have\nshare that same portion.\n\n188\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.210\nUniquely identified as that\nnetwork portion, that street name.\n\n189\n00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.979\nGot to be identical.\n\n190\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.870\nThe other thing is that for a node to be\non the same network with other nodes it\n\n191\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.200\nhas to have it's own unique number.\n\n192\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.510\nOr identifier if you will.\n\n193\n00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:19.554\nIn street names or street addresses we use\nthe house number as the unique portion for\n\n194\n00:10:19.554 --> 00:10:20.264\nthat street.\n\n195\n00:10:20.264 --> 00:10:23.333\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes I've actually encountered\nthis and you might have as well.\n\n196\n00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:26.167\nWhere you've got a couple\nof windows machine and\n\n197\n00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:29.896\nthey happen to have the same IP\naddress you turn the machine on and\n\n198\n00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:34.990\nits says, there's another machine on\nthis network and the same IP address.\n\n199\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.840\nWe need to get one of this guys.\n\n200\n00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.740\nBut something has to be done,\n\n201\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.170\nbecause this not gonna allow that\nbecause of the whole uniqueness.\n\n202\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.062\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I would say that\nthe former would be what it does, yeah.\n\n203\n00:10:47.062 --> 00:10:51.890\nWindows has got this interesting\nthing that detects an IP conflict,\n\n204\n00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.320\nand it calls out to the network says,\n\n205\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.709\nhey we got another house out\nhere with the same house number.\n\n206\n00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.940\nWindows shuts the entire\nTCP IP protocol stack down.\n\n207\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.290\nIt shuts the whole thing down.\n\n208\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.250\nYou have to go back in there and you have\nto reconfigure it with a non conflicting\n\n209\n00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.780\nIP address before Windows will turn\nit's TCP IP protocol stack back on.\n\n210\n00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.750\nWhich is a great thing because\nit's never a fail safe, but\n\n211\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.140\nat least it's a method that's in place\nto help detect those duplicate IPs.\n\n212\n00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.177\nIf you had somebody out there that's\nchanging numbers on street houses-.\n\n213\n00:11:22.177 --> 00:11:22.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n214\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.194\n&gt;&gt; Or houses, we don't really see\nthat til one, the police show up, or\n\n215\n00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:29.650\ntwo until the mail carrier goes what\nare these numbers are identical.\n\n216\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.210\nSo we do have to worry about that,\n\n217\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:34.990\nremember that a node must be\nunique within its own network.\n\n218\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.940\nAll right now how about if,\nwe can potentially\n\n219\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.130\nhave let me see if I find out what I\ndid with that picture there we go.\n\n220\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.905\nWe could potentially have\nmore than one network.\n\n221\n00:11:46.905 --> 00:11:49.480\nOor in this case, more than one street.\n\n222\n00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.280\nSo, as a recap show you\na side by side two streets.\n\n223\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.510\nThese houses on this street,\n\n224\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.620\nnotice that they all have their\nown unique house numbers.\n\n225\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.160\nThey have their own unique street name.\n\n226\n00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:11.222\nNotice down here, we are apparently\nmissing half a road, there we go.\n\n227\n00:12:11.222 --> 00:12:15.412\n[LAUGH] We also have the same numbers.\n\n228\n00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:17.316\nWell, wait a second,\nwe got a problem here.\n\n229\n00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:23.851\nI've got 410 Or 4210, 4212, 4210, 4212.\n\n230\n00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:25.094\nSo I've got a conflict, right?\n\n231\n00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.750\nJust like Dan was talking about?\n\n232\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.300\nOr do I?\n\n233\n00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.570\nAre they unique?\n&gt;&gt; Not so fast.\n\n234\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n235\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.565\nwe gotta slow down because notice that\nwhile the house names are the same.\n\n236\n00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:37.905\nThe house numbers,\nI should say, are the same.\n\n237\n00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:40.835\nThe street names are different,\nso they're still unique.\n\n238\n00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:45.735\nAnd that's another thing that takes us\nback to the rules of IPv4 addressing.\n\n239\n00:12:45.735 --> 00:12:49.560\nIf you were to, let's see here we go,\nwe got another one here.\n\n240\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.690\nIf I want to know whether two\ncomputers are on different networks,\n\n241\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.100\nlike in the street names.\n\n242\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.870\nThat means that these three\ncomputers share a network\n\n243\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.070\nportion or a network ID, street name.\n\n244\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.550\nBut then if I look at these other\ncomputers, you might notice and\n\n245\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.330\nif you don't, we'll tell you how you can,\n\n246\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.000\nthat they are sharing a completely\ndifferent network ID.\n\n247\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.890\nThink street names.\n\n248\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.650\nSo, while at first glance,\nit might look like we have two\n\n249\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.780\ncomputers that are on the same networks\nindeed they do not they are different.\n\n250\n00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.850\nSo this would be akin to having\ntwo of the different streets.\n\n251\n00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.288\nSo that is something to keep in mind.\n\n252\n00:13:34.288 --> 00:13:38.480\n&gt;&gt; All right Wes, I'm following your\nhouse and your street analogy so far, but\n\n253\n00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.820\nthere seems to be like\na missing piece to this.\n\n254\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.370\nHow do we know exactly what\nportion of the address is for\n\n255\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.900\nthe network, and the other for\nbeing, I guess for the host?\n\n256\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.392\n&gt;&gt; Well, nothing's ever programmed\nit that way, it's magic.\n\n257\n00:13:53.392 --> 00:13:56.710\n&gt;&gt; Voodoo. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; No, just kidding,\nbut there is a method to the madness.\n\n258\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.510\nAnd that's right,\nI've been talking about network names and\n\n259\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.350\nnode portions and network portions,\nmy gosh, how do we figure this out?\n\n260\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.729\nWell, that's where we're\ngonna jump into now.\n\n261\n00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:10.354\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's jump back to my diagram real quick,\n\n262\n00:14:10.354 --> 00:14:12.311\njust before we leave this thought.\n\n263\n00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:18.199\nRemember network IDs, or IP addresses are\ncombination of a node ID and a network ID.\n\n264\n00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.477\nThe question is we looked and\nI said you know what,\n\n265\n00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:28.877\nDan I said all three of those addresses\nI can tell are in the same network.\n\n266\n00:14:28.877 --> 00:14:33.088\nAnd the question is how do we tell?\n\n267\n00:14:33.088 --> 00:14:35.880\nHow do we tell what portion\nof it belongs to the node and\n\n268\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.300\nwhat portions belong to the network?\n\n269\n00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.580\nWell let's go ahead and\nbreak down IPv4 address basics.\n\n270\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.500\nAnd I've got IPv, but because we've got\ntwo protocols that we can talk about,\n\n271\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.240\nwe need to make sure that we\ndistinguish the difference.\n\n272\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.930\nWhen we talk about IPv4,\n\n273\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.730\nwhat we're talking about is\na 32 bit binary identifier.\n\n274\n00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.930\nThe identifier essentially\nidentifies the network and the node.\n\n275\n00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:10.890\nNow notice the 32 binary bits,\nones and zeroes.\n\n276\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.430\nHow do we write this out?\n\n277\n00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.590\nWell, what you see here,\n\n278\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.200\nwhat I've been using is what's\nknown as dotted decimal notation.\n\n279\n00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.740\nThey call it dotted decimal notation.\n\n280\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.950\nI just said decimal notation here, but\ntechnically it's dotted decimal notation.\n\n281\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.696\nBecause if I was to read these off.\n\n282\n00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:31.405\nI'd have 192.168.0.10.\n\n283\n00:15:31.405 --> 00:15:35.750\nSo, hence the term\ndotted decimal notation.\n\n284\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.040\nNow, underneath of this,\nall the operating system sees and\n\n285\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.360\nthe devices that are using communications\nis a string of binary bits.\n\n286\n00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.624\n32 binary ones and zeroes.\n\n287\n00:15:47.624 --> 00:15:52.613\nNow if we look at it those binary ones and\nzeroes.\n\n288\n00:15:52.613 --> 00:15:54.962\nThey're divided up into four blocks.\n\n289\n00:15:54.962 --> 00:15:56.709\nAgain I say divided up.\n\n290\n00:15:56.709 --> 00:15:57.879\nThey're divided up so\n\n291\n00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:01.887\nthat we as humans can figure out [LAUGH]\nwhat's going on with these addresses.\n\n292\n00:16:01.887 --> 00:16:05.820\nRather than just dealing with\ncontiguous ones and zeroes right?\n\n293\n00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.960\n&gt;&gt; I don't know about you but\nI have a difficult time with that,\n\n294\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.030\njust one long string of ones and zeroes.\n\n295\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.030\nNot the easiest thing for me to decipher.\n\n296\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.951\n&gt;&gt; It is not, it's a lot easier to\nremember a phone number, right?\n\n297\n00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:15.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.495\n&gt;&gt; And we know how well\n\n299\n00:16:16.495 --> 00:16:19.070\nI can remember phone numbers,\n[LAUGH] not very good.\n\n300\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.470\nSo it's comprised of two portions, right?\n\n301\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.452\nNotice that this is the binary\nrepresentation, a dotted binary,\n\n302\n00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:28.950\nI guess you would say, representation.\n\n303\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.468\nAnd then this is the dotted\ndecimal notation.\n\n304\n00:16:31.468 --> 00:16:36.071\nI've told you that it\ncontains two portions, right?\n\n305\n00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:40.018\nNode bits, remember our node bits\nare kind of like our street name.\n\n306\n00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:40.637\nOr excuse me, I'm sorry, network bits.\n\n307\n00:16:40.637 --> 00:16:41.484\n&gt;&gt; Network.\n\n308\n00:16:41.484 --> 00:16:43.508\n&gt;&gt; Network bits are like the street name.\n\n309\n00:16:43.508 --> 00:16:44.155\nMake sure I get that right.\n\n310\n00:16:44.155 --> 00:16:45.410\n&gt;&gt; It's easy to get turned\naround with [INAUDIBLE].\n\n311\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.951\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:16:46.951 --> 00:16:49.558\n&gt;&gt; Node bits are like your house number,\n\n313\n00:16:49.558 --> 00:16:50.290\nright?\n\n314\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.672\nSo that begs the question.\n\n315\n00:16:52.672 --> 00:16:54.850\nBack to Dan's original question,\nhow do we tell?\n\n316\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.420\nA subnet mask.\n\n317\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.550\nThis is where a subnet mask\ncomes into play, all right?\n\n318\n00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.160\nNow, what is a subnet mask?\n\n319\n00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.963\nWhat does it do for us?\n\n320\n00:17:02.963 --> 00:17:10.221\nWell, it's 32 bit binary number if you\nwill, we call it binary mask, all right.\n\n321\n00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:16.731\nIt's written in decimal as well,\n255.255.255.0 in this case.\n\n322\n00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:18.881\nWell if you look at binary, and\n\n323\n00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:23.200\nwe'll show you how to do\nthe conversions over this coming up.\n\n324\n00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.238\n255 in binary ends up\nbeing eight bits of ones.\n\n325\n00:17:28.238 --> 00:17:30.024\nNow what is eight bits?\n\n326\n00:17:30.024 --> 00:17:33.101\nWell, those blocks that we talked about,\nfirst, second, third, and fourth,\n\n327\n00:17:33.101 --> 00:17:34.710\nthose are called octets.\n\n328\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.782\nAll right, it's eight binary bits.\n\n329\n00:17:37.782 --> 00:17:43.375\nA subnet mask is a set\nof contiguous 1 bits.\n\n330\n00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:48.410\nAnd when we say contiguous 1 bits,\nI can't have 0s in\n\n331\n00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.780\nthe middle of this and\ncall this a subnet mask, all right?\n\n332\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:18:01.110\nIt has to be a contiguous\nset of binary 1s, all right.\n\n333\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:05.859\nNow, what we do is, this is the decimal,\nwe'll go to the decimal first here.\n\n334\n00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:10.680\nWhat we do is we apply the subnet\nmask to the IP address.\n\n335\n00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.608\nIn this case I took one of our IP\naddresses from one of the computers off of\n\n336\n00:18:14.608 --> 00:18:16.581\nthat network that we were showing.\n\n337\n00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:20.412\nIn this case, 192.168.0.10.\n\n338\n00:18:20.412 --> 00:18:24.104\nWhen I apply the subnet\nmask to the IP address,\n\n339\n00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.954\nour computers do this, we do this.\n\n340\n00:18:26.954 --> 00:18:29.600\nJust to kind of figure out what's\ngoing on as well [LAUGH] and\n\n341\n00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.496\nwe'll talk about more of that coming up.\n\n342\n00:18:31.496 --> 00:18:35.837\nWhen I apply the subnet mask,\nwhat it does for me.\n\n343\n00:18:35.837 --> 00:18:40.840\nIs it reveals which portions\nare the network portion\n\n344\n00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.197\nof the address and\nwhich portions are the node portion.\n\n345\n00:18:46.197 --> 00:18:49.218\nNow if there are some of you\nguys that are looking at this.\n\n346\n00:18:49.218 --> 00:18:53.984\nAnd maybe you're familiar with the process\nof applying a subnet mask, yes,\n\n347\n00:18:53.984 --> 00:18:56.660\nI realize that 10 is still there.\n\n348\n00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.670\nRight now what I am doing is theoretically\nshowing you how the subnet mask shows us\n\n349\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:03.790\nthe network portion\nversus the node portion.\n\n350\n00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.133\nWe'll talk about an ending process\ncoming up here after a bit.\n\n351\n00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:11.213\nAll right, so\nwhen we break this up in binary,\n\n352\n00:19:11.213 --> 00:19:18.027\neach one of these decimal numbers can\nbe represented as eight bits of binary.\n\n353\n00:19:18.027 --> 00:19:20.870\nAnd like I said I'll show you\nthe conversion coming up.\n\n354\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.110\nThen we apply the subnet mask to it.\n\n355\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.090\nNotice the one bits here, right?\n\n356\n00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.770\nYou guys notice these one bits?\n\n357\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.720\nAnywhere I see the one\nbits below the IP address,\n\n358\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.610\nI know are the bits that make up\nthe network portion of the address.\n\n359\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.860\nAnywhere I see zeros in the subnet mask,\n\n360\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.450\nI know that that's the node\nportion of my address.\n\n361\n00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:52.040\nAll right, and we're gonna come back\nto what exactly is happening here.\n\n362\n00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.098\nLike I said, I'll show you\nthe binary ending with this slide so\n\n363\n00:19:55.098 --> 00:19:57.359\nyou can understand what\nis going on with that.\n\n364\n00:19:57.359 --> 00:20:02.236\nBut for now I just want you to understand\nthat what the subnet mask does is\n\n365\n00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:04.039\nit allows me to identify.\n\n366\n00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:07.069\nWhat's the street name or\nnetwork portion in this address?\n\n367\n00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.710\nAnd what is the node portion, right?\n\n368\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.268\nOr the house numbers?\n\n369\n00:20:13.268 --> 00:20:15.099\nI need to be able to\nknow that distinction.\n\n370\n00:20:15.099 --> 00:20:18.554\nBecause if I take a series of computers,\n\n371\n00:20:18.554 --> 00:20:22.629\nwhere'd we go here,\na series of IP addresses.\n\n372\n00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:27.611\nI need to be able to tell,\nis this computer on the same network or\n\n373\n00:20:27.611 --> 00:20:30.151\nstreet as these computers are?\n\n374\n00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:31.928\nWell, I don't know.\n\n375\n00:20:31.928 --> 00:20:34.639\nLet's find out.\n\n376\n00:20:34.639 --> 00:20:39.346\nIf I take and I do a 255.255.255.0 and\n\n377\n00:20:39.346 --> 00:20:45.110\nwe put that under every one\nof these IP addresses right.\n\n378\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.340\nZoom out a little bit here.\n\n379\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.820\nAnd let's look at the portions\nthat are considered the network\n\n380\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.640\nportion of these addresses, right.\n\n381\n00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.690\nAnd see if we can draw a dividing line,\nall right.\n\n382\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.030\nSo what this tells me, with 255s here,\nall right, is that the first\n\n383\n00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:13.240\nthree octets of this IP address\nare the network portion, all right.\n\n384\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.170\nRemember where the ones are.\n\n385\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.730\nI know it's in binary, we're just\ndoing the decimal representation.\n\n386\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.810\nThese are a little bit easier.\n\n387\n00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.890\nWe'll tell you what\nthese are coming up too.\n\n388\n00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:26.682\nBut when I apply these subnet masks,\nI can see that this is 192.168.0.0,\n\n389\n00:21:26.682 --> 00:21:29.424\nis the network portion of this address.\n\n390\n00:21:29.424 --> 00:21:37.120\nI can see under the second address\n192.168.0 is also the same here.\n\n391\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.540\nSo I can tell in the last\none 192.168.0 again\n\n392\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.430\nall three of these addresses\nhave matching network IDs.\n\n393\n00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.310\nBecause of that,\n\n394\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.080\nthat tells me the first part of\nthe IP addressing rules is correct.\n\n395\n00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.140\nThey're on the same network.\n\n396\n00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.080\nThey're all sharing the same\nstreet name or network portion.\n\n397\n00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:04.060\nNow what I need to figure out is if they\nare on the same network are they unique?\n\n398\n00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.385\nDo they have unique\nportions of their address?\n\n399\n00:22:07.385 --> 00:22:11.660\nWell remember what we said,\nonce the mail carrier gets to the street,\n\n400\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.520\nthey don't care about\nthe street name anymore.\n\n401\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.070\nI've found out when the street is,\nI'm on the street.\n\n402\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.690\nNow I need to find out what's unique\nto the rest of the portion of\n\n403\n00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.970\nthe address I had.\n\n404\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.060\nWell, if I've already found out\nwhat the network IDs are, right?\n\n405\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.210\nDan, can you help me out here?\n\n406\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.330\nAnd I'll go ahead and I'll take\nour subnet masks out here for now.\n\n407\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.886\nAre those portions different or\nare they identical?\n\n408\n00:22:33.886 --> 00:22:34.516\n&gt;&gt; They're different.\n\n409\n00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:35.750\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They're unique across\n\n410\n00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.878\nthe network, right?\n\n411\n00:22:36.878 --> 00:22:39.873\nSo what we have is a valid\nnetwork addressing here,\n\n412\n00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:42.529\nprovided that we are using\nthat subnet mask.\n\n413\n00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:44.550\nAnd we'll talk about that\nhere in just a second.\n\n414\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.000\nProbably be the one of the last\nthings that we do in this episode.\n\n415\n00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.930\nIn fact Dan, how about we switch over\nto another sheet that I have and\n\n416\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.765\nwe talk a little bit more\nabout our subnet masks.\n\n417\n00:22:52.765 --> 00:22:55.090\nCuz I wanna show you the ending process,\nguys.\n\n418\n00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:59.380\nThe ending processes is why you had\nzeros in that last octet and I said,\n\n419\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.310\ndon't worry about that guys.\n\n420\n00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.430\nWe'll come back to that.\n\n421\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.140\nI want you to know right now\nwhat the subnet mask does.\n\n422\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.799\nI apply it to an IP address,\n\n423\n00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:10.719\nit tells me the portions of the address\nthat are the network ID, the street name.\n\n424\n00:23:10.719 --> 00:23:15.009\nTells me the portions of the address that\nare the node id or the house number.\n\n425\n00:23:15.009 --> 00:23:17.251\nSo that I can determine,\nare they on the same network?\n\n426\n00:23:17.251 --> 00:23:19.471\nAnd if they are on the same network,\nare they unique?\n\n427\n00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:22.860\nRemember Dan gave you the situation and\nscenario earlier.\n\n428\n00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.964\nHe said where he fired up one of those\nWindows machines, went to set its IP or\n\n429\n00:23:26.964 --> 00:23:29.520\nmaybe its IP was set,\nand it threw a conflict.\n\n430\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.306\nWhy?\n\n431\n00:23:30.306 --> 00:23:33.502\nWell that's because your computer called\nout to the rest of the network and said,\n\n432\n00:23:33.502 --> 00:23:36.170\nthis is my IP address and\nthis is what I'm using.\n\n433\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.440\nAnother computer out there on the network\nsaid, not so fast there slim.\n\n434\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Hold up [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n435\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.990\nYou gotta slow your role.\n\n436\n00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.170\nThat's my IP address, all right.\n\n437\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.919\n&gt;&gt; So that computer that Dan was on said,\nwell,\n\n438\n00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:48.638\nwe can't have two of\nthe same IP addresses.\n\n439\n00:23:48.638 --> 00:23:50.885\nThey've got to be unique, so I'm out.\n\n440\n00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:54.196\nAnd it shuts the TCP/IP\nprotocol stack down.\n\n441\n00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:58.082\nThat's why looking at something\nlike this you You have to see,\n\n442\n00:23:58.082 --> 00:24:00.072\nare those IP addresses unique?\n\n443\n00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:00.691\nThey have to be.\n\n444\n00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:02.613\nThat's the rules of the game, right?\n\n445\n00:24:02.613 --> 00:24:06.234\nAnd one of the things that we also\nwant to say, I'll tell you what.\n\n446\n00:24:06.234 --> 00:24:12.930\nLet me go ahead and show you what subnet\nmasks were in the early days of computing.\n\n447\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.893\nThese were the subnet\nmasks that you would have.\n\n448\n00:24:14.893 --> 00:24:17.543\nYou have, and we're gonna talk about\nthe classical system coming up.\n\n449\n00:24:17.543 --> 00:24:23.282\nSee, in the earlier days of IP addressing,\nwe didn't have this crazy,\n\n450\n00:24:23.282 --> 00:24:29.790\nwell of course, not the dot com boom and\nall the mobile devices that we have today.\n\n451\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.950\nSo in the earlier days,\nall we had were these three subnet masks.\n\n452\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:40.090\nAnd I could tell just looking like\nwe did with that 192.168.0.10.\n\n453\n00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:43.090\nIf I apply that subnet mask,\n\n454\n00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:49.100\nI know that those first three octets are\ngonna be network portions of the address.\n\n455\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:55.130\nI knew that applying one of these\nclassical A subnet masks to an IP address,\n\n456\n00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.940\nthe very first octet,\nthat was part of the network ID.\n\n457\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.400\nSo if I had something like a 10.10.10.10,\nall right,\n\n458\n00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.545\nI think I got enough octets in there.\n\n459\n00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:07.360\n[LAUGH] Decided to apply\na Class A subnet mask.\n\n460\n00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.240\nWell, I know that the first portion\nof that 10 dot address is gonna be\n\n461\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.460\nthe network portion.\n\n462\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.820\nThat leaves me three entire octets for\nunique node portions.\n\n463\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.930\nSo I want you to know what the default\nsubnet masks are, all right?\n\n464\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.879\nAnd while we're at it, since we're\ntalking about classical systems,\n\n465\n00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:25.291\nnot to leave you guys open on that.\n\n466\n00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:29.285\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna talk\nabout a classical system because that's\n\n467\n00:25:29.285 --> 00:25:33.237\ngonna bring us back into why we would do\nsome additional technologies as well.\n\n468\n00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:40.980\nIn the IPv4 address space you have\nwhat are known as an address range.\n\n469\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.700\nAnd we talk about the classes.\n\n470\n00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.380\nWe mention the A, B and\nthe C address range.\n\n471\n00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.450\nWell, there are certain ranges that\nwere basically introduced by IANA,\n\n472\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:59.110\nthe Internet Assigned Numbering Authority,\nif I can remember that acronym, all right?\n\n473\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.150\nAnd they said you know what?\n\n474\n00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.970\nIt's a 32 bit address space.\n\n475\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.600\nThat gives us 2 to the power of 32,\n\n476\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.050\nthe possible combinations 4.3 billion,\nall right?\n\n477\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.983\nAnd then what we're gonna do is take\nthat entire possibility of addresses.\n\n478\n00:26:11.983 --> 00:26:16.650\nAnd we're gonna classify each one\ndepending on how many networks you need\n\n479\n00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.499\nversus how many nodes within\na network you need, all right?\n\n480\n00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:23.814\nNow, today we use a classless system,\nbecause as you're gonna see here,\n\n481\n00:26:23.814 --> 00:26:25.931\nas we progress,\nthis is a little bit wasteful.\n\n482\n00:26:25.931 --> 00:26:29.340\nBut you still have to know the classes,\nall right?\n\n483\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.315\nIn that very first class, it starts\nat 1 and goes all the way to 126.\n\n484\n00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:39.613\nNow there are a couple of addresses\nthat I've put in here that are reserved.\n\n485\n00:26:39.613 --> 00:26:43.976\nAnd let me go ahead and\ntalk about this one real quick, 0.0.0.0.\n\n486\n00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:45.322\nThat is a reserved address.\n\n487\n00:26:45.322 --> 00:26:47.563\nEvery computer uses that address.\n\n488\n00:26:47.563 --> 00:26:49.618\nThat's the all routes address.\n\n489\n00:26:49.618 --> 00:26:50.744\nIt's the route of last hope.\n\n490\n00:26:50.744 --> 00:26:54.117\nIt means if I've looked in my routing\ntable and I need to send information to\n\n491\n00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:57.006\na network, and I don't find that\nnetwork in the routing table,\n\n492\n00:26:57.006 --> 00:26:58.740\nI'm going to send it to that address.\n\n493\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.290\nTypically it's whatever\nthe device's default gateway is,\n\n494\n00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.220\nwhich we'll also talk\nabout coming up as well.\n\n495\n00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.330\nSo that's reserved, you can't use that.\n\n496\n00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:06.810\nEverybody uses it.\n\n497\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.400\nStarting with 1,\ngoing to 126, that's class A.\n\n498\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:17.597\nClass B starts at 128.0.0.0 and\n\n499\n00:27:17.597 --> 00:27:21.120\ngoes all the way to 191.\n\n500\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.090\nClass C goes from 192 all the way to 223.\n\n501\n00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.660\nNow these first three classes, these\n\n502\n00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.970\nare the ones that we give out to\ndevices to communicate on networks.\n\n503\n00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:41.210\nThese last two ranges we don't allocate.\n\n504\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.664\nIn fact, class D is a multi cast range,\nand all computers use multi cast.\n\n505\n00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:48.311\nAll devices on networks\nuse multi cast range.\n\n506\n00:27:48.311 --> 00:27:51.194\nWhen they need to send a one\nto many communication,\n\n507\n00:27:51.194 --> 00:27:55.622\none device sends one communication to\nmany different people on that network,\n\n508\n00:27:55.622 --> 00:27:57.718\nthey send it to the multi cast range.\n\n509\n00:27:57.718 --> 00:28:02.850\nAnd those addresses start at 224 and\nwork their way up to 239.\n\n510\n00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.660\nLast is completely reserved for\n\n511\n00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.500\njust experimental purposes,\nand that's 240 to 255.\n\n512\n00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:16.105\nNow be careful on this one,\nI put 255.255.255.254,\n\n513\n00:28:16.105 --> 00:28:18.670\nI did not put all 255s, why?\n\n514\n00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.409\nEvery computer uses 255s.\n\n515\n00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:23.847\nThat's called the Internet\nword broadcast address.\n\n516\n00:28:23.847 --> 00:28:29.350\nI'll give you a classic example\nof when this address is used.\n\n517\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:33.470\nWhen my computer calls out to the network,\ncuz it needs an IP address and\n\n518\n00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.560\nit's using DHCP,\nit doesn't have an IP address yet.\n\n519\n00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.460\nIt doesn't know what the network is,\nit knows none of that information.\n\n520\n00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.430\nSo it says, let me use this address.\n\n521\n00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.870\nAnd I'll call out to the network and\n\n522\n00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.650\nanybody that's listening,\nregardless of what network you're on,\n\n523\n00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.710\nregardless of what your IP is,\nyou're gonna hear this communication.\n\n524\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.670\nSo that is another one of those\nones that's completely reserved.\n\n525\n00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:58.570\nLast thing I'll say about the Classical\nsystem, memorize it, all right?\n\n526\n00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.306\nDefinitely memorize it.\n\n527\n00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:04.410\n1 to 126, 128 to 191, 192 to 223,\n\n528\n00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.130\n224 to 239, 240 to 255.\n\n529\n00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.666\nI'll also tell you that the other thing\nyou can identify in the binary, and\n\n530\n00:29:12.666 --> 00:29:17.853\nin fact I'll say, I'll tell you what,\nDan, I'm gonna save the binary intelling.\n\n531\n00:29:17.853 --> 00:29:21.448\nBecause we still have to show you\nhow you take a decimal number and\n\n532\n00:29:21.448 --> 00:29:22.770\nconvert it to binary.\n\n533\n00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.770\nAnd that's definitely something that\nwe're going to do within this episode.\n\n534\n00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.836\nBut maybe not right within this episode.\n\n535\n00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:29.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it does look like I've talked\n\n536\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.333\na little bit too much.\n\n537\n00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:34.259\n&gt;&gt; Well it's a lot of information and\nit can be very, very confusing for\n\n538\n00:29:34.259 --> 00:29:35.894\npeople that are new to this.\n\n539\n00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:40.613\nI remember when I was being taught\nsubnetting and IP addressing, I was like,\n\n540\n00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:43.096\nwow, none of this makes any sense to me.\n\n541\n00:29:43.096 --> 00:29:47.543\nSo Wes, I think you've actually done a\nreally good job of giving it some context,\n\n542\n00:29:47.543 --> 00:29:51.863\nso that maybe the person that's new to\nthis kind of information has something to\n\n543\n00:29:51.863 --> 00:29:54.523\ngrab onto and\nstarts to make some associations.\n\n544\n00:29:54.523 --> 00:29:55.903\nCuz that's what it's all about.\n\n545\n00:29:55.903 --> 00:29:59.746\nAnd yeah, there's a lot more to go,\nit's just a never ending rabbit trail.\n\n546\n00:29:59.746 --> 00:30:04.034\nAnd it takes people a long time to\nfinally become solid with the stuff, so\n\n547\n00:30:04.034 --> 00:30:06.085\nI know you've got plenty to go on.\n\n548\n00:30:06.085 --> 00:30:08.798\n&gt;&gt; There was one yeah,\nthis was one of those topics,\n\n549\n00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:13.141\nI swear guys, where I was like, I,\nno I don't, okay I actually, no I lost it.\n\n550\n00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:15.080\nOkay now, no I don't.\n\n551\n00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.982\nSo guys, just like Dan says,\nrepetition, repetition.\n\n552\n00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.183\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right well it looks like\nwe'll have a part two waiting for\n\n553\n00:30:21.183 --> 00:30:22.933\nus coming up for more IP addressing.\n\n554\n00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:23.908\nSo looking forward to that.\n\n555\n00:30:23.908 --> 00:30:25.277\nThanks Wes, for joining us.\n\n556\n00:30:25.277 --> 00:30:26.590\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n557\n00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.190\nBut signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n558\n00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.049\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n559\n00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:32.837\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n560\n00:30:32.837 --> 00:30:39.514\n[MUSIC]\n\n561\n00:30:39.514 --> 00:30:42.531\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:13.040\nwatching ITPro.TV\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n4\n00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.870\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.668\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n6\n00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:23.470\nin today's episode we are continuing more\non our computer network plus series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.310\nAnd of course joining us back\nin the studio to continue our\n\n8\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.370\nconversation we were having\non IP addressing and schemes.\n\n9\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.840\nAnd all that craziness\nthat's going on there\n\n10\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.370\nour good friend Mister Wes Bryan Wes,\nwelcome back man.\n\n11\n00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.080\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.160\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, thanks for\nhaving me back here as always my pleasure.\n\n13\n00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.520\nThat's right we have to continue on\nthat path that is well IP addressing and\n\n14\n00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.090\nit's one of those necessary evils that\nwhen you first look at it, it could seem\n\n15\n00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.520\nlike a daunting task, but hopefully we'll\ndemystify it a little bit here too.\n\n16\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.834\nKeep in mind that one of the things that\nwe left of in the first part of this\n\n17\n00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:56.842\nseries that is gonna end up being\na mini series on IP addressing.\n\n18\n00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.851\nWe started talking about the subnet mask\nand if you remember one of the things\n\n19\n00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:04.796\nthat we had mentioned about the subnet\nmask is that it divides up the network\n\n20\n00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:08.135\nportion from the host portion or\nnode portion of an IP address.\n\n21\n00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.566\nLetting us figure out\nwhat network we are on.\n\n22\n00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.566\nNow one of the things that I didn't\nmention yesterday when I was talking\n\n23\n00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.640\nabout, we're in the last\nepisode excuse me.\n\n24\n00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.710\nWhen I was talking about\nsome of the rules for\n\n25\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.650\nIP addressing, well I didnt' add one\nof the biggest another big rule.\n\n26\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.900\nAnd that's that not only must a computer\nto be considered to be on the same\n\n27\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.130\nnetwork unless they share the same\nnetwork ID and same host ID's.\n\n28\n00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.640\nBut in order for that to happen, they also\nhave to share the same common subnet mask.\n\n29\n00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.510\nAnd that's what really is\nthe component that lets us figure out\n\n30\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.910\nwhat network our computers are on.\n\n31\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.020\nSo we're gonna dive in a little\nbit more to subnet masks.\n\n32\n00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.810\nAnd then we'll also talk about\nconcepts like subnetting and\n\n33\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.730\nwe'll talk a little bit more\nabout the classes as well.\n\n34\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.970\nCuz I know we just kind of\nbriefed over these topics.\n\n35\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.063\nAnd then we also have to tackle\nbinary to decimal conversion,\n\n36\n00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:57.921\nthat is gonna be something\nthat is going to be important.\n\n37\n00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:02.311\nSo let's go ahead, and I tell you what,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna start\n\n38\n00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.810\nright out with binary\nto decimal conversion.\n\n39\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.055\nBecause we've been looking at a lot\nof binary bits here before but\n\n40\n00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:10.543\nwe haven't really talked\nabout what is going on?\n\n41\n00:02:10.543 --> 00:02:13.830\nHow did those bits come about and\nhow do we get those decimal numbers?\n\n42\n00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.190\nSo we'll start there and then we'll come\nback and we'll see how those subnet masks\n\n43\n00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.760\nare helping us to do that very thing,\nto tell what network we are on.\n\n44\n00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.150\nSo let's go ahead and We're going to,\nI've got a little diagram here and\n\n45\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.930\nwe're gonna look at binary\nto decimal conversion.\n\n46\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.540\nSee, when we talk about an IPv4 address\nremember we said it's a 32 bit identifier\n\n47\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.870\nand it's broken up into four blocks,\nthree, four blocks are called octets.\n\n48\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.570\nThey're called octets because\nin binary it's 8 bits.\n\n49\n00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.936\nBut we don't write it down that way\nbecause it's very hard like we said in\n\n50\n00:02:46.936 --> 00:02:48.162\nthe first part 32 bits.\n\n51\n00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:51.831\nCould you imagine having to type in\n32 bits every time you want to talk\n\n52\n00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:54.142\nto a computer or configure a computer, no.\n\n53\n00:02:54.142 --> 00:02:58.502\nSo we represent it as decimal notation and\nit's gonna be important that you know how\n\n54\n00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:02.364\nto bring it from decimal into binary and\nbinary to decimal especially when\n\n55\n00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:06.000\nyou get into subnetting and\nreally understanding what the bits are.\n\n56\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.740\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into that right now.\n\n57\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.280\nWhen we talk about binary and\n\n58\n00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.970\nwe talk about decimal we have a series of\nplace values that we have to basically\n\n59\n00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.700\nkind of utilize every time we convert one\nof these numbers from decimal to binary.\n\n60\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.760\nNow these place values are on\na base two numbering system, right.\n\n61\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.380\nSo for instance we only have\ntwo possibilities, right.\n\n62\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.510\nThe base two numbering\nsystem which is binary is.\n\n63\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.440\nWe have the possibility of a one or\nbinary zero, right, on, off.\n\n64\n00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.490\nThat's all we really get.\n\n65\n00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.270\nSo those are the only two\nvalues that you gotta find when\n\n66\n00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.910\nyou're converting from\ndecimal to binary here.\n\n67\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.620\nThe place values,\nif you're not really understanding,\n\n68\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.300\nwell how do I come up with these numbers?\n\n69\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.540\nThese numbers are really just,\n\n70\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.500\nif you think about Base 10\nnumbering systems, right?\n\n71\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.560\nIf for instance, I was figuring out\na math problem, I would start right\n\n72\n00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.490\nfrom the right to the left and\nwe'd have the one place value, right?\n\n73\n00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.990\nWe'd have the ten place value.\n\n74\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.170\nHundreds and you guys have\nprobably seen this before alright,\n\n75\n00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.620\nbecause we're used to a base\nten numbering system.\n\n76\n00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.100\nHowever, in base two numbering\nsystem same concept here but\n\n77\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.650\nthe place values, their values\nare a little bit different right.\n\n78\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.180\nThey start with one very first,\nno different than a base ten.\n\n79\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.830\nBut the difference here is they\ndouble every place value after that.\n\n80\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.300\nAnd since we're dealing with an octate\nyou'll notice that I have what?\n\n81\n00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.120\nOne, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven and eight.\n\n82\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.240\nRight, eight bits that\nwe'll be dealing with.\n\n83\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.770\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n84\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.760\nlet's kinda take a number that we\ncan deal with quite a lot here.\n\n85\n00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.771\nWe'll go ahead and let's say for instance\nlet's take something like 192, right?\n\n86\n00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:46.245\nThere's a couple of different\nways you can take it this like,\n\n87\n00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.307\nI have arrange this in\ncouple of different orders.\n\n88\n00:04:48.307 --> 00:04:50.912\nCuz you think about it really a math\nproblem with this place values.\n\n89\n00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:56.327\nSome people stay up this force\nhorizontally and we'll add them together.\n\n90\n00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:58.560\nWe'll talk about that here in a second.\n\n91\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.770\nWhere some people use this\nvertical approach right.\n\n92\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.530\nIt doesn't really matter because\nthe formula of the processes is going to\n\n93\n00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.650\nbe the same.\n\n94\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.890\nAll right so if I take for instance,\n\n95\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.350\nlet's take this cell here and\nwe'll just bump that up a little bit.\n\n96\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.740\nAnd we'll save I don't know, we'll do 192.\n\n97\n00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.020\nOops, that might not work too well.\n\n98\n00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.410\nGive me one moment here, let's kinda make\nsomething a little bit easier to see.\n\n99\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.920\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.154\nSo let's take something like 192.168.1.10.\n\n101\n00:05:33.154 --> 00:05:35.440\nAll right, this is one of the IP\naddresses that we've seen.\n\n102\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.310\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n103\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.150\nlet's see how is it that we break\nthis down into a binary number.\n\n104\n00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.080\nWell, what I have to do and the easiest\nway to do this is to start to do a little\n\n105\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.430\nmath from the left working\nyour way over to the right.\n\n106\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.080\nAnd what I essentially say is\ncan I take breaking this down?\n\n107\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.201\nWe're gonna break this\ndown one at a time here.\n\n108\n00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:59.111\nNoticed I'm gonna start\nwith the first octet 192.\n\n109\n00:05:59.111 --> 00:06:01.038\nThen we're gonna go to 168.\n\n110\n00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:02.874\nThen we're gonna go one and\nthen we're gonna go to ten.\n\n111\n00:06:02.874 --> 00:06:07.120\nWhen you break the octets down,\nit's easier just to do them one at a time.\n\n112\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.122\nSo it just makes it a little bit more,\na lot easier than trying to do all 32 bits\n\n113\n00:06:11.122 --> 00:06:13.318\nat one time that would\njust be a nightmare.\n\n114\n00:06:13.318 --> 00:06:16.994\nWhich again is one of the reasons that\nwe break it up into one of these blocks,\n\n115\n00:06:16.994 --> 00:06:18.670\nmakes it a lot more easy to manage.\n\n116\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.244\nSo what are we gonna do?\n\n117\n00:06:20.244 --> 00:06:23.600\nNow my question would be, and\nDan you might help me out with this one.\n\n118\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.382\nIf I'm gonna take these place values\nto turn it into binary I take the first\n\n119\n00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:29.041\nnumber that I'm working with.\n\n120\n00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:31.507\nSo in this case let's say it's 192 and\n\n121\n00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:34.560\nam gonna see if I can\nsubtract place values here.\n\n122\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.114\nNow understand if I can\nsubtract this place values,\n\n123\n00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:42.492\nthat turns that place value on and\nthat's a binary one, right.\n\n124\n00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:47.192\nBinary ones and zeros, we think about\nit's on, off, on, off, true, false,\n\n125\n00:06:47.192 --> 00:06:48.800\nright, again two values.\n\n126\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.692\nSo if I take 192 and I say, all right,\ncan I just, can I subtract 128 from 192?\n\n127\n00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:58.397\nWell let's go, oops,\nthat's not what I want to do.\n\n128\n00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:03.370\nI'm going to end up breaking\nmy Excel spreadsheet here.\n\n129\n00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.580\nLet's do calculator, right?\n\n130\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.570\nMake it a little bit easier for\nWes' math, all right?\n\n131\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.706\nSo if I do 192 and\nI subtract 128, I get 64 left.\n\n132\n00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:15.070\nBecause I can use this place value,\n\n133\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.580\nI'm gonna turn it on and\nmake it a binary one.\n\n134\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.190\nNow, this column here is just to kinda\nhelp you to see which one is on and\n\n135\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.360\nwhich one is off.\n\n136\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.211\nNow, what I'm gonna do is now that I can\ntake 128 and I can subtract it from 192,\n\n137\n00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:34.544\nyou'll notice that I have a 64 remainder,\nright 64 left.\n\n138\n00:07:34.544 --> 00:07:37.620\nWell this is gonna continue working\nthrough those place values.\n\n139\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.280\nAnd everywhere I could\ntake the remainder and\n\n140\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.900\nsubtract the next place value\nit becomes a binary one.\n\n141\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.180\nNow I might at any point in this equation\nget to a point where I can't use a place\n\n142\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.960\nvalue, right.\n\n143\n00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.741\nWhat if my remainder here was, lets say,\n32 well the next place value is 64.\n\n144\n00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.705\nThere's no way I could take that 64\nplace value and subtract it from 32.\n\n145\n00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.205\nNow mathematically,\nyou could have a negative number, but\n\n146\n00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:04.990\nwe don't deal in negative\nnumbers here in binary.\n\n147\n00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.369\nSo I would be able to use that.\n\n148\n00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:11.232\nBut since my remainder\nis 64 in this equation,\n\n149\n00:08:11.232 --> 00:08:14.350\nI can subtract 64 from 64, right?\n\n150\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.920\nI turn that on and you might notice\nhere That I've got it adding up there.\n\n151\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.930\nIt makes it a lot easier, right.\n\n152\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.830\nYou guys could deal with my\nmathematical capabilities here but\n\n153\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.890\nI'm sure, Dan, this would be a very long,\ndrawn out and difficulty episode.\n\n154\n00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.500\nSo what I've got it doing in the\nbackground is it's calculating it for us.\n\n155\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.520\nEssentially, what it is,\nnotice this 8-bit number, right?\n\n156\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.450\nBecause I have nothing left, once I\nsubtract that place value, say 64, right?\n\n157\n00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.354\nAnd if we were to do the math,\n64- 64 = 0, right?\n\n158\n00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:47.750\nI can't use any of the other place values,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.360\nThere's nothing left to subtract and\nwe don't have remainders when we're doing\n\n160\n00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.720\nbinary or\ndecimal about a binary conversion.\n\n161\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.000\nSo that ends up becoming my 8 bit number,\nmy binary representation of 192.\n\n162\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.400\nSo I can see taking this out of here,\n1100 and I'll separate these just so\n\n163\n00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.770\nyou guys could see the four bits, it's\neasier especially for me to keep track of.\n\n164\n00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:17.186\nI can see that 192 is actually 1100000.\n\n165\n00:09:17.186 --> 00:09:21.344\nNow, that's the vertical approach if\nyou want the horizontal approach,\n\n166\n00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:22.603\nwe can do that as well.\n\n167\n00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:24.184\nI can do the same thing.\n\n168\n00:09:24.184 --> 00:09:29.680\n192 I could subtract 128,\nturns that bit on.\n\n169\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.400\nRight?\n\n170\n00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.460\nGives me a remainder of 64 and so\nI just move to the next place value.\n\n171\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.510\nI can use that place\nvalue 64 from 64 right?\n\n172\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.030\nGives me a remainder of 0.\n\n173\n00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.170\nNow, the rest of this place\nvalues can't be used.\n\n174\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:49.940\nSo at any point that I cannot use a place\nvalue and subtract it, it becomes a zero.\n\n175\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.530\nNow, you can see right here that the zero,\nthe remainder of zero started very,\n\n176\n00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.970\nvery early on in this\nmathematical equation here.\n\n177\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.300\nSo the rest are automatically zeros.\n\n178\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.960\nSame thing could happen down here if I\nhave a, if I use the 16 place value last.\n\n179\n00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.740\nAnd I got a zero well that not just means\neverything passed it's going to be a zero.\n\n180\n00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.360\nAll right so just, just one example.\n\n181\n00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.870\nWe're going to do a couple\nof this examples and\n\n182\n00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.290\nhopefully it will make a little bit\nmore senses when we go through it.\n\n183\n00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:18.650\nSo we set 192 that was our first one right\nand we've got that by a representation.\n\n184\n00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.260\nThat's 1100 0000, all right?\n\n185\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.540\nBut now, the next one we need is 68,\nall right?\n\n186\n00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.180\nSo let's go ahead and let's do a little\nbit of math on that one, all right?\n\n187\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.320\nSo the first thing I need to figure and\nwe'll go ahead,\n\n188\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.480\nwe'll clear our little table out here,\nall right.\n\n189\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.860\nAnd again we'll clear the oops,\nI don't remember that anything thank you.\n\n190\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.410\nWe'll go ahead and\nclear our other table out.\n\n191\n00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.180\nSo we'll do this a couple of ways so\nyou guys can see it.\n\n192\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.000\nNow, doing the same thing.\n\n193\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.720\nWe'll start this way.\n\n194\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.620\nI'm gonna start horizontally so\nyou guys can see it.\n\n195\n00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.750\nNow I've got a value of 168.\n\n196\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.330\nWhat do I have to do?\n\n197\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.890\nI start from the left.\n\n198\n00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.790\nI'm going to work through\nthese place values.\n\n199\n00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.080\nAny time that I can subtract that\nplace value becomes a binary one.\n\n200\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.964\nIf at any time, no matter where I start,\nif I can't use the place value it's ought,\n\n201\n00:11:07.964 --> 00:11:09.955\nit's false, so it becomes a binary zero.\n\n202\n00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:13.830\nSo we'll, say okay hey can\nI subtract 128 from my next\n\n203\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.046\nnumber here in this IP address\nthat I'm working for, right.\n\n204\n00:11:18.046 --> 00:11:18.550\n168.\n\n205\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.620\nAnd the answer is, well yes I can, right.\n\n206\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.750\nSo I turn that on.\n\n207\n00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.260\nNotice I have 128.\n\n208\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.180\nNow, what do I have left?\n\n209\n00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.180\nWell I have a 40 left, right.\n\n210\n00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.030\n40 is my remainder.\n\n211\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.890\nSo now, we get to that point where\nI tell you if your remainder,\n\n212\n00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.090\nyou can't use one of the place values,\nit's a zero, I can't subtract 64 from 48,\n\n213\n00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.620\nso it's gonna be a zero.\n\n214\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.270\nAnd I'm gonna move to\nthe next place value.\n\n215\n00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.530\nNow remember, my remainder is still 40.\n\n216\n00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.840\nSo can I subtract 32 from 40?\n\n217\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.520\nAnd the answer is, well yes I can, right.\n\n218\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.310\nSo I do a one cuz I can use that.\n\n219\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.110\nAnd now I've got eight left, right?\n\n220\n00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.910\nIf I'm doing my math right here,\nhopefully I've got eight left.\n\n221\n00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.420\nBut I can use a 16, right?\n\n222\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.190\nI can't subtract 16 from eight.\n\n223\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.070\nSo, that's going to become, well,\nit's going to say a binary zero.\n\n224\n00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.250\nNow, remember with our remainder of\neight I can use the 8 place value.\n\n225\n00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.180\nThat's the remainder.\n\n226\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.850\nSo when I subtract it.\n\n227\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.320\nNotice I subtract eight from eight,\nI get a 0.\n\n228\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.750\nAnywhere in this little place\nvalue list that I have a 0 left,\n\n229\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.960\neverything following suit\nis gonna be a 0 as well.\n\n230\n00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.120\nSo now notice that what happened.\n\n231\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.140\nRight, we're adding the place values up.\n\n232\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.963\n128 plus 0 leaves us with 128, right?\n\n233\n00:12:31.963 --> 00:12:35.526\nDidn't add anything there,\nplus a 32 brought us to 160.\n\n234\n00:12:35.526 --> 00:12:37.557\nDidn't add a 16.\n\n235\n00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:39.580\nThere's nothing there, right.\n\n236\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.180\nBut I can add eight and\nthat takes me to 168.\n\n237\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.540\nNow, I want you guys to know the same\nrule applies if you're taking binary,\n\n238\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.340\nI already started with this eight bits.\n\n239\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.360\nSo I gotta bring it back to the decimal.\n\n240\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.690\nRemember this chart,\nremember the place values.\n\n241\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.870\nSet at eight bits into this chart value.\n\n242\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.040\nWherever the one's are add up\nall those place values right.\n\n243\n00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.216\n128 plus 32 plus eight equals 168.\n\n244\n00:13:05.216 --> 00:13:09.290\nSo now you've seen not\nonly taken the decimal and\n\n245\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.170\ngoing to binary, binary back to decimal.\n\n246\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.380\nBut let's not stop there okay.\n\n247\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.920\nWe'll do this on the vertical\napproach as well.\n\n248\n00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.650\nAgain, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna say yes I can take 128 and\n\n249\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.230\nsubtract it from 168, right?\n\n250\n00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.800\nOops, that is a crazy number there.\n\n251\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.260\nGotta love auto-fill.\n\n252\n00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.770\nThere we go, right.\n\n253\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.750\nSo what do I have left?\n\n254\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.070\nI've taken 128, and I've subtracted\nit from 168, and I have 40 left.\n\n255\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.610\nAgain, I can't use the 64, but\nI can use the 32, so I add that.\n\n256\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:43.270\nAlright.\n\n257\n00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.170\nOnce I add the 32 I now have 8 left.\n\n258\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.090\nI can't subtract 16, right?\n\n259\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.690\nBut I can subtract the eight.\n\n260\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.135\nBoy, that autofill,\nI'm gonna have to turn that off.\n\n261\n00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:54.644\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:13:54.644 --> 00:13:55.930\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna get me in trouble here.\n\n263\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But notice, now I add 128.\n\n264\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.070\nPlus 32 plus eight and I get 168.\n\n265\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.280\nSo that I can see taking this number\n\n266\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.130\nout of this chart I'm left\nwith a binary eight bits.\n\n267\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.008\nSo, 168 in our IP address for\n\n268\n00:14:15.008 --> 00:14:18.087\nus is, not to that.\n\n269\n00:14:18.087 --> 00:14:20.342\nWe'll try that again, there we go.\n\n270\n00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:22.407\nIs going to be what?\n\n271\n00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:27.470\n10101000, there you go, thank you now.\n\n272\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:34.485\nNow, here is the most difficult number to\ncalculate in all binary a one, all right?\n\n273\n00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:36.930\n[LAUGH] Dan caught that one out there.\n\n274\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.450\nHe's like yeah, that's a difficult one.\n\n275\n00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.270\nNow so how do we work with just one?\n\n276\n00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.789\nWell let's go ahead,\nlet's reset all of our values.\n\n277\n00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.350\nRight.\n\n278\n00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.120\nReset all of our values here.\n\n279\n00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.350\nAnd let's start over.\n\n280\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.880\nAll right.\n\n281\n00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.280\nNow, one is one of those numbers\nthat joking around it's fairly easy.\n\n282\n00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.420\nRight?\nI can't use a 128.\n\n283\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.800\nRight?\nAnd I can't subtract 128 from one so\n\n284\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.070\nI'm going to save you a lot\nof repetition here, right.\n\n285\n00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.950\nI can't use 64 or 32, 8, 4 or 2.\n\n286\n00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.980\nSo, all of those are zeros.\n\n287\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.200\nThe first place value in doing that\nsubtraction I can use is well, one.\n\n288\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.250\nIt's the only thing I can subtract from\none and I add that and now I have,\n\n289\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.510\nbelieve it or not as simple as it is,\nI have another binary number right.\n\n290\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.812\nI always like though when it's 128 or\nit's one.\n\n291\n00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:25.832\nIt's easy to remember right.\n\n292\n00:15:25.832 --> 00:15:26.332\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n293\n00:15:26.332 --> 00:15:28.378\n&gt;&gt; 128, one and all zeros.\n\n294\n00:15:28.378 --> 00:15:30.668\nOne, all zeros, and a single one so\n\n295\n00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:35.780\nyou'll start to notice that so now if\nwe take that out of this chart here,\n\n296\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.730\nwe'll see one as a 00000001 all right so\nagain eight more\n\n297\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.550\nbytes, all right.\n\n298\n00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.765\nNow this is important for\n\n299\n00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:54.363\nus right we wanna make sure that\nthe last one we gonna do is well.\n\n300\n00:15:54.363 --> 00:15:56.938\nAnd that's not really working out.\n\n301\n00:15:56.938 --> 00:15:58.397\nSo let me go ahead.\n\n302\n00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:03.981\nThere we go, I'll just double click on\nit when we need to see the whole thing.\n\n303\n00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:08.940\nSo the last number that we need in this\nIP address was gonna be ten, right?\n\n304\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.110\nSo let's go ahead and let's figure\nout what ten look Like in Binary.\n\n305\n00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.160\nAll right, now this is another one of\nthose ones that we was to go through it.\n\n306\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.750\nAnd we will go ahead and\nchange up this time.\n\n307\n00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.340\nAnd we'll do the vertical this time.\n\n308\n00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.260\nRight, I can't use 128.\n\n309\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.355\nI can not subtract 128 from ten.\n\n310\n00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.210\nSo, that's gonna become zero.\n\n311\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.360\nAnd again, we won't make it so\ndifficult for\n\n312\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.420\nyou guys that you have to\nrepeat all these here.\n\n313\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.028\n64 kg 32, right, I can't use 16.\n\n314\n00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:39.220\nBut in ten the first place that\nyou are keen is users name.\n\n315\n00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.000\nRight?\nSo that becomes a binary one.\n\n316\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.270\nAll right?\n\n317\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.800\nAnd when I subtract,\nwell what, eight from ten.\n\n318\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.720\nI have two left so I can't use\nthe four but I can use the two right?\n\n319\n00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.010\nTwo from two.\n\n320\n00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.257\nSo that becomes a binary one.\n\n321\n00:16:53.257 --> 00:16:59.080\nAll right, and notice my decimal\nvalue ends up being well ten.\n\n322\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.644\n&gt;&gt; Ten.\n\n323\n00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:01.520\n&gt;&gt; Alright just make sure\nthat I added that right.\n\n324\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.745\nI don't know why I looked at\nit I was like,is that right?\n\n325\n00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:09.334\n[LAUGH] Hash number, the last number,\nor octet, if you will,\n\n326\n00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:13.923\nin our IP address is gonna look\na little like this, one, two,\n\n327\n00:17:13.923 --> 00:17:16.775\nthree, four, and that right there.\n\n328\n00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:21.700\nAnd then even though I know it's\nkind of a drawn out process here,\n\n329\n00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.328\ncuz I know that if people\nhave been looking at this for\n\n330\n00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:27.280\na while they're like wow\nthat's taking a long time.\n\n331\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.280\nBut if it's the first\ntime you've seen this,\n\n332\n00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.870\nI know it can seem a little daunting.\n\n333\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.570\nKeep in mind that what we just did is we\ntook our decimal representation of an IPB4\n\n334\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.400\naddress and we converted each\noctet totaling the 32 bits\n\n335\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.655\nthat we would see inside of the binary\nformat of your ipp4 address.\n\n336\n00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:48.590\n&gt;&gt; Wes do you have any tips for\nthe people that this is pretty new to for\n\n337\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.420\nthem to be able to do\nsome practice with this?\n\n338\n00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.202\nIs there any ways that can do that?\n\n339\n00:17:53.202 --> 00:17:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely.\n\n340\n00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.970\nHere's the way that I've done it to,\nfor me.\n\n341\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.700\nI took and hand, now the exell spreadsheet\nit's all fine and dandy but that's for\n\n342\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.970\nthe show here because you guys I\ndon't wanna keep transferring over to\n\n343\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:05.990\nthe calculator, right?\n\n344\n00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.900\nDon't do it that way when\nyou're practicing, right?\n\n345\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.990\nI know that you're a good fan\nof handwritten notes, right?\n\n346\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.430\nThat's what I do.\n\n347\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.220\nHandwrite this down,\nwrite down these eight place values.\n\n348\n00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.550\nTake any IP address that you see,\n\n349\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:27.740\nany three digit from zero,\nwell zero is kind of easy.\n\n350\n00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.380\nOne all the way to 254.\n\n351\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.610\n&gt;&gt; 255.\n&gt;&gt; Well 255, which will\n\n352\n00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.120\nbring us into our subnet\nmask cuz we're gonna see it.\n\n353\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.680\nHighest value you can have in an eight bit\noctet is gonna be 255, takes all ones,\n\n354\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.120\nturns them all on.\n\n355\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.006\nAnd if you don't believe me,\nI'm going to show you that cuz\n\n356\n00:18:41.006 --> 00:18:41.617\nwe're gonna talk about subnet masks.\n\n357\n00:18:41.617 --> 00:18:44.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's a great question Dan and\n\n358\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.260\nit's one of the things\nthat I would keep in mind.\n\n359\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.050\nWhen you're practicing this,\ndon't let it overwhelm you.\n\n360\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.570\nI remember the first time we started\ntalking decimal to binary and\n\n361\n00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.175\nbinary to decimal It's kind of like\ngetting into a command line interface and\n\n362\n00:18:56.175 --> 00:18:57.095\nthat's all you have.\n\n363\n00:18:57.095 --> 00:19:00.915\nYour skin starts getting jitters\ncuz you're like can I do this,\n\n364\n00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:05.455\nyou guys can do this just take your time,\nwrite these down take any number and\n\n365\n00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:10.670\njust keep practicing moving it into To\nthe binary and back into the decimal.\n\n366\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.370\nAll right, so that's what we mean when we,\nlet's see here.\n\n367\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.770\nSo when we talked about\nour 32 bit identifier,\n\n368\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.520\nright, being this 32 bit\nbinary address here.\n\n369\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.830\nLet me see if I can do this,\nI'll separate it by the right?\n\n370\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.370\nAnd, let me sure I got that right,\nit looks like I did, yep.\n\n371\n00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.630\nOkay, so here we go.\n\n372\n00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.360\nThat's essentially what we've done here.\n\n373\n00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.000\nWe've taken that address, right?\n\n374\n00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.810\nThat 192.168, and\nthat is wrong by the way, guys,\n\n375\n00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:46.110\nlet me update that,\nthat's supposed to be one.\n\n376\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.200\nNotice that It's the same thing here,\nright?\n\n377\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.130\nNow we just did the slow I\nknow drawn out [LAUGH] process\n\n378\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.030\nof taking each place value, marking them\ndown, and doing the mathematical equation.\n\n379\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.040\nBut if you know what\nthe mathematics are behind it,\n\n380\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.010\nthere's only a couple possibilities.\n\n381\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.580\nThe more you practice this\nthe better you can get out of this.\n\n382\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.110\nNow the next thing I want to do,\n\n383\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.560\nis to make sure that we understand\nthe Subnet mask itself.\n\n384\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.910\nOkay, so we've looked at Binary and\nDecimal conversion.\n\n385\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.990\nNow one of the things that I\nmentioned in an earlier episode,\n\n386\n00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:23.520\nis that the subnet masks have\nto be contiguous 1 bits, right?\n\n387\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.390\nThe subnet mask ultimately is\nwhat helps us to determine what\n\n388\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.720\nthe network portion of address is versus\nwhat the node portion of the address is.\n\n389\n00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.480\nNow I said that very generically\nin the last episode sort here but\n\n390\n00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.660\nwe wanna kind of look we gonna take\nthis a little bit further, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.160\nWhen I apply a subnet\nmask to an IP address.\n\n392\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.620\nYour subnet mask has to be a series\nof continuous 1 bits, okay.\n\n393\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.360\nThey can't have zeros.\n\n394\n00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.230\nDispersed in between the ones.\n\n395\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.550\nAnd that's something to always remember.\n\n396\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:07.690\nNow, in a classful system, see we talked\nabout the classes, A, B, C, D, and E.\n\n397\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:12.840\nIn a classful system,\nwe only had three default subnet masks.\n\n398\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.090\nRight, and those three subnet masks were\nvery easy to tell what was going on.\n\n399\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.270\nIn fact let's kind of look at them again.\n\n400\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.380\nAll right, so looking at subnet masks,\nthese were the ones that we have.\n\n401\n00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.449\nAll right, now, we're gonna talk a little\nbit more about cider notation and\n\n402\n00:21:30.449 --> 00:21:32.400\nwhat it means for us coming up for us.\n\n403\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.500\nBut class lists as they call it today,\nwe have classes that we used to follow.\n\n404\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.300\nWe don't follow them any more,\ncuz they were very wasteful, right?\n\n405\n00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.440\nLemme tell you why,\n\n406\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.210\nnotice that if I applied a subnet\nmask of a class a to an IP address.\n\n407\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.060\nNotice that we have 255?\n\n408\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.750\nWell 255's highest number in any octet,\nall ones,\n\n409\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:57.640\nwould tell me that that very first\noctet would be basically my network id.\n\n410\n00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.580\nWell that leaves me three\ncomplete octets that are what?\n\n411\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.940\nThey're called the node portion.\n\n412\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.450\nSo when we talk about the node portion,\nif I have three octets for\n\n413\n00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.290\nthe node portion, then that means two\nto the power of, how many bits is that?\n\n414\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.600\nThree octets at eight,\neight times three is 24.\n\n415\n00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.580\nTwo to the power of 24 tells me how many\nnodes I can get on a single network.\n\n416\n00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.980\nAnd if you look at that, Dan,\nthat's a pretty impressive number.\n\n417\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.090\n&gt;&gt; I don't know too many organizations\nthat have over 16 million hosts\n\n418\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.065\non their network.\n\n419\n00:22:27.065 --> 00:22:27.860\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n420\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.860\nthese are big organizations.\n\n421\n00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not that they don't exist.\n\n422\n00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Apple's one of them.\n\n423\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:36.060\nApple's had a major class A block for\na very long time,\n\n424\n00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.840\ngoing back to, really,\nthe earliest days of the internet.\n\n425\n00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.670\nProbably not too far after\nARPANET was invented.\n\n426\n00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.590\nBut they've got one big block.\n\n427\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.010\nNow I want you to think about it this\nway,let's look at this,let's go into\n\n428\n00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.678\na class B subnet mask right.\n\n429\n00:22:50.678 --> 00:22:56.819\nYou can see that class B would\nhave been 16 ones right, eight and\n\n430\n00:22:56.819 --> 00:23:03.758\neight, that's 16 gives me two octets\nthat are reserved for the hosts.\n\n431\n00:23:03.758 --> 00:23:09.358\nThat's 16 bits to\nthe power of 16 is 65,536.\n\n432\n00:23:09.358 --> 00:23:12.310\nAnd here is something\nthat I need to mention.\n\n433\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.940\nYou'll notice that everyone of\nthese ends in a 4, why is that?\n\n434\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:24.520\nWell, technically there's 65,536\npossibilities, all right?\n\n435\n00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:30.450\nBut there's only 65,534 addresses\navailable to get the hosts and\n\n436\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.740\nwhy is that?\n\n437\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.700\nHere's another part of IPv4 addressing\nrules that you need to remember.\n\n438\n00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.970\nNot only do nodes have to share the same\nnetwork ID to be on the network,\n\n439\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:39.830\nthe same network.\n\n440\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.270\nDo they have to have a unique node ID and\nshare the same subnet mask?\n\n441\n00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:48.730\nThe very first address in a network\nis usually the 0 address.\n\n442\n00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.168\nThat's called the network ID.\n\n443\n00:23:50.168 --> 00:23:54.069\nThat's what we use to define whether\na computer is on the same network as\n\n444\n00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:54.858\nanother one.\n\n445\n00:23:54.858 --> 00:23:59.363\nNow, the very last address in\na network range cannot be given to\n\n446\n00:23:59.363 --> 00:24:03.450\na host because it's what\ncalled the broadcast address.\n\n447\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.215\nSee, broadcast communications and\n\n448\n00:24:05.215 --> 00:24:09.630\nTCP/IP are when I send one communication\nand everybody on the network hears it.\n\n449\n00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.620\nWell, we have a designated address\nthat's reserved for that purpose, and\n\n450\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.310\nit's the last address\nwithin every network.\n\n451\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.440\nSo, that's why you might\nsee formulas like,\n\n452\n00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.100\nwell, I've got 256\npossibilities with 8-bits, but\n\n453\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.240\nthe tally that I get at the end is\nminus that first and last address.\n\n454\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.218\nSo, you get 254.\n\n455\n00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:31.847\nSo, I kinda want to would explain\nthat a little bit because if\n\n456\n00:24:31.847 --> 00:24:34.581\nany of you guys out there seen\nyour exponential values go west,\n\n457\n00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:36.350\nyou're off by two on every one of these.\n\n458\n00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.180\nWell, actually, I'm not.\n\n459\n00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.601\nI got the first one wrong there.\n\n460\n00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:41.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That first one's actually supposed to\n\n461\n00:24:41.566 --> 00:24:43.029\nbe 214 at the end.\n\n462\n00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:46.760\nSo, I just want you to keep in mind\nthat with the subnet masks and\n\n463\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.660\nthose days apply,\nwe can tell right away, right?\n\n464\n00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.740\nI don't even have to do\nthis binary conversion.\n\n465\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.340\nHowever, when we start\nrepresenting bits and\n\n466\n00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:00.150\nmoving on what's known as a class\nlist system because of the waste.\n\n467\n00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.670\nYou said, well, wait,\nwhat do you mean waste?\n\n468\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.490\nWell, I want you to think about\nthis let's say Dan his company\n\n469\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:11.770\ngets one of these Class B addresses and\nhe's using the default Subnet mask.\n\n470\n00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.380\nBut he only needs 60,000 addresses.\n\n471\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.790\nOr he only needs 10,000 addresses, right?\n\n472\n00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.020\nHe's not gonna go with a class C.\n\n473\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.480\nI want to get 254 hosts\nof 10,000 computers.\n\n474\n00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.810\n&gt;&gt; Can only have\n&gt;&gt; 300 addresses that I need.\n\n475\n00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.740\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n476\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.630\n&gt;&gt; Then I would have to jump to a class B.\n\n477\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.130\n&gt;&gt; Very good point, right?\n\n478\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.260\nSo, if you need 300, 350 addresses,\nyou have to move into a class B,\n\n479\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:37.110\ncuz the class C doesn't have enough\nbits reserved for the node portion.\n\n480\n00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.070\nAnd I'm gonna make it easier on myself for\nmath purposes.\n\n481\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.990\nWhat happens if he needs\nonly 5,000 534 addresses.\n\n482\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.180\nHe can't give the other 60,000 to me.\n\n483\n00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.930\nHe can't sublease, if you will, and\ngive them out to somebody else.\n\n484\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.460\nSo, they're just wasted.\n\n485\n00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:57.170\nThat's why this classful subnet mask and\nclassable system was wasteful, right?\n\n486\n00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.060\nThere was a lot of waste\ngoing on in the Internet.\n\n487\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.620\nSo, what they said is let's just go ahead,\nlet's break down the classes.\n\n488\n00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.430\nWe'll use the classes as a way marker,\nthat'll be kind of like our guide, but\n\n489\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.960\nwe'll break the rules.\n\n490\n00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.400\nWe'll just say, you know what?\n\n491\n00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.290\nNo longer are we gonna be confined to just\nthese configurations, and it helps to\n\n492\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.770\nbasically stall the inevitable depletion\nof the IBB who are address space.\n\n493\n00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.030\nSo, that's one of the reasons\nwe went into a classless system.\n\n494\n00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.630\nNow let's look at the subnet mass.\n\n495\n00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.030\nRemember one of the things that we were\ntalking about is that the highest value in\n\n496\n00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.200\nany octet is 255.\n\n497\n00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.640\nLet's go ahead and prove that.\n\n498\n00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.530\nLet's see if we can do that.\n\n499\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.030\nSo, I'm gonna do a one here, one, one, and\n\n500\n00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.360\none and you can see them adding\nthem up as we go, right.\n\n501\n00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.840\nSo, and why did that do that?\n\n502\n00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.138\nThat is not, I gotta hit enter,\nha-ha, I knew that.\n\n503\n00:26:48.138 --> 00:26:52.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just seeing if you guys did,\n\n504\n00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.330\nyou guys passed.\n\n505\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.670\nSo, notice that I've got 128 plus\n64 plus 32 plus 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.\n\n506\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.230\nAdd and tally all those up It becomes 255.\n\n507\n00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.200\nRight?\nSo, I want you to remember subnet masks\n\n508\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.800\nmust be contiguous once.\n\n509\n00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.980\nAnd the default, you can kinda see that\nnow that you know that 255 is the largest\n\n510\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.370\nEight bit numbers in an octet.\n\n511\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.088\nNotice we have 255.0.0.0.\n\n512\n00:27:18.088 --> 00:27:22.630\nWell does that follow\nthe rules of a subnet mask?\n\n513\n00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.440\nAnd if you say it does, I've got one\noctet, all of ones followed by ones.\n\n514\n00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.680\nIf I look at class b,\nI've got two octets Of 255.\n\n515\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.560\nEight bits on ones, eight bits of ones,\nand then all zeroes after that.\n\n516\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:44.230\nFinally, in Class C we've got eight bits,\neight bits, and eight bits, right.\n\n517\n00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.310\nThat's 24 ones, right.\n\n518\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.680\n24 contiguous ones.\n\n519\n00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.310\nNow you might be asking yourself,\nwell wait a second Wes.\n\n520\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.410\nWhat is this CIDR notation over here?\n\n521\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.860\nI'm not really sure Understanding that.\n\n522\n00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.490\nWhen we move into a class, a classful\nsystem in these default subnet masks were\n\n523\n00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:06.150\nno longer the rule when\nwe get out of that rule,\n\n524\n00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:13.240\nit became easier rather than to write down\n255.255.255.0, we were just say the IP,\n\n525\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.600\nwe'd say the network ID or the IP\naddress and put a /24 at the end of it.\n\n526\n00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.130\nWell what does that /24 mean?\n\n527\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.150\nIt represents the one bits\nin the subnet mask, right?.\n\n528\n00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:29.470\n255s are all ones, I have 24 one\nbits inside of the Subnet Mask.\n\n529\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.790\nOr I can just represent it\ninside the notation as 24 and\n\n530\n00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.500\nall I'm doing is\nrepresenting it by the Bits.\n\n531\n00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.640\nLot easier to write it down that way.\n\n532\n00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.890\nLot easier to work with subnet\nmasks that way as well.\n\n533\n00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.670\nAll right, so, let's go ahead, and\n\n534\n00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.210\nlet's talk about how you know a little\nbit more about the subnet mask.\n\n535\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.460\nAll right, now that I've mentioned the\nfact that we're not following things like\n\n536\n00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.950\nthe Classful system anymore.\n\n537\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.490\nAnd we kind of seen that the 255 defaults,\nwell that's all a bits.\n\n538\n00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.460\nAre those the only subnet masks\nrangers that we're gonna seeing?\n\n539\n00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.330\nWell the answer is no.\n\n540\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.980\nWith the fact that we can\nmove it surround today,\n\n541\n00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.540\nyou might see a series of what they\ncall Subnet Masks rangers like for\n\n542\n00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.960\ninstance It's easy to say all right,\n255.255.255.0.\n\n543\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.660\nI know eight bits eight bits eight bits.\n\n544\n00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.780\nIt's easy to calculate.\n\n545\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:27.640\nWhat happens if I do 255.255.224.0.\n\n546\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.540\nWell, is that a valid subnet mask?\n\n547\n00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.020\nDoesn't follow the rules.\n\n548\n00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.730\nWe'll I don't have to do the eight bits in\neight bits here in the calculator here for\n\n549\n00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.370\nyou, right you guys have seen that.\n\n550\n00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.930\nAll bits turned on, equals 255.\n\n551\n00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:44.755\nBut it's the only submit mass that Value,\nand the answer is no.\n\n552\n00:29:44.755 --> 00:29:49.135\nWhen we went to things like site or\nnotation, and classless systems,\n\n553\n00:29:49.135 --> 00:29:52.915\nwe implement something known as\nvariable length subnet masks.\n\n554\n00:29:52.915 --> 00:29:58.640\nAnd what that means is they don't all have\nto be 255 anymore But if you'll notice,\n\n555\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:04.620\nlet me go ahead and zero these out.\n\n556\n00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.400\nAll right?\n\n557\n00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.160\nDoes 255.255.224 follow\ncontiguous one bits?\n\n558\n00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.650\nI don't know.\nLet's find out in that third octet.\n\n559\n00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.010\nSo, if I turn a one on, I've got a 128.\n\n560\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.430\nIf I turn two on I've got 192.\n\n561\n00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.760\nNotice we've got continuous 1's here.\n\n562\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.920\nSo, so far, that octet is going to follow\n\n563\n00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.606\nthe subnet mask if I were to stop right\nhere follows the rules of the subnet mask.\n\n564\n00:30:28.606 --> 00:30:35.110\nHow about if we put another there,\nI've got a value of 224.\n\n565\n00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.730\nSo, this is a valid subnet mask.\n\n566\n00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.430\nIf I were break this down into the binary,\n\n567\n00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:44.920\nI would have eight ones Eight 1s,\nno 0s, right?\n\n568\n00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:50.650\nAnd then the next octet would\nstart with three contiguous 1s.\n\n569\n00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.520\nSo, this is a valid subnet mask, right?\n\n570\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.230\nSince we're not following\nthe classical system,\n\n571\n00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.640\nwe could move these subnet masks around.\n\n572\n00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.930\nAnd that's what we do when\nit comes to subnetting.\n\n573\n00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.780\nAnd then, so, anything that comes after\nthe ones of the subnet mask is the host\n\n574\n00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.460\nportion because we said,\nanything covered under the one area\n\n575\n00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.430\nis going to be the subnet mask for\nthe network.\n\n576\n00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.050\nIt's going to denote the network portion,\n\n577\n00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.110\nand then after that it's\ngoing to be the host portion.\n\n578\n00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.950\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\nIn fact,\n\n579\n00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.670\nyou know, I've kind of done it\na little bit backwards on and\n\n580\n00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.120\noff here, but yeah If you look at\nthe red portion of this subnet mask,\n\n581\n00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.670\nI can tell right away,\nthat is going to be the host portion.\n\n582\n00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.580\nAnd that is the beauty of the subnet mask.\n\n583\n00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.080\nRight.\nAll I gotta do is look at the ones, and\n\n584\n00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.780\nI can tell what is a portion\nof the network address.\n\n585\n00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.710\nSo, keep in mind that\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n586\n00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.740\nyou have eight valid subnet mask range.\n\n587\n00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.696\nAnd so, on the exam,\nif they ask you what is a valid\n\n588\n00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:45.430\nsubnet mask, right, 224 is in that range.\n\n589\n00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.770\nBut if I put a zero here, Dan,\n\n590\n00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.370\nwould you think would that\nfollow the subnet mask rules?\n\n591\n00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.098\n&gt;&gt; No, it would not.\nIf there's no contiguous 1s.\n\n592\n00:31:51.098 --> 00:31:51.771\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n593\n00:31:51.771 --> 00:31:54.577\nSo it always has to be contiguous 1s and\n\n594\n00:31:54.577 --> 00:31:59.540\nlet me show you a little trick\nhere to remembering these, right.\n\n595\n00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.509\nIf you can count the eight bits on\nyour hands, that makes it really easy.\n\n596\n00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:10.260\n128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255.\n\n597\n00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.390\nMemorize those.\n\n598\n00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.520\nYou want to see what they actually\nlook like in the decimal value?\n\n599\n00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.553\nOne bit notice is,\nactually let's do this one at a time.\n\n600\n00:32:19.553 --> 00:32:24.650\n128, that's one 1 bit, right.\n\n601\n00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.300\nBut if I add 2, 192.\n\n602\n00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.930\nSecond bit I told you.\n\n603\n00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:35.690\nIf I had a third, 224, 240.\n\n604\n00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.813\nNext one should be 248, right.\n\n605\n00:32:38.813 --> 00:32:43.330\nThen we got 252, if I believe\nIf I remember them right, 252.\n\n606\n00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.748\n&gt;&gt; Adding starts getting\neasier at this point [LAUGH].\n\n607\n00:32:44.748 --> 00:32:48.635\n&gt;&gt; It is really easy at this point\nonce you start memorizing it.\n\n608\n00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:51.190\n[LAUGH] And\nI put one more 1 in there, right?\n\n609\n00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.440\nWe still have those contiguous 1 bits.\n\n610\n00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.500\nSo if I was to say any of these\nnumbers that I've showed you,\n\n611\n00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.890\n128, that's a valid subnet mask, right?\n\n612\n00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:02.640\nIn this case, 254.\n\n613\n00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.320\nThat's a valid subnet mask.\n\n614\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.040\nI have two octets of all ones and\nthen I have that third octet is how many?\n\n615\n00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.230\nIt's seven ones, right?\n\n616\n00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:20.660\nAnd then finally like we've already seen,\napparently\n\n617\n00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.548\nI've got some kind of anyways, apparently\nI've got something going on here.\n\n618\n00:33:24.548 --> 00:33:28.708\nYeah, so anyhow when you add the two,\n\n619\n00:33:28.708 --> 00:33:34.819\nthe last one that I could just\ntell you [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK].\n\n620\n00:33:34.819 --> 00:33:36.879\nSo, one plus 254, what, equals to 255.\n\n621\n00:33:36.879 --> 00:33:40.740\nSo, keep in mind you also see\nvalid subnet mask ranges, right.\n\n622\n00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.060\nSo when you see those numbers,\nsometimes you'll see like charts and\n\n623\n00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:49.240\nstuff like that, 255.254.0.0, well,\nthat 254 is a valid subnet mask range.\n\n624\n00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.170\nKnow those invalid subnet\nmask ranges as well and\n\n625\n00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.550\nyou'll be doing really good on the exam.\n\n626\n00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, awesome stuff so far.\n\n627\n00:33:57.010 --> 00:34:01.380\nWe're starting to wade a little bit out\nfurther into the deeper end of the pool\n\n628\n00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.080\nand I know that Wes is really\nsetting us up for our next episode.\n\n629\n00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.130\nThat's right, we're continuing on\na little more IP addressing and scheming.\n\n630\n00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:13.510\nSubnet masks and subnets and [INAUDIBLE]\nand it's just a joyous good time.\n\n631\n00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.490\nIt can start to get a little difficult,\nbut\n\n632\n00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:20.030\nWes, I think you've done a great job\nof helping us keep our foundation.\n\n633\n00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:26.250\nKeep our legs underneath this, so\nthat we're prepared for the next episode.\n\n634\n00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.220\nThat being said, it looks like\nwe're out of time for this one.\n\n635\n00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.830\nSo I do look forward to seeing you there.\n\n636\n00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.110\nI look forward to seeing\nyou guys there as well.\n\n637\n00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.390\nAnd with that being said,\nit's time for us to sign off.\n\n638\n00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:37.100\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n639\n00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.246\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n640\n00:34:38.246 --> 00:34:45.661\n[MUSIC]\n\n641\n00:34:45.661 --> 00:34:48.195\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK].\n\n4\n00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:12.160\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.685\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:18.085\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:22.615\nin today's episode, well we are moving on\nwith more on our CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:27.315\nAnd of course coming back for yet another\ncontinuation on IP address scheming and\n\n10\n00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.980\nsubnet maths and\nall that wonderful goodness.\n\n11\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.640\nOur good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.990\nWes man, how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.820\nYeah, we're definitely working on\na little mini series here for sure.\n\n15\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.531\nWell we're not done.\n\n16\n00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.220\nAnd it's been an important topic.\n\n17\n00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.879\nAnd it's definitely one\nthat can be a little bit\n\n18\n00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240\nintimidating the first time you see it.\n\n19\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.331\nI know it was for\nmyself when I first got into networks.\n\n20\n00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.001\nDan, I'm sure at some point\nyou had to deal with it in\n\n21\n00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.020\nyour network administration as well.\n\n22\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.250\nSometimes it's not the fun,\n\n23\n00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.460\nit's not all the fun that we want\nwhen we think about networks.\n\n24\n00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.540\nBut it's definitely one of the most\nimportant concepts that you need to\n\n25\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.110\nunderstand because as an administrator,\nyou very well could be one of the ones\n\n26\n00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.060\nthat are that are doing this when you\nare supporting your networks too.\n\n27\n00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.770\nSo we left off and\nwe talked about the subnet mask.\n\n28\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.960\nOne of the things that we had\nmentioned with the subnet mask,\n\n29\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.440\nis that it has to be contiguous one bits.\n\n30\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.628\nAnd that with classless systems that we\nfollow today, we still use those class A,\n\n31\n00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:28.230\nB and C, if you will as a way marker,\nthe D range, that's all multicast.\n\n32\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.530\nEvery computer uses those\nIP addresses in that range.\n\n33\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.670\nSo we still use them as way markers.\n\n34\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.650\nBut we're not confined\nto the classes anymore.\n\n35\n00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.486\nSubnet masl don't follow those\ndefault subnet mask, right?\n\n36\n00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:48.667\n255.0.0.0 down to 255.255.0.0.\n\n37\n00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:50.866\nThen finally, the last one class A, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.530\nThree octets of 255 and a 0.\n\n39\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.440\nWell we can move those bits\naround now in order to make more\n\n40\n00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.465\nefficient utilization of\nthe address space that we have.\n\n41\n00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.580\nSo we have to be aware of the different\n\n42\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.170\nvalues that you could find within a subnet\nmask and remember what I told you.\n\n43\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.150\nYou have eight of those valid\nsubnet mask ranges that\n\n44\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.830\nstill allow you to follow\nthat contiguous one bit.\n\n45\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.960\nRemember 128, it's a 192, 224.\n\n46\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.350\nYou have 240, 248, 252, 254 and 255.\n\n47\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.200\nSo if you see those in a subnet mask on\nthe exam and there aren't any other 0's.\n\n48\n00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.290\nPrior to those values that you know\nyou have valid subnet mask range.\n\n49\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.550\nSo we wanna talk a little bit more\nabout the subnet mask because\n\n50\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.510\nwe've also mention that the subnet\nmask allows us to tell what a network\n\n51\n00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.500\nportion is from our node portion, right.\n\n52\n00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.300\nAnd we take a look at.\n\n53\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.790\nGet a little diagram here, right.\n\n54\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.570\nWe said that, hey it allows us to know\nwhat the network bits are, right,\n\n55\n00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.900\nin an IP address from the host portion.\n\n56\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.040\nAll right, well that's good\nto know the dividing line.\n\n57\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.620\nBut what it also allows us to do, and\n\n58\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.020\nI've kinda generically said it allows\nus to find out what network we're on.\n\n59\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.890\nBut more importantly and more technically,\n\n60\n00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.110\nit allows us to find out what\nthe network ID is, right?\n\n61\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.100\nSo let's see here, yeah, so\nI've said, for instance, right,\n\n62\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.200\nnetwork A, I didn't mention it early on,\nbut this is a network ID.\n\n63\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.195\nRight, and you can see\n255.255.255.0 subnet mask, right.\n\n64\n00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:28.055\nI also told you about the silent notation,\ntypically if we write a network down,\n\n65\n00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:32.916\nwe usually just do the /24, remember\nthat is 24 one bits in the subnet mask,\n\n66\n00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:36.710\nbut how is it that I know that\nthat's the network ID, right.\n\n67\n00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.382\nIf I know what the dividing line is,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:41.360\nWe could color-code it all we want.\n\n69\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.050\nBut I want you to notice something here.\n\n70\n00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.340\nIn this last octet that we\nknow is the node portion?\n\n71\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.720\nWhy is it all 0s?\n\n72\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.110\nWhat is going on there?\n\n73\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.248\nOkay, and that's a process called ANDing.\n\n74\n00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:58.860\nBinary ANDing, now believe it or not\nevery time your computer sense traffic.\n\n75\n00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.700\nIt does the binary ANDing process\non the destination to figure out.\n\n76\n00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.860\nHey, is it even on the same network as me.\n\n77\n00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.833\nSo it takes that subnet mask and\nit applies to its own IP address and\n\n78\n00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.086\nit does the dividing here.\n\n79\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.790\nBut it needs to know what\nthe network ID is, and\n\n80\n00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.300\nthat's what the subnet\nmask also helps us to do.\n\n81\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.790\nIt helps us through the ANDing\nprocess to remove the portion\n\n82\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.490\nof the address that we really don't need,\nif we're looking at just the network.\n\n83\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.928\nRight, remember I told\nyou the street name,\n\n84\n00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:28.310\nif I need to know what\nstreet the house is on.\n\n85\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.920\nI don't care about the house number.\n\n86\n00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.670\nWell, if I need to know\nwhat network portion.\n\n87\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.290\nNetwork I am on,\nI don't care about the node portion.\n\n88\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.210\nSo when we apply the segment mask,\ngo through an ANDing process.\n\n89\n00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.280\nIt removes the node portion and in binary\nwhat you're left with is the network ID.\n\n90\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.371\nIt identifies the network\nthat all the nodes are on or\n\n91\n00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.120\nmaybe even misconfiguration, maybe you've\nmissed configure a node and you find out.\n\n92\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.810\nLook at it the node portion,\nit's not on the same street,\n\n93\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.280\nit's not within the same network and\nI gotta do some reconfiguration.\n\n94\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.190\nSo that's what we're gonna look at here.\n\n95\n00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.320\nLet's go ahead, and\nwhat we'll do is we'll switch over to that\n\n96\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.300\nspreadsheet I was using earlier here and\nwe wanna look at the ANDing process.\n\n97\n00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.428\nNow, ANDing is fairly easy,\nyou only have two possibilities, right?\n\n98\n00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:15.500\nEverything in binary only\nhas two possibilities and\n\n99\n00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.460\nthis doesn't really change anything,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.050\nWe're not doing some magical voodoo\nhere that now we're gonna get more\n\n101\n00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.412\npossibilities in 1 and 0.\n\n102\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.820\nSo remember this.\n\n103\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.220\nThe only thing when you do ANDing\nthat can equal a 1 is a 1 and a 1.\n\n104\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.260\nAny other combination that throws\na 0 in there is always gonna be 0's.\n\n105\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.850\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n106\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.683\nIf I take that 10 portion of that octet,\nremember what we did,\n\n107\n00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:46.897\nwe have 192.168.1., what was it,\n\n108\n00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:52.314\nin this one I don't remember what it is,\n224, 225.\n\n109\n00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:54.474\nAnd again,\nremember the place values, right.\n\n110\n00:05:54.474 --> 00:05:56.990\nKinda put the place values right in\nmy head there, kinda adding them up.\n\n111\n00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.940\nThat's why it is important\nto remember those places.\n\n112\n00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.620\nSo I'm gonna take the 1 portion here.\n\n113\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.760\nWhy is the 1 portion still down here,\nbut yet this octet is zeroed out.\n\n114\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.710\nRight, well let's start\nwith this one right here,\n\n115\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.740\nkinda find out why did that make its way\nthrough in the final calculation here.\n\n116\n00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.440\nSo if i take for instance in binary a 1,\n\n117\n00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.800\nright, remember that our subnet\nmask is contiguous one bits.\n\n118\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.100\nAnd remember that it's under that portion.\n\n119\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.010\nWell, we're gonna take just this\noctet right here, and we're gonna AND\n\n120\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.380\nit to that portion of the subnet\nmask to find out what value we get.\n\n121\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.890\nSo you guys know how to\ndo the ANDing process.\n\n122\n00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.990\nAll right, so there's our 1, right?\n\n123\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.151\nA 0 and a 1?\n\n124\n00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.714\nRemember, a 0 ANDed at all,\njust make it easy, right?\n\n125\n00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:47.300\nI used to say, well, a 1 and a 0 equals\na 0 and a Zero and a one equals a zero.\n\n126\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.700\nLet's make it easier.\n\n127\n00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.530\nYou throw a 0 and an AND,\nand it equals a 0, period.\n\n128\n00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.736\nIt doesn't matter where it\nis in the address, right.\n\n129\n00:06:54.736 --> 00:06:59.628\nSo rather than getting too\nrepetitious on this, a 0 AND\n\n130\n00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:02.978\ninto a 1 in the subnet mask equals 0.\n\n131\n00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:06.025\nAnd we're gonna repeat the process, right.\n\n132\n00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:10.940\n1 is one of the easiest ones to do, that's\nwhy it's a good one to leap frog of off.\n\n133\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.320\nBut notice when I get down to 1,\na 1 and a 1 equal 1.\n\n134\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.290\nThey call that following through.\n\n135\n00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.790\nAnytime you AND\n1's to a portion of your IP address.\n\n136\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.242\nYou'll notice that the value\ntypically stays the same.\n\n137\n00:07:25.242 --> 00:07:28.631\nNotice I have 192 up here,\n\n138\n00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:33.680\n11000000, a 1 and a 1 equal a 1.\n\n139\n00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.210\nA 1 and a 1 equal a 1.\n\n140\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.630\nI'm not gonna do this for all 8 bits.\n\n141\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.683\nYou guys are gonna be, just please stop.\n\n142\n00:07:38.683 --> 00:07:40.620\nSo it falls right through.\n\n143\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.760\nThe same things goes here.\n\n144\n00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.480\nThis falls right through.\n\n145\n00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.370\nSame thing with the third octet,\nit falls right through.\n\n146\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.590\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I can hear the questions\nprobably turning in the minds of\n\n147\n00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.802\nour viewers as we speak.\n\n148\n00:07:51.802 --> 00:07:56.163\nIf the subnet mask is 255.255.255, and\n\n149\n00:07:56.163 --> 00:08:00.831\nthat just basically says\nwell here's your network ID.\n\n150\n00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:05.789\nSo why do go through this whole ANDing\nprocess, what's the purpose of it?\n\n151\n00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:07.066\n&gt;&gt; That is a great point.\n\n152\n00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:13.422\nWhat happens when your sub net mask\nstops right in the middle of an octet.\n\n153\n00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:16.030\nSee it's easy to remember\nif it's all ones but\n\n154\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.420\nif we check out my diagram here too,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.500\nLet's say that I take a subnet mask.\n\n156\n00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.700\nAnd it's 240.\n\n157\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.551\nWhat is that?\n\n158\n00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:29.740\n128.192.224.\n\n159\n00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.330\n&gt;&gt; 248.\n\n160\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:30.930\n&gt;&gt; 240.\nOkay.\n\n161\n00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.280\nYeah, it is 240.\n\n162\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.000\nSometimes I doubt myself here.\n\n163\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; 240 here\n&gt;&gt; Right, well,\n\n164\n00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.610\nnow I don't really have an easy\nway to tell what falls through or\n\n165\n00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.410\nwhat doesn't fall through\njust by looking at it.\n\n166\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.700\nSee, when you use the default subnet mask,\nit was easy.\n\n167\n00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.040\nJust like Dan said, you look at it and\n\n168\n00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.290\nI don't really care what\nthe binary ending is.\n\n169\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.550\nIn fact, I don't care about any of this.\n\n170\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.690\nI know that the first three octets,\nfirst two, first one octet is going to be,\n\n171\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.730\nthe first octet will\nbe my network address.\n\n172\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.820\nIt's when the subnet mask isn't so\n\n173\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.460\ncleanly divided at the end of\nan octet that we need to know.\n\n174\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.580\nLet's go ahead and look and see real quick\nwhy this is actually following through\n\n175\n00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.260\nhere or isn't following through.\n\n176\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.450\nWhy is that zeroing.\n\n177\n00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.380\nOut.\n\n178\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.150\nWell let's go ahead and I'm going to\nput any number here, any number, right?\n\n179\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:25.112\nWe'll go ahead we'll put 1, we'll put 1,\n\n180\n00:09:25.112 --> 00:09:30.341\n0, 1, I'm just making it up as we go,\nright?\n\n181\n00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:31.548\nAll right.\n\n182\n00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:36.140\nNow my mask will go ahead, we'll make it\neasy first before we start getting into\n\n183\n00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.480\nthe variable links subnet mask cuz that's\nwhere subnetting's gonna come in handy.\n\n184\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:46.580\nAll right, and\nactually let's make sure that this is 0.\n\n185\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:52.170\nI want all of these zeroed out cuz\nremember that's the node portion.\n\n186\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.180\nThe node portion is where the zeroes are.\n\n187\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.720\nSo what we need to do is we\nactually need to zero this out.\n\n188\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.760\nLet me go ahead and do that.\n\n189\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.790\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n190\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.770\n&gt;&gt; You like that.\nThat's a great character.\n\n191\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.160\nOkay, so notice that, again, in this last\nportion of the octet, it's all zeros.\n\n192\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.250\nWe don't have our 255s.\n\n193\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.250\nThat represents this portion of\nthe subnet mask in that octet.\n\n194\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.490\nNow why is it that we have all zeroes?\n\n195\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.750\nWell, notice that I told you\na zero ended in the equation.\n\n196\n00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.690\nI don't care where it is.\n\n197\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.160\nI don't care if it's up here and\nyou end it to a one down here, right?\n\n198\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.380\nI don't care if the zero, where it is.\n\n199\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.490\nAll right?\n\n200\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.110\nIf I go through this ending process a one\nand a zero is going to be a zero right?\n\n201\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.810\nOne and a zero is going to be a zero.\n\n202\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.940\nAs you see, as we go through, since\nthere's zeros here on the node portion\n\n203\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.190\nit essentially clears that\nnode portion completely.\n\n204\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.519\nWe sometimes say that the subnet mask,\nyes it shows us our\n\n205\n00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:57.930\nnetwork ID by removing\nthe portion that we don't need.\n\n206\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.050\nTo figure out if we're on\nthe same network, right?\n\n207\n00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.190\nJust like if I removed the house\nnumber from the street address,\n\n208\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.500\nwhat I'm left with is the street, and\n\n209\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.300\nI can figure out of these house\nare on the same street or not, right?\n\n210\n00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.140\nSo the same principle applies.\n\n211\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.760\nSo when I look something like this and\nI say.\n\n212\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.355\nClass alright,\nthen I have an IP address of,\n\n213\n00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:21.730\nwe'll go ahead,\nlet me copy this down here real quick.\n\n214\n00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.600\nMaybe, right.\n\n215\n00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.835\nAnd if I say I have an IP\naddress of 192.168.0.10,\n\n216\n00:11:28.835 --> 00:11:34.390\nright, and\nI put that 255.255.255 subnet mask on it.\n\n217\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.290\nWell, I know that the first\nthree octets are gonna be\n\n218\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.520\npart of the network portion, right.\n\n219\n00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.110\nIn that last octet, that's all zeros\nIf I end it, it's gonna remove that.\n\n220\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.240\nRight.\nSo, if we did that ending process,\n\n221\n00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.350\nwe would be left with what?\n\n222\n00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.990\nThe network ID.\n\n223\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.010\nAnd that's what I'm showing\nyou here is the network ID\n\n224\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.240\nafter that ending process is happened.\n\n225\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.350\nSo, your computers do that when they need\nto figure out, am I on the same network?\n\n226\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.500\nWell guess what, I'm just gonna\ntake whatever my IP address is,\n\n227\n00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.130\nI'm gonna apply the subnet mask and\nwhat's left,\n\n228\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.990\nI'm gonna compare that to the destination\ninformation on the packet itself.\n\n229\n00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.580\nIf they share the same network ID,\nthen there's no reason to use a router.\n\n230\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.770\nI don't have to send it to another\nnetwork cuz it's on my network.\n\n231\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.115\nBut if we do the ending process,\nand this is our network ID,\n\n232\n00:12:26.115 --> 00:12:31.600\nright, but we do the ending process and\nwe get anything other than this,\n\n233\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.230\nmy computer says no, no,\nno I don't know what to do with that.\n\n234\n00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.790\nThat's not here on the local network.\n\n235\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.160\nI can't just call out somebody and\nsay hey take this traffic.\n\n236\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.870\nSo what do I gotta do?\n\n237\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.540\nThat's is at the point that it sends it to\nsomething known as the default gateway.\n\n238\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.480\nAnd the default gateway is the typically\nthe router that's connected\n\n239\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.380\nto your local network that's\nthe gateway to another network.\n\n240\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.440\nAll right.\nThe default gateway here,\n\n241\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.460\nit leads you to any other network but\nyour own.\n\n242\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.700\nAnd that's what we have routers for.\n\n243\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.260\nAll right, so, again, subnet mask.\n\n244\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:11.110\nThe ending process it helps us to\nfind out what our network ID is and\n\n245\n00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.200\nkeep in mind that it does that\nby removing that node portion.\n\n246\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.110\nOnce I have this right here I can\ntell by bringing that back into,\n\n247\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.890\nfrom the binary back into\nthe decimal what the network ID is.\n\n248\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.870\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, could we see that with one\nof those variable length subnet masks?\n\n249\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n250\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:30.490\nIn fact, let's go ahead.\n\n251\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.750\nWe'll do that very thing right here.\n\n252\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.340\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nlet's switch it over and we'll do that.\n\n253\n00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.420\nI'll tell you what, give me a subnet mask.\n\n254\n00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay, go with how about 224.\n\n255\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.170\n&gt;&gt; 224, okay.\nAll right,\n\n256\n00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:48.330\nthat'll be the one I messed up right out\nthe get go [LAUGH] so here we got 224.\n\n257\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.680\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.030\nSo Dan says, wait a second, Wes.\n\n259\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.060\nWhat happens if,\nlet's put some context on this too.\n\n260\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.905\nThis would have been,\n\n261\n00:13:57.905 --> 00:14:03.146\nlet's say 225.225.255.,\n\n262\n00:14:03.146 --> 00:14:08.315\nlet's say, 224.0, all right?\n\n263\n00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:13.270\nWell, now it's not quite so\neasy to tell, well, wait a second here.\n\n264\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.230\nWhere does that stop in my IP address?\n\n265\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.250\nRight.\n\n266\n00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.660\nWell, it stops in the first two bits.\n\n267\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.040\nSo what do we do here.\n\n268\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.770\nWill take that same exact\nnumber that we just did.\n\n269\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.440\nAnd we'll go ahead and\n\n270\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.510\ndo the binary ending with one\nthese that are not default mask.\n\n271\n00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.580\nAll right so if you look one on a one.\n\n272\n00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.210\nEquals a one.\n\n273\n00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.140\nOne and a one equals a one.\n\n274\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.720\nNotice we have the one and the zero.\n\n275\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.000\nIt might not be the best example in fact,\n\n276\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.350\ncuz if you look here,\nthe ending still stays the same.\n\n277\n00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.540\nA one and a zero, zero and\na zero, one and a zero.\n\n278\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.630\nRemember, any time you see a zero,\njust make it easy.\n\n279\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.020\nThe rest are going to be zeroes.\n\n280\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.200\nAll right.\n\n281\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.110\nSo this portion being\nremoved as our node portion,\n\n282\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.830\nthis one bits being our network\nportion means essentially that,\n\n283\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.010\nlet's say that we did have this\nset on a 192 address, right.\n\n284\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.820\nJust like we did before.\n\n285\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.060\nWe compare top the address\nthat we've been working with.\n\n286\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.630\n192.168 and I know I jump back\nin forth between a one and\n\n287\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.040\na zero in that third octet.\n\n288\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.240\nBut we'll say this is what we have.\n\n289\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.380\nAll right.\nLet me bump up that font a little bit.\n\n290\n00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:30.080\nNow we apply this subnet mask,\nwhen we had the default subnet\n\n291\n00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:35.741\nmask it was very easy to\ntell that the network ID was\n\n292\n00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:41.345\n192.168.1.0, but\n\n293\n00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:47.328\nit is not that way any more because we are\nnot dealing with class for subnet masks.\n\n294\n00:15:47.328 --> 00:15:49.570\nSo since we took 24 right?\n\n295\n00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.543\nAnd I tell you what we will go ahead.\n\n296\n00:15:53.355 --> 00:15:55.329\nAnd we'll change this to that third octet.\n\n297\n00:15:59.299 --> 00:16:03.390\nAll right, so\nlet's say in the third octet right.\n\n298\n00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:03.994\nWe're dealing with the the one.\n\n299\n00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:09.986\nAll right, so let's go ahead and we'll\nsee what the 224 has done for us, right.\n\n300\n00:16:09.986 --> 00:16:13.794\nWe had the 255.255.255, right, and\n\n301\n00:16:13.794 --> 00:16:18.426\nthat let us with a network\nID of 192 2.168.1.0.\n\n302\n00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:20.517\nNow we got the 224.\n\n303\n00:16:20.517 --> 00:16:22.154\nWhat is left, right?\n\n304\n00:16:22.154 --> 00:16:26.928\nWell technically,\nwhat's that done is that's changed\n\n305\n00:16:26.928 --> 00:16:31.438\nour network ID to 192.168.0.0, right.\n\n306\n00:16:31.438 --> 00:16:35.450\nBecause if I look at this\nthird octet doing the anding,\n\n307\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.100\nthere's nothing left, right.\n\n308\n00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:44.990\nIf you look, again not to bore you guys\nthese columns all have zeros in the next.\n\n309\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.550\nSo guess what, their final and\nended values gonna be zero.\n\n310\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.690\nWe got that last little one right there\nbut we're ending it to a zero, so\n\n311\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.710\nguess what?\n\n312\n00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.680\nIt changes to a zero.\n\n313\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.934\nSo if I put this back into the third octet\nthere it is essentially tells me that I\n\n314\n00:16:59.934 --> 00:17:07.270\nhave 192.168.0.0 and this is what\ncomes back to dance question earlier.\n\n315\n00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.340\nWhy would I even do\nanything crazy like this?\n\n316\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.620\nWell if you're dealing with default subnet\nmass, you won't you don't really need to.\n\n317\n00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.560\nBut since we don't follow the classroom\nsystem anymore strictly there\n\n318\n00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.300\nmight be a time like this when you get\none of this variable link subnet mask and\n\n319\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.830\nyou can identify what the dividing one is,\nright.\n\n320\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.000\nIs only as easy as that, so you have to go\nto the binary, you have to look and say,\n\n321\n00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.110\nokay, I see the first two\nbits up to 24 means those\n\n322\n00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.630\nfirst two bits are my network portion and\nthis is my node portion.\n\n323\n00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.510\nAnd I have to figure out what the decimal\nvalue is by doing the binary ending here.\n\n324\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.350\nSo binary ending is\nvery,very important and\n\n325\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.120\nit's something that we\nneed to be aware of.\n\n326\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.350\nOne of the things that I always want you\nto remember, that when you're doing binary\n\n327\n00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.590\nadding a lot of times you only have\nto isolate, you do octet isolation.\n\n328\n00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.450\nJust look at the octet,\nwhere the action's at if you will, right.\n\n329\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.570\nI don't need to worry about\nthe first two octets.\n\n330\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.240\n255.255, I know that's\npart of the network ID.\n\n331\n00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.130\n&gt;&gt; Pretty simple.\n\n332\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.725\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n333\n00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:10.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what did we have to do?\n\n334\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.900\nIn the example that we're showing you,\nwe had to look at the 224 octet,\n\n335\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.860\ncuz it wasn't so easy.\n\n336\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.740\nSo that's where the action is,\nand that's what you'll focus on.\n\n337\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.870\nAnd the same thing applies when you go\ninto something like subnetting, all right.\n\n338\n00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.720\nNow what is subnetting for us?\n\n339\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.100\nNow subnetting is just taking\na larger network like for\n\n340\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.720\ninstance the network that I've got here,\nall right.\n\n341\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.300\nSomewhere around here.\n\n342\n00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.760\nAll right, parked around here somewhere\nand I take this network, right.\n\n343\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.420\nA larger network and I divide it\ninto a smaller network, all right?\n\n344\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.750\nWell let's go ahead and\nlet's see kinda what that looks like.\n\n345\n00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.790\nNow, we're gonna go ahead,\nand I wanna tell you,\n\n346\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.340\nwhen we're subnetting, all right.\n\n347\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.320\nWe're typically dividing that\nlast octet right here for us.\n\n348\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.620\nNow, not always, not always.\n\n349\n00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.710\nBut a lot of times when you're\ndoing you're subnetting,\n\n350\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:03.600\nyou are going to have what they\nconsider like a fixed range, right?\n\n351\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.230\nSo if I start out with\n192.168.0.0 with a /24.\n\n352\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.160\nI can't necessarily go to a 23.\n\n353\n00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.790\nAgain, you can depending\non what we're trying to do.\n\n354\n00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.100\nIf you try to do like we\ntalked about earlier.\n\n355\n00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.950\nIn another episode we talked\nabout route summarization\n\n356\n00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:20.970\nthat's going the opposite way.\n\n357\n00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.180\nThat's taking more small networks, right.\n\n358\n00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.530\nSummarizing the routes and\nmaking them look like a bigger network.\n\n359\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.070\nNow we're going the opposite way.\n\n360\n00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.240\nWe're taking a bigger network and\nwe're gonna start to slice it up.\n\n361\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.870\nLet's see what that looks like here.\n\n362\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.150\nIn fact, I got a little\ndiagram somewhere around here.\n\n363\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.560\nSubnetting, there we go.\n\n364\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.390\nRemember our place values, all right.\n\n365\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:48.400\nIf we're gonna subnet, we're gonna work\nin that octet that had the last octet.\n\n366\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.279\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's see what that looks like,\n\n367\n00:19:51.279 --> 00:19:53.670\nthe network ID at least\ninside of our binary.\n\n368\n00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.550\nRemember in our last octet,\nwe're dealing with the host bits and\n\n369\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.730\nthat's something I should probably\nmention too, not take for granted, right.\n\n370\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.150\nWhen you're subnetting,\n\n371\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.060\nyou have a set of network bits\nalready defined by the subnet mask.\n\n372\n00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.710\nSo what do you have to divide?\n\n373\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.390\nYou have host bits.\n\n374\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:16.980\nSo when we do subnetting, what we do is\nwe start to move like classless variable\n\n375\n00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:23.240\nlength, we start to move and borrow bits\nfrom the host to divide up our networks.\n\n376\n00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:29.960\nSo if I start with a classful subnet mask,\n\n377\n00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.640\nand again, this is the last octet that\nwe're dealing with, and I'll write this\n\n378\n00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.890\nout make it a little bit easier to\nkinda see what's going on, right?\n\n379\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:42.890\nIf I have an address of let's say\n\n380\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:48.449\n192.168.0.0 and\n\n381\n00:20:48.449 --> 00:20:53.570\nit is a /24, all right?\n\n382\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.430\nI can divide this up by that last octet.\n\n383\n00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.223\nNotice that with /24,\nthe first 24 bits of an IP address or\n\n384\n00:21:04.223 --> 00:21:07.670\nthe network are all fixed that\napart from the network ID.\n\n385\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:14.220\nThat means I get to work with\nthis last octet and I can add\n\n386\n00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.420\nsome of those [INAUDIBLE] I guess I should\nsay some of those host bits and turn\n\n387\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.650\nthem into network bits, thereby creating\nadditional smaller networks, all right?\n\n388\n00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.010\nSo let's go ahead and do that, all right?\n\n389\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.940\nSo this is that portion, that fourth\noctet there, this is that portion of that\n\n390\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.150\noctet that is already host bit,\nso it's already zeroed out.\n\n391\n00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.550\nRemember in your subnet\nmask that host portion or\n\n392\n00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:43.580\nnode portion are all zeros but we're\ngonna start to do is we're gonna start to\n\n393\n00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.800\nborrow bits from that host portion.\n\n394\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.140\nWe're gonna turn them into network bits.\n\n395\n00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.500\nThese network bits isolated\ndown become your divisions.\n\n396\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.070\nThey become your subnets.\n\n397\n00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.680\nThose bits that you turn on.\n\n398\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.340\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n399\n00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:04.809\nSo if I decide that in that last octet,\nI want to turn on just one bit, all right.\n\n400\n00:22:04.809 --> 00:22:09.030\nThen that means that\nthat bit just above that,\n\n401\n00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:13.190\nis now part of the network, all right.\n\n402\n00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:17.270\nNow that I borrowed that bit I want you\nto think about possibilities, all right?\n\n403\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:21.001\nWith every time we add a bit,\nthat's right.\n\n404\n00:22:21.001 --> 00:22:23.780\n[LAUGH] Every time we\nadd a bit what happens\n\n405\n00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.890\nis we basically increase\nthe possibilities, right?\n\n406\n00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.960\nSo with this one bit\nturned into a network bit\n\n407\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.290\nwhat two possibilities do I have\nin that place value, right?\n\n408\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.930\nWell I've got the, I could have a zero or\n\n409\n00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.830\nI could have a possibility of a one,\nall right.\n\n410\n00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.050\nThese possibilities that we have,\n\n411\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.940\nthey end up becoming our networks,\nour additional networks.\n\n412\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.530\nAnd let me show you what i mean,\nall right.\n\n413\n00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:55.882\nIf I fill the rest of these\nin with zeroes, all right.\n\n414\n00:22:57.742 --> 00:23:04.190\nAnd we take these numbers out of\nthe decimal or out of the binary value.\n\n415\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.350\nYou're gonna see that what we're\nleft with is we have a zero.\n\n416\n00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Boy, that is hard to see.\n\n417\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.380\nThere we go.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n418\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.320\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n419\n00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.530\nNow it's easier to see.\n\n420\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.880\nWe have a zero here.\n\n421\n00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.190\nAnd if I take this number,\n\n422\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.600\nand add it up to put it back into\nthe decimal value, I'll see that,\n\n423\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.350\nwell this is one of my favorites\n[INAUDIBLE], 128 [LAUGH], all right?\n\n424\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.270\nAnd with that, let's go ahead and\nwe'll throw that in there.\n\n425\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:35.060\n128, I now have a couple of possibilities.\n\n426\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:40.220\nNow this possibilities are known\nas our additional networks or\n\n427\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.810\nmore importantly what we call\nour network ids, all right.\n\n428\n00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.970\nSo let me show you what this looks like\nif we were to take this number and\n\n429\n00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.740\nmake it a these two possibilities here.\n\n430\n00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.120\nSo we'll take those two possibilities\nthat we've just created here and\n\n431\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.290\nwe'll see what they look like.\n\n432\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.384\nThese actually,\nthese binary representations here.\n\n433\n00:23:59.384 --> 00:24:04.256\nThese binary bits they actually represent\nthe two networks that we've just created\n\n434\n00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:07.083\nout of that one bit and\nthose two possibilities.\n\n435\n00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:11.332\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll type our 192 here.\n\n436\n00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:17.910\nWe'll go ahead and use that and\nthat is the first one.\n\n437\n00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.352\nBut, what we need to understand\nis since we've added that bit,\n\n438\n00:24:21.352 --> 00:24:23.407\nthe subnet mask is no longer the same.\n\n439\n00:24:23.407 --> 00:24:26.274\nSince we added a bit, it's now a /25.\n\n440\n00:24:26.274 --> 00:24:28.949\nWe've buried the length\nof the subnet Mask.\n\n441\n00:24:28.949 --> 00:24:34.475\nThe other network ID that we've created\n\n442\n00:24:34.475 --> 00:24:40.010\nhere is 192.168.0.128.\n\n443\n00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:46.500\nNow I want to be very careful with\nour understanding of this, all right?\n\n444\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.998\nThese are network IDs, okay?\n\n445\n00:24:49.998 --> 00:24:55.185\nOne of the things that I told you is that,\nwhen you are using network,\n\n446\n00:24:55.185 --> 00:24:59.350\nyou have two addresses\nthat you can't give out.\n\n447\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.630\nI said it's the very first\naddress in the network and\n\n448\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.360\nit's the very last address in the network.\n\n449\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.850\nWell, you can find that out in\nthe decimal, or excuse me in the binary,\n\n450\n00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:13.170\njust by looking at, well, what is\nthe bits that are part of the network?\n\n451\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.610\nThese are the host bits.\n\n452\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.940\nNow when I say those, the first address,\nhow do we identify the first address?\n\n453\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.270\nAll zeroes in the node portion,\nthat's the very first address.\n\n454\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.355\nThat's what we see right here,\nright, these binary values.\n\n455\n00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:33.474\nThese binary or these decimal\nrepresentation of these two values,\n\n456\n00:25:33.474 --> 00:25:36.453\nyou can see the zeroes in the host bits.\n\n457\n00:25:36.453 --> 00:25:39.370\nThey become the network IDs.\n\n458\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.930\nThese are the networks\nthat we will identify.\n\n459\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.400\nSo the First address cannot be given out.\n\n460\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.670\nNow, I also said the last address with\ninside of a network can't be given out.\n\n461\n00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.190\nIt's called the broadcast address.\n\n462\n00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.850\nHow do we identify those?\n\n463\n00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.650\nWell, let's go ahead and\nremember that now all of these bits,\n\n464\n00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.920\nand we'll kind of change this up a little\nbit These are all, actually probably not\n\n465\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.230\na good color there, change that up,\nthese are all now your host bits.\n\n466\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.210\nLet's go ahead and\nturn these all into ones.\n\n467\n00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:21.630\nAll ones in a node portion equals, on\na network, equals the broadcast address.\n\n468\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.070\n&gt;&gt; I think that important part\n&gt;&gt; Part that you need to take away from\n\n469\n00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:29.950\nwhat Wes just said was on the node or\nhost portion of the IP address.\n\n470\n00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.520\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n471\n00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:35.415\n&gt;&gt; Cuz yes, we have all ones in the subnet\nmask area as well but remember that\n\n472\n00:26:35.415 --> 00:26:38.455\n&gt;&gt; That's the network ID portion.\n\n473\n00:26:38.455 --> 00:26:40.355\nSo keep the two separate.\n\n474\n00:26:40.355 --> 00:26:41.897\nIf you [INAUDIBLE] you're in for\na world of hurt.\n\n475\n00:26:41.897 --> 00:26:42.399\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n476\n00:26:42.399 --> 00:26:43.365\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n477\n00:26:43.365 --> 00:26:48.610\n&gt;&gt; So now that we see all\nones in that node portion.\n\n478\n00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.690\n&gt;&gt; How can we tell what\nthe broadcast address is?\n\n479\n00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.410\nWell, that's okay,\n\n480\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.180\ntake these numbers and like we've been\ndoing them convert them back into decimal.\n\n481\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.040\nIf I do that I'll see that, well what.\n\n482\n00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.890\nI've got a 63 here, and\nwe'll bump up that font a little bit.\n\n483\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.300\nWhat do I have here?\n\n484\n00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.880\nIf I look, easy enough,\nthis one's 255, is it 16?\n\n485\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.100\n&gt;&gt; It's 127.\n\n486\n00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:14.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n487\n00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.443\n127.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n488\n00:27:15.443 --> 00:27:17.610\n&gt;&gt; Helps to have somebody here that can\n\n489\n00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:19.720\nactually count above three.\n\n490\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.850\n127.\nAnd\n\n491\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:25.070\nthere are ways that you can\n&gt;&gt; You can remember this a little bit\n\n492\n00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:28.570\neasier but right now, what I want you\nto do is just get the basics down.\n\n493\n00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.130\nUnderstand the basics.\n\n494\n00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.180\nThe first address and\nthe last address cannot be given out.\n\n495\n00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.600\nThe first address is the network ID,\n\n496\n00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:41.250\nthe last address is the broadcast Address,\nif you will, broadcast address.\n\n497\n00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.150\nIn between that becomes what's\nknown as our addressable range.\n\n498\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:48.600\nThese are the IP addresses that\nwe can give out to our nodes.\n\n499\n00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.330\nSo the first address we can give out is\ngoing to be, well what is it, dot one.\n\n500\n00:27:54.330 --> 00:28:00.890\nWait, it's gonna give me a hard time on\nthat one, we'll just leave it as one.\n\n501\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.410\nThe last address,\nI can't give the broadcast address right?\n\n502\n00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:08.980\nThe last address that I can actually\ngive the host is going to be 126.\n\n503\n00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.450\n&gt;&gt; So, the range becomes one through 126.\n\n504\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.700\nThat's the useable\nbroadcast address right?\n\n505\n00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.040\n&gt;&gt; That's the useable range.\n\n506\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.470\n&gt;&gt; We no longer have 254 or\nthree addresses to.\n\n507\n00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.390\nTo use, I guess it's 254,\naddresses to use on our old Class C.\n\n508\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.660\nWe now have a variable length subnet mask.\n\n509\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.740\nWe've divided that into two\nseparate networks, both containing,\n\n510\n00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:37.300\nwhat, 128 26 different IP addresses.\n\n511\n00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.480\n&gt;&gt; That's it, and that's where\nthat minus two comes in, right?\n\n512\n00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.500\nWhen you see that you can't give out the\nfirst address and the last address, right,\n\n513\n00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:50.990\nin any network that I do the subnetting\non, Keep in mind that I have\n\n514\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:55.720\nto know what the network IDs are, I have\nto know what the broadcast address is.\n\n515\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.330\nBecause if I apply these subnet masks, and\n\n516\n00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.060\nI try to give that address,\nI'm gonna cause problems.\n\n517\n00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.070\nSo I have to know that the addressable\nrange is always in between those.\n\n518\n00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.470\nSo for instance,\nlet's take the same thing.\n\n519\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.350\nIf you'll notice, I can't give out 128 So\n\n520\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.820\nthe first address that I\ncan give out is 129, right?\n\n521\n00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.730\nI can't give 255 out to nodes, right?\n\n522\n00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:21.600\nThat's the broadcast address,\nright, all 1s in the node portion.\n\n523\n00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:26.400\nSo the last address within that\nnetwork that I can use is Just 254.\n\n524\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.630\nAnd I've essentially created\ntwo separate networks, right?\n\n525\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.800\nOur sub-netting.\n\n526\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.220\nNow you can go a little bit\nfurther with this, too, right?\n\n527\n00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.540\nIt just depends on how\nmany networks you have.\n\n528\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:41.660\nSo for instance, if I decided that maybe\nI wanted to do, let's say one, right?\n\n529\n00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.800\nMaybe we wanted to Borrow two bits.\n\n530\n00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.410\nTwo networks wasn't enough.\n\n531\n00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.940\nI need four networks.\n\n532\n00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.880\nRight.\n\n533\n00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.010\nSince one bit's only going\nto give me two networks,\n\n534\n00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.280\nthen I'm going to have to\nborrow a little bit more.\n\n535\n00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.870\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n536\n00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:55.410\nAll right.\n\n537\n00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.320\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe will take all of these,\n\n538\n00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.360\nprobably a little easier if\nI just do Do it like this.\n\n539\n00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.120\nMaybe not.\n\n540\n00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.340\nAll right.\nLet's go ahead and\n\n541\n00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.080\njust zero these out here, as I struggle\nwith my Excel spreadsheet here.\n\n542\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.870\n&gt;&gt; There's no such thing as easy in Excel.\n\n543\n00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.620\n&gt;&gt; No.\nAnd there's\n\n544\n00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.560\nnothing easy when it comes to subneting.\n\n545\n00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.050\nSo much easier just to pen and paper, but\nthen you guys couldn't see it out there.\n\n546\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.680\n&gt;&gt; Be a little difficult.\n\n547\n00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n548\n00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Just get the sky cam out\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n549\n00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:20.270\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n550\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:25.020\nSo let's go ahead and we'll zero these all\nout and we'll say that well two networks,\n\n551\n00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.250\nwell that wasn't enough right.\n\n552\n00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.570\nWe're gonna need a little bit more here.\n\n553\n00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.550\nWe're gonna need four networks.\n\n554\n00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.000\nWell if the one bit didn't do us enough,\nwe're gonna have to see what will.\n\n555\n00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.740\nWill two bits do it.\n\n556\n00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.880\nWell we're gonna hope that two bits do it,\nif not we're gonna find out real soon.\n\n557\n00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.540\nSo let's\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead now notice I'm going to\n\n558\n00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.130\nhave to change everything here right?\n\n559\n00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:47.240\nThese are no longer our node bits,\nthese are going to become part of our\n\n560\n00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.890\nnetwork id, so let me go ahead and change\nthose up, keep them a little bit color\n\n561\n00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:55.480\ncoded here and let's look at the potential\npossibilities we have here right?\n\n562\n00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.300\nSo if I have now two bits,\n\n563\n00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.400\nthe very first possibility that\nI have is always zero zero.\n\n564\n00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.580\nThere always our left with the least\nto achieve what we stared with.\n\n565\n00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.600\nBut then if I go through possibilities,\nnow I got what?\n\n566\n00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.200\nZero one.\n\n567\n00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.750\nAll right?\n\n568\n00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:13.646\nI have got, let's see, what else, one,\n\n569\n00:31:13.646 --> 00:31:17.700\nzero, Right.\n\n570\n00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.940\nAnd I've got one, one.\n\n571\n00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.470\nAll right notice all those.\n\n572\n00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.930\nAnd we'll go ahead we'll\ncolor code these too.\n\n573\n00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.030\nNow.\n\n574\n00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:30.690\nThese become the possibilities that we\njust made by borrowing another bit.\n\n575\n00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.830\nAnd I can tell you it would be 8, 16, 32.\n\n576\n00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:39.440\nYou'll see the pattern going on\nhere on how many networks You need,\n\n577\n00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.170\nbut now let's go ahead and\nwe'll fill out host bits for these, right?\n\n578\n00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.605\nSo we can see,\ngotta keep an eye on what's going on here.\n\n579\n00:31:48.388 --> 00:31:51.321\nAll right, well do our 0s here.\n\n580\n00:31:56.067 --> 00:32:02.362\nAll right, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, all right.\n\n581\n00:32:02.362 --> 00:32:05.288\nAgain, go ahead and color those.\n\n582\n00:32:05.288 --> 00:32:10.055\nAnd then we'll do 0, 0, 0, and\nI know it's very repetitious guys,\n\n583\n00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:15.800\nI understand that but this is one of the\nthings that will make you better at that.\n\n584\n00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.089\nAll right, so, here are our\npossibilities that we've created now, so\n\n585\n00:32:20.089 --> 00:32:22.120\nnow what are our network IDs?\n\n586\n00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.577\nAlright, remember these possibilities\nbecome the networks that you've just\n\n587\n00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:27.132\ncreated when you're sub betting.\n\n588\n00:32:27.132 --> 00:32:30.468\nAll right so I have 0 0,\nthat didn't change anything, right?\n\n589\n00:32:30.468 --> 00:32:31.990\nWhat do I have next?\n\n590\n00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:39.691\nRight.\nI have 64 I have, help me out Daniel.\n\n591\n00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:40.990\nWhat else do I have?\n\n592\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.890\nI've got 192 I believe, 128 and then 192?\n\n593\n00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:44.880\n&gt;&gt; 128, then 192.\n\n594\n00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:46.560\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n595\n00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.000\nNow how is he doing that?\n\n596\n00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.250\nWell he remembers his place values, he's\nhad to look at these darn place values\n\n597\n00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.280\nmore than he would ever\nlike to in his lifetime.\n\n598\n00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.750\n&gt;&gt; Plus you have them labeled right there.\n\n599\n00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.390\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Plus I have\n\n600\n00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:55.915\nthem-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n601\n00:32:55.915 --> 00:32:57.510\n&gt;&gt; I was giving you\n\n602\n00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.395\nthe benefit of the doubt there man.\n\n603\n00:32:59.395 --> 00:33:00.015\n[LAUGH] Sh.\n\n604\n00:33:00.015 --> 00:33:04.090\n[LAUGH] So we can see those possibilities,\n\n605\n00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.750\nright, these become our network IDs and\nthis is how we start out.\n\n606\n00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:14.020\nThese are our network IDs,\nbut remember I need to know\n\n607\n00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.750\nwhat the broadcast address is for\neach one of these networks as well.\n\n608\n00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.050\nLet's go ahead,\n\n609\n00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:24.410\nnow that we got the network ID,\nand I'll start with the first one.\n\n610\n00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:27.070\nWhat is the broadcast for this?\n\n611\n00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:31.910\nWell if you look at this, it's actually\ngoing to be, believe it or not, 63.\n\n612\n00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.210\nRight, if you add all of these up,\nyou'll see that it's 63.\n\n613\n00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.480\n&gt;&gt; That's what I love about the way,\n\n614\n00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.180\nwhen you flesh it out like what Wes is\ndoing right here, it makes it really easy\n\n615\n00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.690\nto figure these things out-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n616\n00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.250\n&gt;&gt; Without even having to do all\nthe mathematics, to be honest with you.\n\n617\n00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:47.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You see that the network, the ID for\n\n618\n00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.230\nthe next network is 64, we know the\nbroadcast is gonna be one less than that.\n\n619\n00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n620\n00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.060\n&gt;&gt; So 63 becomes your broadcast address.\n\n621\n00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.830\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n622\n00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.730\nthat's why we say there are a lot of\nlittle tricks that you can learn.\n\n623\n00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:04.010\nLearn this first,\nbecause then once you got this down,\n\n624\n00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.090\nthings just start standing out at you.\n\n625\n00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.350\nAnd you're like, wow, I see a pattern.\n\n626\n00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.240\nI know that if I've got a 1 bit here and\n\n627\n00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.000\nall 1s, it's one less than\nthis second place value.\n\n628\n00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.640\nThat's the way I do it, right?\n\n629\n00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.973\nIf I know that I've got a 0 here and\n1's here, I know it's 1 less than 32.\n\n630\n00:34:21.973 --> 00:34:23.530\nIt's 31, that's the number.\n\n631\n00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.010\nSo little tricks like that,\nbut know the bits, right?\n\n632\n00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.530\nKnow the bits first.\n\n633\n00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.100\nAll right, so\nwhat is the broadcast address?\n\n634\n00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:29.810\nLet's go ahead and\n\n635\n00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.080\nlet's do the method to the madness\nthere that Dan was talking about.\n\n636\n00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.122\nWell, 127 right?\n\n637\n00:34:35.122 --> 00:34:36.492\nHe said it's one less?\n\n638\n00:34:36.492 --> 00:34:37.680\nWell is he right?\n\n639\n00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.220\nI don't know.\nLet's find out.\n\n640\n00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.580\nWhat is one, What is this?\n\n641\n00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.110\nAll ones and the host portion.\n\n642\n00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.500\nWhat is that value?\n\n643\n00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.530\nIf I was to add that up,\nI could do it actually kind of easy here.\n\n644\n00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.929\nIt's one less than 128, you are right.\n\n645\n00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.249\n127, right.\n\n646\n00:34:54.249 --> 00:34:57.020\nSo it's a very valid point.\n\n647\n00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:02.039\nNow I know that 191 is my\nnext broadcast address.\n\n648\n00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.820\nAnd I know, finally, this is all ones.\n\n649\n00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.580\nRemember, we could turn these all\nin ones if we wanted as well.\n\n650\n00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.820\nWe'll go ahead and do that real quick.\n\n651\n00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.790\nAll right.\n\n652\n00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:19.910\nAnd now notice that my last broadcast\naddress for this last network becomes 255.\n\n653\n00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.830\nAlright so essentially what we've done,\n\n654\n00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:27.010\nwe've got to look have we created\nour four networks that we need?\n\n655\n00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.120\nAlright, this is our first one and\nnow we're up to a slash 26 right?\n\n656\n00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.653\nWe've added two bits,\nkeep in mind your sider notation.\n\n657\n00:35:33.653 --> 00:35:34.690\nRight?\n\n658\n00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:42.232\nSo 192.168.0, and\nwhat was the next one there?\n\n659\n00:35:42.232 --> 00:35:47.548\n64, right?\n\n660\n00:35:47.548 --> 00:35:49.008\n64 and that's a /26.\n\n661\n00:35:49.008 --> 00:35:52.760\nWe have 192.168.0.\n\n662\n00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.236\nAnd what else?\n\n663\n00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:55.146\nWe got 128.\n\n664\n00:35:55.146 --> 00:35:55.973\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n665\n00:35:55.973 --> 00:35:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Oops, 128, and that's a /26.\n\n666\n00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:04.495\nAnd then last but certainly not least,\n\n667\n00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:07.576\nwe've got 192.\n\n668\n00:36:07.576 --> 00:36:11.541\nAll right, so what we've done is\nwe've taken and don't confuse this,\n\n669\n00:36:11.541 --> 00:36:13.890\nthis is the network we started with right.\n\n670\n00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.590\nSo that is what we started with.\n\n671\n00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.719\nAnd we took one large network that\nessentially would have 254 nodes on it\n\n672\n00:36:20.719 --> 00:36:23.680\nremember what Dan said,\nyour possibilities right?\n\n673\n00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.220\nMinus the first and the last address.\n\n674\n00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.760\nAnd what we've essentially\ndone is created four networks\n\n675\n00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.040\nthat if you look at the addressable range,\nright?\n\n676\n00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.400\nRemember what we can\nactually hand out to hosts?\n\n677\n00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.200\nI've essentially put 62 nodes,\n\n678\n00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.440\nthe ability to put 62 nodes\non four networks, right?\n\n679\n00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.457\nSo, I've got 65 here.\n\n680\n00:36:46.457 --> 00:36:48.843\nAnd again kinda going on\nbuilding off what Dan said,\n\n681\n00:36:48.843 --> 00:36:51.176\nI know right now that I\ncan't get the broadcast, so\n\n682\n00:36:51.176 --> 00:36:54.610\nI know the addressable range is one\nless than that, it's gonna be 126.\n\n683\n00:36:54.610 --> 00:37:01.960\nSo, you're seeing that the addressable\npossibilities just stand\n\n684\n00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.230\nwithin the ranges of your broadcast and\nyour network ID, or your network ID and\n\n685\n00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.800\nyour broadcast, I guess that\nwould be an easier way to say it.\n\n686\n00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.883\nAnd I'll go ahead and adjust these fonts,\nguys, just give me one second.\n\n687\n00:37:11.883 --> 00:37:15.618\nSo, 193 to 254.\n\n688\n00:37:15.618 --> 00:37:18.330\nAll right, and we bump up the font so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n689\n00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.200\nThese become the addresses that we can\n\n690\n00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.420\nhand out in the four different\nnetworks that we've just created.\n\n691\n00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.120\nSo guys I know when you first look\nat subnetting, it is a nightmare.\n\n692\n00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.660\nYou've seen us struggle\nwith my Excel spreadsheet.\n\n693\n00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.730\nIt's easier if we're writing this down and\nwe just sit there and\n\n694\n00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:36.720\nwrite it down all day.\n\n695\n00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.360\nBut to show you here, guys,\nyou need to know the bits.\n\n696\n00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.520\nBreak it down.\n\n697\n00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.600\nKnow these place values.\n\n698\n00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.200\nLook at these bits more often and you're\ngonna start to notice patterns that'll\n\n699\n00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.990\nmake this easier, that by the time\nyou get to the Cisco level,\n\n700\n00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.230\nwhen you have to know this in your head,\nyou'll be ready to do it.\n\n701\n00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:58.810\nFor the network plus exam, they don't\nexpect you to know it in your head but\n\n702\n00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:03.490\nwhat they might do is they might give\nyou a scenario that says, I need 62 or\n\n703\n00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:09.370\nI need 50 hosts on two networks\nwith the least amount of waste.\n\n704\n00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.350\nHow do I do that?\n\n705\n00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.950\nWell we've shown you here that I can\nget 62 nodes on a single network,right?\n\n706\n00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.400\nFour networks, 62 nodes apiece.\n\n707\n00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:22.340\nYou do your sub-netting slash 26 gives\nyou the ability to put those 50 nodes\n\n708\n00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:23.660\non that single network.\n\n709\n00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.480\nIt's just up to you, after you do the\nsub-netting as the administrator or maybe\n\n710\n00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.330\neven an IP spreadsheet to figure out which\nnetwork you wanna put your devices on.\n\n711\n00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.520\nSo essentially what I've done\nis I've got this larger network,\n\n712\n00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.810\nI've created four networks now, four\nsmaller subnets if you will off of it.\n\n713\n00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.660\nWhat if I'm only using\none of those subnets?\n\n714\n00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.691\nWell that's okay for\n\n715\n00:38:41.691 --> 00:38:45.644\nnow, I've got three on back up and I could\nuse them more efficiently than saying,\n\n716\n00:38:45.644 --> 00:38:49.731\nI'm gonna put all 254 nodes on a single\nnetwork, and I'm gonna use 50 of them.\n\n717\n00:38:49.731 --> 00:38:55.190\nI've got 204 network addresses that\nare just wasted, sitting idly by.\n\n718\n00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.100\nAnd the other thing that we\nalso gotta keep in mind too\n\n719\n00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.990\nis that you also isolate your broadcast\ncommunications when you do this as well.\n\n720\n00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.593\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthat a little bit more but\n\n721\n00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:09.390\nDan is giving me that old evil eye and\nI think we might have to wrap this one up.\n\n722\n00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.657\n[LAUGH] And that's the wad.\n\n723\n00:39:12.657 --> 00:39:15.935\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He's right, we're out of time\nbut this has been a great primer for\n\n724\n00:39:15.935 --> 00:39:19.028\nyou guys, to figure out what\nsub-netting is, what it looks like.\n\n725\n00:39:19.028 --> 00:39:22.972\nDetermining things like I broadcast\naddresses, what's the addressable range\n\n726\n00:39:22.972 --> 00:39:26.490\nthat we can use for each one of\nour networks that we've created.\n\n727\n00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:30.310\nAnd typical purposes for things like that,\nif I've got five departments,\n\n728\n00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.245\nI can now segregate those\ndepartments by a network right?\n\n729\n00:39:33.245 --> 00:39:37.115\nI can give them their own network ID\nwith their own range of IP addresses and\n\n730\n00:39:37.115 --> 00:39:40.000\nit's easier for\nus to do things like administration.\n\n731\n00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.352\nSo that's the why we do this, and\nnow you've seen the how as well.\n\n732\n00:39:44.352 --> 00:39:46.340\nWes, thanks so much for\nwalking us down that road.\n\n733\n00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:48.508\nI know it is a daunting and\narduous trail, but\n\n734\n00:39:48.508 --> 00:39:51.030\nit is definitely something\nthat you have to pick up.\n\n735\n00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.976\nAnd be able to master as\na network plus technician.\n\n736\n00:39:53.976 --> 00:39:58.865\nThat being said like Wes was telling\nme how we are well out of time\n\n737\n00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:01.735\ncuz I was given that nasty stink eye.\n\n738\n00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:03.012\nSo, it looks like it's time for\nus to sign off for ITPro.TV.\n\n739\n00:40:03.012 --> 00:40:04.009\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n740\n00:40:04.009 --> 00:40:04.878\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n741\n00:40:04.878 --> 00:40:05.959\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n742\n00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:12.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n743\n00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.359\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching, ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:17.140\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.430\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.010\nIn today's episode, we are moving on with\nmore on network pro series for CompTIA.\n\n9\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.050\nAnd, of course, coming back on the studio\nto continue down the road that is IPv4 and\n\n10\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.580\n6, and subnetting, and\naddressing, and schemas.\n\n11\n00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.990\nWell, it's none other than our friend,\nWes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.860\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.530\nHow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.400\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.670\nLooking forward to diving into more\nIP address schemas, that's for\n\n16\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.070\nsure cuz we still have some additional\nthings that we We need to take care of.\n\n17\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.800\nIn the last episode, we showed you\nthings like your binary handing and\n\n18\n00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.890\nyour subnetting.\n\n19\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.090\nWe've talked about the structure of\nan IPv4 address and networking rules.\n\n20\n00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.880\nWhen it comes to addressing rules,\nwhat some of those rules are.\n\n21\n00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.790\nWhat we're going to do is\nmove into some additional\n\n22\n00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.480\nthings that we've got to take into\nconsideration when we're looking at IPv4.\n\n23\n00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.840\nAnd if you haven't been around IP before,\nbefore maybe you're just jumping into\n\n24\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.220\nnetworks, then it's going to be important\ninformation that you need to know.\n\n25\n00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.930\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about something.\n\n26\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.980\nWe kind of talked about the classes right?\n\n27\n00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.660\nWe've talked about that there's an A,\nB, C, D, and E range.\n\n28\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.210\nRange, right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.180\nIn fact, if you're gotta show\nmy computer screen here,\n\n30\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.090\nremember this chart that we showed.\n\n31\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.980\nWe talked about the class A range and\nwhat that range was.\n\n32\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.210\nWe talked about the B range and\nagain C, D and E.\n\n33\n00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.700\nAnd remember that we told you for\nthe most part when we talk about A, B and\n\n34\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.120\nC we still use these as waymarkers but\nwe're really in a classless state today.\n\n35\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.400\nRemember, one of the things that\nwe have to keep in mind with IPv4\n\n36\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.810\nis IPv4 when this addressing\nscheme first came out,\n\n37\n00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.680\nthere were only a handful of\nentities that were connected to what\n\n38\n00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.590\nwould later become the internet back\nin those days it was the ARPANET.\n\n39\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.700\nAnd at that time, this seemed like\nmore than what we were gonna need.\n\n40\n00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.142\nWell, they, and with the dot com boom,\nand the expansion, just exponential\n\n41\n00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:07.652\nexpansion of the Internet, they learned\nvery early on that this was not going to\n\n42\n00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:11.923\nbe something that was going to sustain\nus for IP addressing indefinitely.\n\n43\n00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:16.909\nSo they came up with some techniques\nthat we could essentially use as\n\n44\n00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.631\ncertain types of IP addresses\nin the IPv4 address space,but we\n\n45\n00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.786\ncould only use them on internal networks.\n\n46\n00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:30.800\nAnd what this would do is\ntrying to stall the depletion.\n\n47\n00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.180\nAnd that's something known\nas private IP addresses.\n\n48\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.710\nAnd that's something that\nwe we have to talk about,\n\n49\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.500\nbecause we've just been talking about this\nclass that you see right here generically,\n\n50\n00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.560\nbut I do want to go\na little bit farther and\n\n51\n00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.010\nlook at it a little bit more here because\ninside each one of these classes is\n\n52\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.880\na reserved set of IP address or\na block of IP address.\n\n53\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.700\nThere is something interesting with these\n\n54\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.840\nblocks of IP addresses in\neach one of those spaces.\n\n55\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.140\nAnd that's the fact that are called\nprivate IP addresses and\n\n56\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.770\nthey're not routable across the Internet.\n\n57\n00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.340\nNow, you might say again why would\nwe want something like that?\n\n58\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.070\nWhy would they implement?\n\n59\n00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.230\nSomething like that.\n\n60\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.630\nWell, you have different types of IP\naddresses, you have what are known as\n\n61\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.900\npublic IP addresses and you have what\nare known as private IP addresses.\n\n62\n00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.008\nSo let me give you an example, for\ninstance, here is whole Class A range,\n\n63\n00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.810\nright, 1.0.0.0.\n\n64\n00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.598\nZero all the way up to 126.255.255.255,\nall right?\n\n65\n00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:34.409\nHowever, within that range,\nyou'll have a 10.range, and\n\n66\n00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.328\nit follows the default subnet\nmask by the way herem so\n\n67\n00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:44.851\nit's gonna be 10.0.0.0 and\nit's gonna be 10.255.255.255.\n\n68\n00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.619\nAll right,\nwell these addresses understand,\n\n69\n00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:52.183\nand I said classful they don't have to be\nclassful, not that it really has to be\n\n70\n00:03:52.183 --> 00:03:56.245\nclassful anymore, but here's\nthe deal with this range right here.\n\n71\n00:03:56.245 --> 00:04:02.240\n10.0 all the way to 10.255 all right,\nis the fact that if Dan wants to use this,\n\n72\n00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.630\nhe can use this internally on\nhis network anyway he sees fit.\n\n73\n00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.510\nHe can apply any subnet mask he\nwants to anywhere in this range.\n\n74\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.870\nAnd guess what?\n\n75\n00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.940\nSo can I.\n\n76\n00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.570\nI can use these on\na completely separate network.\n\n77\n00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.411\nNow why is it that I can use those?\n\n78\n00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:20.010\nWell, we can use those on two\ncompletely separate networks and\n\n79\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.090\nit doesn't cause a conflict cuz\nremember up until this point we've been\n\n80\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.530\ntalking about your IP addresses have\nto be unique network addresses,\n\n81\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.080\nyou have to have IDs, unique nodes, so\nwhy is it that we can use two of the same,\n\n82\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.390\nidentical ranges and\nit doesn't cause a problem?\n\n83\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.360\nWell, that goes back to the fact\nthat we have, certain addresses,\n\n84\n00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.790\nthese private IP addresses.\n\n85\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.240\nWe'll look at those ranges again and\nthey're for\n\n86\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.485\nessentially for land routing, all right.\n\n87\n00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:51.545\nKnowing that this address\nspace with around 4.3\n\n88\n00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:54.745\nbillion addresses was\neventually going to deplete.\n\n89\n00:04:54.745 --> 00:04:55.265\nSo, okay.\nWell,\n\n90\n00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:59.575\nwe'll take a certain\nsection of each class.\n\n91\n00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.150\nAnd we'll just reserve that.\n\n92\n00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.590\nPortion, we're gonna mark them as private.\n\n93\n00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.330\nAnd you can't use them out\nthere on the Internet.\n\n94\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.160\nRight.\nThat's why we can have LAN 1 here,\n\n95\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.254\nthat has 192.168.\n\n96\n00:05:11.254 --> 00:05:15.240\nAnd notice up here in LAN 2,\nit has 10., right.\n\n97\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.480\nAnd in LAN 2 it has the 72, 172.16.\n\n98\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.480\nAgain, we'll get back to these addresses.\n\n99\n00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.470\nAnd then you find out here, LAN 4,\n\n100\n00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.810\nwell they're using every single one of\nthe different private IP address ranges.\n\n101\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.320\nWell, why can they do that?\n\n102\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.440\nWell, because these addresses\naren't allowed, basically,\n\n103\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.610\nto send communications\nout on the internet.\n\n104\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.400\nSo since it is only on the internal\nLAN We don't care about conflict,\n\n105\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.300\nwe don't worry about conflicts.\n\n106\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.310\nSo I want you to keep in mind that private\nIP addresses, all right, each class\n\n107\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.650\nhas a range of private IP addresses as\nwell as a range of public IP addresses.\n\n108\n00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.190\nNow, we typically on the exam,\n\n109\n00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.290\nyou need to know what the private\nIP addresses are because cuz\n\n110\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.010\nI'm a big fan of memorizing fewer things\nthat help you remember a lot more.\n\n111\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.690\nIt makes it easier.\n\n112\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.180\nSo what I want you to remember really\nare just these addresses, these ranges.\n\n113\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.750\nNotice it's 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255.\n\n114\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.270\nThis is the one that always got me.\n\n115\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.815\nThis was the hardest one,\nI don't know why, to remember for\n\n116\n00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:22.465\nme because it's weird.\n\n117\n00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:26.767\nAnd it just didn't line up with my train\nof thought, which is weird in general.\n\n118\n00:06:26.767 --> 00:06:33.340\n[LAUGH] 172.16.0.0 So 172.31.255.255 and\n\n119\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.260\nanything in between that range\nis a private IP address.\n\n120\n00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.960\nI could use it, Dan could use it,\nanybody can use it.\n\n121\n00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.550\nBecause we can't take,\n\n122\n00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.470\nwithout additional technologies\nthat we're going to talk about,\n\n123\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.150\nwe can't take those addresses and send\ntraffic across the internet with them.\n\n124\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.480\nAll right.\nNow, the addresses that are in the public\n\n125\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.530\nscope, right,\nthese do have to be unique, right.\n\n126\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:05.070\nSo, lets say theoretically, gosh,\nI don't know, I've got a 80.80.\n\n127\n00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.690\nOne IP address, right?\n\n128\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.030\nDan couldn't have that.\n\n129\n00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.390\nWhy?\nBecause it's not unique to the Internet.\n\n130\n00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.620\nThe public IP address\nrange has to be unique.\n\n131\n00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.330\nThose are registered addresses.\n\n132\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.520\nThese are the addresses that ICANN, the\nInternet Corporation for Assigned Names\n\n133\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.820\nand Numbers, or the older one,\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\n\n134\n00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.130\nallocate to the five regional\nInternet registrars, right?\n\n135\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.940\nThe top dogs of the backbone\nof the Internet, right?\n\n136\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.410\nThey govern continents when\nit comes to IP addresses.\n\n137\n00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.100\nAnd then what they do is they\ntake the pools of IP addresses,\n\n138\n00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.080\nthe big large blocks that\nthey've been allocated, and\n\n139\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.270\nthey allocate that down to lower ISPs,\nand then finally the local ISPs.\n\n140\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.869\nSo it's a big hierarchy\nthat goes on out there.\n\n141\n00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:51.544\nWell, if I wanna use one of\nthese public IP addresses, and\n\n142\n00:07:51.544 --> 00:07:55.069\nI want it to be routable and\nunique across the Internet,\n\n143\n00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:59.429\nthen I have to go to an ISP and\nI have to lease one of these IP addresses.\n\n144\n00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:02.513\nNow how that's done, and\nthat's all up to your contract,\n\n145\n00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:06.646\nwhether you're on [INAUDIBLE] Or anything\nlike that but, to be public phasing,\n\n146\n00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:10.489\nto be publicly routable, you have to\nhave one of the public IP addresses.\n\n147\n00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:13.903\nSo notice that we have the whole\nrange here in Class B.\n\n148\n00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:20.455\nAgain, 172.16.0.0 through 72.31.255.255.\n\n149\n00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:23.605\nHowever, notice there\nis a bigger range and\n\n150\n00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:26.935\nhere you can see\nthe public ranges as well.\n\n151\n00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:29.257\nAgain, I'd put these up here so\nyou can understand,\n\n152\n00:08:29.257 --> 00:08:31.950\ncuz we do have sometimes we have\nquestions that come through.\n\n153\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.395\nPeople are like well wait a second,\nthere's a private range,\n\n154\n00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:37.390\nwhat's a public range?\n\n155\n00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.080\nSo I went ahead and\nhopefully this will help you beforehand,\n\n156\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.180\nbefore that question comes up.\n\n157\n00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.680\nIt just means outside of that\nrange,eEverything's public.\n\n158\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.940\nSo I just kind of give\nyou those numbers here.\n\n159\n00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.498\nAnd you can see, as we move down,\n\n160\n00:08:49.498 --> 00:08:53.029\njust like we've talked about with\nthe class system that we used to follow.\n\n161\n00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:55.740\nOriginally these private IP addresses,\n\n162\n00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.308\nyou could see that if you\nfollow default subnet masks.\n\n163\n00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:01.324\nAgain, you don't have to,\n\n164\n00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:07.310\nyou could see the 10 dots allow you\nthat 16,777,214 impossible nodes.\n\n165\n00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.830\nWell again, you don't have to use them\nthat way, use them anyway you want.\n\n166\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.808\n&gt;&gt; I like to use a Class A addressing\nscheme and the Class C subnet mask.\n\n167\n00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:15.389\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n168\n00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:16.225\n&gt;&gt; Just cuz it's easier to type.\n\n169\n00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:17.629\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's funny that you say that.\n\n170\n00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:21.137\nI think almost every single one\nof my labs are set up that way.\n\n171\n00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:23.702\nCuz I can type a 10.10 all\nthe way cross the board.\n\n172\n00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:24.523\n&gt;&gt; Pretty easy.\n\n173\n00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:25.234\n&gt;&gt; It's a server.\n\n174\n00:09:25.234 --> 00:09:28.320\nI'll add a 100 at the end,\nnow I can distinguish them.\n\n175\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.510\nSo do that, and\nknow just like Dan and I are talking,\n\n176\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.000\nwe both use these IP addresses.\n\n177\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.302\nWe use them in our labs, we use them\nactually to kind of connect to the local\n\n178\n00:09:36.302 --> 00:09:38.076\nnetwork here when we need to and stuff.\n\n179\n00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:40.410\nSo you do have that ability.\n\n180\n00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.213\nSo know the difference between private and\npublic.\n\n181\n00:09:43.213 --> 00:09:45.880\nKnow that for the exam, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.775\nThat is very, very important.\n\n183\n00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:55.571\n&gt;&gt; And we've talked about CIDR notation in\nthe class to center domain routing idea,\n\n184\n00:09:55.571 --> 00:09:59.355\nwhere you can have a variable\nlength something mass.\n\n185\n00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:03.132\nSo you can just say,\nI have 27 bits instead of 24 bits.\n\n186\n00:10:03.132 --> 00:10:06.832\nWe still use like Wes,\nI think you've said this a few times and\n\n187\n00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:11.402\nI think it's a good spot to stress it,\nthat you still have class C, class A.\n\n188\n00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:11.924\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n189\n00:10:11.924 --> 00:10:12.981\n&gt;&gt; You've been saying these terms.\n\n190\n00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:13.549\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n191\n00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:16.661\n&gt;&gt; Using them as like a way,\nlike you said, a way point.\n\n192\n00:10:16.661 --> 00:10:17.207\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n193\n00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:23.180\n&gt;&gt; As a way for you to go,\nyeah, if I came from that era.\n\n194\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.638\nSomebody else could have\na conversation with you.\n\n195\n00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:28.887\nYou say, like a Class C,\nI gotcha, 255 255 255.0,\n\n196\n00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:33.400\nprobably a 192168 something,\nsomething any IP address.\n\n197\n00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.890\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, I'll give you an example.\n\n198\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.406\nSo let's say that, we've already\ntalked about DHCP in other episode.\n\n199\n00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:39.770\nWe've talked about scope.\n\n200\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.383\nDan comes to me and he says, Wes,\n\n201\n00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:44.506\nI need class A private IP address\nwith with a Class C subnet mask.\n\n202\n00:10:44.506 --> 00:10:48.420\nYou say, well wait a second Wes,\nI thought you said, it was class less.\n\n203\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.590\nWell it is.\n\n204\n00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.040\nNotice he said a Class A private IP\naddress with a Class C subnet mask.\n\n205\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.387\nHe's giving me a way marker.\n\n206\n00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:59.528\nHe's telling me,\nI want it to be 10.0.0.0, right?\n\n207\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:04.809\nThe way marker, and\nI want you to put a 255.255.255.0 or\n\n208\n00:11:04.809 --> 00:11:06.790\nClass C subnet mask on it.\n\n209\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.194\nThat is essentially CIDR,\nCIDR or classless domain router\n\n210\n00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:14.221\nis essentially accomplished through\nvariable link subnet masking.\n\n211\n00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:16.381\nThat's one of the things\nwe've got to understand.\n\n212\n00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:21.431\nHow do we make a classless routing\nsystem with variable link subnet masks?\n\n213\n00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:25.518\nNo longer are we stuck,\n8 bits, 16 bits and 24 bits.\n\n214\n00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:30.701\nNow it can be 10 bits,\nit can be 17 bits or it can be 26 bits.\n\n215\n00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:31.781\nThe walls are broken right now.\n\n216\n00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:34.977\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\neven though we're referencing classful,\n\n217\n00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:37.481\nthat doesn't mean we are using classful.\n\n218\n00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:39.390\nWe're just using it as a reference.\n\n219\n00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.100\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n220\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.550\nAnd I do wanna throw a couple\nof little things out here.\n\n221\n00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.460\nThere is an RFC I wanna just mention, and\n\n222\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.560\nI don't know it it'll come up\non the exam at this point.\n\n223\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.270\nBecause as you go on to more\nadvanced certifications,\n\n224\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.740\nthey might want you to know what is\nthe request for comments on this one?\n\n225\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.856\nJust know for the exam, 1918.\n\n226\n00:11:55.856 --> 00:11:58.794\nCertainly don't expect\nyou to go out there and\n\n227\n00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:02.348\nread those lovely doctoral\nthesis that RFCs tend to be.\n\n228\n00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:05.088\nBut we do want you to at least know that.\n\n229\n00:12:05.088 --> 00:12:06.157\n&gt;&gt; That's my grandfather's birth year.\n\n230\n00:12:06.157 --> 00:12:07.121\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n231\n00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:08.037\n&gt;&gt; Easy to remember.\n\n232\n00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:10.115\n&gt;&gt; Well I guess I gotta change\nthe password on my luggage.\n\n233\n00:12:10.115 --> 00:12:10.881\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n234\n00:12:10.881 --> 00:12:12.275\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n235\n00:12:12.275 --> 00:12:15.015\nlet me show you something else.\n\n236\n00:12:15.015 --> 00:12:16.103\nAll right, so\n\n237\n00:12:16.103 --> 00:12:22.100\nif I can't communicate across the Internet\nwith these private IP addresses.\n\n238\n00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.938\nI want you to think about this.\n\n239\n00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:27.020\nYeah, so I'm still logged\ninto my sent box, all right.\n\n240\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.950\nAnd if I do an ip add on this,\nyou might notice that\n\n241\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.150\nwe're doing classless right here,\nin fact on our own network.\n\n242\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.370\nNotice that that's the 10.,\nso that's in the A range.\n\n243\n00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:46.290\nBut notice it's a /16, it's a B subnet\nmask, so that shows you classless.\n\n244\n00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.680\nNow, that's the IP address I have.\n\n245\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.900\nNow, let's see something here.\n\n246\n00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.207\nIf I do a ping, I'm gonna ping,\nlet's say a Google public DNS Server.\n\n247\n00:12:54.207 --> 00:12:59.627\nWe'll do a ping 8.8.8.8,\nbut wait a second Dan.\n\n248\n00:12:59.627 --> 00:13:03.559\nI just thought I told you guys\nthat can't communicate across\n\n249\n00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:06.188\nthe Internet with a private IP address.\n\n250\n00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:07.742\n&gt;&gt; It's not routable you said.\n\n251\n00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:10.763\n&gt;&gt; It's not routable, yeah,\nwell that's how we communicate across\n\n252\n00:13:10.763 --> 00:13:11.854\nthe Internet-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n253\n00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:12.875\n&gt;&gt; Is the routing, right?\n\n254\n00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.430\nSo what's going on here?\n\n255\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.429\nIs this magic?\n\n256\n00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:17.110\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n257\n00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.950\nEven though I told you that technically\naccording to the specification, you're not\n\n258\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.110\nsupposed to be able to use these private\nIP addresses across the Internet.\n\n259\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.660\nWell guess what?\n\n260\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.630\nWe have a technology that\nalso allows that stalling of\n\n261\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.900\nthe inevitable depletion\nof the IPv4 address space.\n\n262\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.680\nAnd that's through something known\nas network address translation.\n\n263\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.060\nSo what is happening on our network?\n\n264\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.321\nWe've talked about this in other episodes,\nso\n\n265\n00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:45.457\nI'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this,\ncuz we've already talked about static NAT.\n\n266\n00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.413\nWe've talked about Dynamic NAT,\nand NAT in general, and\n\n267\n00:13:48.413 --> 00:13:50.110\neven port address translation.\n\n268\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.910\nBut it's good to just\nkind of recap it here.\n\n269\n00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.420\nRemember, what's happening is,\nwe apply a technology in our gateway\n\n270\n00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.630\ndevices that performs\nnetwork address translation.\n\n271\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.530\nWhen a packet of data comes into the\ndevice that's performing network address\n\n272\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.070\ntranslation.\n\n273\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.540\nIn this case,\nI'm using an example of a router.\n\n274\n00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.685\nCould be a layer three switch, all depends\non what you have inside of your company.\n\n275\n00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:15.610\nNotice that I have a private IP address.\n\n276\n00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:21.110\nMy router knows being built\ninto the router's logic,\n\n277\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.180\nthat hey, I can't use that IP address\nout there across the Internet.\n\n278\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.315\nSo what it does is it strips off\nthe private IP address, all right?\n\n279\n00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:31.658\nAnd it replaces it with\na public IP address and\n\n280\n00:14:31.658 --> 00:14:33.641\nit sends it out there to the Internet.\n\n281\n00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:37.275\nNow keep in mind that when\nthe packet comes back in, and\n\n282\n00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:40.210\nit's got the public IP address.\n\n283\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.912\nAnd what it says is okay,\nI remember where that goes.\n\n284\n00:14:43.912 --> 00:14:51.300\nAnd it strips off the public IP address\nand it puts back the private IP address.\n\n285\n00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.080\nNow, that is just straight\nnetwork address translation.\n\n286\n00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.790\nHowever, you might notice that I got more\ninformation just past that IP address.\n\n287\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.460\nSo what is that about?\n\n288\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.139\nWell in smaller environments,\ntypically home environments,\n\n289\n00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:09.990\nyou can do it in Enterprise environments,\nbut it's largely for smaller networks.\n\n290\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.400\nWhat they do is something known\nas port address translations.\n\n291\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.590\nPort address translation means\nrather than keep a database\n\n292\n00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.896\nof just the private IP addresses, right?\n\n293\n00:15:18.896 --> 00:15:22.739\nWhen you have only a single\npublic IP address and\n\n294\n00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:27.930\nyou need to route more than one\ninternal private IP address.\n\n295\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.310\nHow do we keep track of that?\n\n296\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.180\nWell your device now doesn't\njust look at the IP address,\n\n297\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.450\nit's following the ports\nassociated with that address.\n\n298\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.467\nSo if we'll go back to my diagram here and\nI think that is 500,000.\n\n299\n00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:41.664\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is 500.000 ports.\n\n300\n00:15:41.664 --> 00:15:44.067\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A little bit too many zeros there.\n\n301\n00:15:44.067 --> 00:15:48.894\nSo when we talk about the port ranges,\nthis router is keeping track of\n\n302\n00:15:48.894 --> 00:15:52.817\nwhat IP address on the internal\nnetwork to send this to.\n\n303\n00:15:52.817 --> 00:15:57.125\nBecause it's using that\nprivate port range, right?\n\n304\n00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.217\nWe talk about ports, right?\n\n305\n00:15:58.217 --> 00:16:01.061\nWell what is it a 0 to a 1023?\n\n306\n00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:04.728\nThese are your registered ports or\nwell known, no, well known port range,\n\n307\n00:16:04.728 --> 00:16:05.313\nexcuse me.\n\n308\n00:16:05.313 --> 00:16:09.555\nThen 1024 to 49151 is your\nregistered ports, right?\n\n309\n00:16:09.555 --> 00:16:11.220\nWe use these for\ncommon services and stuff.\n\n310\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.431\nThey're more kind of like\na generalization or a recommendation.\n\n311\n00:16:14.431 --> 00:16:16.930\nRight, lot of software uses these ports.\n\n312\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.663\nBut then the last range of\nports is that 49,152 to 65,535\n\n313\n00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:26.562\nthese are private ports, they're\ncalled dynamic ports because at any\n\n314\n00:16:26.562 --> 00:16:30.336\none time one device can use\nmultitudes of these ports.\n\n315\n00:16:30.336 --> 00:16:33.885\nAnd then once the communication's over\nit just goes back into a pool of private\n\n316\n00:16:33.885 --> 00:16:37.060\nports that are allocated then for\nlater communications.\n\n317\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.500\nWell, your router is using those ports.\n\n318\n00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.066\nIt comes and it says, okay I see that\nthe returning trip is port 45,000.\n\n319\n00:16:44.066 --> 00:16:49.470\nWell, let me see okay, last time I\nstripped off the private IP address.\n\n320\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.254\nAnd I put a public IP address,\nI made a little marker for\n\n321\n00:16:53.254 --> 00:16:58.027\nmyself to remember that when that\ncomes in and I say port 55000,\n\n322\n00:16:58.027 --> 00:17:01.668\nit goes to 192.168.1.20 in this case.\n\n323\n00:17:01.668 --> 00:17:07.127\nSo we’re using port address translation\nwhen you need multiple internal\n\n324\n00:17:07.127 --> 00:17:12.244\nprivate IP addresses, translated\ninto a single public IP address.\n\n325\n00:17:12.244 --> 00:17:16.496\nUsually, if you're in a larger company,\nyou're going to use something like dynamic\n\n326\n00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:19.015\nnat, where you have a pool\nof public IP addresses.\n\n327\n00:17:19.015 --> 00:17:22.550\nAnd you've got a few private IP addresses,\nand it's a one to one mapping.\n\n328\n00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:27.030\nThere is no rotation here they always have\nthe same public to private IP address\n\n329\n00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.680\ntranslation.\n\n330\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.430\nThat's Static NAT.\n\n331\n00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.130\nWhen you have a pool of public IP\naddresses and you have a series of\n\n332\n00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:41.620\ninternal addresses and you want more of\na first come, first serve basis right?\n\n333\n00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.160\nI need an address, I pick this one.\n\n334\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.140\nOnce I'm done with that address,\nI let it go.\n\n335\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.950\nNext time I communicate,\nI might get another public IP address.\n\n336\n00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.680\nThat's called dynamic\nnetwork address translation.\n\n337\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.205\nSo, that is essentially the technology\nthat allows us to take these\n\n338\n00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:58.625\nprivate IP addresses and\ncommunicate across the Internet.\n\n339\n00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:00.015\nDoesn't break any rules, right?\n\n340\n00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:03.445\nCuz it's the network address translation\nthat essentially is still using a public\n\n341\n00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:06.675\nIP address to route your\ntraffic across the Internet.\n\n342\n00:18:06.675 --> 00:18:07.425\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n343\n00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:09.484\nAll right now,\n\n344\n00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:13.880\nnext thing that we're gonna look at\nare some of the communication types.\n\n345\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.431\nAnd Dan and I have kinda talked\nabout them in the last few episodes.\n\n346\n00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.830\nYou might have heard us talk about,\nI need to send a communication.\n\n347\n00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.276\nI broadcast it out to everybody.\n\n348\n00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:24.230\nWhat does that even mean for us?\n\n349\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.372\nWell, there are three network\ncommunication types that you really\n\n350\n00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.040\nneed to know.\n\n351\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.202\nThere's a fourth one in IPv6,\ntalked briefly about it but\n\n352\n00:18:31.202 --> 00:18:34.693\nthree major communications that\nwe need to worry about In IPv4.\n\n353\n00:18:34.693 --> 00:18:37.220\nThe very first one that I want\nto talk about is the one that I\n\n354\n00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.602\njust kind of mentioned there and\nthat's broadcast.\n\n355\n00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:44.600\nBroadcast, this is\na communication type that's good.\n\n356\n00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.120\nBecause of the fact that I can communicate\nwith everybody on the network.\n\n357\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.740\nIt's bad,\n\n358\n00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.090\nbecause if I'm only going to talk to\none person on the network guess what?\n\n359\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.900\nEverybody's still gonna\nreceive that signal.\n\n360\n00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.520\nAnd that's why they call it\na one to all communication.\n\n361\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.220\nRemember the address that we told you?\n\n362\n00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.320\nThe last address in every network\nwe can't assign to a node.\n\n363\n00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.860\nBecause when I need to send\na broadcast communication,\n\n364\n00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.750\nlet's say for\ninstance I'm on a 192.168.1.0/24 network.\n\n365\n00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.380\nThat means my broadcast\naddress is 192.168.1.255 and\n\n366\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.210\nevery node on that network that\n\n367\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.870\nneeds to send a broadcast communication\nis gonna send it to that address.\n\n368\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.720\nAnd every other computer on\nthe network that hears it,\n\n369\n00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.560\nwell, they're gonna inspect it.\n\n370\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.200\nThey might not process the information.\n\n371\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.332\nAnd that's the problem with\nbroadcast communications.\n\n372\n00:19:32.332 --> 00:19:35.740\nIs they can saturate our networks\nwith unnecessary traffic.\n\n373\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.960\nIf I need to talk to Dan,\nthere's no reason for me to say, okay,\n\n374\n00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.330\nlet me also send that communication\nto Ronnie, one of our other host,\n\n375\n00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.920\nDon Pezet, Miss Cherokee Boose,\nwhen I only need to talk to Dan.\n\n376\n00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.320\nAll right,\nthat's the broadcast communication.\n\n377\n00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.850\nIt can saturate our networks and\nit can cause some problems, too.\n\n378\n00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.880\nWe'll learn a little bit later in\nsome other episodes about things like\n\n379\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.680\nbroadcast storms.\n\n380\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.000\nWe've actually had one of\nthose on our networks.\n\n381\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.430\nAnd, when they happen,\nthey can bring your network to a crawl.\n\n382\n00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:06.550\nSo, if I needed to talk to Dan,\nand only Dan,\n\n383\n00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:12.760\nwhat I would do is something called,\noops, that is not really a good diagram.\n\n384\n00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.800\nWe're gonna fix some diagrams\nhere on the fly there, Dan.\n\n385\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.740\nThat is not supposed to be a broadcast.\n\n386\n00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.410\nIt's called a unicast all right?\n\n387\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:25.484\nAnd with the unicast,\nthe unicast is a one-to-one communication.\n\n388\n00:20:25.484 --> 00:20:30.227\nRight, rather than sending\ninformation out to one person or\n\n389\n00:20:30.227 --> 00:20:35.063\nfrom one person to everybody,\nwe talk directly to one to one,\n\n390\n00:20:35.063 --> 00:20:41.130\ngive me a second here, hopefully we\ncan fix this diagram real quick.\n\n391\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.940\nSo this would be more of a what's\nknown as a one-to-one communication.\n\n392\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.420\nThis is something known as\na unicast communication there,\n\n393\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.100\nguys, sorry about that.\n\n394\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.910\nI had to fix that slide there real quick.\n\n395\n00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.156\nAnd this is when I'm gonna\ntalk directly to Dan.\n\n396\n00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:54.639\nI don't need it to go to everybody.\n\n397\n00:20:54.639 --> 00:20:56.500\nI only need to communicate,\nright, with Dan.\n\n398\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.162\nSo more efficiently as\na unicast communication.\n\n399\n00:20:59.162 --> 00:21:01.920\nLet me give you an example of where\nwe might use a unicast communication.\n\n400\n00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.390\nI need to talk to an FTP server,\nI need to get a file.\n\n401\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.676\nWell I'm not gonna tell\neverybody on the network hey,\n\n402\n00:21:08.676 --> 00:21:11.950\nI'm gonna talk to the FTP server right?\n\n403\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.410\nI guess I could, but that'd be a waste.\n\n404\n00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.040\nI can talk directly to the server\nwith a unicast communication.\n\n405\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.209\nSo unicast communications are a one\nto one communication, and\n\n406\n00:21:21.209 --> 00:21:23.556\nthey have their place\ninside of our networks.\n\n407\n00:21:23.556 --> 00:21:26.767\nAnd I mean, broadcasts do too, but\nwe're starting to see those broadcasts,\n\n408\n00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:30.480\nespecially in IPv6, when we get into that,\nwe'll talk about how they're eliminated.\n\n409\n00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.270\nOne of the last ones that we'll talk about\nis something known as a multicast, and\n\n410\n00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.310\nI want you to think of\na multicast communication,\n\n411\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.426\nkind of like the pay-per-view of that.\n\n412\n00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:43.290\nAll right,\nif you pay to view the event, you see,\n\n413\n00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.860\nyou watch the episode\nwhatever it might be.\n\n414\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.360\nIf you are not paying for that event,\nand we're not talking criminality here,\n\n415\n00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.310\nif your not paying for\n\n416\n00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.420\nthe event, it doesn't come in, that signal\ndoesn't even come into your house right.\n\n417\n00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.600\nMulticast is one to many.\n\n418\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.160\nI like to explain it as a one\nto a select group all right.\n\n419\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.520\nOne to many, right?\n\n420\n00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.400\nOne signal that goes to more than one,\nbut it doesn't go to all.\n\n421\n00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.430\nAgain, I like to say that it's\na multicast group, cuz that's typically,\n\n422\n00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.720\nwhat we're using.\n\n423\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.270\nWe're using the internet group management\nprotocol to send multicast transmissions.\n\n424\n00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.462\nLet's kinda bring this\nback full circle here.\n\n425\n00:22:19.462 --> 00:22:22.960\nIf you remember,\nwe were talking about that range.\n\n426\n00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.230\nAll right and let's see here,\nwhere did that go?\n\n427\n00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.550\nOkay, up here.\n\n428\n00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.160\nSee this range here?\n\n429\n00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.992\nClass D, when I need to send\na multicast communication,\n\n430\n00:22:32.992 --> 00:22:35.770\nguess what, I send it to these addresses,\nthis range.\n\n431\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.040\nThat's the multicast range, all right?\n\n432\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.620\nAnd that means when I send\nthat communication out,\n\n433\n00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.130\nanybody else who's in that multicast\ngroup will be listening to\n\n434\n00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.250\nwhatever the address might be within\nthis range, and receive the signal.\n\n435\n00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.329\nIf they're not listening to\nwhatever this address is,\n\n436\n00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:53.154\nthen they're not gonna\nreceive the signal at all.\n\n437\n00:22:53.154 --> 00:22:54.520\nAnd that's the multicast.\n\n438\n00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.960\nThere's one last one I might throw in here\nDan, and that's the one we'll see in IPV6.\n\n439\n00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.750\nThat's called a one to the best, right.\n\n440\n00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.970\nThat's an any cast.\n\n441\n00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.650\nYou might see this for instance in DNS\nservers when you need to find a route hit\n\n442\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.600\nserver, well, which one do I go to?\n\n443\n00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.570\nI've got 13 IP addresses, right?\n\n444\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.370\nA through M I believe, and\n160 choices, which one do I go to?\n\n445\n00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.320\nWell, your router's\ngoing to do an anycast.\n\n446\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.790\nI say your router,\nit's going to be the ISP,\n\n447\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.670\nyour router just dumps it onto the ISP's\nnetwork, and we let them deal with it.\n\n448\n00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:26.130\nBut the ISP's network, is going to say,\nyou need to talk directly to a route hit?\n\n449\n00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.932\nIn this case, maybe you'll talk to\na level three I believe, 4.2.2.1, right?\n\n450\n00:23:31.932 --> 00:23:34.810\nAnd I think they're in charge of,\nfor instance, TLDs.\n\n451\n00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.990\nBut anyways, you're gonna go to\nthe closest root hit server.\n\n452\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.473\nRather than going to halfway around the\nworld [LAUGH] to a root hit server that's\n\n453\n00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:44.813\nnot even close to you at all,\nso there is an anycast.\n\n454\n00:23:44.813 --> 00:23:51.440\nBut for the test IPB 4, broadcast,\nunicast, and multicast.\n\n455\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.930\n&gt;&gt; This is probably a good spot for us to\nactually jump into, speaking of casts,\n\n456\n00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.910\nthere are some different\nalso types of domains, and\n\n457\n00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.860\nwe hear this a lot when\nit comes to networking.\n\n458\n00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.453\nWe hear broadcast domain,\ncollision domain, these are terms that\n\n459\n00:24:04.453 --> 00:24:08.375\ncan be very confusing to somebody\nwho's not initiated into networking.\n\n460\n00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:13.642\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna get in our dolorian.\n\n461\n00:24:13.642 --> 00:24:14.250\nWe're gonna.\n\n462\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.013\n&gt;&gt; Doc Brown.\n\n463\n00:24:15.013 --> 00:24:17.981\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we're gonna\ntake a trip back to the future.\n\n464\n00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:20.060\nAll right, we're gonna go back in time.\n\n465\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.600\nAll right, no don't worry about it I'm not\ngonna sing you one of those Huey Lewis\n\n466\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.750\nsongs, I won't torture you that way,\nall right.\n\n467\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.720\nI'm joking around but\nat the same time kinda serious on this.\n\n468\n00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.578\nWe don't like to use hubs in our networks\nanymore because of the fact that it's\n\n469\n00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:36.940\njust hard wire to broadcast.\n\n470\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.640\nEvery electrical signal from any\ndevice that's plugged into a hub\n\n471\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.560\nis going to broadcast out\nall over other ports.\n\n472\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.360\nAll right, you can imagine that's\ngonna cause some contention.\n\n473\n00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.710\nRemember especially ethernet's\ncontention based, right?\n\n474\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.140\nWe're the contender,\n\n475\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.130\nwe're duking it out to try to get\nthe communication on the wire.\n\n476\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.160\nSo let me go ahead and\nshow you a diagram here.\n\n477\n00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.750\nThere are two different types of domains,\n\n478\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:02.030\nthere is what's known as a collision\ndomain and a broadcast domain.\n\n479\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.350\nCollision domains have been\ngreatly reduced today, however,\n\n480\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.240\nbroadcast domains we still use them.\n\n481\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.600\nLet's see if we can kinda help\nwith the difference, right.\n\n482\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:17.000\nA collision domain is where\nyou have a communication,\n\n483\n00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.492\ntwo communications that\nhappen over the same medium.\n\n484\n00:25:21.492 --> 00:25:25.120\nAll right I want you to think\nabout two cars going head on or\n\n485\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.840\ntrains on a train track head on,\nwhat is going to happen?\n\n486\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.360\nAll right?\n\n487\n00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.550\nWe're going to have an accident, right?\n\n488\n00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:30.820\nThey're going to collide.\n\n489\n00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.480\nSo an electrical collision\nhappens when you have\n\n490\n00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.100\ntwo devices that are connected\nto the same device that can send\n\n491\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.670\nthe same signals at the same\ntime over the same medium.\n\n492\n00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.740\nThat's the problem with hubs, right?\n\n493\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.960\nWe can have a lot of\nelectrical collisions, right?\n\n494\n00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.650\nAnd if you think about what's going\non in an electrical collision,\n\n495\n00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.020\nthat's a fragmented packet that's\ndetected by the sender and\n\n496\n00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:54.930\nthen we send it again and it might\ncollide and then we send it again, right.\n\n497\n00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.540\nThat's not really efficient.\n\n498\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.210\nThat is a broadcast domain.\n\n499\n00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.140\nIn this case, these two hubs.\n\n500\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.100\n&gt;&gt; Collision domain.\n\n501\n00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.140\n&gt;&gt; Not a broadcast domain,\ncollision domain, excuse me.\n\n502\n00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.500\nThese are collision domains.\n\n503\n00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.030\nNow that has nothing to do with\naddressing at all, all right?\n\n504\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:17.080\nThe switch on the other hand, there\nare layer two broadcast Mac addresses.\n\n505\n00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.830\nWe're gonna get into Mac\naddresses here in just a second,\n\n506\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.080\nmaybe not in this episode but\nwe will, all right?\n\n507\n00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.400\nSo I want you to think of this.\n\n508\n00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.650\nWhen I send a signal to the broadcast\nlayered 2 address, where does it go?\n\n509\n00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:33.060\nIt's a broadcast communication\nguys think about it, all right.\n\n510\n00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.690\nNot only is that gonna because\nhubs is broadcast anyways.\n\n511\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:41.080\nThat broadcast communication\nis going to hit your switch.\n\n512\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.130\nSo what does the switch do to\na broadcast communication?\n\n513\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.730\nIt says it came in this port?\n\n514\n00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.470\nIt needs to go out, all ports.\n\n515\n00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.950\nSo let me broadcast it out everywhere.\n\n516\n00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:58.270\nSo, now, not only does this broadcast\nhit every single one of these devices,\n\n517\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.960\nit also hits every single\none of these devices.\n\n518\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.830\nSo, from the perspective of your network,\n\n519\n00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.250\nthe broadcast domain is like\nthis right here, all right?\n\n520\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.730\nIt's everything that's connected,\nin this case, to the switch.\n\n521\n00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.820\nNow that's the old way.\n\n522\n00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.540\nWe don't use these hubs, in fact,\nwe try not to use them at all.\n\n523\n00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.680\nAll right it's not saying that you won't\nfind some quick reason to plug one in,\n\n524\n00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.480\nthat's not what I'm saying.\n\n525\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.010\n&gt;&gt; And that's because we want to\nreduce the amount of collisions.\n\n526\n00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthat's right reduce collisions good point.\n\n527\n00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:33.950\nReduce collisions mean better performance,\nright.\n\n528\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.250\nSo when the switch, when we got rid\nof hubs, right, and we said, okay,\n\n529\n00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:43.780\nnow the switch has the ability to plug\nevery one of our devices directly into it,\n\n530\n00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.190\nsomething kinda interesting happens.\n\n531\n00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.530\nBecause the switch is a full duplex\ncommunication, right, I can send and\n\n532\n00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:54.600\nreceive because it's doing\nthe porting between ports.\n\n533\n00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.620\nGuess what, each note is now it's\nown isolated contention domain.\n\n534\n00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:05.230\nI'm contending for\nthe port that dance computer's plugin.\n\n535\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.300\nWhy?\nWell, guess what?\n\n536\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.470\nThe switch receives the information,\nlooks at a little bit of logic,\n\n537\n00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.650\nlooks at the information in the frame,\nand says it's gotta go to port 1.\n\n538\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.950\nSo, each computer now,\nin this case we're using computers,\n\n539\n00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.230\nare on their own collision domain.\n\n540\n00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.780\nThat doesn’t reduce the size of\nthe broadcast domain because\n\n541\n00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.020\nswitch is still broadcast.\n\n542\n00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.330\n&gt;&gt; Anything connected to the switch\nis in the same broadcast.\n\n543\n00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.080\n&gt;&gt; That’s right, absolutely.\n\n544\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:37.320\nSo when we look at it today,\nthese are still broadcast domains, right?\n\n545\n00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.420\nBut I want you to pay attention to\nthe device that's right in the middle.\n\n546\n00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.200\nNotice it's the router.\n\n547\n00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.070\nNotice we have a second broadcast domain.\n\n548\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.970\nAnd here's something\ninteresting about routers.\n\n549\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.260\nIn fact, Dan and I were talking\nabout this very thing yesterday.\n\n550\n00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.080\nAll right is that when the broadcast,\n\n551\n00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.630\nlet's say from PC 1 here\ngoes into the switch, right?\n\n552\n00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.758\nLike Dan says, connect to the switch,\nbroadcast can go to everybody else,\n\n553\n00:29:05.758 --> 00:29:08.150\nmeans it's gonna go to this.\n\n554\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.230\nIn fact, let me just take\nthis out of here real quick.\n\n555\n00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:14.850\nIt's going to go to this PC likewise\nall the way down the chain.\n\n556\n00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.590\nWell guess what else is also\nconnected to the switch?\n\n557\n00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.490\nOr you could say the switch\nit's connected to it,\n\n558\n00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.820\ndepending on your frame of reference.\n\n559\n00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.598\n&gt;&gt; You're perspective.\n\n560\n00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:22.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n561\n00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.610\nIt's connected to the router.\n\n562\n00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.810\nNow here's something interesting\nabout what routers do.\n\n563\n00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:33.322\nRouter see the broadcast communication and\nthey drop it,\n\n564\n00:29:33.322 --> 00:29:39.971\nthey do not pass broadcast\ncommunications across into this network.\n\n565\n00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:45.520\nSo routers separate and\nisolate broadcast domains.\n\n566\n00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.750\nThe switch didn't do that for us.\n\n567\n00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.610\nPlug into the switch you're\npart of that broadcast domain.\n\n568\n00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:56.590\nHowever, if you have a network that\nconsists of a few switches here and\n\n569\n00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.680\none of these computers sends a broadcast,\nyes it goes to everybody in this domain\n\n570\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.780\nbut once that broadcast\nreaches that router,\n\n571\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.755\nthe router looks at,\nsaid is all broadcast dump it.\n\n572\n00:30:04.755 --> 00:30:07.890\nSo it never makes it's way over here.\n\n573\n00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:12.850\nSo when you use routers,\nyou get a better performance, you can get\n\n574\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:17.430\na better performance because your\nisolating the broadcast domains, right.\n\n575\n00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.610\nIf I have a series of computers,\nlet's say it broadcasts domain two and\n\n576\n00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.200\nthere is no absolutely no reason for\nwhatever our implementation is for\n\n577\n00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:32.030\nany of that broadcast information\nto reach broadcast domain one.\n\n578\n00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.130\nI put a router in the middle,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n579\n00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.590\nThe router receives the broadcast,\ndumps it off.\n\n580\n00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.370\nSo hopefully that shows\nyou the difference.\n\n581\n00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.720\nLike I said, from where we used to go,\ncollision domains.\n\n582\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.860\nIt used to get a little bit,\nit was just very confusing.\n\n583\n00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.260\nIf you're in the same, on the same device\nwhere you can send physical signals at\n\n584\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.800\nthe same time across the same physical\nmedium, you'll get collisions.\n\n585\n00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.130\nSince today we plug directly\ninto switches rather than hubs,\n\n586\n00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:04.100\neach device has its own isolated\ncollision domain with it and the switch.\n\n587\n00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.980\nHowever, switches still broadcast.\n\n588\n00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.260\nSo we still have broadcast domains.\n\n589\n00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.140\nAnd if we want to further isolate\nbroadcast communications,\n\n590\n00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.990\nwe put a router between them and now we've\nisolated that broadcast communication\n\n591\n00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.830\nto just that portion of the network.\n\n592\n00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.737\n&gt;&gt; And the cool thing is that\nthe creators of these wonderful devices,\n\n593\n00:31:23.737 --> 00:31:26.854\nthe switches and the routers and\nthe hubs, they've realized all this.\n\n594\n00:31:26.854 --> 00:31:30.048\nAnd typically, even though Wes\nhas a router in his diagram,\n\n595\n00:31:30.048 --> 00:31:34.258\nwhich is perfectly good because it's\ngreat for teaching you what's going on.\n\n596\n00:31:34.258 --> 00:31:37.186\nYou'll usually see this inside of\nsomething like a layer three switch or\n\n597\n00:31:37.186 --> 00:31:40.594\na multiplayer switch, as they call them,\nwhich have kind of like built in routers,\n\n598\n00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:41.700\nwhich is awesome, right?\n\n599\n00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes it reduces the amount of\nequipment that we have to buy,\n\n600\n00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.500\nbringing the cost down,\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n601\n00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.590\nWes I know we've got a wee bit more to\ngo but we have a wee bit no time left.\n\n602\n00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.980\nSo that looks like we're going into yet\nanother part here.\n\n603\n00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.540\nYes IP addressing and schemes,\na little bit of a ball for\n\n604\n00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.070\nus to tackle so hopefully you'll\ncome back for that next part.\n\n605\n00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.400\nWes thanks so much for dropping by.\n\n606\n00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.720\nWe do appreciate that.\n\n607\n00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.540\nWe do appreciate you for watching but\nit looks like it is time

00:00:17.040\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.126\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are moving on this train we've\n\n8\n00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.179\nbeen on here with our network plus series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.521\nAnd of course coming back for\npart five of IP addresses

what,\n\n12\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.764\n12 episodes for IPV6?\n\n13\n00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:37.379\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that's right.\n\n14\n00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.830\nWell IPV6 is four times the

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, just kidding, guys.\n\n18\n00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.800\nWe are probably gonna wrap it up here with\n\n19\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.410\nthe last little bit that\nwe need to talk about.\n\n20\n00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.110\nAnd I say, little bit.\n\n21\n00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.060\nThere's not really a little bit to it.\n\n22\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.870\nThis topic can be as complex\nas you would like to make it.\n\n23\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.723\nAnd we're gonna try to make it not so\ncomplex for you, so\n\n24\n00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.295\nthat at least you can\nunderstand the beginnings.\n\n25\n00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:02.100\nAt least an elementary or\nfundamental level.\n\n26\n00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.920\nNow we've been talking, like Dan mentions,\nIPv4 pretty extensively.\n\n27\n00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.390\nAnd I wanna step back just for\na second and\n\n28\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.510\nI wanna talk about layer two addressing.\n\n29\n00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.030\nSee we've been talking primarily,\n\n30\n00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.130\nI mean when you talk about IP it doesn't\nmatter what version you're talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.870\nYou're talking about a layer\nthree addressing protocol, again,\n\n32\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.800\nlayer three of the OSI model.\n\n33\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.270\nRemember, we will talk about that in\nanother episode, the seven layer model.\n\n34\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.090\nLayer three is where IP routing happens,\nbut\n\n35\n00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.470\nwe haven't really talked about how\nwe speak to computers on local area\n\n36\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.276\nnetworks when we don't really\nneed routing to be involved.\n\n37\n00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:39.729\nAnd that is through something known,\na layer two address,\n\n38\n00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.534\nthat is known as a MAC address.\n\n39\n00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.480\nA MAC address, we gotta be careful.\n\n40\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.886\nAll these acronyms that you come across,\n\n41\n00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:50.297\nsome of them you can find a single\nacronym that has 15 different meanings.\n\n42\n00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:51.791\nSo, with MAC address,\n\n43\n00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:57.560\nwhat we are talking about is something\nknown as a media access control address.\n\n44\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.417\nThis is a hardware level address.\n\n45\n00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:03.731\nIt is a, Microsoft, for instance,\ncalls it a physical address and\n\n46\n00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.418\nthat is because it is burned\ninto the network adapter.\n\n47\n00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:11.024\nIn fact, you might hear it called\na burned in address, a BIA.\n\n48\n00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.430\nAs they sometimes call it.\n\n49\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.780\nNow, what are the characteristics\nof the address?\n\n50\n00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.140\nAll right well first of all,\n\n51\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.100\nit's switches that are using Mac addresses\nto forward traffic between their ports and\n\n52\n00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.770\nwe do wanna know that the switches\noperate on layer two with Mac address.\n\n53\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.650\nNow they are looking at source and\ndestination MAC address and\n\n54\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.140\nthe MAC table that is stored within them\nto figure out where to send information.\n\n55\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.030\nNow the MAC address is set by\na couple of organizations.\n\n56\n00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.410\nOne organization sets\na portion of the address,\n\n57\n00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.470\nthen the hardware manufacture set\nanother portion of the address.\n\n58\n00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.834\nIn fact, let's go ahead,\nI've got a little chart here and\n\n59\n00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:51.647\nwe can kinda show you\nhow these are broken up.\n\n60\n00:02:51.647 --> 00:02:57.114\nA MAC address, looking at, for instance,\na list here on the left-hand side,\n\n61\n00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.600\nyou'll see some examples of MAC addresses.\n\n62\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.960\nNotice that they are six bytes, right?\n\n63\n00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.446\nNotice that we have, if you count them\nout, one, two, three, four, five, six.\n\n64\n00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:11.646\nAll right now, those six bytes.\n\n65\n00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:16.430\nEven though they are used collectively,\ntogether.\n\n66\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.150\nThere are distinct portions between them,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.100\nThere is a distinguishing characteristic\nwith the first three bytes\n\n68\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.760\nversus the second three bytes.\n\n69\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.329\nKind of like we talked about in IP, right?\n\n70\n00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.540\nIt's got two portions of a network\nportion, its got a node portion.\n\n71\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.180\nWell, this is another address that\nhas two different portions of it, but\n\n72\n00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.620\nit's used considerably different\nthan what we think about in IP.\n\n73\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.831\nSee, on one hand, the first three bytes,\n\n74\n00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:42.286\nwe have what's known as\nan organizationally unique identifier.\n\n75\n00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:46.521\nNow, remember I told you two organizations\nkind of set these Mac addresses,\n\n76\n00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:49.404\nwell the main,\nthe first three bytes are set by INA.\n\n77\n00:03:49.404 --> 00:03:53.785\nRight, that's the International Internet\nassigned numbering authority,\n\n78\n00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:56.310\nif I can ever remember that acronym.\n\n79\n00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.060\nAnd they assign these addresses uniquely\n\n80\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.570\nto manufacturers of network adaptors,\nright?\n\n81\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.915\nSo for instance,\nif you were to look up Intel.\n\n82\n00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:07.462\nIntel, and\n\n83\n00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:11.080\nin fact rather than I'll tell you what\nI'm going to kind of go off script here.\n\n84\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.092\nAnd hopefully, this goes.\n\n85\n00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:13.630\nIt goes okay.\n\n86\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.344\nWe're gonna go ahead, and let me show you\nguys something known as an OUI lookup.\n\n87\n00:04:19.344 --> 00:04:24.070\nI believe Wireshark has a, yep,\nreal good one here, all right?\n\n88\n00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.510\nSo if you want to find out,\n\n89\n00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.600\nall right I'm gonna find out who\nmakes a certain network adapter.\n\n90\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.255\nWell you can actually plug in, and I don't\nknow I'm not gonna make one up here and\n\n91\n00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:40.225\nsee if they actually find one,\nyou can actually plug an OUY in here and\n\n92\n00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:41.067\nchoose find.\n\n93\n00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:45.417\nAnd I have no clue where this\ncompany is it wasn't Intel, but\n\n94\n00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:50.707\nI can find that hey look, this first\nthree bytes, these first three bytes\n\n95\n00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:56.188\nof this section are basically allocated\nby INA to a company name CIMSYS Inc.\n\n96\n00:04:56.188 --> 00:04:59.609\n&gt;&gt; Be cool if they did a reverse\nlook up where I could say Intel,\n\n97\n00:04:59.609 --> 00:05:03.176\nshow me all of the [CROSSTALK] for\nour Yeah, I cannot remember.\n\n98\n00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:07.554\nThe vendor portion of your Mac address,\nwhat is that?\n\n99\n00:05:07.554 --> 00:05:10.044\nThat'd be cool.\n&gt;&gt; I know you're tripping on it,\n\n100\n00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:12.083\nbecause if you think about it.\n\n101\n00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:15.130\nWe use these terms synonymously, right?\n\n102\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.720\nVendor ID.\n\n103\n00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.294\nI didn't call it the organizationally\nunique identifier,\n\n104\n00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:20.511\nwhich is what it's called.\n\n105\n00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.350\nKnow that OUI.\n\n106\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.570\nBut I can tell you in some representations\nyou might not even see those first\n\n107\n00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.510\nthree bytes.\n\n108\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.800\nYou might quite literally see intel_ and\nthe last three bytes, why?\n\n109\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.760\nWell, because that OUI what it's there for\n\n110\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.220\nis to show me who is the manufacturer\nof this network adaptor.\n\n111\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.830\nAnd it has to be unique\nacross the Internet,\n\n112\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.340\nthat's another thing to keep in mind.\n\n113\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.740\nThese addresses are 48-bits long,\nall right, that's trillions and\n\n114\n00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.270\ntrillions and\ntrillions of possibilities, all right.\n\n115\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.418\nNow, what about the second\nhalf of the address?\n\n116\n00:05:57.418 --> 00:06:00.130\nThis is the adapters identifier, right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.940\nI just got adapter id here, right?\n\n118\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.760\nThis is unique to the network adapter\ninside of the manufacturer right?\n\n119\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.116\nSo let's say that I am somebody like\nIntel, right, or ASUS, if you will,\n\n120\n00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:13.816\nGigabyte.\n\n121\n00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:16.087\nYou know, making motherboards and\nI've got my own,\n\n122\n00:06:16.087 --> 00:06:19.280\nBroadcom's another one out there that\nyou might see a lot, too all right.\n\n123\n00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.290\nWell, let's just take Broadcom, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.140\nBroadcom says hey, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna create this batch of\n\n125\n00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.370\nGigabit adaptors and\nwe're gonna create 50000 of them.\n\n126\n00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.322\nWell, they have to have\n50000 unique adaptor ids.\n\n127\n00:06:36.322 --> 00:06:41.980\nThey all all of those adapters\nare gonna share the Broadcom OUI.\n\n128\n00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.657\nRight so if you look here I've got\na couple, and the OUI's are identical.\n\n129\n00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:50.318\nIn fact you might be able to see\nit a little bit easier out here.\n\n130\n00:06:50.318 --> 00:06:55.195\nNow the last portion is unique, so this is\na unique address because in the last three\n\n131\n00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:58.170\nbytes, it's the adapter identifier.\n\n132\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.667\nAll right so keep that in mind\nthat we've got 6 bytes, right.\n\n133\n00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:07.250\nWe had first three bytes, OUI.\n\n134\n00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.220\nOrganizationally Unique Identifier,\nall right.\n\n135\n00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.720\nDan calls it a vendor ID.\n\n136\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.054\nYou'll hear a lot of documentation\nthat does exactly that,\n\n137\n00:07:14.054 --> 00:07:15.346\ncuz that's what it identifies.\n\n138\n00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:19.467\nI actually like that definition better cuz\nit'll help you remember what it's doing\n\n139\n00:07:19.467 --> 00:07:20.114\non the exam.\n\n140\n00:07:20.114 --> 00:07:20.900\nKeep it simple.\n\n141\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.940\nSo the Adapter ID, again, that is the last\n3 bytes of this 48 bit, 6 byte address.\n\n142\n00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.880\nKeep in mind this is\na unique hardware address.\n\n143\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.047\nAnd it is a layer two address.\n\n144\n00:07:36.047 --> 00:07:40.341\nWhen a switch builds up a MAC table, it's\nbuilding up a MAC table based on where it\n\n145\n00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:45.200\nfinds these MAC addresses assigned to\nthe different ports on its interface.\n\n146\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.879\nAnd when it forwards traffic,\n\n147\n00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:51.086\nit looks to that MAC table to see which\nport is the destination MAC address on.\n\n148\n00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:52.904\nSo I can forward it to\nthe appropriate port.\n\n149\n00:07:52.904 --> 00:07:57.818\nNow I didn't mention a broadcast address\n[LAUGH] as far as a broadcast MAC address\n\n150\n00:07:57.818 --> 00:08:00.321\ngoes That's all fs, by the way, guys.\n\n151\n00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:03.930\nSo just in case you need\nto know that is all fs.\n\n152\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:04.798\n&gt;&gt; Like what you got in school.\n\n153\n00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:05.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n154\n00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:08.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell them about my report\n\n155\n00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.625\ncard, Dan.\n\n156\n00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:17.240\nAll right, so if you think about it, we\nhave, again, with a 48-bit address here.\n\n157\n00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.670\nIf you look underneath,\n\n158\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.710\nit's essentially going to be trillions\nupon trillions of addresses, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.500\nNow that is the Mac address,\nagain when we try to think,\n\n160\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.870\nI don't think I've forgot anything there.\n\n161\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.200\nAgain it is a layer two address.\n\n162\n00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.150\nNow I wanted to go ahead and set that\nstage because we're going to talk about\n\n163\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.460\na component that call out\nthe examiner of technology, and\n\n164\n00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.470\nthat technology deals with\nthe MAC address in IPv6.\n\n165\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.930\nSo we needed you to know what the MAC\naddress was, before we move into IPv6.\n\n166\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.010\nSo now that we've set the stage for\nthat, let's go ahead and\n\n167\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.710\nlet's look at the format\nof an IPv6 address.\n\n168\n00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.190\nDan I need you to do me a favor and\nI need you to plug this address in.\n\n169\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I'm not gonna do that.\n\n170\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.918\n&gt;&gt; He's not gonna do that.\n\n171\n00:08:59.918 --> 00:09:00.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n172\n00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.910\nhe's not an hourly employee.\n\n173\n00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:02.990\nIf you're an hourly employee.\n\n174\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay I'll start now.\n\n175\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.620\nSeems to be all day.\n\n176\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.470\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n177\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.950\nThat is 128 bit address.\n\n178\n00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.770\nRemember, everything we deal\nwith in computers, everything,\n\n179\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.850\nis a base two numbering system.\n\n180\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.290\nDoesn't matter if it's your MAC address,\ndoesn't matter if it's your IP address.\n\n181\n00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.030\nWorth 2 to the power of whatever.\n\n182\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.200\nIf it's a MAC address, still binary.\n\n183\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.240\nIt's 2 to the power of 48.\n\n184\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.420\nIn this case, it's 2 to the power of 128.\n\n185\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.710\nRemember when we said\n2 to the power of 32?\n\n186\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.920\nThat's 4.3 billion,\n4.294 billion in change.\n\n187\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.000\nThis right here is 2 to\nthe power of 128 128.\n\n188\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.540\nThe possibilities are so\nastronomically large,\n\n189\n00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.680\nour mind cannot even comprehend\na number that's that big, all right.\n\n190\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.570\nAnd when I say big,\n340 undecillion addresses.\n\n191\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.380\nThat is 12 zeroes.\n\n192\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.520\nThat is a lot.\n\n193\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.000\nIn fact, analogies a lot of\ntimes don't even make sense.\n\n194\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.680\nI've got one here for you though.\n\n195\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.360\nWe've gotta throw it out.\n\n196\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.290\nIPv4 address,\nif you take each individual possibility,\n\n197\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.360\nconvert each possibility into a grain of\nsand you could fill up a very small moving\n\n198\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.310\ntruck with all that sand and\nyou still have plenty of room left over.\n\n199\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.640\nYou take that same analogy and\nyou apply it to the IPv6 address space.\n\n200\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.480\nYou would need a container\nthat is 1.3 billion times\n\n201\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.770\nof the circumference of our\nearth to contain all that sand.\n\n202\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.485\nThis routing space,\nthis addressing space is so\n\n203\n00:10:22.485 --> 00:10:27.405\nmind-bogglingly large, I don't want to\nbe the one that says never say never.\n\n204\n00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:30.615\nSo I'm going to be that one that still\ndoes say, well it will never happen.\n\n205\n00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:35.675\nBut I don't see it happening when\nevery single person on the planet\n\n206\n00:10:35.675 --> 00:10:40.975\nright now can have billions of addresses,\nwe should be good for a little bit.\n\n207\n00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:43.085\nAgain, I can't say never, right.\n\n208\n00:10:43.085 --> 00:10:47.355\n&gt;&gt; But you can have an IP address for\nevery hair on your head, for every man,\n\n209\n00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.280\nwoman, and child and for\nevery hair on their head.\n\n210\n00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.670\nIt just gets a little insane and\npurposefully right, because we don't want\n\n211\n00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.580\nto run into what we ran into with IPv4,\nwe don't want to run out of addresses.\n\n212\n00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.900\nSo they said you know what, let's just\nkick this pig as hard as we can and\n\n213\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.400\nlet's go big.\n\n214\n00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.020\n&gt;&gt; Right exactly, so\nif we look at IPv4 addresses, right?\n\n215\n00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.593\nThey're broken up into 8 bits,\nright, four 8-bit chunks.\n\n216\n00:11:13.593 --> 00:11:19.480\nWell with IPv6 being 128 bits,\nhow are those blocks broken up?\n\n217\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.260\nWell it is actually 16 bit\nblocks that we see here.\n\n218\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.820\n16 bit blocks and they are broken\nup into 8 individual blocks.\n\n219\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.890\nNow I went ahead and separated these guys\nto make it a little bit easier to kind of\n\n220\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.320\nsee what's going on here, but\nthat is one block 16 bits, all right, and,\n\n221\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.660\nif you multiply that x 8, 16 x 8,\nyou're gonna come up with 128 bits.\n\n222\n00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.300\nNow, one of the things to keep in mind,\nwhen\n\n223\n00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.470\nit comes to IPv6, IPv6, just like IPv4,\n\n224\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.490\nis not gonna be written in binary however,\nit is written a lot different.\n\n225\n00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.300\nIt's written in hexadecimal.\n\n226\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.060\nAnd in fact, let's see, do I have,\n\n227\n00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.630\nI think I got a slide here of\none pulled up, and there we go.\n\n228\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:16.162\nAll right, so\nthis is an example of an IPv6 address.\n\n229\n00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:19.550\nYou can see that it's what\nthey call coinhexidecimal,\n\n230\n00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.460\nversus dotted decimal in IPv4.\n\n231\n00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:29.340\nAnd you can see that we've got 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 blocks.\n\n232\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.990\nHowever, I want you to keep in mind,\nbecause this address is so\n\n233\n00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:39.580\nlarge they did give you ways to abbreviate\nit and make it a little bit smaller.\n\n234\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.390\nSo that it's a little easier to work with.\n\n235\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.830\nIt's still pretty complex to work with but\nit does make a little bit easier.\n\n236\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.290\nOne of the things I want\nyou guys to know for\n\n237\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.670\nthe exam is that there\nare abbreviation techniques and\n\n238\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.020\nI want you to be aware of it.\n\n239\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.420\nOne of the very first\nthings that we talked about\n\n240\n00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.580\nis the abbreviation of leading 0.\n\n241\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.620\nNotice that I have a series of\nleading 0s right here, right?\n\n242\n00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.350\nI've got three contiguous blocks of 0s,\nbut then I've got a 0054 and a 08DE.\n\n243\n00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:11.342\nWell, I can actually remove all of those,\n\n244\n00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:14.940\nleading 0s, right?\n\n245\n00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.920\nAnd when I do, I've got 0, 0, 0,\n\n246\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.570\nnotice I took off the two 0s there and\nI took off the 0 that's in front of the 8.\n\n247\n00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.460\nThat is the same exact IPv6 address,\nall right?\n\n248\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.190\nBut, there's another way that you\ncan go even farther than this.\n\n249\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.490\nNotice that I've got\nthese contiguous 0 bits?\n\n250\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.450\nYou can go even farther, and what I\ncan do is, I can further shorten that\n\n251\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.480\nIPv6 address up by taking\nthose contiguous bits, and\n\n252\n00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.680\nshortening them, and\nreplacing them with a double colon.\n\n253\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.670\nNow, let's be careful\nwith a double colon here,\n\n254\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.180\nbecause that can only appear\nin one portion of the address.\n\n255\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.790\nBecause when the computer looks at it,\nit's gonna look and\n\n256\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.393\nsee how many blocks do I\nhave in this IPv6 address.\n\n257\n00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:03.910\nI can see I've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n258\n00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.140\nWell there's a colon there and\n\n259\n00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.730\nI can tell that must mean there\nare 3 abbreviated blocks of 0s.\n\n260\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.440\nSo it know where to fill in those 0s for\n\n261\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.640\nyou so it could work with it just like\nyou can work with it a little bit easier.\n\n262\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.070\nIt doesn't stop the computer at all.\n\n263\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.290\nBut you can only have the double colon\none place inside of an IPv6 address.\n\n264\n00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.520\nAll right so do keep that in mind that\nthere are some abbreviation techniques.\n\n265\n00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.620\nNow I want to look at the structure\na little bit more of the IPv6 address so\n\n266\n00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:42.340\nthat we can of talk about some\nof the components, alright.\n\n267\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.180\nNow I went ahead and I kind of brought\nup a little bit of a diagram here.\n\n268\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.060\nIt would probably be easier if\nI do a little adjustment here.\n\n269\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.630\nGive me one second guys.\n\n270\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.158\nMake it a little easier to move\naround on the screen for me.\n\n271\n00:14:56.671 --> 00:14:58.020\nAll right, there we go.\n\n272\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.180\nNow we can move it around\na little bit easier.\n\n273\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.130\nThis is the format of your IPv6 address.\n\n274\n00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.820\nAll right,\nyou have reserve by kind of those,\n\n275\n00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.560\nthose top dogs in the internet that we've\nbeen talking about very first three bits.\n\n276\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.180\nThat's why the majority of\nyour globally accessible IPv6\n\n277\n00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:20.170\naddresses are gonna start with the two.\n\n278\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.340\nWe'll get to that here in a second here.\n\n279\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.890\nNow, the first portion of this address,\n\n280\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.400\nright first 48 bits are what are known\nas the global routing prefix.\n\n281\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.800\nAnd this is hierarchical.\n\n282\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.370\nIt has a hierarchical routing structure.\n\n283\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.370\nAnd they break it down starting\nwith the top dogs of the Internet,\n\n284\n00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.750\nthen the Internet backbone providers,\nthen your local ISP.\n\n285\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.411\nAnd this is how it routes\nacross the internet, okay.\n\n286\n00:15:43.411 --> 00:15:48.144\nThe 16 bits in the middle\nare called a subnet identifier,\n\n287\n00:15:48.144 --> 00:15:51.267\nand these are how you can, if you want,\n\n288\n00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:56.018\nyou can divide your IPVs Address\nup inside of your company.\n\n289\n00:15:56.018 --> 00:16:00.774\nThen, the last 64 bits\nare what are known as\n\n290\n00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:05.040\nthe interface identifier, all right.\n\n291\n00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.620\nNow, if we wanna look at\nthe comparison to IPv4,\n\n292\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:14.410\nthink about the first 48 bits and\n16 bits, so\n\n293\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.950\nthe first 68 bits, are what are known\nas network interface identifier.\n\n294\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.420\nNow sometimes generically,\nthey just say well the first 64 bits.\n\n295\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.450\nI kinda broke it up here a little bit, so\n\n296\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.730\nyou could see that those 64 bits\nare kinda separated, as well.\n\n297\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:33.660\nThe last 64 bits would be comparative to\nwhat's known as a host portion, all right.\n\n298\n00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.940\nAnd I want you to be aware of that,\nokay, for the exam.\n\n299\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.810\nKnow that this is the structure\nof an IPv6 address.\n\n300\n00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:47.865\nNow, we talked a little bit about\nit being essentially, hexadecimal.\n\n301\n00:16:47.865 --> 00:16:50.415\nIf you haven't seen hexadecimal, it is\n\n302\n00:16:50.415 --> 00:16:53.725\nprobably a good time to know a little\nbit more about our numbering systems.\n\n303\n00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.865\nAnd just to talk about it briefly,\nall right.\n\n304\n00:16:57.605 --> 00:17:01.325\nWhen we talk about what we\ndeal with day-to-day, right.\n\n305\n00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:04.570\nYou and I probably use BASE10\nnumbering system, right?\n\n306\n00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:09.260\nWe've talked about that,\neverything in computing uses BASE2.\n\n307\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.500\nSo, if it's Binary underneath, right?\n\n308\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.580\nWe have a binary representation, right?\n\n309\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.310\nWe've got a possible 1 or 0, that's BASE2.\n\n310\n00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.971\nHowever, I will tell you.\n\n311\n00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:26.480\nThat with IPv6, it's written in what's\nknown as a BASE16 numbering system.\n\n312\n00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.720\nAnd what does that mean?\n\n313\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.630\nWell, it means that it has\n16 possibilities right,\n\n314\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.520\nin BASE10 what do we have 0 through 9 and\nthat's it.\n\n315\n00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.457\nAnd base 16 you have 0 to 9 right, and\n\n316\n00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:46.472\nthen you have 6 additional\npossibilities right we have 10,\n\n317\n00:17:46.472 --> 00:17:50.230\n11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\n318\n00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.956\nNow, I wanna let you guys know If you need\nto pause the video for a little bit, maybe\n\n319\n00:17:53.956 --> 00:17:57.577\nwrite this down go ahead, that's what I\ndo and I'm looking at a decimal chart,\n\n320\n00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:02.012\nI like to look at the decimal and the hex\ncomparison so I know what's going on here.\n\n321\n00:18:02.012 --> 00:18:04.940\nAll right, now remember that\nI told you that your IPv6\n\n322\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:10.528\naddress is divided into 816 bit blocks.\n\n323\n00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:14.005\nNow, I kinda had a little bit\nof a little bit of a diagram,\n\n324\n00:18:14.005 --> 00:18:15.620\nkinda show you that, right?\n\n325\n00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.800\nWell, how do I know what that block\nis in hexidecimal, all right?\n\n326\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.958\nWell, that's where you need to know how\nto take hexidecimal and or excuse me,\n\n327\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.850\ntake binary and convert it to hexidecimal.\n\n328\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:28.970\nAll right, so that's what we're gonna do.\n\n329\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.790\nWe're gonna do a couple of\nexamples of that, guys.\n\n330\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.180\nJust to kinda show you\nwhat's going on here.\n\n331\n00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.220\nAll right now, I'm gonna go ahead Dan,\nand I'm gonna have you, if you will.\n\n332\n00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.556\nAnd you can think of these numbers\njust off the top of your head, and\n\n333\n00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:46.594\njust think of a hexadecimal value.\n\n334\n00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:48.870\nAnd we'll see if we can do a little\nbit of conversion here on the fly.\n\n335\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.810\nSo, give me four of those values.\n\n336\n00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.790\n&gt;&gt; All right, how about F-F-E-4?\n\n337\n00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.\n\n338\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.667\nSo we got F-F-E-4.\n\n339\n00:18:57.667 --> 00:18:59.570\nEasier to read.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n341\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.696\n&gt;&gt; It isn't that.\n\n342\n00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:01.497\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n343\n00:19:01.497 --> 00:19:02.142\n&gt;&gt; What was that last one,\n\n344\n00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:02.761\nbuddy?\nWas that 4,\n\n345\n00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:03.421\nyou said?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n346\n00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:03.921\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n347\n00:19:03.921 --> 00:19:05.355\nSo, this is what he's given me.\n\n348\n00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:10.268\nF-F E4 and I need to figure out,\nhow do I get that into binary?\n\n349\n00:19:10.268 --> 00:19:14.710\nSo, let me go ahead first of all and take\nthe wrong answer, boom out of that block,\n\n350\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:20.540\nboom gone, alright so, F's are a lot\nof time very easy to remember.\n\n351\n00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.970\nIf you look down at this chart,\nwhat is an F in binary, right?\n\n352\n00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.774\nWell, when we talk about hexadecimal.\n\n353\n00:19:26.774 --> 00:19:32.503\nI want you to think of\nevery 4 bits is represented\n\n354\n00:19:32.503 --> 00:19:36.710\nby a 0 through F, every four bits.\n\n355\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:38.940\nThat's how break down hexadecimal.\n\n356\n00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.500\nSo, 16 bits is gonna give\nme four hexadecimal values.\n\n357\n00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.800\nSo, make it easy.\n\n358\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.260\nWork four bits at a time.\n\n359\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.060\nSo we'll start with the F.\n\n360\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.130\nI know that F here, based on my chart,\nright and like I said, you guys can always\n\n361\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:56.930\ncheck the numbers of you need to, my\nfirst four digits in this hexadecimal for\n\n362\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.430\nthis binary for\nthis hexadecimal is gonna be1111.\n\n363\n00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.556\nRight, and that's makes my F.\n\n364\n00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:06.980\nI'm gonna go ahead put spaces in to\nmake a little bit easier to read.\n\n365\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.900\nWell, I know FF right, so\nthe second one gotta be 111, all right.\n\n366\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.080\nWell, how about an E, well if you wanna\nlook at the binary representation of an E\n\n367\n00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.190\nwe can see it's 1111110,\nmake sure I got that right [LAUGH].\n\n368\n00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:31.580\nEasy to lose count, so I can see that the\nthird letter is actually 1110 in binary.\n\n369\n00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.514\nThe last one he gave us was 4.\n\n370\n00:20:34.514 --> 00:20:40.040\nAll right, well, what's 4, if we go from\nhexadecimal, and we're going into binary.\n\n371\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.780\nWell, I want you to think about, you\nremember your place values that we showed\n\n372\n00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.010\nyou in IPV4, I want you to think about\nyour place values, what would a 4 b?\n\n373\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.870\nIf we had 4 bits to represent, right?\n\n374\n00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.202\nIt would be what?\n\n375\n00:20:51.202 --> 00:20:57.053\nA 0100 if I have that right, let's\nfind out, I'm not, I do have it right.\n\n376\n00:20:57.053 --> 00:20:58.494\nI'm thinking my place values, Right?\n\n377\n00:20:58.494 --> 00:21:02.200\nI'm taking that binary bit and\nthrowing it right in that 1,\n\n378\n00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.970\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 28 in my head.\n\n379\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:10.990\nSo, what does it take to\nrepresent a 4 with 4 binary bits?\n\n380\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.040\nWell, think about that table,\nthat'll help you too.\n\n381\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.803\nSo, I can tell that's 10 Excuse me,\n0110100.\n\n382\n00:21:19.803 --> 00:21:23.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I swear I can do it alright so\n\n383\n00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.470\nthat ends up being the last\n&gt;&gt; Really quickly Wes.\n\n384\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Somebody in the chair room ask,\n\n385\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.400\nis this just for\ntheir personal edification,\n\n386\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.860\nsomething we're trying to help them\nout with or is this part of the exam?\n\n387\n00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.440\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n388\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.810\nIt's a great question.\n\n389\n00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.730\nI'm not sure if they're gonna\ndo hexidecimal conversion.\n\n390\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.090\nI would have told you guys\nabout Five exams ago.\n\n391\n00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.690\nI don't know how many of\nthese exams I've had before.\n\n392\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.250\nBut, I would have told you quite a few\nexams when they weren't stressing IPv6 and\n\n393\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.310\nyou just had to know how to spell it.\n\n394\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.213\nCan I spell IPv6?\n\n395\n00:21:55.213 --> 00:21:57.050\nI would have probably said no.\n\n396\n00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:03.420\nBut, because technology has moved so\nfast, and we're using IPv6 more and more.\n\n397\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.920\nI would know the basics.\n\n398\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.480\nI really would know, memorize your chart.\n\n399\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.530\nI don't think they're gonna make\nyou do a conversion of a 128 bits.\n\n400\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:17.280\nBut, they might ask you, what is this\nletter represented in hex or in binary?\n\n401\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.829\nSo, that I would know when it\ncomes to breaking down these bits,\n\n402\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:27.440\nI would just know the hexadecimal\nconversion for the exam.\n\n403\n00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.400\nI just say that because I believe that\nthey are stressing IPv6 enough today,\n\n404\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.250\nthat you very well could\nbe asked to do that.\n\n405\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.930\nAll right, so the last one was 4,\nand I was Almost, yeah.\n\n406\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.050\nFumbling around trying to type here.\n\n407\n00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:47.355\nSo, I can actually see that FFE4\n\n408\n00:22:47.355 --> 00:22:52.880\nthese are these 16 bits in binary.\n\n409\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:58.600\nAnd that is essentially how you\nbreak down hex to binary, right?\n\n410\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.710\nIf you wanna go the other way, right?\n\n411\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.770\nI'll just take 11111,\nwell that's easy, I know that's an F.\n\n412\n00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.750\nNow, just convert it back with\nthe chart again making it easy.\n\n413\n00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.750\nNow, I've got one here that\nDan didn't participate in and\n\n414\n00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.120\nlet's kinda go through these and\nsee if we can figure out what's what.\n\n415\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.482\nSo, the first one I have is a 1001.\n\n416\n00:23:16.482 --> 00:23:20.103\nWell, I'm going to look at my chart and\nI'm going to look for\n\n417\n00:23:20.103 --> 00:23:22.700\na 1001, I could see that that's a 9.\n\n418\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.280\nSo, we'll go ahead and\n\n419\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.791\nput some backslash's in there\nbecause those always help.\n\n420\n00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:30.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, that's gonna be our 9.\n\n421\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.039\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's see what the next one is.\n\n422\n00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.723\nAll right, and that's gonna be 10100.\n\n423\n00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:44.966\nAnd I already know that's a four I\nprobably should have maybe changed that\n\n424\n00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:46.274\none up, 01100.\n\n425\n00:23:46.274 --> 00:23:49.823\nThere we go That is our four.\n\n426\n00:23:49.823 --> 00:23:52.006\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll put that there.\n\n427\n00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:54.370\nAll right, what's the next one there?\n\n428\n00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.020\nWe got 0011.\n\n429\n00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.210\nLet's look through our chart,\nand that's a three.\n\n430\n00:23:58.892 --> 00:24:00.900\nAll right, and\nagain I'm just kind of using this chart.\n\n431\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.990\nThe chart really really helps out just\nlike the place values that we really\n\n432\n00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:08.220\nstressed in breaking down IPv4\naddresses from decimal to binary.\n\n433\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.040\nLast one here, we got 1110,\n\n434\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.530\nthat's the second to last one in the list,\nso I know that's gonna be an e.\n\n435\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:21.960\nSo 1110,\nwe'll get it right eventually, is E.\n\n436\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.660\nSo that is a little bit of a conversion.\n\n437\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.280\n&gt;&gt; That's not an E.\n\n438\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:24.790\n&gt;&gt; Is that not an E?\n\n439\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:25.320\n&gt;&gt; That's a 5.\n\n440\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll put potato\nin there and that'll be close.\n\n441\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.350\nClose enough there, E.\n\n442\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.530\nThere we go, perfect.\n\n443\n00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.360\nIt's getting a little bit easier to read,\neventually, if I type the right things.\n\n444\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.650\n&gt;&gt; So you can see how\n\n446\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.160\nwell working with an Excel spreadsheet is.\n\n447\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.720\nKeep in mind that this is how you do\nyour conversion from you hexadecimal\n\n448\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.410\ninto binary.\n\n449\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.750\nSo if they give you a binary number and\nyou can, kind of,\n\n450\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.020\nmemorize this chart, you'll be doing well.\n\n451\n00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.400\nI know there are plenty of\nlittle tricks and stuff.\n\n452\n00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.660\nPeople talk about counting\non their hands and stuff.\n\n453\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.290\nI don't really do that,\nI just break it down so\n\n454\n00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.230\nI can see what the bits are doing and\nit makes it a little bit easier for\n\n455\n00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:04.250\nme just kind of knowing\nwhat the bits are doing.\n\n456\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.450\nAlright, so one of the other things that\nI kinda wanna stress, let's see her,\n\n457\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.640\nwhere we at, we talked about\nthe address structure, okay.\n\n458\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.490\nI wanna talk a little bit about\nthe address types that you might see.\n\n459\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:25.570\nYou probably see me scrolling through and\ncome across this chart here.\n\n460\n00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.510\nI wanna just take a second and\ntalk about this chart.\n\n461\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.870\nCuz there's some different address\ntypes that I definitely want\n\n462\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:34.310\nyou guys to be aware of here, all right.\n\n463\n00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.810\nAnd that are typically\nthese first routing prefix.\n\n464\n00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.950\nCuz remember the first few bits that\nI was telling you about, all right?\n\n465\n00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.730\nNow, keep in mind that technically\nanything that starts with a 2\n\n466\n00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:53.050\nis gonna fall under some kind of\nglobally routable unicast address.\n\n467\n00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:57.230\nHowever, there are a few of those in the\n2000s that have kind of been set aside for\n\n468\n00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.860\nspecific capabilities.\n\n469\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.790\nOne is Teredo and one is 6-to-4.\n\n470\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.340\nWe'll start out with 6-to-4 real quick.\n\n471\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.920\nThat is a tunneling technology that\nallows me to take IPv6 only traffic and\n\n472\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.110\nencapsulate it and\nsend it over an IPv4 only network.\n\n473\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.750\nThat's why they call it 6-to-4.\n\n474\n00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.720\nThey also call out 4-to-6 and\n4-to-6 is just the opposite.\n\n475\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.330\nIt means that I've got an IPv4 only\nnetwork which typically our internet still\n\n476\n00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.310\nis predominately the IPv4 traffic,\n\n477\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.720\nso 4-to-6 means that I'm going\nto take 4 traffic and I'm going\n\n478\n00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.830\nto encapsulate it over an IPv6 network and\nI'm going to send it on its way.\n\n479\n00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:41.580\nAnd you can see 6-to-4 technology\nis the 2002, that first block,\n\n480\n00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.870\nright, so that first prefix\nthere if you will is 2002.\n\n481\n00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.320\nToredo is something that.\n\n482\n00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.430\nReally nobody should use\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n483\n00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.530\nIt is on the exam it's still there and\nwe gonna kinda know about it but\n\n484\n00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:57.950\nit's not really a popular implementation\nwhen it comes to having IPv4\n\n485\n00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.830\ntraffic that you need to\nsend over on IPv6 network.\n\n486\n00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:06.220\nWhat this is really about is when you\nhave network address translation devices.\n\n487\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.514\nThat you are passing through and\nyou need to communicate IPv6,\n\n488\n00:27:10.514 --> 00:27:16.178\nIPv4 beyond network address translation\nbased devices you're gonna use Toredo.\n\n489\n00:27:16.178 --> 00:27:20.286\nNow Toredo is a proprietary technology\nI believe was invented by Microsoft so\n\n490\n00:27:20.286 --> 00:27:23.770\nyou'll see an open source\nstandard called Miredo.\n\n491\n00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.380\nAll right, so Teredo and Miredo.\n\n492\n00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.690\nJust understand that these\nare transitional translational technology,\n\n493\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.200\nreally should be transitional.\n\n494\n00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.335\nAnd in fact, a lot of people say that\nit really is a nightmare to set Teredo.\n\n495\n00:27:34.335 --> 00:27:39.190\n6-to-4, we use, and the other one\nthey don't mention on the list.\n\n496\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.570\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and mention it\ncuz you guys should know about it.\n\n497\n00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:42.760\nAnd that's ISATAP.\n\n498\n00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.340\nBecause ISATAP is how we\nencapsulate traffic on our lan.\n\n499\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.370\nIf we don't need to go over the Internet,\nthen we don't need 6-to-4 right?\n\n500\n00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:58.050\nWe just need ISATAP So you might see a\nISATAP address or an ISATAP communication.\n\n501\n00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.140\nThat is when you have IPv6 traffic that\nyou need to you need to send over an IPv4\n\n502\n00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.250\nnetwork, but\nit's only with inside of your LAN.\n\n503\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:08.990\nWhat you need that same functionality, but\nyou need it to pass a router's interface\n\n504\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.678\nand go across the internet,\nyou're gonna use 6-to-4 technology.\n\n505\n00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.970\nCouple of the other types\nthat we wanna know,\n\n506\n00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.700\nmulticast, multicast communications,\nnow that brings us to\n\n507\n00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.460\nanother topic that we mentioned when we\nwere talking about communication types.\n\n508\n00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.030\nNotice there isn't a broadcast address and\nyou wear here in the IPv6.\n\n509\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:32.150\nWell that's because broadcast\ncommunications are eliminated,\n\n510\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:36.180\nwe don't have broadcast communications\ninside of IPv6, what we have our\n\n511\n00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:40.930\nunit cast and multicast communications\nbecause it makes it a lot more efficient.\n\n512\n00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.440\nCommunicating across your networks,\n\n513\n00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.850\nif you can eliminate all that mumbo-jumbo\nthat's gong on in the background.\n\n514\n00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:51.120\nThe broadcast communications that's they\nwere doing have been wrapped up into\n\n515\n00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.570\nthings like multicast communications.\n\n516\n00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.570\nI'll give you an example, we'll talk\nabout protocols in another episode but\n\n517\n00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:04.100\nthere is one In IPv4 that relies\nheavily on a broadcast communication.\n\n518\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.220\nIt's called a address resolution protocol.\n\n519\n00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.820\nSee, IPv4 doesn't understand\na MAC address, has no clue.\n\n520\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.620\nSo when routing is done, and\nwe're on the LAN, how does IP\n\n521\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.620\ndeliver the traffic to the destination,\nif it's based on a hardware MAC address?\n\n522\n00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.460\nWell, it uses ARP.\n\n523\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.610\nIt calls out to the network and\nsays, who's got this IP address?\n\n524\n00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.000\nIt's a broadcast communication.\n\n525\n00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.650\nSo since everybody hears it,\n\n526\n00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:33.710\nthe one computer that does have\nthat IP address also heard it.\n\n527\n00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.350\nSays, yeah, you could find\n192.168.1.20 at this Mac address.\n\n528\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.820\nBut it's a broadcast communication.\n\n529\n00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:44.110\nThat is handled differently inside\nof IPv6, it multicast communication.\n\n530\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.190\nNext one we have is\nthe link local address.\n\n531\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.660\nLink local addresses these\nare used pretty much by\n\n532\n00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.000\nevery computer that has IPv6 enabled.\n\n533\n00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000\nYour link local address makes it easier to\nfind people on your local network right?\n\n534\n00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.760\nI don't have to call out,\n\n535\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.290\nagain with arps hey who's out there\nI need to communicate with you.\n\n536\n00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.380\nIn fact, we all have multicast addresses.\n\n537\n00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.360\nThese link local addresses.\n\n538\n00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.170\nAnd what can happen here Is we could turn\naround and we could send the information\n\n539\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.310\ndirectly to our nearest neighbour\nwith the link local address.\n\n540\n00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:23.290\nSo keep in mind, you have what\nare known as the global addresses.\n\n541\n00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.580\nA global unicast address is what's\nkind of like your public IPv4 address.\n\n542\n00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.020\nIt's routable across the internet,\nall right?\n\n543\n00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.600\nWhat we have that's akin to a private IP\naddress is the last one on the list here.\n\n544\n00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.080\nThese are called unique local addresses,\nULAs.\n\n545\n00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.930\nAnd these are used inside\nof your organizations.\n\n546\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.369\nThese are akin, if you will,\nto the private IP address.\n\n547\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.020\nThe link-local address however,\nis when you're talking about,\n\n548\n00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.530\nconnected to the same local network,\nall right?\n\n549\n00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.540\nNow this one's kind of\ninteresting because.\n\n550\n00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:02.030\nIn IPv4, we have one address that we\ndid talk about in the DHCP episode, but\n\n551\n00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.220\nthey call it on the objective, so\nI want to kind of mention that.\n\n552\n00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.550\nAnd that's that one reserved\naddress in IPv4 called APIPA.\n\n553\n00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.840\nAPIPA is when I can't communicate\nwith a DHCP server, right.\n\n554\n00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:19.783\nRather than not have any IP address,\nmy computer gives me this 169.2.4.\n\n555\n00:31:19.783 --> 00:31:23.100\nanything.anything, the last two\noctets are generated by my computer.\n\n556\n00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.030\nAnd I can at least maintain\na communication with\n\n557\n00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.616\nother computers that have a APIPA address.\n\n558\n00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:35.020\nAll right guess what here inside of\nIPv6 we don't need any paper address.\n\n559\n00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.700\nWe use a link local.\n\n560\n00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.060\nI don't have to talk to a DHCP server\nto obtain a link local address,\n\n561\n00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.903\nmaking it ideal for local communications.\n\n562\n00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:49.411\nThat also leads me into,\nwell do we even use DHCP in version 6?\n\n563\n00:31:49.411 --> 00:31:52.491\nWell, yeah, but for\nmaybe different reasons for\n\n564\n00:31:52.491 --> 00:31:54.702\nthat you would think of then IPv4.\n\n565\n00:31:54.702 --> 00:31:57.457\n&gt;&gt; You still don't wanna go around\nmanually configuring every node on\n\n566\n00:31:57.457 --> 00:31:58.092\nyour network.\n\n567\n00:31:58.092 --> 00:31:59.640\nThat wouldn't be fun.\n\n568\n00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.315\n&gt;&gt; Not at all.\n\n569\n00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:02.566\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's what brings us into\n\n570\n00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:06.460\nsomething known as\nstateless configuration.\n\n571\n00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:11.290\nSee, one of the great things about\nIPv6 is that your network adapters,\n\n572\n00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.460\nand the operating systems,\nthey can generate,\n\n573\n00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.910\nwell the operating system's\nwhat's controlling everything,\n\n574\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:22.980\nit's generating and\ncan generate it's own unique IPv6 address.\n\n575\n00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.900\nI'll show you have it does that.\n\n576\n00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.970\nIn fact,\nI've got a little diagram here and\n\n577\n00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.747\nthis is something known as\nthe Extended User Interface 64, all right?\n\n578\n00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:31.144\nEUI-64.\n\n579\n00:32:31.144 --> 00:32:32.980\nThis is kind of interesting, right?\n\n580\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.730\nBecause we already have a 48-bit\naddress that, theoretically,\n\n581\n00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.400\nis supposed to be unique\nacross the entire world.\n\n582\n00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.180\nWell wouldn't it be nice since we know\ngoing out the gate every computer,\n\n583\n00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:49.100\nevery device that sends information\nacross TCP IP network has a mac address,\n\n584\n00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.050\nhas a 48 bit address.\n\n585\n00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.400\nWell guess what?\n\n586\n00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.920\nIf we can take that address and\nautomatically assign it to the network\n\n587\n00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.450\ninterface portion of\nan IPv6 address guess what?\n\n588\n00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.390\nWe now have unique\nnetwork interfaces across\n\n589\n00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.290\nevery IPv6 address that could be\nassigned to a network adapter.\n\n590\n00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.600\n&gt;&gt; That's some smart people out there.\n\n591\n00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.580\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n592\n00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.250\nSo what they did, is they took,\nand they said, you know what?\n\n593\n00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:15.290\nWe're gonna reserve these series of bits,\nright here, is that eight, 16 bits.\n\n594\n00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:17.010\nWe're gonna reserve these 16 bits.\n\n595\n00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:21.880\nIn these 16 bits, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll insert between your Mac address.\n\n596\n00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.290\nWell, your operating system's doing it.\n\n597\n00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.020\nAnd that leaves you now from a 48 bit Mac\n\n598\n00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:34.600\naddress to a 64 bit network interface\nidentifier, or interface identifier.\n\n599\n00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.870\nExcuse me, gotta be careful there,\ninterface Identifier.\n\n600\n00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.000\nYour computers can automatically\ngenerate these, all right?\n\n601\n00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.240\nNow the question is if I can\nautomatically generate an IPv6 address,\n\n602\n00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.310\nwhy do I need DHCP?\n\n603\n00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.020\nWell, the answer is you don't.\n\n604\n00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.150\nBut I want you to think about some things\nthat we talked about in our DHCP episode.\n\n605\n00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.890\nSee, DHCP is not just about IP addresses.\n\n606\n00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.930\nSo I want you to understand starting off,\n\n607\n00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:05.720\nI want you to think of the two\nmiddle letters in DHCP.\n\n608\n00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.860\nIt is a host configuration protocol,\ndynamic host configuration protocol.\n\n609\n00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:18.370\nSo yes, even though our IPv6 address\ncan be generated automatically through\n\n610\n00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:23.330\nE64 technology, wouldn't be nice to still\nhave them talk to the DACP server and\n\n611\n00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.690\npull down their default gateway,\npull down their DNS server,\n\n612\n00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:30.950\npull down any other configurations\nthat we might domain names.\n\n613\n00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:35.080\nAnd that's why they use DHC.\n\n614\n00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.345\n&gt;&gt; You can't do it.\n\n615\n00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:37.711\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; DHCPV6!\n\n616\n00:34:37.711 --> 00:34:39.170\nWe'll use acronyms.\n\n617\n00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.120\nThat's why.\n\n618\n00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:40.730\n&gt;&gt; It's fun.\n\n619\n00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.230\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n620\n00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:43.060\nThey call it stateless.\n\n621\n00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.180\nStateless DHCP, okay.\n\n622\n00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.250\nBecause what we can do is we can say,\nsure.\n\n623\n00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.750\nInterfaces, operating\nsystems generate your own,\n\n624\n00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:56.130\nuse E-way 64 that's what it's there for\nbut talk to the DHCP server so\n\n625\n00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.920\nyou get pulled out as\nan additional configurations.\n\n626\n00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.050\nNow you might be wondering can you\nlocally administer to an E-way 64\n\n627\n00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:09.370\ntype of address, yes you can but\nthere's no reason to.\n\n628\n00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.720\nThere are ways you can\nlocally administer but\n\n629\n00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.650\nmore commonly is to let the interface,\nthe network adapters and\n\n630\n00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.620\nthe operating systems if you will\ngenerate their own communications.\n\n631\n00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.310\nSo that's stateless by the way\nis auto configuration.\n\n632\n00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.460\nLet's see, did I miss anything?\n\n633\n00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.320\nNo I think I've got it.\n\n634\n00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.520\nDon't be intimidated by it.\n\n635\n00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.720\nIf this is the first time you've\nheard some of these concepts,\n\n636\n00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.390\nguys, just keep practicing it, all right.\n\n637\n00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:37.270\nI know you're like, my gosh, Wes, you just\ngave us IPv4 and we're learning that and\n\n638\n00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.710\nnow you say, well, wait a second,\nwe've got something even bigger to learn.\n\n639\n00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.735\nYes, yes I am.\n\n640\n00:35:41.735 --> 00:35:45.520\n[LAUGH] But the more you practice at it,\nthe better you will get.\n\n641\n00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.760\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n642\n00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.880\nWell, we got done in one episode\nwhen it comes to IPv6 anyway.\n\n643\n00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.800\nJust goes to show you that there's\na whole lot more information\n\n644\n00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.390\nwhen it comes to IPv4 that you need to\nknow really for the exam anyway than IPv6,\n\n645\n00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.120\nso now you know where to\nfocus your your efforts.\n\n646\n00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.090\nThat being said, looks like we finally\nrounded out IP schemes and IP addressing,\n\n647\n00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:09.320\nwhole lot of fun, it is something you\ntoo need to kind of bury in the brain.\n\n648\n00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.550\nMake it part of your persona as it were,\nas a network technician is.\n\n649\n00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.600\nThis is gonna help you,\nnot only on the exam, but\n\n650\n00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.630\nin the long run working out on the field.\n\n651\n00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.055\nWest you did a fantastic job.\n\n652\n00:36:19.055 --> 00:36:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Thanks Lowrie.\n\n653\n00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.680\n&gt;&gt; Of explaining these techniques, these\ntips, these things that we need to know.\n\n654\n00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.690\nBut it is that time for us to sign off.\n\n655\n00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.640\nFor IT Pro TV, I have been your host,\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n656\n00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.500\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wess Bryan.\n\n657\n00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:30.690\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n658\n00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:37.468\n[MUSIC]\n\n659\n00:36:37.468 --> 00:36:40.657\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.247\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.508\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.500\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.710\nIn this episode, we will be examining\nrouting concepts and protocol basics.\n\n8\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.080\nWith us today to help with our topic,\nis going to be Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.610\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n10\n00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.950\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.492\nThat's right, we are back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:34.995\nAnd we are talking about well,\na really important concept.\n\n13\n00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.305\nWhen we talk about well,\n\n14\n00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.345\ncommunicating across networks that\nwe're not directly connected to.\n\n15\n00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:40.545\nWe have to use routing, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.035\nIf we're talking about Layer 2 technology,\n\n17\n00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.635\ntypically means we have some kinda direct\nconnection to a connectivity device,\n\n18\n00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:49.905\nthat can forward traffic to and\nfrom, source and endpoint.\n\n19\n00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:54.260\nHowever, when we talk about forwarding\ntraffic, or getting that traffic from\n\n20\n00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.448\na network that I'm not directly attached\nto, that's where routing comes in.\n\n21\n00:00:58.448 --> 00:01:02.360\nSo it is gonna be important that you\nunderstand the basics of routing.\n\n22\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.150\nNow, when we talk about routing we've got\na few different protocols that we can use.\n\n23\n00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.070\nAnd depending on what\nthe necessity is of the network and\n\n24\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.170\nwhat we really need, will define\nwhich of these protocols that we use.\n\n25\n00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.940\nNow, we wanna talk about what\na routing protocol does for us.\n\n26\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.510\nNow, when we talk about routing protocol,\n\n27\n00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.231\nyou should understand that,\nyes it does route traffic.\n\n28\n00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.890\nBut really,\nit allows us to learn about the networks.\n\n29\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.150\nNetwork or networks if you will,\ndepending on which protocol it is.\n\n30\n00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.300\nNow, the routing protocols\nare used to discover routes and\n\n31\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.560\ndetermine, what the best path\nis from source to destination.\n\n32\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.190\nAnd there are different routing protocols\nthat do this a little bit differently, so\n\n33\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.150\nit is important to understand that.\n\n34\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.640\nNow when we talk about using routing\nprotocols to discover routes,\n\n35\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.140\nthere are two different ways\nthat we can use routes.\n\n36\n00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.620\nAnd one of those ways is,\nwhat is known as a static route, and\n\n37\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.520\nthe other way that they call out is,\na dynamic route.\n\n38\n00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.170\nAll right.\nIn fact,\n\n39\n00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.380\nI got a little diagram right here.\n\n40\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.530\nAnd we'll talk about the static and\nthe dynamic route.\n\n41\n00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.640\nWhen I have multiple paths, that I can\ntake to get to a destination network.\n\n42\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.530\nWell, which path am I going to take?\n\n43\n00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.990\nWell that depends on\nyour network topology and\n\n44\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.270\nyou need to learn your\nconnectivity devices.\n\n45\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.240\nRemember we talked about in another\nepisode, how routers were the smartest\n\n46\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.530\nconnectivity devices that\nthere is really on the planet.\n\n47\n00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.290\nBecause they can look at a database\nof destination networks,\n\n48\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.240\nwhere they know where to send the traffic.\n\n49\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.530\nAnd over time the entries in\nthat database can change,\n\n50\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.570\nbased on the routing\nprotocol that they're using.\n\n51\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.710\nSo, a dynamic routing protocol, or\n\n52\n00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.190\na dynamic router if you will,\nis one that we've learned, right?\n\n53\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.340\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be\npermanently in the routing table.\n\n54\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.830\nI might find that for instance,\nto get to this network here,\n\n55\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.850\nmaybe this link right here is down,\nmaybe this link is a slow link.\n\n56\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.878\nBut, there's a fast link here,\nand if I send it to router one,\n\n57\n00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:07.362\nit'd be more efficient than sending\nit to router two, which is closer\n\n58\n00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:11.624\ntechnically in this network,\nto router three than router one is.\n\n59\n00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:12.856\nBut we don't necessarily know that.\n\n60\n00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:15.613\nAnd that's where the dynamic\nrouting protocols come in,\n\n61\n00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:18.280\ncuz they allow us to learn\nthe network topology.\n\n62\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.120\nAnd it allows these routers to communicate\nwith one another and figure out, what is\n\n63\n00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.570\nthe best path if I was going, let's say,\nfrom router four to router three?\n\n64\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.890\nMaybe it is a direct path.\n\n65\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.035\nMaybe that's a 56K line, and this is\na SONET line, and that's a SONET line.\n\n66\n00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:37.580\nRight.\nYou have an overall 10 G here, and\n\n67\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.480\nyou have 10 G here.\n\n68\n00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.179\nWell now, that direct route from router\nfour to router three, isn't looking so\n\n69\n00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.086\ngood anymore.\n\n70\n00:03:44.086 --> 00:03:49.966\nBut, If we're not using dynamic routing\nprotocols to implement dynamic routes,\n\n71\n00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:53.110\nthen we may not be aware of that.\n\n72\n00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.890\nNow, there is what is known\nas static routes too.\n\n73\n00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.444\nOkay.\nAnd\n\n74\n00:03:57.444 --> 00:04:00.722\nit's important to understand that\na static routes is one that's set by\n\n75\n00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:01.658\nan administrator.\n\n76\n00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.360\nAll right.\n\n77\n00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.649\nWhen the administrator says,\n\n78\n00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:10.200\nI know what route I want router four\nto use to communicate with router five.\n\n79\n00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.811\nAnd in this case, since there isn't\nany other routes that we can go,\n\n80\n00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:18.706\nused in this case,\nto get from router four to router five,\n\n81\n00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:24.810\nwhy do I need to use a dynamic routing\ndiscovery protocol to learn of that fact?\n\n82\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.780\nSo I could put static\nroute here that says,\n\n83\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.540\nsince I've only got one connection\nbetween these two routers,\n\n84\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.260\nwhy do I have to waste CPU strength\nmaking decisions to discover that fact?\n\n85\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.350\nWell, we can implement a static\nroute which tells these two routers,\n\n86\n00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.300\nany time you send traffic between\nthese two, you will use this route.\n\n87\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.880\nNow, like we talked\nabout in other episodes,\n\n88\n00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.375\nwe talked about dynamic and\nstatic IP addressing.\n\n89\n00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:52.708\nRight.\nIt has its benefits and\n\n90\n00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:54.530\ncould have its drawbacks, right?\n\n91\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.120\nUsually static IP addressing is more about\nthe workload than anything else, and\n\n92\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.916\nthis configuration errors.\n\n93\n00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:02.060\nAll right.\nWell, there's probable static routes,\n\n94\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.200\njust like we say that there are some good\nthings and there are some drawbacks.\n\n95\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.540\nRight.\nWell, one of the good things about\n\n96\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.910\nthe static route, we'll go with the good\nfirst we'll be optimistic here,\n\n97\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.010\nis the fact that I don't have to waste\ntime processing a routing table.\n\n98\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.205\nLooking and inspecting,\nwhere's that entry?\n\n99\n00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:15.610\nOkay.\nDo I have the best entry?\n\n100\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.969\nHey let me communicate\nwith this next router?\n\n101\n00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:18.860\nWhat do you have?\n\n102\n00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.933\nIs that better than what I have?\n\n103\n00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:21.540\nI don't have to waste all that time.\n\n104\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.120\nI look at the routing table, I see.\n\n105\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.250\n&gt;&gt; Speed.\n&gt;&gt; The administrator, you got it.\n\n106\n00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.070\nNo CPU, no calculation.\n\n107\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.230\nI look at that routing table, if I'm\na router I guess or the administrator,\n\n108\n00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.445\nlook at that routing table I know, we're\ngonna use this route to go to that device.\n\n109\n00:05:35.445 --> 00:05:38.599\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like a typo\nwith security though, right?\n\n110\n00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.790\nLike to prevent any kind of rogue routers,\nthat's another really, in my book, a pro.\n\n111\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:45.355\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n113\n00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:48.690\nif you've only got a single link\nyou can even implement, some\n\n114\n00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.190\nof your classless inter-domain routing and\nreduce that a little bit farther too.\n\n115\n00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.000\nBut when it comes down to it,\nwhat happens if that static route fails?\n\n116\n00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.450\nAll right.\nSo what happens if the static route fails?\n\n117\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.620\nAnd now we don't have that one route,\nbetween router four and router five.\n\n118\n00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.889\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] other column, the con.\n\n119\n00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.669\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n120\n00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:07.820\nThat's where the con comes in.\n\n121\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.870\nBecause the con is, I'm still gonna try\nto use that route if I'm router four.\n\n122\n00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.550\nIt didn't change the fact, just because\nthe link is down, that I'm not gonna try\n\n123\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.900\nto still send traffic out that route,\neven if it's failed.\n\n124\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.760\nAnd that's the problem.\n\n125\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.550\nAnd that's one of the big differences\nbetween static routing and\n\n126\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.295\ndynamic routing.\n\n127\n00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:25.110\nYeah you get a benefit.\n\n128\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.690\nIf I know that there is only one link\nbetween these two routers, then I'm gonna\n\n129\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.239\nstatically map it, I'm not gonna waste\ntime with processing a routing table.\n\n130\n00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.680\nHowever, with the dynamic routes,\nroutes can change, right?\n\n131\n00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.510\nTopologies can change.\n\n132\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.380\nThe dynamics of your network can change.\n\n133\n00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.780\nA link can be up and down.\n\n134\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.160\nSo what happens if, router four needs\nto communicate with Router three?\n\n135\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.090\nWell it knows it has a direct connection.\n\n136\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.150\nAnd in the routing table, if you've got\na direct connection between endpoints,\n\n137\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.400\nit's gonna be the preferred choice,\ncuz it's the quickest path a lot of times.\n\n138\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.840\nBut what happens if that route fails?\n\n139\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.650\nWell, if it's a static route we've already\ntold you, it will still try to communicate\n\n140\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.240\nwith router three over that link,\neven if it fails.\n\n141\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.700\nNow with a dynamic routing protocol\nit can say, hey wait a second here,\n\n142\n00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:13.600\nI can't talk to router two but\nrouter one, how do you get to router two?\n\n143\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.140\nDo you know how to get to router two?\n\n144\n00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.680\nOr router three,\ndo you know how to get to router two?\n\n145\n00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.350\nAnd these guys can talk, or\ngals, can talk back and forth.\n\n146\n00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.820\nI don't know why they're always guys.\n\n147\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.535\nProbably cuz they're always breaking down.\n\n148\n00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:25.720\n[LAUGH] Breaking things.\n\n149\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.250\nBut, between the two routers\nthey could talk to router three.\n\n150\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.021\nI can talk to router four and\nI can say how do we get to router two?\n\n151\n00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:35.565\nWell router one might say, yeah you know\nwhat, I know how to get to router two,\n\n152\n00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:37.570\njust send that information to me.\n\n153\n00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.089\nRight.\nAnd now we've conned one of the beauties\n\n154\n00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:44.478\nof routing in dynamic routing, is that\nwe've found a way to still communicate\n\n155\n00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:47.953\nto router two, even though that\nlink in this case has failed.\n\n156\n00:07:47.953 --> 00:07:50.530\nSo that is a benefit to dynamic routing.\n\n157\n00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.857\nNow again,\nthe drawback to dynamic routing.\n\n158\n00:07:53.857 --> 00:07:57.225\nIs well, we gonna have to\nuse some routing protocols.\n\n159\n00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:59.047\nAnd we have to make a choice\nof which one we use.\n\n160\n00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:03.626\nAnd depending on which one we use,\ncould cost a lot more money to implement.\n\n161\n00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:06.080\nAgain depending on which one you use.\n\n162\n00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.356\nSo, that takes us into what\ntype of routing protocols,\n\n163\n00:08:09.356 --> 00:08:11.667\ndynamic routing protocols do we have.\n\n164\n00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:13.961\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's kinda funny you use the term cost.\n\n165\n00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.786\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; When we look at our metrics here,\n\n166\n00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.524\nthat sometimes people say that, right?\n\n167\n00:08:17.524 --> 00:08:18.737\nYou look at the cost of the route.\n\n168\n00:08:18.737 --> 00:08:22.477\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and we're gonna look at\nthose costs and those metrics coming up.\n\n169\n00:08:22.477 --> 00:08:24.420\nSo, we have two different primary, well,\n\n170\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.579\nthree different depending\non how you look at it.\n\n171\n00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:29.039\nBecause they always lump\nhybrid protocols in there.\n\n172\n00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:30.593\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; And that's kind of a blending of\n\n173\n00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:31.554\na couple of categories.\n\n174\n00:08:31.554 --> 00:08:35.308\nBut primarily we got two types\nof routing protocols, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:35.308 --> 00:08:38.590\nWe have what are known as,\n\n176\n00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.268\nlet me see if I can find my slide here for\nthis.\n\n177\n00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:46.437\nI think, there we go.\n\n178\n00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:49.859\nI'm gonna talk about a couple of\ndifferent types of protocols in context.\n\n179\n00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:53.790\nWe've got what are known as interior\ngateway protocols, all right.\n\n180\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.072\nInterior gateway protocols\nare responsible for\n\n181\n00:08:57.072 --> 00:08:59.879\nrouting traffic inside of our networks.\n\n182\n00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.037\nThat's why they call them\nInterior Gateway Protocols.\n\n183\n00:09:02.037 --> 00:09:06.480\nAnd the two primary ones that we have,\nwell, there's a few of them.\n\n184\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.610\nBut the two different types that\nwe have are what are known as\n\n185\n00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.802\nDistance Vector Routing Protocols, and\n\n186\n00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:14.757\nwe have what are known as\nLink State Routing Protocols.\n\n187\n00:09:14.757 --> 00:09:18.826\nAnd then we'll talk about some\nthat kinda blend the two here,\n\n188\n00:09:18.826 --> 00:09:21.027\ntwo of those concepts together.\n\n189\n00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:24.371\nI wanna talk about the very first one\nwhich is a Distance Vector Protocol.\n\n190\n00:09:24.371 --> 00:09:28.346\nThis is an example of an interior gateway\nprotocol that routes traffic with\n\n191\n00:09:28.346 --> 00:09:29.680\ninside of our networks.\n\n192\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.510\nNow if you see,\nyou're probably wondering right away.\n\n193\n00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.214\nWell, wait a second, Wes,\ndidn't you skip one?\n\n194\n00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:37.662\nYou say, RIPv22, well,\nwhat happened to RIPv1?\n\n195\n00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:39.070\nWell, RIPv1's out there, but\n\n196\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.299\nit's largely not gonna be used because\nof some of the drawbacks that it has.\n\n197\n00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:43.937\nAnd we'll talk about those coming up.\n\n198\n00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:49.302\nBut RIPv2, when we talk about distance\nvector routing protocols, right.\n\n199\n00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:51.599\nCherokee mentioned that term cost.\n\n200\n00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:54.676\nCost, all right, I want you to think\nof taking a road trip, all right.\n\n201\n00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:59.030\nAnd you've got two or three different ways\nthat you could go to the same destination.\n\n202\n00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.639\nSome are longer than others.\n\n203\n00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.425\nWell if you think about\nthe one that's longer,\n\n204\n00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:04.130\nit's gonna take you more gas money, right?\n\n205\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.520\nIt's gonna take you, a longer trip,\nit's gonna take you more gas to get there.\n\n206\n00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.340\nSo it's gonna cost you more.\n\n207\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.218\nSo when you're planning out your trip, and\n\n208\n00:10:11.218 --> 00:10:13.248\nthe best path to get to\nthat final destination,\n\n209\n00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:16.419\nit might be the one that doesn't cost\nyou quite as much gas money, right.\n\n210\n00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:17.796\nThe cost is lower.\n\n211\n00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:20.873\nWell RIP uses cost, but what it's, cost or\n\n212\n00:10:20.873 --> 00:10:25.960\nits metric is that makes the determination\nis how far, distance right?\n\n213\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.130\nHow far is it to that end point.\n\n214\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.137\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's\ngonna calculate the shortest\n\n215\n00:10:33.137 --> 00:10:38.057\namount of hops, if you will,\nfrom source to destination.\n\n216\n00:10:38.057 --> 00:10:40.852\nSo yeah Cherokee, with that in mind,\nwhen we talk about distance and\n\n217\n00:10:40.852 --> 00:10:42.356\nwe talk about hop count, all right.\n\n218\n00:10:42.356 --> 00:10:47.787\nI want you to understand that the,\nthey say the technique of passing\n\n219\n00:10:47.787 --> 00:10:52.947\ntraffic from one router to the next,\nthat's considered a hop.\n\n220\n00:10:52.947 --> 00:10:56.940\nIt's considered the next hop, and\nthat's really what this router is doing.\n\n221\n00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.964\nIf this is RTE-1, per se,\nI'll tell you what,\n\n222\n00:10:59.964 --> 00:11:02.421\nlet's put a number on this router here.\n\n223\n00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:06.603\nLet's say RTE-1 needs to\ncommunicate using RIPv2, so\n\n224\n00:11:06.603 --> 00:11:11.652\nwe'll just do RTR-1, make it easy and\ngeneric, right, RTE-1.\n\n225\n00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:17.212\nAll right, so if RTE-1 needs to send,\nlet's say, some traffic to,\n\n226\n00:11:17.212 --> 00:11:23.161\nand we'll just call this for the heck\nit RTE-2, cause I am that creative.\n\n227\n00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:24.576\nSalvador Dali eat your heart out.\n\n228\n00:11:24.576 --> 00:11:30.073\nAll right, so\nRTE-1 needs to send information to RTE-2.\n\n229\n00:11:30.073 --> 00:11:30.882\nSo what is it gonna use?\n\n230\n00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:32.774\nWe said the hop count, the distance.\n\n231\n00:11:32.774 --> 00:11:34.111\nThat's why it's called a distance vector.\n\n232\n00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.368\nThe vector is the destination.\n\n233\n00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:38.985\nThe distance is how long it takes\nto get to that endpoint, alright,\n\n234\n00:11:38.985 --> 00:11:40.259\nthat end destination.\n\n235\n00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:43.560\nWell notice, I've got many different\npaths I could take, right?\n\n236\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.193\nI could go from RTE-1,\nalright, and you know what,\n\n237\n00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:48.439\nthis is getting a little\nhard to keep track of.\n\n238\n00:11:48.439 --> 00:11:51.957\nI should have done a better\njob on this diagram guys, so\n\n239\n00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:56.403\nwe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll make this, I don't know, RTE-4.\n\n240\n00:11:56.403 --> 00:12:01.850\nWe'll do everything completely backwards\nand then we'll make this RTR 3, all right.\n\n241\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.890\nNow, we've got a little bit\nbetter of a diagram, right.\n\n242\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.050\nSo if RTR 1 wants to talk to RTR 2,\nit's gotta few different choices, right.\n\n243\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.403\nIt could got to RTR 4 and\nthen the RTR 2, right.\n\n244\n00:12:11.403 --> 00:12:15.012\nIt could got to RTR 4 and\nthen to RTR 3 then the RTR 2.\n\n245\n00:12:15.012 --> 00:12:17.369\nBut notice, it also has hop counts and\n\n246\n00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:20.398\ntheses are arbitrary numbers by the way,\nguys.\n\n247\n00:12:20.398 --> 00:12:23.000\nJust more for the theory purposes.\n\n248\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.268\nRight?\nBut if I look, if I wish to go, let's say,\n\n249\n00:12:27.268 --> 00:12:30.680\nfrom RTE-1 to RTE-4, right?\n\n250\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.850\nAnd we go from RTE-4 to RTE-3.\n\n251\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.770\nAnd then from RTE-3, I know,\nwait for it, to RTE-2.\n\n252\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.569\nLet's do some calculations here,\nkinda like RIPv2 would.\n\n253\n00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:45.246\nAnd let's find out if that's actually the\nshortest path as far as hops go because\n\n254\n00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:46.820\nthat's our cost, right.\n\n255\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.218\nWhat costs us the least\namount of gas money?\n\n256\n00:12:49.218 --> 00:12:52.012\nAll right, well we've got six hops,\nwe've got two hops, and\n\n257\n00:12:52.012 --> 00:12:53.710\nwe've got another six hops, right.\n\n258\n00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.053\nSo that's what, 14?\n\n259\n00:12:55.053 --> 00:12:56.898\n14 hops to get to RTE-2.\n\n260\n00:12:56.898 --> 00:13:00.565\nSo there's no way that using RIPv2\nthat that's going to be considered\n\n261\n00:13:00.565 --> 00:13:01.358\nthe best path,\n\n262\n00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:05.700\ndynamically when we're trying to figure\nout which route we're going to take.\n\n263\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.861\nSo ultimately, guys,\n\n264\n00:13:06.861 --> 00:13:10.701\nyou can see that what it's going to do\nis it's going to take this path, right?\n\n265\n00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:13.610\nFrom RTE-1 to RTE-2 because that's 2 hops.\n\n266\n00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.636\nSo that's a little bit about RIPv2 is.\n\n267\n00:13:16.636 --> 00:13:19.835\nNow there's some other characteristics\nthat I want you to know about RIPv2,\n\n268\n00:13:19.835 --> 00:13:21.587\nI kind of want to compare\nit back to RIPv1.\n\n269\n00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:25.570\nSo you guys can even see why\nare we even using RIPv2 today, and\n\n270\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.261\nnot using the order they just called RIP.\n\n271\n00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:31.905\nYou might see it called RIP version one,\nbut it's sometimes just called RIP.\n\n272\n00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:34.795\nAll right, well the characteristics,\n\n273\n00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:38.395\nRIPv2 supports what's known as\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n274\n00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:39.645\nIt's a classless system.\n\n275\n00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:42.177\nAll right and we'll talk about\nthe classes in other episodes.\n\n276\n00:13:42.177 --> 00:13:44.794\nBut keep in mind in the earlier\ndays of the Internet,\n\n277\n00:13:44.794 --> 00:13:48.318\nwe had this class full system that\nimplemented a lot of waste, right.\n\n278\n00:13:48.318 --> 00:13:52.845\nWell today to kind of prolong the use\nof some of these older technologies,\n\n279\n00:13:52.845 --> 00:13:56.140\nthey implemented what is\nknown as classless system.\n\n280\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.140\nThat kind of broke down the walls.\n\n281\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.788\nWell RIP, when it was invented,\nit was a classfull system, right?\n\n282\n00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:06.053\nIt used three default sub-net masks,\nright?\n\n283\n00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.180\nIt used a series of ranges and\nyou couldn't break the boundaries.\n\n284\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.567\nYou had to be classfull.\n\n285\n00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:13.739\nRIPv2 supports classless.\n\n286\n00:14:13.739 --> 00:14:15.770\nIt's not a clas full system.\n\n287\n00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:17.310\nDoesn't have that limitation.\n\n288\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.669\nThe other thing too is RIP,\nwe use broadcast communications.\n\n289\n00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:24.818\nSee RIP, one of the things that it's\ndoing, while you're talking about RIP or\n\n290\n00:14:24.818 --> 00:14:26.090\nyou're talking about RIPv2.\n\n291\n00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.096\nIs in order to update these routers for\ninstance, we go back to my diagram here.\n\n292\n00:14:30.096 --> 00:14:32.754\nIf I wanna go ahead and I want to inform,\n\n293\n00:14:32.754 --> 00:14:36.310\nlet's say RTE-4 to RTE-3\nof the routing table.\n\n294\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.011\nSee, this is how we're\ndiscovering those routes.\n\n295\n00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:45.621\nRTE-4 is sending RTE-1, and RTE-3,\na copy of its routing table, periodically.\n\n296\n00:14:45.621 --> 00:14:48.710\nThe whole routing table,\njust sending it to him.\n\n297\n00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.966\nWell, with rip it used to do that\nover broadcast communications.\n\n298\n00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:53.836\nAnd broadcast communications,\n\n299\n00:14:53.836 --> 00:14:57.382\na communication from one person\nto everybody on that network.\n\n300\n00:14:57.382 --> 00:14:59.210\nSo there was a lot of waste.\n\n301\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.563\nWell when RIPv2 comes out,\nit uses that 224.0.0.9 address and\n\n302\n00:15:03.563 --> 00:15:05.610\nthat's your multicast address.\n\n303\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.873\nWhich means, the only one that that\ncommunications gonna go to is other people\n\n304\n00:15:09.873 --> 00:15:11.757\nthat are in that multicast group.\n\n305\n00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:13.919\nSo it's slightly more efficient, right?\n\n306\n00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:18.439\nBut we're still broadcasting the routing\ntable periodically to our nearest\n\n307\n00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:19.699\nneighbors, right.\n\n308\n00:15:19.699 --> 00:15:22.256\nAnd that's how we learn of the routes.\n\n309\n00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:27.015\nAnother thing that we gotta keep in\nmind is that there really wasn't any\n\n310\n00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:29.088\nauthentication for your RIP.\n\n311\n00:15:29.088 --> 00:15:31.731\nNow, RIPv2 isn't completely secure,\n\n312\n00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:35.968\nbecause it's using pretty much\na weak algorithm in and of itself.\n\n313\n00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:38.147\nBut it at least uses something.\n\n314\n00:15:38.147 --> 00:15:41.237\nFor authentication, you use MD5.\n\n315\n00:15:41.237 --> 00:15:45.568\nNow, if you guys are into security and\nyou understand security, you're gonna say,\n\n316\n00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:47.989\nwell, MD5, that isn't really much better.\n\n317\n00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.582\nWell, at least it's better than nothing.\n\n318\n00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:53.432\nHowever, we know that if you are using\nsomething like a hashing algorithm,\n\n319\n00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:55.487\nyou should be using SHA-256 today.\n\n320\n00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:59.020\nWe'll get into that,\ninto some of the security sections here.\n\n321\n00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.250\nWhat else there?\n\n322\n00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.730\nVariable link subnet masks\nthat's the other one.\n\n323\n00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.013\nWhat we're you going to say?\n\n324\n00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:08.248\n&gt;&gt; Did we quick version two did they\nremove that 15 hop count limit on that\n\n325\n00:16:08.248 --> 00:16:09.670\nparticular protocol?\n\n326\n00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.589\nBecause that was a drawback for\nlarger networks.\n\n327\n00:16:12.589 --> 00:16:14.540\n&gt;&gt; They did not, they did not.\n\n328\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.212\nI will tell you that link state does.\n\n329\n00:16:16.212 --> 00:16:20.210\nLink state has unlimited hop counts so\nit's not limited to that.\n\n330\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.940\nThe 15 hop count,\nwhat Cherokee's referring to.\n\n331\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.900\nI think it's, is it 16 hops,\ndoes destination on reach at all?\n\n332\n00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.203\n&gt;&gt; 16 to infinity, yeah.\n\n333\n00:16:27.203 --> 00:16:30.256\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\nif I wanna tell another router,\n\n334\n00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:34.090\nlike I said, if we go back to our\nthe diagram right here, right.\n\n335\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.030\nAnd I wanna let RTE-1 know that\na certain route that was in my table you\n\n336\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.934\ncan't reach anything.\n\n337\n00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:43.090\nI can't reach anymore, I believe I\nbroadcast it as a hop count of 16.\n\n338\n00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.219\nWhich means destination not reachable,\nit has a maximum of 15 hops.\n\n339\n00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:51.730\nBoth RIP, and RIPv2,\nthey both support that 15 hop maximum.\n\n340\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.451\nHowever, when we get into the,\nlike for instance, link state no SPF,\n\n341\n00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:57.322\nyou're gonna see OSPF is awesome.\n\n342\n00:16:57.322 --> 00:17:02.635\nIt says, you know what, we don't have\nthose limitations, the sky is the limit.\n\n343\n00:17:02.635 --> 00:17:08.189\n[LAUGH] So If I want to communicate,\nokay, so where are we at here.\n\n344\n00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:12.580\nI wanna make sure that I keep it,\nvariabling subnet masks, right?\n\n345\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.040\nA classful system,\nyou have three subnets, right?\n\n346\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.634\nYou have a Class A, you have a Class B,\nand you have a Class C.\n\n347\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.894\nHowever, we went to a variable\nlength subnet mask so\n\n348\n00:17:22.894 --> 00:17:29.388\nwe could stall the depletion of our IPv4\naddresses and RIP didn't have built-in.\n\n349\n00:17:29.388 --> 00:17:35.790\nHowever, your RIPv2 does support\nvariable link subnet masking.\n\n350\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.876\nSo that is something that we do want-\n&gt;&gt; And IPv6,\n\n351\n00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:41.790\nI think that RIPv2 does support IPv6,\nwhere as the first one didn't either.\n\n352\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.230\nSo that was another huge\nlimitation of this protocol.\n\n353\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.720\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting, so you're breaking\nthe bonds of our limitations, every day.\n\n354\n00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.299\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n355\n00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:49.711\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n356\n00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:52.585\nSo where does this become a problem?\n\n357\n00:17:52.585 --> 00:17:55.152\nOr can it potentially become a problem?\n\n358\n00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:59.890\nWell, notice that's six hops, okay, so\nwe talked about the hop count, alright?\n\n359\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:05.190\nHow about this, how about if I say that,\nlet's see, so what would that be?\n\n360\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.747\nThat would be, let's give one where\nit is over, maybe a SONIT line.\n\n361\n00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:18.736\nAll right, and maybe we have\nan extremely dedicated ATM line.\n\n362\n00:18:20.057 --> 00:18:24.657\nAll right, and let's see here,\nthat's one, two, three, and\n\n363\n00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:26.758\nmaybe there's two hop here.\n\n364\n00:18:29.921 --> 00:18:32.790\nLet me, I'm kind of getting\nlost here as where I'm at,\n\n365\n00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.230\nall these little things popping up here.\n\n366\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.270\nI'm going to put this one,\nwe're going to go to one to four to three.\n\n367\n00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.929\nAll right, one, four, three.\n\n368\n00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:46.584\nThat means, quit things from\npopping up here all over the place.\n\n369\n00:18:49.088 --> 00:18:49.930\nGet it eventually here.\n\n370\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.419\n&gt;&gt; So, we're gonna be sending a message.\n\n371\n00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:55.599\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, essentially what we're gonna be\ndoing is we're gonna be sending a message\n\n372\n00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:56.940\nfrom RTE-1 to RTE-3.\n\n373\n00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.951\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n374\n00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:01.270\nnow, with RIP, remember it's\nonly looking at the hop count.\n\n375\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.820\nAll right, that's all it looking at.\n\n376\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.787\nBut if this is a SONIT and\nthis is an ATM line,\n\n377\n00:19:05.787 --> 00:19:09.327\nthese have the ability to be very,\nvery fast lines.\n\n378\n00:19:09.327 --> 00:19:14.914\nHowever, this one down here is a 56K\nline that goes down quite often.\n\n379\n00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:17.900\nNot a very reliable link unfortunately.\n\n380\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.641\nAlright, so that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat even though it's only a two hop\n\n381\n00:19:22.641 --> 00:19:27.116\ncount, that it's gonna be a better\npath to the final destination, right.\n\n382\n00:19:27.116 --> 00:19:28.557\nI mean that's what routing's about,\n\n383\n00:19:28.557 --> 00:19:30.880\nis getting that information\nto the destination.\n\n384\n00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.249\nRight, you could see that something maybe\nthese two which they're identical, right.\n\n385\n00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:40.620\nWe've got six hops, we've got six hops,\nwe got six hops, and we got six hops.\n\n386\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.872\nWell, even if I had changed them\na little bit just to make it.\n\n387\n00:19:43.872 --> 00:19:49.537\nYou'll never have a routing entry and\nthe routing table that identical\n\n388\n00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:54.741\nmetrics to the same destination\nthere unless you set it that way.\n\n389\n00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:59.760\nBut let say for instance this is,\nwe want to bump this up just a little bit.\n\n390\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.020\nSo, that six and\ntwo we'll just make this three, all right.\n\n391\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.722\nSo, we've got eight here, right?\n\n392\n00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:07.790\nTo get from RTE-1 to RTE-3.\n\n393\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:12.530\nWe've got 9here, 9 hops to get\nfrom RTE-1 to RTE-3 this way.\n\n394\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.547\nHowever, part of this link is a 56 K-line\nand it's very, let's say, unstable.\n\n395\n00:20:17.547 --> 00:20:18.178\n&gt;&gt; It's not reliable.\n\n396\n00:20:18.178 --> 00:20:19.875\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very unreliable.\n\n397\n00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:23.984\nSo is there a chance that if I use RTE-1,\nRTE-4, to RTE-3,\n\n398\n00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:28.486\nthat it can be more efficient than\nusing RTE-1 to RTE-2 to RTE-3?\n\n399\n00:20:28.486 --> 00:20:29.597\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n400\n00:20:29.597 --> 00:20:31.140\n&gt;&gt; And the chances that are, yes.\n\n401\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.160\nBut the problem is with RIPv2,\n\n402\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.150\nwe'll never know,\nbecause it's not even gonna look at that.\n\n403\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.795\nAnd that's where the next\ntype of protocol comes in.\n\n404\n00:20:40.795 --> 00:20:43.938\nAnd that's what's known\nas a link-state protocol.\n\n405\n00:20:43.938 --> 00:20:47.927\nNow a link-state protocol, if you\nwant to understand conceptually, and\n\n406\n00:20:47.927 --> 00:20:49.900\nyou want to remember it for the exam.\n\n407\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.768\nI want you to flip the word around, okay?\n\n408\n00:20:52.768 --> 00:20:57.002\nInstead of saying link-state, I want you\nto think of it as state of the link.\n\n409\n00:20:57.002 --> 00:20:57.946\nAll right, and\n\n410\n00:20:57.946 --> 00:21:03.530\nyou can kinda understand what it's using\nto determine which path I'm gonna take.\n\n411\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.858\nAll right?\nSo now notice we have our 56k line and\n\n412\n00:21:06.858 --> 00:21:08.893\nour 100 megabit line.\n\n413\n00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:13.837\nHowever here we got 100 megabit and\nwe got a 10G network.\n\n414\n00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:18.737\nAll right, well if we were just to\ntheoretically say that these were the same\n\n415\n00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:22.196\ndistance in hop count,\nwhich one are we going to use?\n\n416\n00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:24.247\nWell, either or, right?\n\n417\n00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:27.894\nThis time we factor in\nother characteristics.\n\n418\n00:21:27.894 --> 00:21:30.470\nWe factor in things like the speed.\n\n419\n00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.718\nWe factor in things like the quality\nof the link, it is up, is it down,\n\n420\n00:21:34.718 --> 00:21:35.732\nis it reliable?\n\n421\n00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:38.218\nThat's one of the good things about OSPF.\n\n422\n00:21:38.218 --> 00:21:42.469\nNow OSPF does some very interesting\nthings in the fact that it has a band\n\n423\n00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:45.870\nwidth calculation metric,\nand it does have a default.\n\n424\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:51.106\nLike there's a difference bandwidth\nmetric for like 10, a 10 meg network\n\n425\n00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:55.884\nover a 100 meg network versus like\na gig and a 10G network, right?\n\n426\n00:21:55.884 --> 00:21:57.682\nDifferent bandwidths, or\n\n427\n00:21:57.682 --> 00:22:02.695\nobviously a higher bandwidth is gonna\nbe a better, or a faster connection.\n\n428\n00:22:02.695 --> 00:22:05.180\nSo it will calculate things like that.\n\n429\n00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.390\nIt detects things like latency, right?\n\n430\n00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.650\nState of the link routing, right?\n\n431\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:14.331\nInstead of thinking link-state routing,\nthink of state of the link routing.\n\n432\n00:22:14.331 --> 00:22:19.975\nIt uses the Dijkstra algorithm\nto perform what's known as SPF,\n\n433\n00:22:19.975 --> 00:22:22.800\nor SPF, Shortest Path First.\n\n434\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.130\nIf I can remember that right there,\nthat's the technology.\n\n435\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.650\nThey do call that out on the exam.\n\n436\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.272\nNotice that the, know that the technology\nthat it's using is the Dijkstra Algorithm\n\n437\n00:22:31.272 --> 00:22:34.046\nto performs what's known\nas Shortest Path First.\n\n438\n00:22:34.046 --> 00:22:36.229\n&gt;&gt; Not actually performing the algorithm,\n\n439\n00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:38.880\njust knowing that it's\na type of linked-state.\n\n440\n00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:39.389\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n441\n00:22:39.389 --> 00:22:40.527\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n442\n00:22:40.527 --> 00:22:42.754\n&gt;&gt; It also has things like\nlink failure detection.\n\n443\n00:22:42.754 --> 00:22:45.760\nRemember like we we're talking about\nis that link is an up or down.\n\n444\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.365\n&gt;&gt; Pliable.\n\n445\n00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:47.015\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n446\n00:22:47.015 --> 00:22:50.307\nNow it's a little bit different,when\nwe talk about the communication between\n\n447\n00:22:50.307 --> 00:22:50.902\nthe routers.\n\n448\n00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:54.032\nThese routers when they\nneed to learn the routes,\n\n449\n00:22:54.032 --> 00:22:58.740\nOSPF actually does worse in performance\nthan RIP when it first starts out.\n\n450\n00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.896\nAnd that's because if you look at\nthese routers, I wanna go ahead and\n\n451\n00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:03.470\nI wanna compare the two.\n\n452\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.920\nIf I talk about something like RIP, right?\n\n453\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.344\nRouter, well, we'll take RTE-1 here.\n\n454\n00:23:09.344 --> 00:23:14.386\nRTE-1 communicates its entire\nrouting table with RTE-4.\n\n455\n00:23:14.386 --> 00:23:17.500\nAnd it does the same thing with RTE-2.\n\n456\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.293\nIt does not communicate with RTE-3\nunless it is a neighboring router.\n\n457\n00:23:22.293 --> 00:23:28.086\nSo it only talks to its routers and\nit's constantly broadcasting or\n\n458\n00:23:28.086 --> 00:23:32.976\nmulti-casting if you will,\nit's full routing table.\n\n459\n00:23:32.976 --> 00:23:36.220\nOSPF, on the other hand,\ndoes a little bit different.\n\n460\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.385\nIt floods the entire network.\n\n461\n00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:41.652\nEvery router, RTE-1,\nRTE-2, RTE-3 and RTE-4,\n\n462\n00:23:41.652 --> 00:23:44.934\nthey get the routing information,\nthe routing topology.\n\n463\n00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:47.679\nAll right.\n\n464\n00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:51.761\nYou can see the performance degrade\non the network because there's\n\n465\n00:23:51.761 --> 00:23:54.420\na lot of extra information\nout there right.\n\n466\n00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.730\nWe're communicating with everybody.\n\n467\n00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.860\nSo we learn the topology of the network.\n\n468\n00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.750\nBut then here's where link state starts in\nthis case OSPF starts to out shine RIP,\n\n469\n00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.730\nvery quickly, a RIP version two.\n\n470\n00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.648\nIs because then after that, once we have\nwhat's known as a converged network.\n\n471\n00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:14.235\nOr converged network just means,\nwe all have the appropriate up to date\n\n472\n00:24:14.235 --> 00:24:17.325\nrouting topology in\nthe entirety of the network.\n\n473\n00:24:17.325 --> 00:24:17.825\nAll right.\n\n474\n00:24:19.685 --> 00:24:23.980\nOne of the things that makes a benefit\nis if there is a routing change\n\n475\n00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.090\nunlike RIP who just keeps broadcasting\nwhether anything changes or not and\n\n476\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.130\nit's the entirety of the routing table.\n\n477\n00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.940\nOSPF, open shortest path first says,\nnow that everybody's aware of everything\n\n478\n00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.180\nthe next time something changes let\nme do an incremental communication.\n\n479\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.340\nI'll just let you guys know out there,\neverybody else in the network,\n\n480\n00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.450\nknow that that one route has changed.\n\n481\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.770\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, we're just putting that one\nbit of information to the routing table,\n\n482\n00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:52.870\ninstead of all the other information\nmaking those convergence times faster.\n\n483\n00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.780\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n484\n00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.548\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly it.\n\n485\n00:24:54.548 --> 00:24:56.170\nIt makes the convergence.\n\n486\n00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:01.780\nAgain, convergence is just the time that\ntakes from a routing change to happen for\n\n487\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.350\nevery other router on the network\nto be aware of that change.\n\n488\n00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.940\nAll right, if I talk about convergence.\n\n489\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.840\nTo give you a comparison there Cherokee,\nto give a comparison, let's\n\n490\n00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.310\nsay if I have somewhere out here I've got\nI don't know, a routing topology change.\n\n491\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.590\nAll right.\n\n492\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.030\nAnd I'm not exactly sure.\n\n493\n00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.920\nThere's a link out to a network here,\nand it's failed.\n\n494\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.770\nAll right.\n\n495\n00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.980\nWell, what has to happen is three has\nto make two aware, three has to make\n\n496\n00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.890\nfour aware, and then three has to wait for\neither two to talk to one,\n\n497\n00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.530\nor four to talk to one, in order\nto know that that route's changed.\n\n498\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:41.770\nSo it had to propagate its way,\nthe entirety of the routing table.\n\n499\n00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.510\nAnd then each router has to inspect it,\n\n500\n00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:47.700\nlook at the routes that have changed and\ndoesn't care about what hasn't changed.\n\n501\n00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.275\nAnd then pick that route up,\nupdate its routing table,\n\n502\n00:25:50.275 --> 00:25:52.530\ntake the entire field of\nthat routing table and\n\n503\n00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.130\nbroadcast the remote to cast\ninto the next router, right?\n\n504\n00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.900\nSo, we're neighbor by neighbor by\nneighbor with OSPF on the other hand.\n\n505\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.190\nOSPF allows us the ability that when I\nlink, let's say the same thing happens.\n\n506\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:05.970\nAll right.\n\n507\n00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.850\nAnd we'll just create\na little fake link here.\n\n508\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.020\nAll right.\n\n509\n00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.720\nAnd when that link fails well,\nyou know what?\n\n510\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.830\nOSPF says, let's go ahead and\n\n511\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.580\nlet's talk to every router on\nthe entirety of the network.\n\n512\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.480\nAnd instead of telling them\nthe entire routing table,\n\n513\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.500\nwhich they don't need to know,\nI'll just tell you that one link.\n\n514\n00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.970\nSo the convergence, Cherokee was\nmentioning happens a lot quicker.\n\n515\n00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.730\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat's beneficial about OSPF.\n\n516\n00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.960\nNot only the ability to make\ndecisions not just based on distance,\n\n517\n00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.210\nbut a lot of other characteristics and\nquality of the link.\n\n518\n00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.080\nI do wanna mention one other one there.\n\n519\n00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.960\nLet say, I don't believe\nit's used quite as much, and\n\n520\n00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.680\nthat's intermediate system\nto intermediate system, IS.\n\n521\n00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.410\nIt's another link state routing protocol\nas well know it for the exam however,\n\n522\n00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.170\nOSPF is gonna be one\nthat's more important.\n\n523\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.506\nNow Cherokee, that's really just\n[LAUGH] kinda scratching the surface,\n\n524\n00:27:02.506 --> 00:27:03.456\nI'm looking on a list I know.\n\n525\n00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:05.543\n&gt;&gt; We've got a lot more to go but\njudging by the time,\n\n526\n00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:07.304\nI think we might have to say that, right.\n\n527\n00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:09.327\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\nWe'll go ahead and save it for\n\n528\n00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:13.236\nhe next episode because in this show\nwe were able to look at the differences\n\n529\n00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:15.900\nbetween you showed us static and\ndynamic routes.\n\n530\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.330\nAnd then we also looked at the differences\nbetween writing protocols and\n\n531\n00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.580\nlearned the difference\nbetween a distance vector\n\n532\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.890\nversus a link state routing protocol,\nso thank you for that.\n\n533\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.870\nBut stay tuned, there's a lot more\nassociated with routing in these\n\n534\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.750\nprotocols that you need to take a look at.\n\n535\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.110\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up for this show.\n\n536\n00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.200\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n537\n00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n538\n00:27:36.140

ITPRO.TV\n\n3\n00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.415\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:15.530\nWelcome to your CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.597\nThis show is actually a continuation where\nwe were looking at routing protocols and\n\n7\n00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:24.789\nrouting concepts and protocol basics.\n\n8\n00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.611\nWe were able to get through some but\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n9\n00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.440\npick up right where we left off.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.720\nAnd with us today, in studio is\nMister Wes Bryan, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.630\njoining us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.440\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, Cherokee,\nthank you for having me here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.960\nThat's right, we're gonna go back into\nsome of the basics in a part two,\n\n14\n00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.730\nlike Cherokee said.\n\n15\n00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.290\nWe're really looking at some of these\nrouting concepts we want you to know and\n\n16\n00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.850\nbe prepared for the Net Plus Exam.\n\n17\n00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.790\nHowever, keep in mind that as you go\non to more advanced certifications, as\n\n18\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.991\nyou go into the Cisco world, you can get\na lot more in depth about these concepts.\n\n19\n00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:56.530\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nlet's dive right in.\n\n20\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.450\nOne of the first things that we've\ngotta kind of talk about is something\n\n21\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.640\nknown as the loop back interface.\n\n22\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.440\nWe didn't really talk about that in the\nfirst part, so we're gonna start there.\n\n23\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.740\nWith the loop back interface,\nwe actually have in IPv4 and\n\n24\n00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.670\nIPv6, we've got a couple of networks\nthat are actually reserved by IANA,\n\n25\n00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.460\nand they're reserved for testing software.\n\n26\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.590\nOne of the things that we can\ndo is use our ping utility.\n\n27\n00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.610\nThe packet internet groper\nI think is what that,\n\n28\n00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.630\nI don't know why the hell they\ncome up with these names.\n\n29\n00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.270\nBut ping utility, we can use in order to\ntest whether the software in our system,\n\n30\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.300\nunderstands the TCP/IP protocol stack, and\nmore importantly, that we can communicate.\n\n31\n00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.140\nSo, in fact,\nlet me show you on my computer here.\n\n32\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.000\nWe can go ahead and pull up on terminal,\nI'm on a Mac here too, so\n\n33\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.530\nit's just BSD under the hood.\n\n34\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.737\nAnd if I decide that I wanna test\nwhether my operating system understand\n\n35\n00:01:51.737 --> 00:01:56.248\nthe protocol stack,\nwell then we use the loop back address and\n\n36\n00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:59.133\nusually we ping 127.0.0.1.\n\n37\n00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.521\nNow, I got to tell you, if I turn around,\nI can ping other numbers here,\n\n38\n00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.980\nbecause really the whole network is\nreserved for a loopback processing.\n\n39\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.244\nBut traditionally, we use the very\nfirst address within that network and\n\n40\n00:02:09.244 --> 00:02:10.673\nit starts with the one, right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:14.874\nRemember, as we go into showing\nyou how networks are structured,\n\n42\n00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:18.936\nthe very first address in any\nnetwork is usually the network ID.\n\n43\n00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:23.681\nSo, we can't use 127.0.0.0 right,\nthat's the network ID so\n\n44\n00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:26.440\nthe very first addressable.\n\n45\n00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.289\nAddress, if you will,\nwithin that range will be 127.0.0.1.\n\n46\n00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.456\nSo, if I run this, one of the things that\nyou're gonna notice here is that I'm\n\n47\n00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:38.640\nsending out a little bit of information,\nand I'm getting some replies back.\n\n48\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.150\nThat's what we typically see in ping.\n\n49\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.550\nAnd, we'll talk about this utility\ncoming up in a later episode.\n\n50\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810\nBut, what's interesting here is this ping\nutility when I'm pinging the loop back\n\n51\n00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.810\naddress, it isn't sending any electrical\ncommunications out my network adapter on\n\n52\n00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.420\nto the network, and then out to somebody\nthat has an IP Address of 127.0.0.1.\n\n53\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.904\nSee, the reason they call it the loop\nback address is because as we'll\n\n54\n00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:05.014\ntalk about in other episodes we\nhave that seven layer OSI model.\n\n55\n00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:09.277\nAnd what's happening here is it is working\nits way down to the network layer, and\n\n56\n00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:12.550\nit's looping itself right back\nup to the application layer.\n\n57\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.800\nSo, it doesn't make it\ndown to the link layer,\n\n58\n00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.570\nwhereas that's typically where the link\nand the physical layer where we\n\n59\n00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.130\nstart to see those electrical\nimpulses placed on the media.\n\n60\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.260\nSo, that's why they call\nit the loop back address,\n\n61\n00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.780\nbecause if I wanna just test my operating\nsystem can't my operating system\n\n62\n00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.460\nspeak the protocols that we need in\norder to communicate on the network,\n\n63\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.280\nthe very first thing I can do\nis test the loop back interface.\n\n64\n00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.930\nSo, again loop back interface is great for\ntesting your software.\n\n65\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.383\nLet me see if I can show you this guys.\n\n66\n00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.410\nAnd what it's interesting here,\n\n67\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.290\nit does kind of yeah I guess in BSD, it\ndoesn't allow you to ping anything else.\n\n68\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.053\nIn Windows though it will let you ping\njust about any address within that range.\n\n69\n00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:56.617\n&gt;&gt; And it's kinda nice because you can\nreally isolate network problems by trying\n\n70\n00:03:56.617 --> 00:04:00.181\nto make sure there's something wrong\nwith your local machine before you start\n\n71\n00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:03.450\nchecking out other pieces of\nequipment further down that route.\n\n72\n00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.330\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\n\n73\n00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.610\nin fact when I wanna test, if I don't have\ncommunications, let's say on this machine,\n\n74\n00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.830\nthe first thing I do is test the software.\n\n75\n00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.430\nI need to know does the operating system,\n\n76\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.560\ndoes it know how to speak the language\nof the network, before I go any further.\n\n77\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.880\nSo absolutely, and you'll see that as\nwe get into some of our troubleshooting\n\n78\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.560\nsections where we're gonna use ping,\nand we'll show you,\n\n79\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.680\njust like Cherokee mentioned how you\nping as local as you can get, and\n\n80\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.440\nthen you start working your\nway out to your network.\n\n81\n00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440\nEdge of your network, to figure out\nwhere's the communication breakdown.\n\n82\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.492\nNow, speaking of communication breakdown\n[LAUGH] that actually takes us right\n\n83\n00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:33.564\ninto our next topic there.\n\n84\n00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:36.250\nAnd that's something\nknown as routing loops.\n\n85\n00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.150\nNow, when they talk about\nrouting loops here,\n\n86\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.900\nwe're actually talking\nabout a layer-three loop.\n\n87\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.179\nAnd what I mean by that is, remember,\n\n88\n00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:47.190\nwe talked about routers operating\nat the OSI layer three, right.\n\n89\n00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.370\nThat's where routing happens that's\nwhere our IP address happened.\n\n90\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.110\nI do wanna just briefly mention that\nrouting loops don't just happen\n\n91\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.680\nat the layer three and in routers.\n\n92\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.360\nYou also have switching loops too,\nand then switching loops are where we\n\n93\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.470\nimplement things like the spanning\ntree algorithm in order to break them.\n\n94\n00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.310\nBut, essentially what a loop is, is when\nyou have incorrect information in one,\n\n95\n00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.278\ntwo, or more of your routers.\n\n96\n00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:16.350\nAnd they kinda get, they can't really\nagree on where to send the information.\n\n97\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.910\nSo, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n98\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.110\nIf we talk very basically that\nthis machine right here, for\n\n99\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.900\ninstance router one, right.\n\n100\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.040\nNotice that it is connected\nto router three, okay.\n\n101\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.390\nSo, router three is gonna be our\nbag guy here in a second, but\n\n102\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.760\nlet's see what the routing\ntable looks like.\n\n103\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.600\nNow, router one knows that it has\na direct link to router three.\n\n104\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.670\nSo, if it needs to get information into a\nnetwork that router three is attached to,\n\n105\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.510\nyou could send that information\nright to router three.\n\n106\n00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.370\nBut it also knows, through talking\nto router two, router two said,\n\n107\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.900\nhey router one, guess what?\n\n108\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.890\nI know where router three is, and\n\n109\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.520\nif you ever need to get to router three,\njust send that information to me.\n\n110\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.900\nNow, I wanna show you something here too.\n\n111\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.070\nRouter two, and\n\n112\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.490\nremember, keep in mind what router three's\ngonna be our bad guy here in a second.\n\n113\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.665\nNotice that router two also says,\n\n114\n00:06:03.665 --> 00:06:06.385\nI got a direct connection down\nhere to router three as well.\n\n115\n00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:10.794\nAnd I've also talked over to RTR-1,\nand RTR-1 let me know, hey,\n\n116\n00:06:10.794 --> 00:06:16.080\nif need RTR-2 needs to get to RTR-3,\njust send that information my way.\n\n117\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.150\nAlright, so here we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna make RTR-3 our bad guy here.\n\n118\n00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.126\nSo, when we do this what's going to happen\nis we're just going to simulate a failure,\n\n119\n00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:27.010\nalright, it goes offline.\n\n120\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.553\nNow, I want you to think about\nthe routing table, all right.\n\n121\n00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:33.199\nThese guys know Let's say for\ninstance RTR-1 here it\n\n122\n00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.121\nknows that hey I just tried to send\ninformation to RTR-3, and I can't.\n\n123\n00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.920\nI can't send information, RTR-3's offline.\n\n124\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.170\nSo, what does it do?\n\n125\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.925\nIt says let me go ahead and\ncheck my routing table here.\n\n126\n00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:46.785\nAnd I know I've got this entry.\n\n127\n00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:49.745\nSince this direct route doesn't work,\n\n128\n00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:52.885\nI know I got a route that\nI can send this router to.\n\n129\n00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:54.415\n&gt;&gt; An alternative.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n130\n00:06:54.415 --> 00:06:57.045\nI've got an alternative option here.\n\n131\n00:06:57.045 --> 00:06:59.360\nSo, we send that traffic to RTR-2,\nall right.\n\n132\n00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.970\nWell RTR-2 says, let me go ahead.\n\n133\n00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.460\nI know that I can send\nthis directly to RTR-3.\n\n134\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.570\nBut, RTR-3 is offline.\n\n135\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.062\nSo, now what are gonna do?\n\n136\n00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:13.830\nWell, RTR-2 is gonna look at its routing\ntable and say, okay I know what to here.\n\n137\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.648\nI got an entry in my routing table\nthat say, hey if you need to send.\n\n138\n00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:21.440\nIt to RTR-3, and I can't get there\ndirectly, I'll just send it to RTR-1.\n\n139\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.200\nSo, what happens?\n\n140\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.693\nIt sends it back to RTR-1.\n\n141\n00:07:24.693 --> 00:07:27.050\nAnd then RTR-1 says, okay,\n\n142\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.400\nwell, I know I have a direct link that's\nfails, let me check my routing table.\n\n143\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.808\nOkay I see, I send it to RTR-2 and now you\ncan start to see what's happening here.\n\n144\n00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:42.070\nNotice that RTR-2 is receiving the packet\nand the process just keeps going and\n\n145\n00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.910\ngoing and eventually the packet times out.\n\n146\n00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.180\nThe time to live expires and it discards.\n\n147\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.399\nSo, keep in mind that a routing loop,\nthere's a couple of different technologies\n\n148\n00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:54.827\nthat we use to implement,\nor not to implement.\n\n149\n00:07:54.827 --> 00:07:56.197\nYou never want to\nimplement a routing loop.\n\n150\n00:07:56.197 --> 00:07:58.303\nYou need to check your routing\ninfrastructure if that's what you're\n\n151\n00:07:58.303 --> 00:07:58.915\ngonna set out to do.\n\n152\n00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:00.160\nBut, if you want to.\n\n153\n00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.561\nStop routing loops.\n\n154\n00:08:01.561 --> 00:08:03.950\nThere's a couple of different\ntechnologies you can do.\n\n155\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.410\nAnd these will,\nthe goal is to stop this in its tracks.\n\n156\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.280\nOne is called Split Horizons.\n\n157\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.040\nThe other one is called Poison Reverse.\n\n158\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.400\nSo for instance, if I send that\ninformation to router two, and\n\n159\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.880\nrouter two knows, hey, I can't get to\nrouter three, it's gonna tell router one,\n\n160\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.610\ndon't send me anymore information,\ncuz I can't get to router three.\n\n161\n00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.740\nAnd that essentially is going to\neliminate some of these bogus or\n\n162\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.520\ninvalid entries in the routing table.\n\n163\n00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.930\nNow they'd be valid, right,\nif router 3 was online.\n\n164\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.061\nAnd then if you're using something like\nOSPF, eventually if this router comes back\n\n165\n00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:40.852\nonline then what we end up\ngetting is our links restored,\n\n166\n00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:44.060\nrouting tables are rebuilt and\nthen we're good again.\n\n167\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.090\nThat doesn't always happen and\n\n168\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.099\nthat's why you wanna know those\ncouple different technologies.\n\n169\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.780\nAll right, so that takes us to,\nthat gets our routing loops.\n\n170\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.646\nNow the other thing I wanna talk about\nis something known as a default route,\n\n171\n00:08:57.646 --> 00:08:58.498\nall right?\n\n172\n00:08:58.498 --> 00:09:01.202\nSometimes you might hear this address,\n\n173\n00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:04.468\nit's reserved in our IP Address range,\nright?\n\n174\n00:09:04.468 --> 00:09:09.416\nIt's 0.0.0.0, or four blocks of zeroes,\nor no, eight blocks of zeroes\n\n175\n00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:14.980\nseparated by colons, if you happen to\nbe talking about IPv6 versus IPv4.\n\n176\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.790\nNow if I want, let's say,\na series of routers\n\n177\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.850\nI don't want them knowing about all the\ndifferent routes right behind router one.\n\n178\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.030\nI don't need to over saturate\ntheir routing tables, right?\n\n179\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.840\nI just need these routers within this\nnetwork to just talk to each other, right?\n\n180\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.420\nAnd if they don't know where to send\nthe information, I want them to send it to\n\n181\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.630\nrouter 1 and then router 1 can get it\nto the infrastructure that it needs to.\n\n182\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.820\nSo what we do is we implement\nwhat's known as a Default Route.\n\n183\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.290\nAnd the Default Route basically tells\nthese routers, if you can't find it within\n\n184\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.566\nyour routing table, which typically\nare gonna be all the routes between these\n\n185\n00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:58.998\nrouters confined to this area,\njust send it to this address and\n\n186\n00:09:58.998 --> 00:10:02.155\nwhat's gonna happen is they'll\nsend that to router 1.\n\n187\n00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.765\nNow what we have back here,\nyou can't tell,\n\n188\n00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:07.930\nis the fact that we've got\na major topology back here.\n\n189\n00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.079\nYeah, router 1 can get\nto all these routes.\n\n190\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.770\nBut again,\nwe don't wanna congest the routing table\n\n191\n00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.900\nof these series of routers if\nrouter 1 can handle that for us.\n\n192\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.140\nSo what we do is we inject\nsomething known as a default route.\n\n193\n00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.010\nAnd it says, if you know that\nit's within these routes, and\n\n194\n00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.045\nthese routers here,\nyou'll find that in your routing table.\n\n195\n00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:31.825\nIf you don't find any of these routes\nthere, send it to 0.0.0.0 that\n\n196\n00:10:31.825 --> 00:10:36.760\npoints back to router 1, and then router 1\ncan further get it where it needs to go.\n\n197\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.935\nSo the Default Route is really\na good way to couple of things.\n\n198\n00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:44.510\nConfine a space to a group or routers or,\n\n199\n00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.830\nexcuse me, confine routing to\na certain group of routers.\n\n200\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.318\nAnd also,\nit clears up some of the congestion.\n\n201\n00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:55.278\nI don't want maybe for instance,\nall of these routers to have every\n\n202\n00:10:55.278 --> 00:11:00.600\nroute on the network, again,\njust over saturating the routing table.\n\n203\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.460\nSo we put in that default route and\n\n204\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.820\nthen it just appears to them that\nnothing exists past router one.\n\n205\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:10.039\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the default route.\n\n206\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.340\nAll right, so that takes care\nof our loop back interface.\n\n207\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.250\nRemember, just there for software testing.\n\n208\n00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.350\nAll we're doing is testing our\noperating systems ability.\n\n209\n00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.320\nThe software's ability to talk\nwith a TCP IP protocol stack.\n\n210\n00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.449\nRemember, the default route, if I wanna\nisolate traffic to a certain area,\n\n211\n00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:27.857\nthey also call it the, what is it?\n\n212\n00:11:27.857 --> 00:11:32.340\nThe route of last resort,\nI believe is what they also call it, yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.320\nI don't know where it's going.\n\n214\n00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.920\nI can't find it in my routing table.\n\n215\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.093\nI'm gonna send it here.\n\n216\n00:11:37.093 --> 00:11:39.710\n&gt;&gt; They always have to have multiple\nnames just for us to memorize everything.\n\n217\n00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.749\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly, well, it wouldn't be\na technical certification if you didn't\n\n218\n00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:44.305\nhave 15 acronyms to define one thing.\n\n219\n00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:44.988\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wes,\n\n220\n00:11:44.988 --> 00:11:47.629\nI think we had on our list here\nautonomous system numbers.\n\n221\n00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:49.255\nIs that what we'll be looking at next?\n\n222\n00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:51.277\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what\nwe're gonna be looking at.\n\n223\n00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:53.889\nSo let's talk a little bit about\nwhat autonomous systems are.\n\n224\n00:11:53.889 --> 00:11:55.304\nNow we gotta talk about the big guys,\n\n225\n00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:58.260\nthe big guys out there that\ncould really control everything.\n\n226\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.000\nAnd you'll hear a couple of\ndifferent standards bodies, right?\n\n227\n00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.520\nLargely going back to\nthe earliest days of ARPANET.\n\n228\n00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.130\nIt's been IANA,\nthe Internet Assigns Numbering Authority,\n\n229\n00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.660\nI believe is what it was called.\n\n230\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.556\nAnd then in 2003 a lot of their contracts\nexpired with the Department of Defense,\n\n231\n00:12:14.556 --> 00:12:15.758\nif I understand it right.\n\n232\n00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:22.210\nBut anyways, history lesson aside,\nit was ICANN that took over the functions.\n\n233\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.310\nAll the documentation still says IANA, but\nit is the International Corporation for\n\n234\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.490\nAssigned Names and Numbers today\nthat handle things like the IPv4 and\n\n235\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.160\nIPv6 address space for\nthe public registrars, and\n\n236\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.900\nthat's what we're looking at here when we\ntalk about autonomous systems, all right?\n\n237\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.050\nAn autonomous system really is nothing\nmore than a self-contained network,\n\n238\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:47.560\nthat is in control by\na single administrative body.\n\n239\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.881\nNow you might say what's\nthe difference between that and a LAN?\n\n240\n00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:51.760\nYou remember when we\nwere talking about LANs?\n\n241\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.370\nWell, a lot of times there's nothing\nreally too much different from them, but\n\n242\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.930\nthey don't necessarily have\nto be self-contained and\n\n243\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.370\nyou can't find them across the internet.\n\n244\n00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.350\nSo I don't need people to find\nmy local home network, right?\n\n245\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.930\nI don't really care if Microsoft or\nif Apple or if Facebook or\n\n246\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.670\nother social media sites know exactly\nhow to get into my local network.\n\n247\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.540\nIn fact, I prefer that they don't.\n\n248\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.380\nBut if you're one of those companies,\nyou might wanna be listed in\n\n249\n00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.590\na public listing to where everybody knows\nwhere your network is and how to find you.\n\n250\n00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.632\nAnd that's where autonomous systems\ncome in, autonomous systems are these\n\n251\n00:13:29.632 --> 00:13:34.380\nself-contained networks that\nare publicly reachable, all right?\n\n252\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:38.610\nBut anything out there\nthat's publicly reachable,\n\n253\n00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.450\nthat is in the public, is gonna be\nin the control of IANA or ICANN.\n\n254\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:49.810\nSo what we have are five regional Internet\nregistrars, as they call them, RIRs.\n\n255\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.020\nAnd they control the allocation\nof these numbers.\n\n256\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.550\nNow let me be a little more specific.\n\n257\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.470\nIt's really IANA that controls these,\nand what they do is they allocate\n\n258\n00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:06.940\nlarge blocks of these listings\nof autonomous system numbers.\n\n259\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.575\nAnd we'll look at, for\ninstance, AFRINIC here.\n\n260\n00:14:09.575 --> 00:14:13.617\nAFRINIC is the African International\nNetwork Information Center,\n\n261\n00:14:13.617 --> 00:14:16.061\nI believe is what the acronym stands for.\n\n262\n00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:19.620\nBut they are the regional\nInternet registrar for\n\n263\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.668\nthe entire continent of Africa, right?\n\n264\n00:14:22.668 --> 00:14:27.357\nA lot of space, so when we talk about\nthese being the big guys, we mean big,\n\n265\n00:14:27.357 --> 00:14:27.889\nright?\n\n266\n00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:31.160\nAfrica's the biggest continent\non the planet, right?\n\n267\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.930\nAnd they control the AS numbers and the\nlistings that we see for that location.\n\n268\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.560\nNow you can actually go out,\nand you can find these.\n\n269\n00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.870\nIn fact,\nlet me see if I can find one real quick.\n\n270\n00:14:45.368 --> 00:14:49.170\nThere are, in fact, let me find ARIN's.\n\n271\n00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.053\nARIN, that's ours here in the States.\n\n272\n00:14:51.053 --> 00:14:56.110\nARIN a-s number look up.\n\n273\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.524\n&gt;&gt; And so these five RIR's,\nthey're responsible for managing and\n\n274\n00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.670\nallocating these IP Addresses.\n\n275\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.860\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThey control them,\n\n276\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.740\nso if I wanna be a public entity,\nout on the network, and\n\n277\n00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.570\nI really, ARIN's one of the one's,\nand they do maintain a list.\n\n278\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.130\nAll of them maintain lists, guys.\n\n279\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.437\nI actually got some of these\nlinks in the show notes, so\n\n280\n00:15:13.437 --> 00:15:15.858\nI'll put them in the show notes so\nyou guys can find them.\n\n281\n00:15:15.858 --> 00:15:20.178\nBut I can go to them and I can find\nout what that list of numbers are.\n\n282\n00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:23.160\nNow you might say, well,\nwait a second, Wes.\n\n283\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.490\nWhy would we want that?\n\n284\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.830\nI mean, wouldn't that make\nthem susceptible to hacking?\n\n285\n00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.557\nWell, it'd be no different\nthat your phone book, right,\n\n286\n00:15:30.557 --> 00:15:33.063\nI don't know that we use phone\nbooks a lot anymore, but\n\n287\n00:15:33.063 --> 00:15:35.590\nyour listing of your number\nin the phone book, right?\n\n288\n00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.840\nWell, that's a public listening.\n\n289\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.550\nThat's right,\nI don't even know if the [INAUDIBLE] for\n\n290\n00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.030\nthat matter, but it is a public\nlisting and that's no different there.\n\n291\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.170\nNow there are some things that we wanna\nknow about autonomous systems and\n\n292\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.800\nI kinda hinted on this when we\nwere talking about a couple of\n\n293\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.340\ninterior gateway protocols that\nare kinda famous out there.\n\n294\n00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.640\nWell, there's a few of them, right?\n\n295\n00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.570\nWe have things like RIPv2,\nwhat else do we have?\n\n296\n00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:00.936\nWe have OSPF.\n\n297\n00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:04.339\nCisco proprietary,\nlike EIGRP is out there.\n\n298\n00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.994\nWell, that interior gateway protocol,\nthey call it that,\n\n299\n00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:09.659\nbecause it's interior Interior\nto the autonomous system.\n\n300\n00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:14.048\nSee, an anterior gateway protocol is\nnot gonna broadcasted its rounding\n\n301\n00:16:14.048 --> 00:16:17.457\ntables to another autonomous system,\nhence interior.\n\n302\n00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:22.121\nHowever they do have external\ngateway protocols and\n\n303\n00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:24.669\nthat one is one known as BGP.\n\n304\n00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:32.070\nNow BGP is they call it here in your exam\nobjectives they call it a hybrid protocol.\n\n305\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.120\nAnd that's because it can blend\n\n306\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.440\na combination of metrics together\nit can be used internally.\n\n307\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.200\nIt could be used externally.\n\n308\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.240\nPrimarily BGP is gonna be used to\n\n309\n00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.470\nroute traffic between autonomous systems\nbased on their autonomous system numbers.\n\n310\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.580\n&gt;&gt; And so, Wes,\nthat kind of brings me to a question.\n\n311\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.920\nI'm thinking, when I use a command\nutility in Windows operating systems like\n\n312\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.590\na Route Print and\nI'm looking at the different pieces.\n\n313\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.340\nThe IP Addresses of the different\nhubs that I have to go through.\n\n314\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.500\nAnd I see the same IP Address or\nnot the IP Address but\n\n315\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.090\nIP Address,\naddressing space of the same name.\n\n316\n00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:12.580\nAnd I can identify, okay here in\ngames bill regionally utility.\n\n317\n00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.580\nI see a lot of GRU equipment.\n\n318\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.590\nSo by looking at those names.\n\n319\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:21.150\nAnd on the internet we know that we're\nsharing equipment but by looking at\n\n320\n00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:25.320\nthat I can identify let's say there's\nfive different IP addresses for GRU.\n\n321\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.030\nThen those five different machines,\nthose routers will be part of\n\n322\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.470\none autonomous system cuz it's\ngoverned by that one entity.\n\n323\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.270\n&gt;&gt; They can and here's where it\ngets a little bit tricky with\n\n324\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.280\nsomething like GRU for instance.\n\n325\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.610\nBecause they're also an ISP, yes they do\ngive you autonomous system numbers but\n\n326\n00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.550\nyou can also join their network and\nhave your own autonomous system as well.\n\n327\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.210\nSo with ISPs you kind of get both.\n\n328\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.480\nBut that's absolutely correct.\n\n329\n00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.600\nSo with autonomous systems,\n\n330\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.660\nthere are a couple of things that we\nwanna look at just a little bit more.\n\n331\n00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.270\nAgain, if you guys are going on into\nCisco, you're gonna learn a lot more about\n\n332\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.680\nthis and the interworkings but it is\ngood to kinda see what's going on here.\n\n333\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.310\nSee Interior gateway protocols,\nlike I said,\n\n334\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.680\nthey route traffic inside\nof the autonomous system.\n\n335\n00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:19.000\nYour exterior gateway protocols like BGP,\nwhat they do is, its goal I should say.\n\n336\n00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.290\nIt is to route information between your\nautonomous system based on their number.\n\n337\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:30.039\nWhat you have or you have\n\n338\n00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:35.090\nthese peers right.\n\n339\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.530\nSo out there in the Internet, really\nwhen it comes down to it, I could say,\n\n340\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:45.220\nwell, nobody really knows what's inside\nof this autonomous system numbers.\n\n341\n00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.000\nOr inside of this autonomous systems,\nbecause\n\n342\n00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.690\nthe internal routing infrastructure\nisn't broadcast to the world.\n\n343\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.600\nSo, really, technically I\ncould could fix this slide and\n\n344\n00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.090\nI could do something more like this.\n\n345\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.740\nBecause the only thing\nthat world sees publicly\n\n346\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.199\navailable are the border gateway routers.\n\n347\n00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:07.772\nThese other routers would be called\ninterior gateway routers if you will,\n\n348\n00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.906\nthe ones that are inside\nof the autonomous system.\n\n349\n00:19:10.906 --> 00:19:15.428\nSo, that's a little bit about what you\nhave as far as the autonomous systems keep\n\n350\n00:19:15.428 --> 00:19:17.372\nin mind that it is governed by INA.\n\n351\n00:19:17.372 --> 00:19:22.518\nAgain they allocate the five internet\nregional internet registrars\n\n352\n00:19:22.518 --> 00:19:26.781\nit uses BGP to communicate\nbetween autonomous systems.\n\n353\n00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:31.720\nIt's a path vector protocol as it's\nsometimes called and it does try to\n\n354\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.010\nroute traffic based on what is known\nas the ASN or Autonomous System Number.\n\n355\n00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.720\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes with all this\ndifferent networks available\n\n356\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.200\nonline how do I know if one particular\nnetwork's using one part of call?\n\n357\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.810\nAnd then another is using a different.\n\n358\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.490\nHow do I translate or keep those line\nof communication open between them?\n\n359\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.960\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's where it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n360\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.090\nIf you do happen to have, and let me see\nif I know I've got a slide here, yes,\n\n361\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.170\nthat's called Route Redistribution.\n\n362\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:01.000\nSee, when we talk about\nautonomous systems,\n\n363\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.680\nthey talk about autonomous\nsystems must adhere to\n\n364\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.790\na single routing domain policy and\nthey could form to a single protocol.\n\n365\n00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.810\nWell, people could be using BGP.\n\n366\n00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.010\nPeople could be using OSPF.\n\n367\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.186\nThese we gotta talk a little\nbit about the metrics.\n\n368\n00:20:16.186 --> 00:20:20.348\nNow metrics we've already kind of\ntalked about OSPF and rip version two.\n\n369\n00:20:20.348 --> 00:20:23.963\nRemember that rip version\ntwo just uses hop count,\n\n370\n00:20:23.963 --> 00:20:28.120\nit's distance, so\nhow far out is that destination?\n\n371\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.500\nAnd if I can get the shortest distance\nbetween those two, the source and\n\n372\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.970\ndestination that's the path I'm\ngonna take, that's called a metric.\n\n373\n00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.275\nOSPF on the other hand uses\na lot more than just distance.\n\n374\n00:20:38.275 --> 00:20:40.710\nIt can use distance,\nit can use calculated bandwidth.\n\n375\n00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.310\nIt could be overwritten completely and\nyou could use an administrative distance\n\n376\n00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.140\nthat's manually set and\ndefined by the administrator.\n\n377\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.000\nBut they do use different metrics.\n\n378\n00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.840\nWe talked about in the first\npart we talked about gas.\n\n379\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.970\nThe money that I have to pay for\ngas is really what I use as the metric and\n\n380\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.770\nthe cost to take a trip\nfrom point A to point B.\n\n381\n00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:03.810\nI'm going to use the shortest path\nthat costs the least amount of gas.\n\n382\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.299\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and exactly that's the term\nthat you'll hear quite often is\n\n383\n00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:12.881\nthe least amount, the can I say\nthis right here, the lowest cost.\n\n384\n00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:14.350\nWhich path has has the lowest cost?\n\n385\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.470\nSo you look at that.\n\n386\n00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.958\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and another thing to keep\nin mind with the routing tables you don't\n\n387\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:22.345\nhave two routes to the same destination.\n\n388\n00:21:22.345 --> 00:21:25.311\nIt's going to be the shortest path.\n\n389\n00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:28.797\nWe're building up the shortest path and\nwe do that based on that metric.\n\n390\n00:21:28.797 --> 00:21:32.011\nNow getting back to routing\ndistribution what if I\n\n391\n00:21:32.011 --> 00:21:35.340\nhave a routing domain that's running BGP.\n\n392\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.010\nAnd it's using BGPs metrics.\n\n393\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.980\nASN, Autonomous System Numbers.\n\n394\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.830\nHowever over here I've got\na routing domain autonomous\n\n395\n00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.210\nsystem that is using OSPF, and\nit's using an OSPF metric.\n\n396\n00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.390\nWell, the two don't play nice together.\n\n397\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.860\nThey don't work together.\n\n398\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.090\nI don't go to somebody that\nmaybe speaks Spanish and\n\n399\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.210\nthat's all they speak is fluent\nSpanish and don't know English.\n\n400\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.300\nAnd hand them a letter\nthat's in English and\n\n401\n00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.850\nexpect them to understand what's going on,\nand likewise back to me.\n\n402\n00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.760\nLove to learn Spanish,\nbut I don't understand it,\n\n403\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.540\nso-\n&gt;&gt; Not on the fly.\n\n404\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.000\n&gt;&gt; Right, and if they give me a letter\nthat's in Spanish, I wouldn't know.\n\n405\n00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.150\nSo what do I need?\n\n406\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:11.460\nI need a translator.\n\n407\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.790\nI need something that can translate that\nEnglish into the Spanish language and\n\n408\n00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.932\nvice versa for me, Spanish to English so\nthat we can communicate.\n\n409\n00:22:19.932 --> 00:22:23.880\nWell, route redistribution\ndoes exactly that.\n\n410\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.590\nIt takes essentially the metric\nfrom one routing protocol and\n\n411\n00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.150\nit changes it into a metric,\nwell it doesn't really change.\n\n412\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.020\nAnd let me back up a little bit.\n\n413\n00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.170\nWhat it does is it takes the metric\nfrom one routing protocol.\n\n414\n00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.910\nThis router one will talk\nto router two and then say,\n\n415\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:45.490\nhey you're using BGP,\nwell here's what I need you to do.\n\n416\n00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.010\nIf I'm gonna determine what is a low cost,\nI need you to send me the metric.\n\n417\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.280\nCuz I'm running OSPF.\n\n418\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.759\nI don't know anything about BGP.\n\n419\n00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:56.810\nHowever, if you tell me what those\nmetrics are suppose to be and\n\n420\n00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.577\nwhat the better metric is.\n\n421\n00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:03.884\nThen when somebody is routing from\nmy OSPF domain into my BGP domain,\n\n422\n00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:06.970\nI can make a decision for you.\n\n423\n00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.513\nEven though I really don't know\nwhat the heck this BGP is.\n\n424\n00:23:10.513 --> 00:23:15.053\nSo route redistribution very basically\nwhat it allows you to do is agree on\n\n425\n00:23:15.053 --> 00:23:19.963\nan arbitrary routing metric that you can\nuse across those domains when they're\n\n426\n00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:22.322\nnot using the same routing protocol.\n\n427\n00:23:23.988 --> 00:23:24.980\nAll right.\n\n428\n00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhen we're talking about those metrics,\n\n429\n00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.400\nand we're saying things like different,\nyou use the gas.\n\n430\n00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.160\nAnd then I kind of mentioned there,\nI don't know if we were talking on or\n\n431\n00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.410\noff camera about it,\nbut I said toll booths.\n\n432\n00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:39.623\nSo just kind of, the way I have\nsuch a weird brain, so sorry Wes,\n\n433\n00:23:39.623 --> 00:23:41.954\nif I'm confusing you here.\n\n434\n00:23:41.954 --> 00:23:46.970\nWith a GPS system, if I put in like\na distance vector, Distance Vector GPS.\n\n435\n00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.660\nIt's just simply gonna be looking at\nthe turns or the hop counts, right?\n\n436\n00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.876\nBut if I had a link state GPS and\nit's looking at things,\n\n437\n00:23:54.876 --> 00:23:59.454\nit's a fancy GPS system that\nlooks like traffic and tolls and\n\n438\n00:23:59.454 --> 00:24:02.985\nany kind of construction,\nthings like that.\n\n439\n00:24:02.985 --> 00:24:06.532\nWell, what if there is a route\nthat I prefer over the other?\n\n440\n00:24:06.532 --> 00:24:11.100\nAnd like what Wes was saying\nwith route redistribution,\n\n441\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.049\nYou can actually,\nby utilizing administrative distances,\n\n442\n00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:18.100\nyou can-\n&gt;&gt; Override.\n\n443\n00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Well,\noverride that router's judgement and\n\n444\n00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.400\nadministratively prefer a route\nby using that technique.\n\n445\n00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the administrative\ndistances can be by default, right?\n\n446\n00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.798\nThey can be, for instance,\nbandwidth calculation.\n\n447\n00:24:29.798 --> 00:24:33.451\n10 meg link is gonna be not\npreferred over a 100 meg link,\n\n448\n00:24:33.451 --> 00:24:38.382\nwhich is not gonna be preferred over a gig\nlink and then right up into 10 G, right?\n\n449\n00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:41.230\n10 G is gonna be preferred\nover a one gig link.\n\n450\n00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.380\nOr, with the same administrative\ndistances, we could say, you know what,\n\n451\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.620\nwe're not gonna follow\nwhat the default is.\n\n452\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.600\nAnd we're gonna administratively\ndefine what the cost of the link is.\n\n453\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.550\nSo the router goes,\nI don't care what I know the default is,\n\n454\n00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.610\nyou told me that I should look here,\nand that's what I'm gonna look at.\n\n455\n00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.840\nSo, you can also manually define\nthose administrative distances.\n\n456\n00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.130\nNow one of the other things that\nwe've gotta talk about, and\n\n457\n00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.870\nI think we're getting close,\nwe've got just a couple more topics here.\n\n458\n00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.170\nI gotta keep a eye on my time.\n\n459\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:11.480\nI want you guys to know what something\ncalled route aggregation is.\n\n460\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.665\nNow route aggregation is, again,\n\n461\n00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.870\n[LAUGH] like Cherokee mentioned,\nthere's more than one term for it.\n\n462\n00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:21.350\nSometimes you might hear it called route\nsummarization, or route aggregation.\n\n463\n00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.557\nNow, I'm gonna call it, I'm so\nused to calling it route summarization.\n\n464\n00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.306\nNow, with route summarization,\n\n465\n00:25:27.306 --> 00:25:32.250\nI want you to understand that the purpose\nof this is not to congest a routing table.\n\n466\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.008\nIf I have 700 routes leading\ninto one autonomous system,\n\n467\n00:25:36.008 --> 00:25:40.075\nhow much does the rest of the world\nreally need to grow about that?\n\n468\n00:25:40.075 --> 00:25:42.450\nDo they need to know the 700 routes?\n\n469\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.680\nAnd more so, if I have contiguous address\nspaces, wouldn't it make more sense,\n\n470\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.550\nthat if I had ten routes that\nare all continuous networks, to say,\n\n471\n00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:53.680\nyou know what, we're just gonna\nrepresent those as one larger network?\n\n472\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.492\nSo you put that one entry\nin your routing table and\n\n473\n00:25:56.492 --> 00:26:00.950\nyou don't have to have ten of those routes\nin your routing table all going to,\n\n474\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.640\nlet's say,\nwithin the same type of network.\n\n475\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.550\nSo here, let me show you a little\nbit about how this works.\n\n476\n00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.720\nRoute summarization, you might hear,\nI think I've heard it called super netting\n\n477\n00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.510\nbefore, but route summarization is\nkinda easy when you're looking at it.\n\n478\n00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.520\nTake a look at my screen here.\n\n479\n00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.730\nI have five networks here and\nI've went ahead, guys,\n\n480\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.410\nand, in another episode we're\ngonna talk about binary.\n\n481\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.090\nSo if you don't know what the binary is\nright now, you're gonna have to check that\n\n482\n00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.910\nepisode out and then come back and\nsee us on this one.\n\n483\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, really, unless you're just\nsome kind of genius, to understand\n\n484\n00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.720\nthis concept you kind of have to break\nit down, at least for me anyways.\n\n485\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.466\n&gt;&gt; I always have to break\nit down to the binary.\n\n486\n00:26:36.466 --> 00:26:37.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the way I've gotta do it.\n\n487\n00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.680\nWe've got another host that's been doing\nCisco stuff for the last 30 years now, and\n\n488\n00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.260\nI know he can calculate\nthis right off your head.\n\n489\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.860\nThank goodness, they're not gonna ask\nyou to do that the Network+ exam.\n\n490\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.450\nSo here's what I do, see, notice that\nwe have, right, we have these networks.\n\n491\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.745\nAnd notice that they're all\ncontiguous address spaces, right?\n\n492\n00:26:56.745 --> 00:27:00.730\nI've got a slash 24, or\na class C, subnet mask.\n\n493\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:05.440\nThat means the network ID's,\nthese are all the network ID's,\n\n494\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.060\nnotice it's 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\n495\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.210\nWell, if I wanna say,\nyou know I have five routes, but\n\n496\n00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:15.650\nI wanna tell RTR-2 from RTR-1, I don't\nwanna tell them all five of these routes.\n\n497\n00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.860\nWell, what I can do is I\ncan summarize the routes.\n\n498\n00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.130\nI can aggregate these routes,\nbasically moving the bits around and\n\n499\n00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.570\nour siter notation summarizes them,\nturning them into one larger network.\n\n500\n00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.320\nAnd let me show you an easy\nway to do this, all right?\n\n501\n00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.590\nI, just like Cherokee mentioned,\nI have to break it down into the binary,\n\n502\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.210\nthen I can see what I'm summarizing.\n\n503\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.730\nIf you'll notice,\nthere are a certain set of these bits,\n\n504\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:44.170\nif we look down this screen,\nthat are absolutely identical, right?\n\n505\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:47.332\nNotice that they are,\nyou can see it's in, you know what,\n\n506\n00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:50.200\nI'd probably do a space here,\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n507\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:58.670\nNotice that these are the areas that\nare identical in these addresses.\n\n508\n00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.410\nAll right, and there we go, there's one.\n\n509\n00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.140\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying,\neverything to the right of that space,\n\n510\n00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:04.830\nthat's gonna differ.\n\n511\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.955\nBut when you find that last,\nthat bit there, and\n\n512\n00:28:07.955 --> 00:28:10.490\nthen everything to the left is what\nwe're really focusing on right here.\n\n513\n00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just looking at the identical\nbits right there is what\n\n514\n00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.400\nI'm focused on right now.\n\n515\n00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.910\nNotice I have a series of bits in every\none of these addresses that are identical.\n\n516\n00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.679\nNow, how I could summarize\nthe routes is I say, you know what,\n\n517\n00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:24.360\nI'm gonna change my siter notation.\n\n518\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.992\nThe bits, in what we would also call,\nin decimal, we'd call a subnet mask,\n\n519\n00:28:29.992 --> 00:28:34.252\nand I'll just represent all of\nthe bits that are the same.\n\n520\n00:28:34.252 --> 00:28:38.210\nAnd what that does is it\ncombines all of the subnetworks,\n\n521\n00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.091\nthe individual routes,\ninto a single larger network.\n\n522\n00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:47.752\nAnd for me, I can already see I've worked\nthrough this one before, that that ends up\n\n523\n00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:53.096\nsaying, instead of having five routes and\ngiving you all of those five routes,\n\n524\n00:28:53.096 --> 00:28:58.325\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ndo a 172.31.8.0 with a slash 21.\n\n525\n00:28:58.325 --> 00:29:00.730\nAnd that combines all\nthese routes together.\n\n526\n00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.230\nNow, I know I said that kinda fast, let's\nlook at what we're talking about here.\n\n527\n00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:09.940\nIf I was to count, let's see, 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\n528\n00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:14.120\nAll right, we have 32,\nright, 32 possible bits.\n\n529\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.552\nAnd if I subtract, what was that, 11?\n\n530\n00:29:16.552 --> 00:29:19.500\n1, 2, 3, and 8, 11.\n\n531\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:25.006\nSo if I subtract, 32,\n11 from 32, yeah, I get 21.\n\n532\n00:29:25.006 --> 00:29:25.671\nIs that right?\n\n533\n00:29:25.671 --> 00:29:27.612\nYeah, should be right.\n\n534\n00:29:27.612 --> 00:29:32.289\nNotice that 21 bits, the left side,\nthe higher order of bits,\n\n535\n00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:37.152\nas they call them, there's 21 of\nthese bits that are identical.\n\n536\n00:29:37.152 --> 00:29:38.230\nWell guess what?\n\n537\n00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:42.800\nIf there are 21 bits that are identical,\nall I have to do is slash 21,\n\n538\n00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.445\nsummarizes the routes, and\nit combine these into a larger network.\n\n539\n00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:52.730\nThen I take that one route and\nI essentially pass it over to the RTR-2.\n\n540\n00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:57.640\nAnd now, instead of having five routes\nin the routing table, we only have one.\n\n541\n00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.540\nAnd we've reduced the overall\ncomplexity of the routing table,\n\n542\n00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.190\nmaking the performance a little better.\n\n543\n00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.950\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I\nwas gonna ask you, Wes.\n\n544\n00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.580\nSo now that we have less\ninformation to look at,\n\n545\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.780\ndo we see an increase in\nperformance on these devices?\n\n546\n00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.500\n&gt;&gt; We do, and in fact we can\ntake that a little bit farther.\n\n547\n00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.421\nClass listener domain routing, the whole\npurpose of it, was that very thing,\n\n548\n00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:17.776\nthe route summarization.\n\n549\n00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:22.061\nBecause the core routers across\nthe backbone of the Internet had so\n\n550\n00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:24.749\nmany of these class C addresses, right?\n\n551\n00:30:24.749 --> 00:30:27.848\nAs we start to dwindle down\nthe IPv4 address space,\n\n552\n00:30:27.848 --> 00:30:31.520\npeople had chewed up the A addresses,\nchewed up B addresses.\n\n553\n00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.752\nSo what does the company have to do?\n\n554\n00:30:32.752 --> 00:30:36.285\nThey have to get quite a few\nblocks of C addresses, right?\n\n555\n00:30:36.285 --> 00:30:38.819\nWell the backbone routers\nstarted to get just saturated,\n\n556\n00:30:38.819 --> 00:30:40.483\ntoo many routes in the routing table.\n\n557\n00:30:40.483 --> 00:30:43.422\nSo we come up with classless inter,\nI say we, they come up with a [LAUGH]\n\n558\n00:30:43.422 --> 00:30:43.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n559\n00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:45.311\n&gt;&gt; Classless inter-domain routing\n\n560\n00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:46.298\nto do a couple of things.\n\n561\n00:30:46.298 --> 00:30:49.830\nOne, to stall the inevitable\ndepletion of the IPv4\n\n562\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.900\naddress space by more efficiently\nutilizing the bits that you have.\n\n563\n00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.290\nAnd then another thing is summarizing, so\nthat we put less routes in the routing\n\n564\n00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.600\ntable and those core backbone\nrouters perform a little bit better.\n\n565\n00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.080\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes, what happens if one\nof these routers were to fail?\n\n566\n00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.490\nWe wanna have redundancy\nwithin our environment.\n\n567\n00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.270\nSo I hear this term high availability.\n\n568\n00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.780\nWhat do you think,\ndo we have enough time to cover that or?\n\n569\n00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:10.629\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n570\n00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:15.168\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the last things that\nwe've gotta do is that very thing,\n\n571\n00:31:15.168 --> 00:31:16.980\ncover high availability.\n\n572\n00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.682\nSo imagine I have one default gateway,\nall right?\n\n573\n00:31:21.682 --> 00:31:26.212\nThe default gateway is really nothing\nmore than the router that I send my\n\n574\n00:31:26.212 --> 00:31:31.600\ninformation to when I don't know where\nto send it on my local network, right?\n\n575\n00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.860\nMy computer also uses that default route.\n\n576\n00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.057\nIt says, let me look in the routing table,\nmy local routing table, and let me see.\n\n577\n00:31:37.057 --> 00:31:40.830\nOkay, I see the local network,\nI see my multicast addresses.\n\n578\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.445\nI see the all network broadcast address,\nI see those routes.\n\n579\n00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:47.165\nBut what I don't see is how to get that,\nlet's say, out to Google.\n\n580\n00:31:47.165 --> 00:31:48.579\nSo what do I do?\n\n581\n00:31:48.579 --> 00:31:51.854\nI send it to the router,\nthe default gateway, in this case,\n\n582\n00:31:51.854 --> 00:31:54.176\nin my routing table, is 0.0.0.0.\n\n583\n00:31:54.176 --> 00:31:57.662\nYou might have configured\nan adapter before, and\n\n584\n00:31:57.662 --> 00:32:02.490\nlet's say maybe your default\ngateway is 192.168.1.1.\n\n585\n00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.530\nYou're sending it to that single router,\nthat single gateway.\n\n586\n00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.854\nWhat happens if that router fails,\nlike Cherokee just mentioned?\n\n587\n00:32:08.854 --> 00:32:11.403\nWell, now you have no way\nto get out to the Internet.\n\n588\n00:32:11.403 --> 00:32:14.917\nSo, what you can do is you can implement\nsomething known as a virtual IP address.\n\n589\n00:32:14.917 --> 00:32:19.665\nNow a virtual IP address basically\ngives you router redundancy.\n\n590\n00:32:19.665 --> 00:32:23.773\nSo what happens here is, notice that\nyou have a couple of routers here,\n\n591\n00:32:23.773 --> 00:32:28.771\nRouter-1, Router-2, I'm going to give\nthem their own IP address, just like any\n\n592\n00:32:28.771 --> 00:32:33.480\nother device on a TCP/IP based network,\nit has to have an IP address.\n\n593\n00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:40.252\nSo their IP address that I\nconfigure on Router-1 is 192.168.2.\n\n594\n00:32:40.252 --> 00:32:44.661\nNotice on Router-2 I\nconfigure 192.168.1.3.\n\n595\n00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:48.880\nBut I don't use these addresses\nas the default gateway.\n\n596\n00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.470\nWhat we use is something like\nHot Standby Router Protocol, or\n\n597\n00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.500\nCommon Address Redundancy Protocol, or\n\n598\n00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.630\neven the what is it,\nthe Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol.\n\n599\n00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.100\nAnd what it does is it says, okay, I know\nwhat they're physically assigned, right?\n\n600\n00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.060\nI know what I went in there and\nconfigured.\n\n601\n00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.628\nBut what I want everybody to\nsee is a single IP address that\n\n602\n00:33:12.628 --> 00:33:15.874\nleads to both of these routers, right?\n\n603\n00:33:15.874 --> 00:33:20.561\nSo we have a virtual, if you will,\nsoftware-based IP address that\n\n604\n00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:25.510\nevery one of these computers\nsees as their default gateway.\n\n605\n00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:31.176\nHowever, it's not tied to one router,\nit's tied to both or more routers.\n\n606\n00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:34.382\nSo that if this router happens\nto go offline, guess what?\n\n607\n00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:38.736\nI'm not worried about that IP\naddress that I configured it to, and\n\n608\n00:33:38.736 --> 00:33:42.081\nhaving to go reconfigure\nall of these computers and\n\n609\n00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:45.996\nnow put them in the IP\naddress of 192.168.1.2.\n\n610\n00:33:45.996 --> 00:33:47.198\nNo, they don't see that to begin with.\n\n611\n00:33:47.198 --> 00:33:49.856\nSo when Router-2 goes offline,\nthey still continue.\n\n612\n00:33:49.856 --> 00:33:51.852\n&gt;&gt; You might get some\nperformance degradation, right?\n\n613\n00:33:51.852 --> 00:33:54.695\nBut at least you wouldn't be offline,\nyou'd still have that.\n\n614\n00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:56.536\n&gt;&gt; You might notice\nperformance degradation but\n\n615\n00:33:56.536 --> 00:33:58.148\nit depends on how you have your routers.\n\n616\n00:33:58.148 --> 00:34:01.365\nIf you have them in passive/active\nthen one's only working to begin with.\n\n617\n00:34:01.365 --> 00:34:05.150\nIf you have active/active, then both of\nthem are working and you would notice.\n\n618\n00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.808\nYou might not notice if they're\nin passive/active, that means,\n\n619\n00:34:07.808 --> 00:34:09.310\nones always working it to begin with.\n\n620\n00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.673\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, that's all they see.\n\n621\n00:34:12.673 --> 00:34:16.710\nThey see the virtual IP address that\nisn't tied to a specific router.\n\n622\n00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.090\nSo that it gives me time\nthat if I need to, right?\n\n623\n00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:24.105\nI can bring that router back online and\nall of my clients were none the wiser,\n\n624\n00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:25.188\nthey didn't know.\n\n625\n00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:29.040\nNow, just like Cherokee said,\nthey might notice a little bit.\n\n626\n00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.485\nIf I've got both of these routers working\nat the same time, and [SOUND] one goes\n\n627\n00:34:32.485 --> 00:34:36.672\noffline, yeah, for sure, you're gonna say,\nman, network's kinda slow right now.\n\n628\n00:34:36.672 --> 00:34:42.180\n[LAUGH] But for the most part, you still\nget the ability to continue communicating,\n\n629\n00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.440\neven if it happens to be that\nthat router went offline.\n\n630\n00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.980\nI did mention a couple.\n\n631\n00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.570\nCommon Address Redundancy Protocol\nisn't on the exam.\n\n632\n00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.650\nI'm not sure exactly why it's not.\n\n633\n00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.690\nBut it is another one\nof those protocols that\n\n634\n00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.500\nreally is trying to achieve the same goal.\n\n635\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.520\nHowever, HSRP,\nwhich is proprietary to Cisco,\n\n636\n00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:07.830\nis on the exam, as well as VRRP,\nwhich is an open standards protocol.\n\n637\n00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.331\nI just went ahead and put Common Address\nRedundancy Protocol on there just in case.\n\n638\n00:35:12.331 --> 00:35:14.133\nI'm not sure if it's gonna be on there,\nbut\n\n639\n00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:16.434\nI know it's not formally\ncalled out on the objectives.\n\n640\n00:35:16.434 --> 00:35:19.120\nAnd, Ms. Cherokee, I think that's all.\n\n641\n00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.649\n&gt;&gt; You did good, Wes.\n\n642\n00:35:19.649 -->

because we have\nmore Network+ headed your way.\n\n647\n00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:35.165\nBut we're out of time for this show,\nso I'm gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n648\n00:35:35.165 -->

00:00:08.737\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:10.601\nYou are watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:15.190\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.520\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.660\nThis episode, we will be looking\nat unified communications basics.\n\n8\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.540\nAnd with us today we have\nMr Wes Bryan in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.310\nAnd Wes I'm really hoping you\ncan shed some light on this.\n\n10\n00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.400\nBecause I'm thinking about\nunified communications and well,\n\n11\n00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.600\naren't all communications\nnowadays unified?\n\n12\n00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.550\nSo what are we talking about here?\n\n13\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.760\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yeah, it's one of\nthose things that we're oblivious to\n\n14\n00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.650\nit if we don't actually open up\nthe hood and see what's in the engine.\n\n15\n00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.480\nThat's right we're probably, you guys\nare probably using it right now and\n\n16\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.310\ndon't realize it.\n\n17\n00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.620\nAnd I know that we use it\nhere at IT Pro TV a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.020\nSo unified communications\nwhat does that mean for us?\n\n19\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.850\nWell, I want you to think about what\n\n20\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.320\nlife would be like without\nunified communications.\n\n21\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.190\nSo you can know what it is and\nwhy we really need it today.\n\n22\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.270\nHow many different messaging\nplatforms do you have?\n\n23\n00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.600\nAnd when I say messaging platforms,\n\n24\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600\nI'm not just talking about\nan instant messenger.\n\n25\n00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.792\nBut if you think about it,\nwe have to communicate their email.\n\n26\n00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:12.237\nWe have to communicate through phone.\n\n27\n00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:16.300\nWe have to communicate through\ntext message, SMS messages.\n\n28\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.620\n&gt;&gt; Facebook.\n&gt;&gt; Social Media, another one, right?\n\n29\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.660\nSo, right there we're already up to\nfour different messaging services right?\n\n30\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.970\nMaybe we need to do video conferencing,\nmaybe we need to do conference calls.\n\n31\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.390\nConferencing in general right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.450\nWell you could have multiple systems, you\ncould have systems that are on premise and\n\n33\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.850\nthen that architecture individually\nyou have to manage and maintain.\n\n34\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.962\nWouldn't it be nice that if\nyou need audio communications,\n\n35\n00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:44.533\nyou need different types\nof messaging services.\n\n36\n00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:50.520\nIf you need video conferencing,\nyou need just video messaging.\n\n37\n00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.780\nYou wanna make sure that you have for\ninstance the ability that if\n\n38\n00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.610\na customer calls you, you can determine\nwhich device you pick it up on.\n\n39\n00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.250\nDo I want to pick it up my home office?\n\n40\n00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.920\nDo I want to pick it up at the office?\n\n41\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.610\nDo I want it to ring on my cell phone?\n\n42\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.550\nOr do I want to ring every single one or\nmaybe I'm not an assistant.\n\n43\n00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.930\nI want that ring to come in forward to my\nphone and then forward over the assistant.\n\n44\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.090\nWell, that's a lot of infrastructure to\nhave that manage each individual piece.\n\n45\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.989\nAnd that's where unified\ncommunications comes in.\n\n46\n00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.554\nThe ability to take all of those\ncommunications in time into a logic\n\n47\n00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:26.134\npackage.\n\n48\n00:02:26.134 --> 00:02:28.077\nMaking it a little bit more economical.\n\n49\n00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:31.905\nAnd a little bit more feasible when\nit comes to the administration of\n\n50\n00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:33.790\nthese technologies.\n\n51\n00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.110\nThat's what unified communications are and\n\n52\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.660\nthat's what we're gonna be taking\na look at here in this episode.\n\n53\n00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.150\nSo let's go ahead and let's talk about\na little bit of the benefits and\n\n54\n00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.530\nthe offerings of unified communications.\n\n55\n00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.270\nI got a little diagram here and\n\n56\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.990\nyou could see we've got a whole\nbunch of components here.\n\n57\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.250\nBut let's talk about what unified\ncommunication means for us.\n\n58\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.790\nI want you to think of messaging and\nemail, right?\n\n59\n00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.130\nWhen I need to get a hold of somebody.\n\n60\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.340\nFor instance,\nif I need to send a document.\n\n61\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.760\nOr I need to talk to Cherokee cuz we got\na show that we're gonna do tomorrow.\n\n62\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.970\nAnd I need to make sure that\nI've got an outline for her.\n\n63\n00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.490\nWell, I need to get ahold of her.\n\n64\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.990\nThere's a couple ways I could do that,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.300\nIf I've got her number,\nI could call her on the cellphone.\n\n66\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.790\nAnd if she's not busy, she can pick it up.\n\n67\n00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.690\nShe might be busy.\n\n68\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.080\nIt might be taking care of the family.\n\n69\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.335\nWell I can send her an email.\n\n70\n00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:24.145\nWell, email is asynchronous.\n\n71\n00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:26.355\nIt's not really time-sensitive.\n\n72\n00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.755\nWe'd like to think, as sending it,\nit's time-sensitive.\n\n73\n00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:32.785\nBut when it comes down to at the recipient\ncan choose to view the emails or\n\n74\n00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:34.350\nnot view the emails.\n\n75\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.900\nSo to them it's not really time sensitive.\n\n76\n00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.750\nSo imagine the ability to take\njust something like that.\n\n77\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.700\nTake messaging,\ntake phone voice conversations right?\n\n78\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.290\nAnd blend them into\na single infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.910\nTaking things like A/V your audio and\nvideo.\n\n80\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.600\nAnd putting them out there on our\ntraditional networks as well.\n\n81\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.199\nHigh definition video,\nhigh definition conferencing systems and\n\n82\n00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.859\nagain have all of that\nwrapped into a single unit.\n\n83\n00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.130\nAnd that's really what we mean when\nwe talk about unified communications.\n\n84\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.250\nYou have a few devices like for instance\nyou have your unified communication\n\n85\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.700\nservers Microsoft makes these as well,\nlike Links communication servers.\n\n86\n00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.270\nI know we're using Skype today.\n\n87\n00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.190\nWe'll get to that fact here in a second.\n\n88\n00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.899\nBut you do have devices like these servers\nthat can run some of the software to\n\n89\n00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.920\nallow you to integrate these components.\n\n90\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.717\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\nhere at ITProTV we use Microsoft 365.\n\n91\n00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:32.681\nSo when we're looking at, like you\nmentioned, real-time versus non-real time.\n\n92\n00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.397\nLike if you sent that email,\nit's sitting in my inbox.\n\n93\n00:04:35.397 --> 00:04:38.722\nBut maybe it was a little more urgent,\nand you knew I was online.\n\n94\n00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:43.540\nAnd you could kind of chat at me and\nget that real-time communications there.\n\n95\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.510\nIn your diagram here,\nyou have these servers.\n\n96\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.660\nNow, because it's a service that\nI'm getting from Microsoft these\n\n97\n00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.940\nservers are not located on\nmy physical site are they?\n\n98\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.850\n&gt;&gt; No they are.\n\n99\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.660\nWe got two different models.\n\n100\n00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.670\nWe've got what's known as an on premise\nmodel which is what I'm showing here.\n\n101\n00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.070\nThis is an on Premise model, but then the\nother one that we were gonna lead into,\n\n102\n00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.490\nis what's known as a hosted UC Service.\n\n103\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.490\nAnd the UC Service that you see today,\n\n104\n00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.970\nreally a lot of them are leading\ntowards the cloud infrastructure model.\n\n105\n00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.020\nIf I don't have all of the infrastructure,\nlike we have here,\n\n106\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.660\nlike on Premise model,\nmaybe I don't have the UC Server.\n\n107\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.640\nWe also have things like for\ninstance unified communication gateways.\n\n108\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.850\nYou can go out there and\n\n109\n00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.050\nin fact Cherokee we're gonna spend some\nof your money here on this episode.\n\n110\n00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.600\nShe's gonna love that.\n\n111\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.300\n&gt;&gt; You love doing that.\n\n112\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.060\n&gt;&gt; I absolutely do.\n\n113\n00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.570\nSo if I go UC gateway and I look, well so,\nI know where I can go, I could say.\n\n114\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.610\nIn fact let me make this\na little bit easier,\n\n115\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.710\nwe'll go to Cisco or\nsomething close to Cisco.\n\n116\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.920\nAnd you do have like for\ninstance here we go here's some of their\n\n117\n00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.620\nUnified Communication Gateway Routers and\nPlatforms.\n\n118\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.453\n&gt;&gt; Where's the price on that?\n\n119\n00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:53.260\n[LAUGH] I think I want it.\n\n120\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.470\n&gt;&gt; There is the price, Learn More.\n\n121\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.132\n&gt;&gt; Okay, got it, so I need to know.\n\n122\n00:05:57.132 --> 00:05:59.290\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, [LAUGH] I was just\ngonna say she beat me to the punch.\n\n123\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.870\nAnytime you have to ask the price,\ntypically means you can afford it.\n\n124\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.270\nThat's usually the way\nit works with anything.\n\n125\n00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.440\nBut you can see that there is this like\nfor instance, unified communication\n\n126\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.920\ngateways and what do the unified\ncommunications gateways do for us?\n\n127\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.750\nBut that allows us,\nthink about a gateway device.\n\n128\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.040\nNow, we've talked about before,\n\n129\n00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.810\nwe've talked about things\nlike the default gateway.\n\n130\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.990\nAnd the default gateway really is just\na way that I send information off my local\n\n131\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.570\nnetwork.\n\n132\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.692\nIf I've gotta send something\nto another network,\n\n133\n00:06:23.692 --> 00:06:26.060\nI have to use the default gateway.\n\n134\n00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.180\nSo what are we talking about when we\nsay unified communications gateway?\n\n135\n00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.090\nWell now we're talking about\na gateway in a different sense.\n\n136\n00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.760\nWe're not talking about\na layer three device.\n\n137\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.080\nWe're talking about a device that could\nbe on multiple layers of the OSI model.\n\n138\n00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.130\nBecause what it's doing is it's\ntranslating dissimilar technologies.\n\n139\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.000\nFor instance, when we talk about some of\nthe things that unified communications\n\n140\n00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.350\nallows us to do, right?\n\n141\n00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.870\nIt allows us the benefit of using existing\ntechnologies that we already have.\n\n142\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.740\nMaybe you have something like\na private branch exchange.\n\n143\n00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.250\nMaybe you have an ISDN,\n\n144\n00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.370\nthe Integrated Services Digital Network\nprivate branch exchange.\n\n145\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.950\nYou might see it abbreviated\nas ISDN PBX system.\n\n146\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.440\nMaybe you have an IP-based PBX.\n\n147\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.847\nYou're running voice over IP already,\n\n148\n00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:11.980\nbefore you even consider\nunified communications.\n\n149\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.020\nWell, I want you to think\nof the unified nature.\n\n150\n00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.630\nJust think about the word, unified.\n\n151\n00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.500\nThis allows me for instance,\none of those gateways server,\n\n152\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.680\nthe unified communications\ngateway devices that I can take.\n\n153\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.170\nAnd I can bridge the inoperability\nbetween one system and\n\n154\n00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.980\nanother system and\nput the gateway in there.\n\n155\n00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.310\nAnd now we get unified communications,\nbeing able to blend these\n\n156\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.284\ntechnologies together with existing\ntechnologies that we already have.\n\n157\n00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:43.293\nSometimes you guys might see for instance,\n\n158\n00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:47.740\nunified communications\nmight be abbreviated UCC.\n\n159\n00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.336\nDon't let that fool you.\n\n160\n00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:51.118\nAs we get more into the cloud based.\n\n161\n00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:56.370\nRight, sometimes you'll hear it\ncalled as a service you'll hear\n\n162\n00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:02.670\nit called unified communications,\nwe'll try to spell that right there guys.\n\n163\n00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.490\nCaptain typo to the rescue.\n\n164\n00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.290\nWhen we talk about unified\ncommunications you might hear it called\n\n165\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.850\nunified collaboration and communication or\nunified communication and collaboration.\n\n166\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.000\nNow what Cherokee mentioned\nwas Office 365, right.\n\n167\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.220\nWell that's a form,\nyou can make it a form with for\n\n168\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.850\ninstance Skype for Business, Outlook,\nor Exchange if you will in the cloud.\n\n169\n00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:33.880\nAnd that becomes what's known as UCAAS,\nunified communications as a service,\n\n170\n00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.190\nor unified communications and\ncollaboration as a service.\n\n171\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:43.100\nBoy that's a mouthful, and what that\nmeans is that the UC severs are hosted.\n\n172\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.750\nNo longer on the internal network, and in\nfact I can use basic routing technologies\n\n173\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.980\nif I want in order to communicate\nwith them with my existing network.\n\n174\n00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.100\nAnd that's what you're really\nseeing when you talk about unified\n\n175\n00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.150\ncommunications today.\n\n176\n00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.260\nYes, you could have on premise devices\nthat you manage and you maintain\n\n177\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.310\nwhich means that if these devices fail\nyou're gonna be the one paying for them.\n\n178\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.040\nSo if you're a larger company that\nmight be something that you can afford.\n\n179\n00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.900\nIf you're a small or\n\n180\n00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.840\na medium company it might be a little\nbit more feasible to say, you know what?\n\n181\n00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.730\nI don't want to handle the network\ninfrastructure side, but\n\n182\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.040\nI do need the service.\n\n183\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.400\nSo I'm gonna go to your company and\n\n184\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.850\nsince you already have that infrastructure\nin place, I'll pay you for the service.\n\n185\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.560\nAnd then I get things like email,\n\n186\n00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.950\nI get things like instant messaging,\nvideo conferencing.\n\n187\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.360\nI say social media guys,\n\n188\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.530\nwhat we're talking about is more\nbusiness-class social media, right?\n\n189\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.110\nThings like Yammer is one that I\nthink Microsoft still owns out there.\n\n190\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.365\n&gt;&gt; Who uses Yammer?\n\n191\n00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:38.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n192\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.097\n&gt;&gt; I don't know,\nI haven't seen it really take off yet.\n\n193\n00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:44.685\n&gt;&gt; It's just another one of those\ntechnologies that was bought and\n\n194\n00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:45.888\nrun into the ground.\n\n195\n00:09:45.888 --> 00:09:49.265\nBut [LAUGH] the other cool thing that\nwe got too is the think about this,\n\n196\n00:09:49.265 --> 00:09:50.150\nsmart delivery.\n\n197\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.820\nI kind of mentioned that with\nsmart delivery, do I want\n\n198\n00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.740\nit to ring my local phone here that\nI have right here under the podium?\n\n199\n00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.660\nDo I want it to ring the phone at my desk?\n\n200\n00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.430\nDo I want you to send me a message,\n\n201\n00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.170\nis that my preferred preference when it\ncomes to getting a hold of me, right?\n\n202\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.910\nSo you also have things,\nthat's one of the benefits of things,\n\n203\n00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.300\nsmart delivery when you're\nusing multiple devices.\n\n204\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.390\nNow, that's not only in phone calls.\n\n205\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.986\nNow, I want you to think about it,\nif I've got, for instance Cherokee and\n\n206\n00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:25.345\nI both have iMacs right here, or\nnot iMacs, excuse me, MacBook Pros, right?\n\n207\n00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:27.200\nThey've got a pretty beefy\nprocessor in them right?\n\n208\n00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.180\nGot plenty of memory, and if we put their\ngigabit connection on it, then her and I\n\n209\n00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.760\ncould do a video conference between these\ntwo laptops with unified communications,\n\n210\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.170\nand provided our bandwidth is okay on our\nlocal network, we're gonna be just fine.\n\n211\n00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.990\nWhat about on a device like this?\n\n212\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.980\nWell your unified communications\ninfrastructure, smart delivery\n\n213\n00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.910\nknows that the bandwidth that I give you\non that device, that MacBook Pro,might\n\n214\n00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.032\nnot be the same experience if I gave you\nall that data on this mobile device.\n\n215\n00:10:57.032 --> 00:11:01.820\nSo maybe, on a mobile device,\nif we're doing web conferencing and\n\n216\n00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.840\nI transition from my laptop,\nwhere I'm doing voice and video,\n\n217\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.560\nand I move over to my cell phone,\nmy cell phone doesn't have the bandwidth.\n\n218\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.100\nSo maybe I don't get the video,\nI only get the audio, right?\n\n219\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.341\nAs I still want to be part\nof the conference, but\n\n220\n00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:20.640\nI can't get all that information,\nit's going to give a bad user experience.\n\n221\n00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.330\nWell unified communications with smart\ndelivery knows that the way I deliver\n\n222\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:30.640\nthe traffic to, let's say the MacBook or\na Surface Pro tablet,\n\n223\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.326\nisn't probably gonna be the exact way and\nbandwidth-wise and\n\n224\n00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:39.990\nresource processor power-wise that\nI would be to a mobile device.\n\n225\n00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.182\nAnd that's important, too, and\nit's another great thing about unified\n\n226\n00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:48.905\ncommunications is the fact that when we do\nhave this just massive expansion of BYOD,\n\n227\n00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:51.846\neverybody wants to bring their own device,\nright.\n\n228\n00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:56.148\nWe all have our devices, [LAUGH] maybe\nnot on us right now [CROSSTALK].\n\n229\n00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.840\nAnd multiple devices,\nanother good point too.\n\n230\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.260\nHow does the service stream,\n\n231\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.390\nlet's say video conferences\nto each individual device?\n\n232\n00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.391\nWell if you have the unified\ncommunications set up and\n\n233\n00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:10.440\nit's set up right, then that service,\n\n234\n00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.100\nthat infrastructure knows what to\nsend to each individual device.\n\n235\n00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.770\nHow about another thing,\nroaming capabilities?\n\n236\n00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.340\nYou say well, wait a second Wes hold on.\n\n237\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.060\nYou're telling me I need unified\ncommunications in order to do roaming?\n\n238\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.080\nI've been doing roaming for\na long time on my cell phones.\n\n239\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.610\nThat's not really completely the type\nof roaming I'm talking about.\n\n240\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:36.000\nImagine if I am on a web\nconference on this device.\n\n241\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.080\nWhat do you think's cheaper?\n\n242\n00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.340\nGoing over my cellular data plan, or\nconnecting to my WiFi network, and\n\n243\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.230\nhaving it delivered there?\n\n244\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.090\nSo that's what I mean when I say roaming.\n\n245\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.100\nThe ability to intelligently make\na decision that you're on a WiFi network,\n\n246\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.910\nnow with your web conferencing, so\n\n247\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:55.720\nwe'll deliver that over your WiFi rather\nthan your GSM or your CDMA network or\n\n248\n00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.290\nLTE network, where now your provider's\nsaying, yeah, just go ahead, absolutely.\n\n249\n00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:01.970\n&gt;&gt; That would be easy.\n\n250\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n251\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.420\nGo ahead.\n\n252\n00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.740\nJust keep delivering it over that\ncellular network, no problem.\n\n253\n00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.470\nWe'll keep pumping out the bandwidth,\nand keep charging you too.\n\n254\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.270\nSo, it also gives you those\nintelligent roaming options, where it\n\n255\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.240\nsays if you're on the WiFi network,\nI'll just use the WiFi data, right.\n\n256\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.650\nAnd I, as an end user, shouldn't have\nto do what I have to do at home, and\n\n257\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.150\nthis is true story.\n\n258\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.980\nI got to make sure that if I'm gonna\nstream Netflix on my phone at night I\n\n259\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.558\ndon't fall asleep with a data\nplan turned on, right.\n\n260\n00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:32.570\nBecause my WiFi network crashes and\n\n261\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.050\nnow overnight I'm streaming Netflix\nto my phone over my data plan.\n\n262\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.268\n&gt;&gt; Speaking from experience?\n\n263\n00:13:37.268 --> 00:13:37.898\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n264\n00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:41.364\nyeah I plead the fifth on that one I don't\ncare what the camera says it does lie.\n\n265\n00:13:41.364 --> 00:13:45.500\n[LAUGH] So, we get that benefit too.\n\n266\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.405\nThat I can bring these multiple\ntechnologies to different devices and\n\n267\n00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:53.243\nalso have the ability to make\nintelligent decisions on where you're\n\n268\n00:13:53.243 --> 00:13:56.366\nlocated on what transmission\nmedia that might be used.\n\n269\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.790\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n270\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.810\nAnd I kind of mentioned that where\n\n271\n00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.440\na lot of this is being\nhosted in the cloud today.\n\n272\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.723\nThey don't really call out the cloud\nbased unified communications.\n\n273\n00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:12.330\nWe do have a\n&gt;&gt; Section on cloud.\n\n274\n00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.670\n&gt;&gt; Section on, yeah,\nthank you, you help me.\n\n275\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.240\nWe're gonna have a section on cloud,\nwhere you do have to understand things\n\n276\n00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.680\nlike virtualization in the cloud,\nbut it's not here.\n\n277\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.670\nBut it does make for good conversation and\nI think it is important to show you that's\n\n278\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.790\nkinda where were, if we're not already\nthere, we're definitely streaming to it.\n\n279\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of what I'm asking\nabout you earlier, because it's so\n\n280\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.300\nperfect for so many individuals.\n\n281\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.930\nIt's not perfect for everyone, but it is\nan option for, like you had mentioned,\n\n282\n00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.100\na lot of smaller businesses.\n\n283\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.020\nMaybe they're just starting out, they\ncan't afford all that expensive equipment,\n\n284\n00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.660\nor maybe they don't even know if their\nbusiness is gonna last past the first year\n\n285\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.910\nor something like that.\n\n286\n00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.410\n&gt;&gt; A secure environment,\nit might not be good for them.\n\n287\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.720\nSo for instance, if I have to follow\nthings like PCI, Payment Card industry,\n\n288\n00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.100\ncompliance, and I know you know policy.\n\n289\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.710\nSo you know exactly what I'm talking\nabout, things like HIPPA Compliance.\n\n290\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.410\nI might have to keep it on premise.\n\n291\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:01.830\nOr I might have to go to the third one,\nand do, and\n\n292\n00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.690\nI don't have, I thought I had a hybrid.\n\n293\n00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.830\nBut the hybrid type network and\n\n294\n00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.500\nlet me just check here,\nno it doesn't look like I have a hybrid.\n\n295\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.550\nSo guys just understand that the hybrid's\ngonna be a combination of on premise and\n\n296\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.460\ncloud based.\n\n297\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.210\nSo maybe there are some things that,\nfor security reasons,\n\n298\n00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.226\nwe have to make sure that\nwe're in control, right?\n\n299\n00:15:21.226 --> 00:15:24.240\nWhen that communication\ngoes up to the cloud,\n\n300\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.030\ndo you know the people\nthat are working with it?\n\n301\n00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.340\n&gt;&gt; I really don't,\nI have to trust that company.\n\n302\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.595\n&gt;&gt; Right, I don't know, really, anybody\nthat works at Microsoft in Office 365.\n\n303\n00:15:33.595 --> 00:15:36.735\nI certainly don't know their\ninfrastructure behind the scenes.\n\n304\n00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:41.305\nI can only hope that their\nadministrators are doing due diligence.\n\n305\n00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:45.941\nSo there might be situations\nwhere you're gonna use\n\n306\n00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:49.005\nmore of a That hybrid technology.\n\n307\n00:15:49.005 --> 00:15:49.745\nLet's see here.\n\n308\n00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:54.662\nThere's another very important\nconcept that I want you to know about\n\n309\n00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.700\nunified communications.\n\n310\n00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:03.140\nIf you have used, let's say Facebook, if\nyou've used any instant messenger app, you\n\n311\n00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.840\nprobably are very aware of this already,\nand that's something called presence.\n\n312\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.765\nPresence is the ability to find out,\nare you online?\n\n313\n00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:12.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Quite literally, are you online?\n\n314\n00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.200\nThink about, if you have an instant\nmessaging service that you're using,\n\n315\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.900\nlike I said, I use Facebook, and I can\ntell by going to a certain location within\n\n316\n00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:25.330\nthe interface that I've got a handful\nof friends that are online right now.\n\n317\n00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.560\nRight now, they're currently using it,\nthe technology,\n\n318\n00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.990\nand that if I wanted to get hold of them,\nI could, all right?\n\n319\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.820\nThat's presence.\n\n320\n00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.920\nAnd presence just basically means that\nregardless of the technology that I'm\n\n321\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.520\nusing, doesn't matter if I'm using e-mail,\nif I got my e-mail open,\n\n322\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.570\nI can tell by a little indicator\nthat Cherokee's online.\n\n323\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.990\nI could find out that, yeah,\nCherokee's online, but\n\n324\n00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.060\nright now she's in a conference\nmeeting and she's busy, right?\n\n325\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.510\nSo, presence.\n\n326\n00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.140\nNow, presence, I gotta mention this.\n\n327\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.520\nThey don't call it on the exam objectives,\nbut\n\n328\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.190\nI do wanna kinda break down two\ndifferent components, right?\n\n329\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.580\nPresence and availability are two\ncompletely different things, all right?\n\n330\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.130\nCuz there is availability.\n\n331\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.330\nPresence just means can you\ntell if I'm online or not.\n\n332\n00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.760\nAvailability is Cherokee is in a meeting,\nor Cherokee is not in a meeting and\n\n333\n00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.980\nI can send her a message that says\n\n334\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.440\nI need to know what the administrative\ndistance of this protocol is.\n\n335\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.990\nOr have you seen this policy,\ndo you understand what it means?\n\n336\n00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.080\nI have no clue, right?\n\n337\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.400\nThat let's me know that, yeah, she could\ntake that call or she's away, right?\n\n338\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.086\nSo there's presence and\nthere's also availability.\n\n339\n00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:33.480\nThey're not quite, they're related,\nvery closely related to each other, but\n\n340\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.060\nthey're not technically the same.\n\n341\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.270\nSo I did want to throw that in there.\n\n342\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.430\nMy online, offline status,\nmy communication availability.\n\n343\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.570\nAgain, availability is\nsomething quite different.\n\n344\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.060\nBut then,\nthe other cool thing about presence is\n\n345\n00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.640\nhow do we get a hold of somebody?\n\n346\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.000\nDo you have a preferred method?\n\n347\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.070\nAnd if you have a preferred method,\n\n348\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.440\nthat's something that you could do\nwith preference is I'm away, IM only.\n\n349\n00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.240\nOr I'm available, call me, right?\n\n350\n00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.750\nSo I might say text messages only.\n\n351\n00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.240\nSure, I'm available, but you're,\n\n352\n00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.410\nif you need to get a hold\nof me send me an sms right?\n\n353\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.080\nA little text message on the phone.\n\n354\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.620\nSo that's another thing that\nthe presence helps you with.\n\n355\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.090\nNow, a couple of other things\nthat we need to kinda look at.\n\n356\n00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.960\nLet's see here.\n\n357\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.460\nI want to talk a little bit about\nwhat is known as quality of service.\n\n358\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.465\nBut before we do that,\nlet's talk about multicast versus unicast.\n\n359\n00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:22.820\nCuz they do call this out.\n\n360\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.590\nWe're gonna talk about all three\ndifferent communication types coming up.\n\n361\n00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.030\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna\nmention them all here and then guess what,\n\n362\n00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.680\nwe'll mention them again later as\nit relates to that technology.\n\n363\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.920\nSo, when we're using these technologies,\n\n364\n00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.030\nwe can have what's known as\na one-to-one communication, right?\n\n365\n00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.340\nSo, Cherokee and I,\n\n366\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.040\nwe were talking about a concept\nbefore we started with this episode.\n\n367\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.870\nThat is a one-to-one communication,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:50.310\nIt's her and I talking, one source,\none destination, and then if you,\n\n369\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.825\nfrom the other perspective, then again,\nit's still one source, one destination.\n\n370\n00:18:52.825 --> 00:18:57.820\nOne-to-one communications\nare called Unicast.\n\n371\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.240\nIt is a directed communication\nto one specific end point.\n\n372\n00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.620\nNow, you can have UC communications\nthat are unicast, point-to-point,\n\n373\n00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.310\nnot really point-to-point, but\njust one-to-one, all right?\n\n374\n00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.190\nYou can also have multi-cast\ncommunications, right?\n\n375\n00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.235\nWe can use things like IGMP,\nwhich is the Internet gateway manage,\n\n376\n00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:18.990\nGroup Management Protocol, all right?\n\n377\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.950\nIt's the way we route traffic\nwith multi-cast communications.\n\n378\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.900\nNow it's a little bit different,\nall right?\n\n379\n00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.325\nYou say, well, wait a second,\nmulti-cast communications, what's that?\n\n380\n00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:29.195\nIt's a one-to-many communication.\n\n381\n00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:31.995\nAnd I like to explain it, even though\nyou'll see everybody explain it\n\n382\n00:19:31.995 --> 00:19:36.290\none-to-many, I usually say one-to-many,\nand that many is a select group, right?\n\n383\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.720\nYou have what are called\nmulti-cast groups, and\n\n384\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.720\nthe multi-cast groups are the only\nones that receive the communication.\n\n385\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:48.920\nYou may be, if you've ever, maybe you've,\nlet's say, how do I wanna say this?\n\n386\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.290\nHBO.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I love that analogy.\n\n387\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Or Pay Per View events, right?\n\n388\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.260\nIf you've ever had to pay for an event.\n\n389\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.180\nThink about it.\n\n390\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.570\nThat Pay Per View event only goes\nto the people that pay to view,\n\n391\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.580\nthat's why they call it Pay Per View.\n\n392\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.950\nThat is an example of\na multicast communication,\n\n393\n00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.280\nbecause I wanted,\nthink about somebody on the street, right?\n\n394\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.930\nI remember we used, when we were younger,\nwhen we were kids, we would do chores and\n\n395\n00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.610\nwork around that neighborhood and\nstuff, and\n\n396\n00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.980\nwe put our money together and we'd go with\nour friend's house and she would pay for\n\n397\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.060\nthe boxing fights, back in Tyson days and\nHolyfield days, right?\n\n398\n00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.290\nBut if you think about it,\nall of us went over to her house,\n\n399\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.040\ncuz individually we couldn't afford it.\n\n400\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.320\nWell, that means when she paid for\nit, we could go her house and see it,\n\n401\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.170\nand maybe anybody else on the block\nthat might have paid for that event.\n\n402\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.160\nBut I couldn't watch it at my house.\n\n403\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.070\nWhy?\n\n404\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.660\nI'm not part of the group.\n\n405\n00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.380\nIt was never intended for me.\n\n406\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.340\nAnd that's a multi-cast communication.\n\n407\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.430\nNow, multi-cast communications are an\nefficient way that if I need to send some\n\n408\n00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.608\nkind of video communication to more than\none person we can call out as a group.\n\n409\n00:20:48.608 --> 00:20:51.180\nAnd rather than broadcast,\nwhat's broadcast?\n\n410\n00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.190\nBroadcast is when I send one communication\nto everybody on the network.\n\n411\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Like PBS.\n\n412\n00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.730\n&gt;&gt; Just like PBS, right?\n\n413\n00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.770\nNo longer are you paying for it-\n&gt;&gt; You couldn't afford the boxing.\n\n414\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.060\nBut you sure can watch Reading Rainbow.\n\n415\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.530\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n416\n00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.780\nSo, everybody gets that communication.\n\n417\n00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.230\nThat's not really efficient when you\ntalk about unified communications,\n\n418\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.140\nreally wouldn't do us anything but hinder\nour networks if that's how they were gonna\n\n419\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.890\ndeliver their traffic to\nmore than one person.\n\n420\n00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.530\nSo they use unicast and\nthey use multicast.\n\n421\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.200\nI didn't wanna bring in broadcast cuz\nit's the only one we're missing out of\n\n422\n00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.770\nthe three communication types-\n&gt;&gt; For IPv4.\n\n423\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:24.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for IPv4.\n\n424\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.870\nWe'll get into the other ones later.\n\n425\n00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.400\nAnd,d yeah, so remember the multi-cast and\nthe unicast as well.\n\n426\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because with unified\ncommunications, like you said,\n\n427\n00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.200\npart of that multicast group.\n\n428\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.710\nLike if I wanted to send a group e-mail,\nI could just kinda put all of my\n\n429\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.130\nshow hosts and sent it out instead of\ntyping each one individually there.\n\n430\n00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.170\nSo it's just kind of easy that way.\n\n431\n00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.040\n&gt;&gt; It definitely is.\n\n432\n00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo, the other type of communication that\nI wanna talk about is something known\n\n433\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.090\nas Quality of Service.\n\n434\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.770\nAnd I've got a little generic diagram here\nto kinda show you what quality service is.\n\n435\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.700\nI want you to think about what\ntraffics hit our network, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.390\nMore and more so\n\n437\n00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.990\ntoday we have less traditional, I said\nless traditional traffic, we have both.\n\n438\n00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.490\nTraditional types of traffics like, for\n\n439\n00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.430\ninstance, like your file transfer\ntraffics, file transfer protocol.\n\n440\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.800\nWe have just normal\ncommunications when we're talking-\n\n441\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.350\n&gt;&gt; E-mail translation-\n\n442\n00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.345\n&gt;&gt; Between two computers,\n\n443\n00:22:16.345 --> 00:22:18.770\ne-mail communications.\n\n444\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.090\nBut we also have a lot of real\ntime delivery that we need, right?\n\n445\n00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.720\nWe have Voice Over IP,\nwe have video communications.\n\n446\n00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.270\nAnd these communications,\n\n447\n00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.510\nthe way they use our networks\nare completely different, right?\n\n448\n00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.330\nWhen we talk about traditional\ncommunications like FTP or\n\n449\n00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.100\nFile Transfer Protocol, right, I don't,\n\n450\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.568\nI would like it to be a fast file\ntransfer, but is it a necessity?\n\n451\n00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:42.340\n&gt;&gt; It's not necessary.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n452\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.910\nit is not really necessary.\n\n453\n00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:49.620\nSo, we can afford a little bit of\na delay in that communication, right?\n\n454\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.510\nBut I can't really afford packet loss,\nbecause if we have packet loss,\n\n455\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.600\nthen the files get corrupted and, well,\n\n456\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.770\nwhy are we even transferring\nthe files in the first place?\n\n457\n00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.600\nSo with that type of traffic, I could say,\nyou know what, FTP, I tell you what.\n\n458\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.170\nWe're gonna give you a little\nbit less of the bandwidth, but\n\n459\n00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.960\nwhat we're gonna do is ensure that\nyou don't drop a packet, all right?\n\n460\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.140\nHowever, things like, for instance, and\n\n461\n00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.500\nif we take a look at my desktop here,\nwe could show you some of the other ones.\n\n462\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.200\nThings like real time transfer protocol,\nreal time time transport protocol,\n\n463\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.073\nI've gotta get that one right.\n\n464\n00:23:20.073 --> 00:23:23.947\nVoice over IP, Video Telecommunications,\n\n465\n00:23:23.947 --> 00:23:27.180\nthese type of communications\nneed real time delivery.\n\n466\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.620\nAnd with these real time delivery\ncommunications, they can stand\n\n467\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.505\na little bit of packet loss, but\nwhat the can't stand is any delay.\n\n468\n00:23:36.505 --> 00:23:38.265\nSo we need to get them fast.\n\n469\n00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:39.981\nGet them there fast.\n\n470\n00:23:39.981 --> 00:23:45.368\nSo, quality of service is away that\nwe can assign certain resources,\n\n471\n00:23:45.368 --> 00:23:49.037\nour bandwidth That's right,\nno packet loss.\n\n472\n00:23:49.037 --> 00:23:53.958\nWe can slow the packets down, we can speed\nthem up if we have to by assigning them\n\n473\n00:23:53.958 --> 00:23:59.220\na certain value and we could say RTP we're\ngonna give you most of our bandwidth.\n\n474\n00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.810\nFTP, we're gonna slow\nyou down a little bit so\n\n475\n00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:06.630\nit's a way to classify your traffic and\nassign a certain amount of your network\n\n476\n00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:11.360\nresources based on the type of traffic,\nand that's what quality of service is.\n\n477\n00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.860\n&gt;&gt; Cool, so I'm just triaging based\nupon those predefined parameters with\n\n478\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.830\nquality of service.\n\n479\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.270\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, now.\n\n480\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.470\nThey do call out a couple of things on\nthe exam that I want you to be aware of.\n\n481\n00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.060\nThey also call out what is\nknown as class of service.\n\n482\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.270\nClass of service is a layer 2 technology.\n\n483\n00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.240\nQuality of service is\na layer 3 technology.\n\n484\n00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.140\nSo if I need to tell an upper layer\nprotocol what type of traffic this is,\n\n485\n00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.670\nI put a class on it.\n\n486\n00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:39.853\nNow, class again,\nlike I said just it allows us to associate\n\n487\n00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:44.338\na specific class at layer\ntwo with a type of traffic.\n\n488\n00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:46.325\nNow, quality of service, however,\n\n489\n00:24:46.325 --> 00:24:49.125\nthey also call out a couple\nof different things here.\n\n490\n00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:54.570\nQuality of service really has two\ndifferent defined architectures.\n\n491\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:00.120\nOne is an Internet Engineering Task Force\ndefinition and\n\n492\n00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.180\nthat's something known\nas integrated services.\n\n493\n00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.520\nAnd it uses something known as Resource\nReservation Protocol or RSVP, that's a-\n\n494\n00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.192\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n495\n00:25:08.192 --> 00:25:09.706\n&gt;&gt; That's a tech geeky term for sure.\n\n496\n00:25:09.706 --> 00:25:13.120\nAnd then they also call what's\nknown as differentiated services.\n\n497\n00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.630\nDifferentiated Services is\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n498\n00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.462\nI need to be able to\ndifferentiate if its HTTP, POP3,\n\n499\n00:25:18.462 --> 00:25:23.240\nIMAP, SMTP, FTP or\nmaybe some kind of directory service.\n\n500\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.590\nOver differentiating the fact that now\nI have real time traffic, all right?\n\n501\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.000\nNow how do they do that?\n\n502\n00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.290\nThey do that with something known as, here\nis the acronym guys, sorry alphabet soup.\n\n503\n00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:37.670\nThat is your DSCP, that differentiated\nservers code point and [LAUGH].\n\n504\n00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.260\nI know, guys,\nwith some of these standards.\n\n505\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.690\nJust know that that's\na way to mark traffic and\n\n506\n00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.830\nto differentiate, that's why they\ncall it Differentiated services.\n\n507\n00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.680\nI need to know what needs to\nbe delivered in real time.\n\n508\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.790\nI need to know what's traditional traffic\nthat could be slowed down a little bit,\n\n509\n00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.010\nin order to provide those services.\n\n510\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:02.080\nSome of the most common,\nthe most common DIF Serve,\n\n511\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.680\nthey call it for short, but Differentiated\nService Code Point is the full acronym.\n\n512\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.850\nI'm just gonna call it DIF Serve here.\n\n513\n00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:11.780\nSome of the common classifications,\nkeep in mind that even though\n\n514\n00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:17.520\nwhen we talk about routing, I can only\naffect a decision made from the next hop.\n\n515\n00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.360\nI can't do anything past\nthat if I'm a router.\n\n516\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.882\nRight, I might know that the endpoint\nis five hops that way, but\n\n517\n00:26:22.882 --> 00:26:27.860\nthe only thing I can do is influence the\nnext hop that I'm sending this traffic to.\n\n518\n00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.527\nThat's called per hop behavior,\nand in differentiated service code\n\n519\n00:26:32.527 --> 00:26:37.363\npoint you have three common parameters or\nif you will classifications.\n\n520\n00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:42.700\nYou have what's known as the default PHB,\nper hot behavior right.\n\n521\n00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.120\nAnd that's a best effort.\n\n522\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.900\nYou also have expedited PHB and again this\nis dedicated to very low loss, right,\n\n523\n00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:55.290\nlow latency traffic and then a last is\nassured forwarding per hot behavior and\n\n524\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:27:00.480\nthat says I don't know what under\nthe predetermined conditions,\n\n525\n00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.340\nI am going to give you a assurance that\nwe're gonna deliver your information.\n\n526\n00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.990\nSo a couple of different things there.\n\n527\n00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.910\nSo again, remember class of service.\n\n528\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.130\nIt allows users to associate\na layer 2 service with a packet.\n\n529\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.450\nQuality of service, again, remember\nthat you have two different types.\n\n530\n00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.310\nOne of them they don't call out,\nand that's the A net serve.\n\n531\n00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:23.190\nAnd again that's the integrated services,\nit uses RSVP and they also\n\n532\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:28.460\ncall out DiffServ architecture, that's\nthe Differentiated Services code point.\n\n533\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.750\nAll right, let me look over here,\nI don't think, I did forget something,\n\n534\n00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.370\nI almost forgot about some of the most\nimportant things when it comes to\n\n535\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.340\nour unified communications and\n\n536\n00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.780\nthat's what protocols are when you can\neven see when we're using some of this.\n\n537\n00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.470\nI've talked about a couple of them but\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n538\n00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.610\ntalk about them a little bit more.\n\n539\n00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:52.080\nNow, guys, what I believe I'm\ngoing to tell you about these\n\n540\n00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.720\ndefinitions is going to be really\nwhat you need to know for the exam.\n\n541\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.100\nI know we have viewers out there that\nreally like the little minutious here,\n\n542\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.930\nso I put those there for\nadditional reading if you want it.\n\n543\n00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.360\nIt is not required on this exam, but\nI know that some of you might use Net+\n\n544\n00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.270\nas a leaping stone to go on to\nmore higher level certifications.\n\n545\n00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.090\nSo in the blue there I put what\nare known as the request for\n\n546\n00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.480\ncomments that come from\nthe Internet Engineering Taskforce.\n\n547\n00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.940\nThey read like stereo instructions, guys.\n\n548\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.820\nThey are doctoral dissertations,\nmaster thesis.\n\n549\n00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.510\n&gt;&gt; Bathroom reading.\n\n550\n00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really is.\n\n551\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.190\nSo I do put them there, we're not\ngonna worry about them for this exam.\n\n552\n00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.980\nSo those of you guys that are watching\nout here, if you want more information on\n\n553\n00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.250\nthese, you can go ahead and\nyou can really read in depth information.\n\n554\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.325\nBut I believe what I'm gonna tell\nyou here is gonna be just about\n\n555\n00:28:40.325 --> 00:28:42.825\nWhat you need to know when\nit comes to the exam.\n\n556\n00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:45.735\nCan't say that for\nsure because they change the exam.\n\n557\n00:28:45.735 --> 00:28:48.939\nAnd they add things that we're just\nsometimes we don't know they're\n\n558\n00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:49.708\ngonna be there.\n\n559\n00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:52.576\nH 323, this is basically the ITU\n\n560\n00:28:52.576 --> 00:28:57.360\nthe International Telecommunications Union\nstandard for\n\n561\n00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.790\ntransferring audio or video packets\nbasically over any packet based network.\n\n562\n00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.500\nSo it's an international standard.\n\n563\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.620\nWe follow it here too.\n\n564\n00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:13.050\nBut again with the ITU, that's kinda\nthe opposite or the European version\n\n565\n00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.720\nof what we have here in the States is ANSI\nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n\n566\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.527\nHowever, we still follow along\nwith this specification too.\n\n567\n00:29:20.527 --> 00:29:25.516\nNow, two of these protocols are really\nheavily entrenched in voice\n\n568\n00:29:25.516 --> 00:29:26.750\nover IP as well.\n\n569\n00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.610\nSo, unified communications,\n\n570\n00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.910\nwe're gonna have more than one protocol\nthat can serve as more than one technology\n\n571\n00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:37.000\nand that's SDP and SIP or SIP as it's,\nit's not called SIP it's called sip.\n\n572\n00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.970\nThe session description protocol,\nwhen we talk about the session\n\n573\n00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.470\ndescription protocol,\nit's an application layer protocol and\n\n574\n00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.260\nbasically what it does is it\ndescribes how to stream the media.\n\n575\n00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.450\nAnd it does work in combination,\nor in conjunction,\n\n576\n00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.640\nwith the Session Initiation Protocol.\n\n577\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.880\nPlease do keep that in mind and\nthese other protocols.\n\n578\n00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.900\nSo they're all really working together.\n\n579\n00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.580\nAnd then we have SIP,\nthe Session Initiation Protocol.\n\n580\n00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.860\nAnd with the Session Initiation Protocol,\n\n581\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.740\nwe use this a lot in Voice\nover IP communications.\n\n582\n00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.410\nAlso in application layer protocol\nas well and what it does it creates,\n\n583\n00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.940\nit controls, it maintains and\nit terminates or\n\n584\n00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.960\nmodifies at any time the media that's\nstreaming over a session over the network.\n\n585\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.780\nThe last two work together as well.\n\n586\n00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.280\nIn fact, like I said, all of them really\nwork together but the last two are really\n\n587\n00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.840\nclose cousins, in fact you'll find that\nthey both have the same RFC, because\n\n588\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:39.030\nthe control protocols also\nmentioned as an attribute of RTP,\n\n589\n00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.200\nthe Real-Time Transfer Protocol.\n\n590\n00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.585\nBe careful with that one because I\nmade the mistake of always calling it\n\n591\n00:30:45.585 --> 00:30:47.885\nReal-Time Protocol because it's RTP.\n\n592\n00:30:47.885 --> 00:30:48.810\nReal-Time is one word.\n\n593\n00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.260\nIt's real time transport protocol.\n\n594\n00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:56.630\nThis is what's responsible believe it or\nnot for actually moving the data right.\n\n595\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:01.240\nIt's used on your IP based networks for\nyour audio and video streams.\n\n596\n00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.270\nThe control protocol again related to it\nit's a close cousin or a close sister of\n\n597\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.630\nit, it is responsible basically for\nmonitoring the state of the connection.\n\n598\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.358\nAnd basically giving you\nthe ability to monitor it, and\n\n599\n00:31:15.358 --> 00:31:19.682\nas well as if you have to\nimplement quality of service,\n\n600\n00:31:19.682 --> 00:31:24.954\nbasically just keeping an eye on\nthe real time transfer protocol.\n\n601\n00:31:24.954 --> 00:31:28.486\nLet's say let me make sure here guys\nI don't think I forgot anything.\n\n602\n00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:31.950\n&gt;&gt; So Wes if we're looking at these\nprotocols we're talking real time TCP,\n\n603\n00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.480\nUDP what are we talking about here?\n\n604\n00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.950\n&gt;&gt; What's interesting is that we're\ntransport protocol doesn't call UDP\n\n605\n00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.090\nor TCP.\n\n606\n00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.860\nIt is pretty much its\nown transport protocol.\n\n607\n00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.770\nSo it doesn't have to piggyback off of it-\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n608\n00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:49.160\n&gt;&gt; And again, it can take and it can\nencapsulate IP-based traffic itself.\n\n609\n00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.095\nSo, that's one of\nthe great things about it.\n\n610\n00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:55.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that covers it for\nunified communications.\n\n611\n00:31:55.175 --> 00:31:57.805\nFirst of all you explained\nwhat the heck it was and\n\n612\n00:31:57.805 --> 00:32:00.885\nwho or why would we wanna use it and\nhow you could you use it.\n\n613\n00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:04.655\nAnd lastly there we looked at\nthe different undermining technologies,\n\n614\n00:32:04.655 --> 00:32:06.335\nthose protocols and\nthank you for doing that today.\n\n615\n00:32:06.335 --> 00:32:07.265\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n616\n00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:09.255\n&gt;&gt; And thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n617\n00:32:09.255 --> 00:32:12.325\nStay tuned because we do have more\nnet plus heading your way but\n\n618\n00:32:12.325 --> 00:32:14.915\nthis show remember I'm your\nshow host Cherokee Boose.\n\n619\n00:32:14.915

your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.520\nIn this episode we'll be looking at\ncloud and virtualization concepts.\n\n11\n00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.340\nWith us today to help explain this\ntopic we have Mr. Wes Bryan himself.\n\n12\n00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.600\nThank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n13\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.960\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for\nhaving me here Cherokee.\n\n14\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.460\nThat's right.\n\n15\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.310\nWe are going to be looking at cloud and\nvirtualization.\n\n16\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.110\nI'm gonna be doing a justice\nto everybody out there,\n\n17\n00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.630\nif I don't call this clouds and\nvirtualization.\n\n18\n00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.280\nI was talking to Cherokee in naming\nthe title here, I was saying clouds and\n\n19\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.780\nvirtualization where we're gonna\nhave happy paintings, hold hands and\n\n20\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.580\nsing Kumbaya.\n\n21\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.470\nJust kidding guys but\n\n22\n00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.310\nwe are talking about pretty much where\nevery network has been going today and\n\n23\n00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.300\nwhere a lot of the resources that we see\nare moving from our on-premise location.\n\n24\n00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.780\nAnd we're using the network\ninfrastructure of another company.\n\n25\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.400\nAnd we're outsourcing that\nessentially to a third party.\n\n26\n00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.130\nBut we're also gonna talk about some\nof the virtualization concepts,\n\n27\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.260\nlike the objective states that help\nsupport our cloud infrastructure.\n\n28\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.600\nNow I wanna go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo before we dive into the cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.620\nI'd like to take a second here because in\nthe exam objectives they call out really\n\n30\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.600\njust about three things.\n\n31\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.360\nThey call out virtual switches,\nvirtual routers, and\n\n32\n00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.910\nthen virtual network adapters.\n\n33\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.700\nAnd well you could imagine\nthose were all great concepts.\n\n34\n00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.430\nFor a networking show,\nbut it really doesn't do\n\n35\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.710\nyou any good if you don't understand\nwhat virtualization is in the outside.\n\n36\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.880\nSo we're gonna take a little bit\nof time they don't really call\n\n37\n00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.590\nout understanding the virtualized\nconcepts like the hosts and stuff.\n\n38\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.040\nThey do for sure in A Plus, they want you\nto understand a little bit about that.\n\n39\n00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.910\nBut we wanna set the stage, so\n\n40\n00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.030\nif this is the first time you've\never heard of the Virtual Router is,\n\n41\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.670\nyou at least know you have some\nkind of basis or standpoint here.\n\n42\n00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.820\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n43\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.450\nThis is more of like an abstract\narchitecture when it comes to operating\n\n44\n00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270\nsystems on how they work.\n\n45\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.850\nYou could argue the fact that I could\nput a couple of more layers and\n\n46\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.338\nhere if I really want like at the top.\n\n47\n00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:07.220\nI could put the user and\n\n48\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.540\nthat's the abstract user layer that\nthey interact with applications.\n\n49\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.230\nThat interacts with\nthe operating system and\n\n50\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.880\nthe hardware we can even put\nfirmware in here if we want.\n\n51\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.320\nBut these are at least the three\ncommon layers of any computing system.\n\n52\n00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.380\nWe have hardware,\nwithout an operating system to tell\n\n53\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.630\nthat hardware what to do it's\nbasically an overpriced paper weight.\n\n54\n00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.260\nBut then once we install\nan operating system\n\n55\n00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.180\nwhich gives us access to control our\nhardware and utilize the resources in it.\n\n56\n00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.310\nThen we install our applications\non top of our operating system and\n\n57\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.110\nthat's what you and\nI as end users that's what we work with.\n\n58\n00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.480\nWe work with the applications that talk\nto the operating system which then\n\n59\n00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.640\nin turn talks to the hardware.\n\n60\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.730\nNow, one of the things that\nyou'll start to see is\n\n61\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.410\nthat computers have a lot\nof resources in them today.\n\n62\n00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.165\nTen years ago, five years ago,\n\n63\n00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.155\nten years, 15 years ago they didn't\nhave as much resources as they do today.\n\n64\n00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.905\nLike for instance hard drive spaces\nbecoming a little bit cheaper so\n\n65\n00:03:05.905 --> 00:03:06.905\nyou get a lot of it.\n\n66\n00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:10.915\nRAM is becoming a little bit more cheaper\nso you have systems it's not uncommon to\n\n67\n00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:16.010\nsee systems with sometimes a minimum of 16\ngigs of RAM in them all the way up to 64.\n\n68\n00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.050\nI know we got a server sitting over\nin the closet there that we use for\n\n69\n00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.940\nvirtualization that's got\n64 gigs of RAM in it.\n\n70\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.810\nWell, if I didn't have virtualization and\nI installed an operating system,\n\n71\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.170\nlet's say on one of these\nsystems that has 64 gigs.\n\n72\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.840\nWell now I've got a single\noperating system and\n\n73\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.900\nin this case three applications\nthat get to utilize 64 gigs of RAM.\n\n74\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.420\nWell there is a little bit\nof a problem with that and\n\n75\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.980\nthat's the fact that it doesn't\nutilize the resources that you\n\n76\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.210\nhave inside of your\nsystem very efficiently.\n\n77\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.590\nAnd what I mean by that is let's say that\nthese applications use a whopping two\n\n78\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.040\ngigs total of your RAM.\n\n79\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.080\nYour operating system, 64 bit operating\nsystems can typically run anywhere\n\n80\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.520\nfrom 800 Megs on up to two and\na half gigs, you know that they consume.\n\n81\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.700\nSo let's just say three gigs for\nthe operating system,\n\n82\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.360\nworst case scenario we say two gigs for\nthe applications.\n\n83\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.490\nNow we've got five gigs.\n\n84\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.340\nSee the problem is I still have\n\n85\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.650\n59 gigs of RAM that are sitting\nthere doing absolutely nothing.\n\n86\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.224\nAnd with the fact that I could\nhave octa processors today.\n\n87\n00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:23.424\nWe have quad-cores, we have\nthe hexa-cores and octa-cores today.\n\n88\n00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:26.194\nI know they have something out\nthere that are 12 cores, and\n\n89\n00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:29.420\nIntel right now is working\non one with 16 cores.\n\n90\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.930\nThat's a lot of CPU space that\npotentially just sits there idle and\n\n91\n00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.830\ndoesn't really even get used.\n\n92\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.060\nIn fact, let me show you what I mean here.\n\n93\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.630\nLet me go ahead and\nin fact I'm logged into a server here.\n\n94\n00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.260\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n95\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.070\nIf I bring up my Task Manager, this\nsystem only has eight gigs of RAM, and\n\n96\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.350\nit doesn't have a lot by comparison.\n\n97\n00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.740\nI have two machines, and we'll talk\nabout what this means here in a second.\n\n98\n00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.170\nTwo machines running and\nI want you to see I've eight gigs of RAM,\n\n99\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.750\nwith two virtual machines running,\nand the host operating system.\n\n100\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.880\nI'm using barely half of the memory.\n\n101\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.180\nSo what happens to the other four gigs?\n\n102\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.690\nIt just sits there idly.\n\n103\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.450\nSo virtualization at the very basis,\ngives us away to\n\n104\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.480\nutilize the resources that we have on our\nhardware, a little bit more efficiently.\n\n105\n00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.730\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and in a business environment\nand if look from a business perspective\n\n106\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.500\nif I look at that statistic,\n48%, so I have 52% waste.\n\n107\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.880\nWes was that what you tried to tell me.\n\n108\n00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.530\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and\nwhat does it do we can't use it.\n\n109\n00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.683\nAnd that's where virtualization comes in.\n\n110\n00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:35.422\nIn fact, if I turn these machines off that\nare actually running we're putting what\n\n111\n00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:38.346\nwould I say the carriage\nin front of the horse here.\n\n112\n00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:41.906\nBut if I turned these virtual machines off\nI'm actually probably gonna be running\n\n113\n00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:43.000\neven less than two gigs.\n\n114\n00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.940\nSo now I've got six gigs\njust sitting there idly.\n\n115\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.245\nJust standing by.\n\n116\n00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:50.030\n8% of my quad core processor.\n\n117\n00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.710\nNow there's nothing really\ncrazy about this processor,\n\n118\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.580\nI think it's an i5 quad-core\nIntel-based processor.\n\n119\n00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.260\nBut look, it's using 4% utilization.\n\n120\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.380\nSo is there a technology, and I've already\ntold you but is there a technology that\n\n121\n00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.370\nallows us to utilize these resources and\nallocate them a little bit better?\n\n122\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.590\nSo that we're not only using\nthem more efficiently,\n\n123\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.180\nthey're not just sitting idly by and\nwe're waiting for a hardware failure.\n\n124\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.960\nSo we don't use it we wait for\nit to fail and we replace it.\n\n125\n00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.510\nWell that doesn't really make sense.\n\n126\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.880\nSo this normal computing\nfind out where we are here.\n\n127\n00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.400\nThis normal computing model here\ndoes tend to leave a lot of waste.\n\n128\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.170\nAnd that's where we\nbring in virtualization.\n\n129\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.500\nThe main technology I wanna talk about\nin virtualization is something known as\n\n130\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.850\na hypervisor.\n\n131\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.450\nNow a hyper visor it's kind of\na legal not illegal, a legal hack.\n\n132\n00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.610\nIt's essentially really if\nyou look at the basis of it,\n\n133\n00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.570\nit's nothing more than a root kit.\n\n134\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.650\nBecause what is it doing?\n\n135\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.860\nWell the hypervisor actually sits\nin this case in a type one and\n\n136\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.030\nwe will compare the difference\nhere in a second.\n\n137\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.680\nA type one hypervisor is a technology\nthat runs right on top of your hardware.\n\n138\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.230\nAll right.\n\n139\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.330\nAnd then from there what happens is\nyou install your operating system\n\n140\n00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.290\non top of the hypervisor.\n\n141\n00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.860\nNow what does that mean for us?\n\n142\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.830\nAll right.\nWell when I,\n\n143\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.340\nyou notice we have a series of Apps,\nI got two operating systems here now that\n\n144\n00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.270\nare running in their own\nisolated environment.\n\n145\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.850\nNow what that means for me is that.\n\n146\n00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.420\nI can utilize the resources\na little bit more efficiently.\n\n147\n00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:27.010\nLet's say on that 64 gigs\nof RAM based machine.\n\n148\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.470\nSo for instance I have two\nisolated machines here.\n\n149\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.750\nNow when I say virtual machines.\n\n150\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.309\nI do want you to understand that this is\nan operating system no different than what\n\n151\n00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:39.673\nyou've seen in fact on my\ncomputer that we just showed you.\n\n152\n00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:45.220\nIt allows me to run this logical\ninstance of a software based machine\n\n153\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.981\non top of the hypervisor that I can\nthen provided I have the resources.\n\n154\n00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:55.650\nI can create additional machines\nallocating them to resources as I see fit.\n\n155\n00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.085\n&gt;&gt; Okay Wes, so what you're telling me,\nif I was your boss and\n\n156\n00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:02.411\nlooking at it from a business\npersons This perspective.\n\n157\n00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:07.952\nI'm saying, okay, Wes, so you've just\nnow taken advantage of that wasted space\n\n158\n00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:13.850\non the machine, and you actually have two\nmachines running in one physical box.\n\n159\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.530\nSo now I don't have to go out and\nbuy another physical machine.\n\n160\n00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.920\nI don't have to power that machine.\n\n161\n00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.660\nMachine so we're going green already.\n\n162\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.460\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n163\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.230\n&gt;&gt; And if I have an office in Manhattan\nwhat is my rent space for this office?\n\n164\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.090\nYou're telling me I can physically\nconsolidate my servers,\n\n165\n00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.590\nthat sounds like a great idea Wes.\n\n166\n00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.420\n&gt;&gt; It really is and\n\n167\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.570\nthat's one of the things I didn't even\nmention things like you say going green.\n\n168\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.350\nWhen we're bringing up servers,\nif I talk about physical machines I\n\n169\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.740\ncould have four physical devices that are\nrunning in, let's say, a server closet,\n\n170\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.720\nand each one of them are chewing\nthrough their own electrical costs.\n\n171\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.580\nBut if, like Cherokee says,\nI consolidate them and\n\n172\n00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.810\nI make them a software\ninstance of a machine, and\n\n173\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.460\nI allow them to run on more than one\nmachine on a single physical device.\n\n174\n00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.170\nNow we've consolidated\nthe electrical cost.\n\n175\n00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.130\nWe've consolidated the physical cost, and\nwe start a more economic benefit as well.\n\n176\n00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.860\nLet me show you what I mean too\nabout allocating the resource.\n\n177\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.680\nRemember we said-\n&gt;&gt; And Wes,\n\n178\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.246\nI probably got a raise as well.\n\n179\n00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:11.649\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, hopefully I did, and\n\n180\n00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:14.775\nhopefully it's not just the blood pressure\nand the cholesterol that's on the raise.\n\n181\n00:09:14.775 --> 00:09:19.620\n[LAUGH] So if we look at for\ninstance, 64 gigs of RAM here,\n\n182\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.810\nand now we allocate that.\n\n183\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.850\nAnd that's one of the good things.\n\n184\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.030\nI said allocating your\nresources as you see fit.\n\n185\n00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.360\nMaybe I've got a machine\nthat I say applications,\n\n186\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.600\nmaybe I turn these into services, right?\n\n187\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.590\nMaybe I've got one, and\nlet me get this out of here, so\n\n188\n00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.560\nit'll be easier to work with.\n\n189\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.660\nMaybe I've got a machine\nthat's running DNS.\n\n190\n00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.170\nI've got a machine that's running DHCP,\nif I can spell that acronym right.\n\n191\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.250\nAnd maybe for\ninstance I don't have another application.\n\n192\n00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:49.630\nIt's all up to me on what I choose to do,\nbut because applications like these,\n\n193\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.290\nservices that these servers provide\ndon't really take up a lot of resources,\n\n194\n00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.020\nI might very well just get away with\nsaying hey I wanna put 2 gigs right.\n\n195\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.880\nI wanna put 2 gigabytes\nof ram on this system,\n\n196\n00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.780\nbecause you know what I've looked at the\nresources, I've opened up Task Manager.\n\n197\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.600\nMaybe they're Linux machines\nI've opened up top.\n\n198\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.560\nI can see that they're not\nusing a lot of that so\n\n199\n00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.490\nwhy would I just allocate\nthat more than what's needed?\n\n200\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.892\nSo now, notice that I've got 2 gigs for\n\n201\n00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:22.208\nthis one machine, all right,\nwe take our 2 gigs.\n\n202\n00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:23.260\nwhat did we say?\n\n203\n00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.560\nWe said 3 gigs, right,\nfor our host machine,\n\n204\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.840\nthe physical machine that all\nof these are running on, right?\n\n205\n00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.160\nAnd let say we get a little\nbit more crazy, let say, for\n\n206\n00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.790\ninstance, whatever the service is that's\nrunning on this virtual machine needs\n\n207\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.920\na little bit more about\nour memory here right?\n\n208\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.200\nSo now I've got 8 gigs,\nI've got 10 gigs, all right?\n\n209\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.360\nSo from our 64, and I was gonna try\nto do some bad math here, that'll\n\n210\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.370\nbe 54 gigs that are left, and then finally\nthe last 3 for the host operating system.\n\n211\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.800\nI have only consumed by allocating it\nthis way through virtual machines 51 gigs\n\n212\n00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.620\nof my RAM.\n\n213\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.590\nNow what that does mean?\n\n214\n00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:10.050\nIt means if I have additional needs for\nadditional machines.\n\n215\n00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.430\nI still have 51 gigs that I can\nallocate to additional machines.\n\n216\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.970\nI could put a third machine potentially\non here, a third and a fourth and\n\n217\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.310\na fifth guest machine.\n\n218\n00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.490\nNow I do wanna take a second to talk\nabout that term guest machine versus\n\n219\n00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.270\nhost machine.\n\n220\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.390\nThe host machine is the physical device\nthat we could walk over to the server\n\n221\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.800\ncloset, and\nwe can press the power button on.\n\n222\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.260\nOr we could press the power\nbutton turn it off if you want.\n\n223\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.395\nProbably not a good idea,\nyou should shut down your servers.\n\n224\n00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.660\nBut that's the host machine.\n\n225\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.320\nThese virtualized instances of\noperating systems, if you will.\n\n226\n00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.400\nThese are called guest VMs or\nguest machines.\n\n227\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.060\nAll synonymous terms here.\n\n228\n00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.150\nBecause why?\n\n229\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.670\nWell, they're a guest\nrunning on top of the host.\n\n230\n00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.210\nSo please understand that.\n\n231\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.380\nOne of the last things I'd like to kinda\nexplain here what the virtualization\n\n232\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.960\ntechnology, is that this\nis a type 1 hypervisor.\n\n233\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.120\nThis is what you use in production.\n\n234\n00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.890\nYou also have what are known as type 2\nhypervisors that have their place in\n\n235\n00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:12.550\nthe industry, but they don't really have\ntheir place in a production environment,\n\n236\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.080\nand let me tell you what I mean by that.\n\n237\n00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.960\nType 2 hypervisors, they really\nare nothing more than another piece of\n\n238\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.180\nsoftware that's running side by\nside all the other applications.\n\n239\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:26.400\nAnd in fact for color coding purposes I\ncan probably move this up a little bit and\n\n240\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.750\nthen change that color to the ones\nI've used for the other applications.\n\n241\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.070\nCuz essentially,\nwhen you run a type 2 hypervisor,\n\n242\n00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.660\nnotice that I have a host operating\nsystem running on a host machine.\n\n243\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.640\nThen on top of that,\nI have my applications.\n\n244\n00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.860\nWell a type 2 hypervisor,\nsomething like VMWare,\n\n245\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.750\nthe old Virtual PC that I don't think\nis even supported anymore by Microsoft.\n\n246\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.830\nYou've got a few out there, Parallels\nis one if you're in the Mac world,\n\n247\n00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.340\nthese are all type 2 hypervisors, it's\na piece of software that you download,\n\n248\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.245\nyou install, just like you would install\nthings like Libra Office, right?\n\n249\n00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:04.650\nOpenoffice.org, the Office Suite, right?\n\n250\n00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.020\nAnd they're gonna run side by side in\ncompetition with other applications that\n\n251\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.680\nare running on this\nhost's operating system.\n\n252\n00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.660\nAnd then on top of that is where you put\nthe guest machine, now what you might\n\n253\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.090\nsee here there seems to be a lot of\ncommunication that needs to go on, right?\n\n254\n00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.004\nApplication request to resource and\n\n255\n00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:29.300\nthis aspect it has to talk to\nthe guest operating system.\n\n256\n00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:36.290\nThen the guest operating system has to in\nturn, talk if you will, to the hypervisor.\n\n257\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.900\nWhich the hypervisor then translates\nthat down to, if you can see here,\n\n258\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.360\nsomething that the host operating\nsystem can communicate with.\n\n259\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.100\nAnd then finally we get some kind of\naccess to the resources within a machine.\n\n260\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.100\nSo you can all these different\nstages that I have get through\n\n261\n00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.980\nbefore I finally get to\ninteract with the operating or\n\n262\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.860\nthe physical machine that\nall of this is running on.\n\n263\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.480\nAnd that's why this type 2 hypervisors,\nthey're not used in production.\n\n264\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.440\nThey don't give you the best benefit,\nbecause you have, for instance,\n\n265\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.580\na lot of extra communication\nthat has to go on.\n\n266\n00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.330\nType 1 hypervisors, you can see that\nthe hypervisor itself is, kinda,\n\n267\n00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.260\ninteresting, it's running right\non a bare metal installation.\n\n268\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.620\nIn fact, Microsoft does this\nwith their Hyper-V, and\n\n269\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:24.053\nwhen you turn the Hyper-V function on,\nyour Windows operating system,\n\n270\n00:14:24.053 --> 00:14:27.857\nlet's say,\nif you're running Server 2012 or 2016.\n\n271\n00:14:27.857 --> 00:14:32.598\nIt's interesting, because your server box,\nyour server operating system,\n\n272\n00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:37.548\nis then, what they do is when your machine\nreboots it actually slips the hypervisor\n\n273\n00:14:37.548 --> 00:14:39.830\nunder your server operating system.\n\n274\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.660\nNow you don't see it in your\nconsole like I'll show you, but\n\n275\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:47.420\nit's kind of interesting because now it's\nrunning just like a virtual machine for\n\n276\n00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.474\njust like side by side with\nall your other guests.\n\n277\n00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:53.890\nSo the type 1 hypervisor is where the\nperformance is going to be, and your type\n\n278\n00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.360\n1 hypervisor is going to be what you\nsee inside of a production environment.\n\n279\n00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm really glad that\nyou brought that up, Wes,\n\n280\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.090\nbecause it can be so confusing for people.\n\n281\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.606\nThey're like, wait, I have an operating\nsystem, and then I've added, or turned on,\n\n282\n00:15:05.606 --> 00:15:06.220\nthat role.\n\n283\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.013\nSo how is that not a type 2?\n\n284\n00:15:08.013 --> 00:15:11.352\nBut like you just said, and I like to\nthink of it just like it punches through\n\n285\n00:15:11.352 --> 00:15:14.300\nthat hyper visor to directly\ncommunicate with the hardware.\n\n286\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.380\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it does.\n\n287\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.363\n&gt;&gt; I mean you look at it and\nMicrosoft has like you said for\n\n288\n00:15:18.363 --> 00:15:22.808\nthe production environments, they even\ngive you the poor Hyper-V install and\n\n289\n00:15:22.808 --> 00:15:24.997\nMicrosoft recommends they said look,\n\n290\n00:15:24.997 --> 00:15:29.603\nin a production environment we don't\nreally recommend you running DNS and DHCP.\n\n291\n00:15:29.603 --> 00:15:32.431\nWe just want this to be your\nvirtualization machine and\n\n292\n00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.610\nthey give you that.\n\n293\n00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.220\nThat's actually a free version\nof the server operating system.\n\n294\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.910\nBut you do have other different versions\ndifferent ways to run it with and\n\n295\n00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.550\nin conjunction with a full\nblown operating system and\n\n296\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.130\nit still is a type 1 although\nit may not seem like it is.\n\n297\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:46.764\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it doesn't.\nAnd\n\n298\n00:15:46.764 --> 00:15:49.823\nthe first time I learned that it kind\nof impressed me cuz I'm like what\n\n299\n00:15:49.823 --> 00:15:51.002\nis it doing on the reboot.\n\n300\n00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:54.222\nUsually when you install features\nin Windows and I know this isn't\n\n301\n00:15:54.222 --> 00:15:58.030\na Microsoft Or Windows operating system\nclass usually you have to do a reboot.\n\n302\n00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.390\nSo I thought it was just no\ndifferent than any other reboot.\n\n303\n00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.130\nBut when you look at the documentation\nyou see kinda what's going on.\n\n304\n00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:08.060\nYou now realize that your server\noperating system is sitting side by side\n\n305\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.930\nat least in this abstract layers\nwith all the other guest machines.\n\n306\n00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.530\nSo let's go ahead, I tell you,\nI can show you the difference here,\n\n307\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.630\nin fact,\nlet me show you a type 1 hypervisor,\n\n308\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.150\nin fact Hyper-V is that type 1 hypervisor\nthat I was talking about here.\n\n309\n00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.030\nAnd you can see I've got\na series of virtual machines,\n\n310\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.490\nthis is my host machine that\nwe were talking about here.\n\n311\n00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.110\nThese are my guest machines, and\n\n312\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.150\nI want you to notice that I\ndo have my desktop, right?\n\n313\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:42.000\nHere's my desktop to my server, yet\nI've got access to another server here.\n\n314\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.960\nWell, what's going on?\n\n315\n00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.760\nAgain, keep in mind, I've got a physical\nmachine that's running the hypervisor,\n\n316\n00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.130\nright, and it's kinda tricky,\n\n317\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:55.050\nespecially in the Microsoft web,\nbecause here's my host operating system.\n\n318\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.160\nAnd if I wanted to,\nI could get in here, right?\n\n319\n00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.620\nI could get in here with for instance,\nI don't have Server Manager on here but\n\n320\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.870\nI could get in here, and I could work\nwith all the applications if I want.\n\n321\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:09.660\nJust like I could if I turn around, and\nI switch to the guest operating system,\n\n322\n00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.480\nnotice that to me, oops, it doesn't\nreally look much different, right.\n\n323\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.970\nThe full blown server\noperating system here as well.\n\n324\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.440\nThere we go, that's what I want.\n\n325\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.510\nAnd you can see, right here,\nthat essentially, I can run more than one\n\n326\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.960\noperating system on a single\nphysical device at any given time.\n\n327\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.180\nNow that's the type 1 hypervisor.\n\n328\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.300\nOther types of hypervisors that you have,\nthe type 2 here would be something like,\n\n329\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.310\nfor instance, our VMWare here.\n\n330\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:44.980\nSee, VMWare, you can see, and in fact,\nlet me get into applications here.\n\n331\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.234\nWhere is applications?\n\n332\n00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:52.705\nWell, these are my applications.\n\n333\n00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:54.215\nI was looking for an application.\n\n334\n00:17:54.215 --> 00:17:58.515\nAnyways, notice that I have Safari,\nMail here, Facetime, Dictionary,\n\n335\n00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:00.015\nHurupad that we do our markdown.\n\n336\n00:18:00.015 --> 00:18:02.215\nAnd notice that VMWare Fusion?\n\n337\n00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:06.175\nIt's another application sitting side by\nside with all the other applications.\n\n338\n00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:08.900\nSo when I'm launching this, right,\n\n339\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.190\nthis actually starts to get\ninto competition if you will or\n\n340\n00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.980\ncontention with other applications\nthat are running on my machine.\n\n341\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.680\nSo this is great for testing software.\n\n342\n00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.810\nAgain the type 1 hypervisor\nis what you're gonna be using\n\n343\n00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.750\nif you talk about production.\n\n344\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.490\nNow that's a little bit\nkind of sets the stage for\n\n345\n00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.230\nwhat we need to talk about as far as well\nthree topics here that they talk about.\n\n346\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.330\nVirtual switches,\nvirtual routers virtual fire walls, they\n\n347\n00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.090\ntalk about virtualized NICS and physical\nNICS and what the difference is here.\n\n348\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.400\nAll right so\nwhat are we talking about there?\n\n349\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.060\nWell let me go ahead let's get\nback into our virtual machine and\n\n350\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.590\nlet's talk about what a virtual\nnetwork adapter is first right,\n\n351\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.030\nbecause then we can talk\nabout what we attach it to.\n\n352\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:56.040\nWell if I look and\nif I right-click on my network icon and\n\n353\n00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.170\nI open it up, and I change my,\noop, you know what?\n\n354\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.520\nI think I'm on the host here,\njust give me one moment.\n\n355\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.930\nLet me exit full screen.\n\n356\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.130\nIt's one of the things\nthat's kinda interesting,\n\n357\n00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.520\nyou start getting into too many\nscreens and you can't figure out,\n\n358\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.320\nare you on the physical machine or\nare you on the virtual machine?\n\n359\n00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:18.000\nSo let me go ahead and just connect to\none here real quick change the view.\n\n360\n00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.110\nThere we go so I know that this is\na server I know this is a server operating\n\n361\n00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.700\nsystem and in fact because of the lovely\nnaming convention I can see that this is\n\n362\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.260\nthe one that I just brought online.\n\n363\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.440\n&gt;&gt; You gotta love those.\n\n364\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.120\nThink of me?\n\n365\n00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right, I don't understand\nthem for the life of me.\n\n366\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.730\nBut, anyways so if I go into for\n\n367\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:42.990\ninstance this computer,\nthis virtual machine's network interface.\n\n368\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.630\nAnd I choose Ethernet Adapter.\n\n369\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.240\nAll right, I want you to notice something.\n\n370\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.740\nI don't know if you guys can see this\nreal good, but can you see that,\n\n371\n00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.430\nMicrosoft Hyper-V Network Adapter?\n\n372\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.430\nSo, what is that?\n\n373\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.920\nWell, that isn't a physical\nnetwork adapter.\n\n374\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.090\nWhat that is, is a software defined,\nor a software based, network adapter.\n\n375\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.160\nIt's running in the virtual machine.\n\n376\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.670\nHowever, don't think\nthat there's a limitation\n\n377\n00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.600\nto a virtualized network adapter, right?\n\n378\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.410\nI can use it no different than I\nwould if I use a physical adapter.\n\n379\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.000\nIn fact, configuration's just the same,\nif I right click on it and\n\n380\n00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.800\nI choose Properties.\n\n381\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.120\nAnd I come in here, for\ninstance TCP/IPv4 properties\n\n382\n00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.980\nI can see that this one is set up to for\ninstance, DHCP.\n\n383\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.710\nRight, I can do all of my normal\nfunctionality that I would want to do\n\n384\n00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:34.550\nright inside of this machine,\nno different than the physical device.\n\n385\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.330\nNow, here's where it gets a little tricky.\n\n386\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.888\nWhat kind of communications do you\nwanna give your virtual machine?\n\n387\n00:20:42.888 --> 00:20:44.350\nWell, there's a couple of different kinds.\n\n388\n00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:50.320\nIn fact, if I go ahead and,\nlet me minimize this, we'll\n\n389\n00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.160\nget back to the Hyper-V console, here,-\n&gt;&gt; It's such a weird\n\n390\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.460\nconcept to us, it really is.\n\n391\n00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.920\nAnd sometimes people have a struggle\nwith these because it's intangible and\n\n392\n00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.780\nyou're telling me I can\ntake a physical device.\n\n393\n00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.070\nAnd well, it's not really there,\nbut it's there.\n\n394\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.460\nAnd so for you guys just kind\nof think outside the box here.\n\n395\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.380\nBecause if we're gonna, Wes is gonna\nbe showing us switches and routers.\n\n396\n00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.030\nWell, it's essentially,\nit's coding running on a hardware device.\n\n397\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.490\nSo what if we take that intelligence, that\ncoding, and put in a virtual environment?\n\n398\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:18.860\nThat's what we're talking about.\n\n399\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, software, basically\na software-defined network device.\n\n400\n00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:28.060\nThere is no physical, like you said,\nyou can't grab on to these devices.\n\n401\n00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.810\nSo if I look at what we have for\noptions, right\n\n402\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.790\nyou'll see over here that I have something\nknown as a Virtual Switch Manager, right.\n\n403\n00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.830\nAnd if I pull up\nthe Virtual Switch Manager,\n\n404\n00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:40.400\nI've got a couple of options if\nI wanna create a switch, right?\n\n405\n00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.380\nWell we've got a few.\n\n406\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.085\nIn the Microsoft round we've got internal.\n\n407\n00:21:45.085 --> 00:21:47.195\nExcuse me, External,\nInternal, and Private.\n\n408\n00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:51.845\nAll right, so if I wanna give this virtual\nmachine access to the physical network,\n\n409\n00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:56.605\nI'll create what's known as an external,\nan external switch.\n\n410\n00:21:56.605 --> 00:22:00.040\nNow, I've already got one created, and\nlet's kind of see what's going on here.\n\n411\n00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.770\nNow they call out virtual NIC\nversus a physical NIC, all right.\n\n412\n00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.940\nWhat I see in a virtual machine that\nI just showed you is the virtualized,\n\n413\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.432\nthe software representation\nof a network adapter.\n\n414\n00:22:11.432 --> 00:22:15.560\nWe configured it just the same but\neverything is running in software.\n\n415\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.950\nWell if I want to give access to the\nnetwork like any other device, I actually\n\n416\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.870\nhave to map that through the hypervisor,\nit's the hypervisor doing this,\n\n417\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.470\nto the physical network adapter\nrunning in the machine and\n\n418\n00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.620\nyou could see right here that it's\nan Intel Centrino Advanced-N.\n\n419\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.200\nSo that's the physical device.\n\n420\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.220\nAnd what it'll allow this type of network\nto do is it'll allow my VM to communicate\n\n421\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.190\nwith the rest of the network, just like\nany other physical device on my network.\n\n422\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.900\nNow, I'm not gonna create that switch,\nwell, that is created.\n\n423\n00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.130\nI'm not gonna change anything here,\n\n424\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.860\ncuz I wanna talk about a couple\nof the other ones here.\n\n425\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.430\nRight, we also have what's known as\nwell we'll go with the private one.\n\n426\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.810\nThe private one is where I\njust want VMs to communicate.\n\n427\n00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.580\nI don't want it communicating\nwith my host operating system.\n\n428\n00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.470\nAnd this is good in scenarios where maybe\nyou're running security software and\n\n429\n00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.840\nwhen I say security software you're\ntrying to test your security software.\n\n430\n00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.880\nMaybe you have a live virus that\nyou load up into this machine.\n\n431\n00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.640\nI certainly don't want it\ninfecting the host, and\n\n432\n00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.230\nI don't want it on my physical network,\nso I might give a completely\n\n433\n00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:20.710\nprivate switch here that essentially, just\nallows me to communicate between the VMs.\n\n434\n00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.560\nLast but not least we have an internal\nswitch and then the internal switch allows\n\n435\n00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.210\nthe VM's to communicate and\nas well as whatever the host is right.\n\n436\n00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.600\nIn this case my machine\nthat's running Hyper-V\n\n437\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.930\nis the one that can communicate\nwith the VMs as well.\n\n438\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.410\nLet's go ahead and see how they interact\nwith it because they also call out for\n\n439\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.220\ninstance routers right,\na virtualized router.\n\n440\n00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.930\nNow if I go to the machine\nthat I just set here.\n\n441\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.738\nI just set it to an internal\nnetwork adapter.\n\n442\n00:23:49.738 --> 00:23:53.014\nAnd let's go ahead and\ndo this, full screen.\n\n443\n00:23:53.014 --> 00:23:55.735\n&gt;&gt; One thing I wanna point out\nalso is if you are looking.\n\n444\n00:23:55.735 --> 00:23:58.838\nLooking at what was the internal switch.\n\n445\n00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:03.200\nIf you're utilizing Hyper-V, there's\nsomething called integration services.\n\n446\n00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.393\nAnd it's like an extra bundle,\na feature pack that Microsoft offers.\n\n447\n00:24:07.393 --> 00:24:12.660\nAnd you can't use that unless you're at\nleast running an internal switch there.\n\n448\n00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.934\nIt adds additional support for\nyour virtualized environment.\n\n449\n00:24:15.934 --> 00:24:18.811\nBut if you isolate it, like Wes says,\nthere's no way for it to communicate and\n\n450\n00:24:18.811 --> 00:24:20.690\nto check on those virtual machines.\n\n451\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Right so\n\n452\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:25.200\nlet's go ahead and you know what I didn't\nthink about that it's a good point.\n\n453\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.130\nMost of the hyper visor technologies\nright whether it's Hyper-V or\n\n454\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.370\nwhether it's VMWare,\nVMWare fusion type 1, type 2.\n\n455\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.140\nMost of them do have those extensions.\n\n456\n00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.940\nVMWare calls them I believe VMWare tools.\n\n457\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.000\nIntegration services is I believe\nwhat Microsoft calls them and\n\n458\n00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.430\nit just allows you to take more\nadvantage of more functionality.\n\n459\n00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.300\nSend the virtual devices functionality.\n\n460\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.560\nAnd even improve things like\nthe communications between them.\n\n461\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.700\nIncluding things like\npointer integration as well.\n\n462\n00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.210\nBut we'll go ahead and save that one for\nour virtualization course there.\n\n463\n00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.866\n&gt;&gt; Very, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So let me go ahead and\n\n464\n00:24:59.866 --> 00:25:01.660\ndo an IP config on this, and\n\n465\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:07.046\nlet's see what exactly we have going on\nwhen it comes to network communications.\n\n466\n00:25:07.046 --> 00:25:08.595\nLet's just go ahead and\n\n467\n00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:13.020\npipe this out to more real quick to\nmake it a little bit easier to see.\n\n468\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:14.271\nAll right, notice that I have a 169.254.\n\n469\n00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:19.850\nNow, we haven't got really\ninto what this address means.\n\n470\n00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.065\nBut essentially,\nif I can't talk to a DHCP server and\n\n471\n00:25:23.065 --> 00:25:27.290\nI'm set up to use DHCP, Windows falls\nback on what's known is a Pipa.\n\n472\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:31.750\nWe'll talk about that more in our IP\naddressing scheme section here cuz we\n\n473\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.960\ndefinitely gotta talk about it but\n\n474\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.740\nwe don't really want to\ngo into it too much here.\n\n475\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.790\nBut what that tells me,\n\n476\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:40.820\nis that I can't communicate with\nanybody else on this network.\n\n477\n00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.180\nUnless they also have\none of these addresses.\n\n478\n00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.296\nSo where does the router come in?\n\n479\n00:25:45.296 --> 00:25:48.191\nRight the switch confines\nme just the local network,\n\n480\n00:25:48.191 --> 00:25:49.875\nwhere does the router come in?\n\n481\n00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:54.485\nWell, let's go ahead, and let's switch\nthis network adapter that we were using.\n\n482\n00:25:55.555 --> 00:25:57.685\nRemember I did the internal one here?\n\n483\n00:25:57.685 --> 00:26:01.475\nLet's go ahead and\nswitch that in the VM settings,\n\n484\n00:26:01.475 --> 00:26:05.525\nwe'll switch it over to\nan external adapter.\n\n485\n00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:08.795\nAnd I want you to see something here,\nwhen we get back to our machine.\n\n486\n00:26:10.756 --> 00:26:17.040\nLet's see here, usually- There we go.\n\n487\n00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.390\nI was gonna say usually\nnetwork discovery kicks in.\n\n488\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.230\nAnytime you change your\nlocation of your network,\n\n489\n00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.030\nWindows has got this service called\nnetwork discovery service and\n\n490\n00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.260\nwhat it does is it's network\ndiscovery awareness.\n\n491\n00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.180\nIt says well wait a second,\nsomething's change on your network?\n\n492\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.070\nI see you're not attached\nto this network anymore.\n\n493\n00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.340\nYou are attached to this one.\n\n494\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.280\nHow do you want me to set up the firewall?\n\n495\n00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.490\nEssentially is what it's doing here.\n\n496\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.906\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and say yes,\n\n497\n00:26:40.906 --> 00:26:46.180\nyeah I'm not worried about that right\nnow cuz it's a virtualized network here.\n\n498\n00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.746\nBut let me go ahead and what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna do an ipconfig /renew.\n\n499\n00:26:51.746 --> 00:26:56.250\nWe're gonna start that door process over\nagain see if we can obtain an IP address.\n\n500\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.020\nNow when I do that I've got an IP address.\n\n501\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.860\nNotice that I'm on a 10.0.12.127,\nthat's my IP address,\n\n502\n00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.190\nso we're essentially on 10.0.0.0 network.\n\n503\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.360\nWell, let's see if I can ping something\noff of my local network, right?\n\n504\n00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.940\nThat means I have to be going through\na router in order to do that.\n\n505\n00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.810\nSo, let's see what Hyper-V is doing\nhere in the background for me.\n\n506\n00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:22.810\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and do ping,\nand let's see, little ping level\n\n507\n00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.850\nthree is DNS Servers out there and\nsee if it gives me the ability to do that.\n\n508\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.930\nWell let's wait for it hopefully it's\nrunning a little bit slow there.\n\n509\n00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:33.810\nWe'll just wait for it.\n\n510\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.730\n&gt;&gt; Hurry up and wait.\n\n511\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.570\n&gt;&gt; Hurry up and wait that's right so and\n\n512\n00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.119\nI'm getting replies it's taking a little\nbit because we're going over the network.\n\n513\n00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.690\nWow that is very slow.\n\n514\n00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:50.230\nBut notice that what I am doing is I am\ngetting replies although be it very slow.\n\n515\n00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.890\nIt is getting the replies and\nyou can see by the latency there it was\n\n516\n00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.650\nonly 23 milliseconds so this is actually\na little bit of latency on the remote\n\n517\n00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.140\ndesktop connection that I'm\nusing to connect to the server.\n\n518\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.510\nBut notice that I did get connections.\n\n519\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.560\nSo Hyper-V essentially is acting no\ndifferent than a physical router is.\n\n520\n00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.800\nIt's performing things for\nme like network address translation.\n\n521\n00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.340\nAnd it's allowing me to communicate not\njust confined to the local virtualized\n\n522\n00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:14.880\nswitch.\n\n523\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.790\nBut now you can see what I\npinged was a public IP address.\n\n524\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:20.736\nAnd again, it's actually, I believe,\n\n525\n00:28:20.736 --> 00:28:26.090\none of level three's root hit servers\nout there, so it went off of my network,\n\n526\n00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.260\nit went out to the internet, essentially\ndoing network address translation for me.\n\n527\n00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.310\nSo that's a virtualized router, and the\nfact that if you are running virtualized\n\n528\n00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:39.110\ntechnology and you need to route traffic\noff of your local network, typically\n\n529\n00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.630\nyour hyper visors have that functionality\nbuilt in, where they could do it.\n\n530\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.340\nHow it's set up and\n\n531\n00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.750\nhow it's configured is always contingent\non the product that you're using.\n\n532\n00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.650\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nthat takes care of those,\n\n533\n00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.180\nlet's look at this just a little bit more.\n\n534\n00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.830\nSo what is going on\nhere more in a diagram.\n\n535\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.870\nAll right you've seen\nthe different virtual switches.\n\n536\n00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.490\nThey run inside of our server no\ndifferent than the virtual machines do.\n\n537\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:08.910\nThe virtual machines connect to the\nvirtualized switches and depending on how\n\n538\n00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.410\nwe set it up defines whether they\njust talk to themselves, right?\n\n539\n00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.500\nOr they talk to themselves and the host.\n\n540\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.560\nOr in this case like I just show you,\nessentially you talk to the physical\n\n541\n00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.980\nnetwork just like any other device that\nI would literally plug the cable in and.\n\n542\n00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.260\nGo to town, if you will,\nworking with the network.\n\n543\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.140\nAll right, now there is one other\nthing that they call out here.\n\n544\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.550\nAnd we're not really\ngetting into fiber channel.\n\n545\n00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.470\nLet me see here, okay, here we go.\n\n546\n00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.120\nThey call out virtual firewalls.\n\n547\n00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.529\nSo what is a virtual firewall?\n\n548\n00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.790\nWell, we have virtual machines,\nwe have virtual operating systems,\n\n549\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.540\nwe've shown you virtualized NICs,\nvirtual switches and routers.\n\n550\n00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.280\nWell, we also have virtual firewalls.\n\n551\n00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.650\nAnd this is really nothing more,\n\n552\n00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.385\nanything more than the firewalls that are\nrunning on the virtual machines, right.\n\n553\n00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.005\nIf I was to get in here, let's see.\n\n554\n00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:03.655\nLet me get back into my windows virtual\nmachines and let's go ahead and\n\n555\n00:30:03.655 --> 00:30:08.757\nlet's launch up Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security there.\n\n556\n00:30:08.757 --> 00:30:11.097\nSo notice I have my firewall right here,\nall right?\n\n557\n00:30:11.097 --> 00:30:13.757\nThis is no different than the Windows\nfirewall that's running on\n\n558\n00:30:13.757 --> 00:30:17.708\na physical Windows machine that I\nhave sitting at my desk right now.\n\n559\n00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:22.628\nThe difference is, it's running in\nthe virtual machine on the host.\n\n560\n00:30:22.628 --> 00:30:25.088\nSo it's a virtualized firewall system.\n\n561\n00:30:25.088 --> 00:30:26.948\nRight?\nAnd this is all part,\n\n562\n00:30:26.948 --> 00:30:29.684\nwith these communications,\nwith these virtualized firewalls,\n\n563\n00:30:29.684 --> 00:30:34.200\nthis is all part of what is known\nas software defined networking.\n\n564\n00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.020\nWhy do we say that?\n\n565\n00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.670\nWell, again,\nwhen we say it's logical, right?\n\n566\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.110\nIt's software doing this.\n\n567\n00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.690\nThe virtualization is your software\nrepresentation of what we would\n\n568\n00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.320\nnormally think as being a physical device,\n\n569\n00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.850\nonly it's not really related\nto a physical device.\n\n570\n00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.320\nAll right, Miss Cherokee,\nI think that I've got a lot more here, but\n\n571\n00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.330\nI don't know if I could do it any justice.\n\n572\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:57.326\n&gt;&gt; That's all right, Wes, we'll break\nit up. We're gonna do a part two, so\n\n573\n00:30:57.326 --> 00:30:58.050\nstay tuned.\n\n574\n00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.630\nWe have some more\ninformation headed your way.\n\n575\n00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.910\nWe're gonna continue speaking\nabout virtualization, and\n\n576\n00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:05.450\nthen we're gonna be looking a little\nmore into cloud computing so stay tuned.\n\n577\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:07.910\nRemember I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n578\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:08.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n579\n00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.373\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n580\n00:31:13.373 --> 00:31:19.140\n[MUSIC]\n\n581\n00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.876\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.197 --> 00:00:11.878\n&gt;&gt; You're watching live ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:14.339\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.440\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600\nThis is a continuation of an episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.430\nwhere we were previously speaking about\ncloud computing and virtualization.\n\n9\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.940\nWe started to get into it and,\nwell, we simply ran out of time.\n\n10\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.260\nSo with us today, we have Mr. Wes Bryan\nin studio to help us Complete this topic.\n\n11\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.550\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for\nhaving me back here, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.970\nThat's right, we got a few topics that\nwe still have to roundup to make sure,\n\n14\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.730\nI should say loose ends, to tie up so\nthat we can make sure you are prepared for\n\n15\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.760\nthis exam.\n\n16\n00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.400\nOne of the first things that we're gonna\njump into, is we're gonna talk about\n\n17\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.770\na technology, that maybe you kinda\nheard a little bit about in A+ and\n\n18\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.440\nthen you start to hear about\nit more in NetPlus, and you'll\n\n19\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.150\nprobably also hear about it in ServerPlus\nas well, and that is a storage technology.\n\n20\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.660\nWe've been talking really just about\nthe devices themselves, what a virtual\n\n21\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.980\nmachine is, we really haven't got into\nactually the cloud bit of this either.\n\n22\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.490\nBut, we also have to talk about\nthe storage that helps us to support\n\n23\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.280\ntechnologies like this\nwhether it be virtualization.\n\n24\n00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.770\nIf it's cloud then it might be\nsomething that you're doing on premise,\n\n25\n00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.570\nbut that's something\nknown as fiber channel.\n\n26\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.390\nFiber Channel is an extremely fast,\n\n27\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.310\nextremely reliable and\nextremely expensive storage technology.\n\n28\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.700\nAnd what it uses is a series of,\nthey call it switch fabric.\n\n29\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.450\nWhen you have Fiber Channel switches,\nwhen you have things like your\n\n30\n00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.650\nhost BUS adapters, you have this\nentire almost like a dedicated\n\n31\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.390\nnetwork to just doing storage, it's\nactually called a storage area network.\n\n32\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.310\nNow, let's go ahead and\nlook at some of the components here.\n\n33\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.750\nTier and I've got a real basic Fiber\nChannel switch diagram set up, right?\n\n34\n00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.950\nFiber Channel, okay?\n\n35\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.465\nWhen you're connecting to a storage\narea network over Fiber Channel,\n\n36\n00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:07.611\nyou are not using just the traditional\nnetwork communications.\n\n37\n00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:12.353\nNow, we'll get into some things when you\ncan when it comes in the fiber channel,\n\n38\n00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:17.307\nbut for the most part if you want the true\nFiber Channel communications you're gonna\n\n39\n00:02:17.307 --> 00:02:18.840\nuse whats known as an HBA or\n\n40\n00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.680\na host bus adapter is what allows you to\ncommunicate on the Fiber Channel network.\n\n41\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.570\nIt's usually connected with very\nhigh speed fiber optic media.\n\n42\n00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.290\nYou'll have a fiber optic switch that\nallows you to communicate with the SAN.\n\n43\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.100\nAgain, the storage area network, wherever\nyour storage area network might be.\n\n44\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.330\nA lot of times when you implement\nthis kind of technology,\n\n45\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.420\nyou won't do it something\nas simple as this.\n\n46\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.940\nIt's a very simplistic diagram, however,\nI will tell you though usually what you're\n\n47\n00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.940\ngoing to see if you're going to spend\nthe money on one of these type of systems\n\n48\n00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.670\nwhich cheap systems can be 30 to\n$70 thousand to cheap systems,\n\n49\n00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.130\nand they can get into the $100\nthousands really quick.\n\n50\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.790\nAnd that's because usually\nwhen we implemented something\n\n51\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.220\nmore a little bit closer to something\nlike this where we literally have, and\n\n52\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.170\nthis is why they call it a fabric,\nwe have a connections to where you\n\n53\n00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.120\nnotice I have 1HBA, again host bus adapter\nthat is in this server right here.\n\n54\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.340\nAnd notice that it has a connection to\nthis Fiber Switch and it has a connection\n\n55\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.152\nto this Fiber Switch, and that's for what\nwe would know ultimately as redundancy.\n\n56\n00:03:26.152 --> 00:03:28.940\nI wanna make sure that if I\nhave a production machine,\n\n57\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.290\nI don't want to lose or have any down\ntime by having to replace a link.\n\n58\n00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.000\nIf one of these links fail, you'll notice\nthat I still have a redundant link that\n\n59\n00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.750\npoints me to the next Fiber Switch\nthat allows mitigate factors of SAN's.\n\n60\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.240\nFiber Channel again, very, very fast,\n\n61\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.880\nalso supports a lot of users\nover extremely long distances.\n\n62\n00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.220\nI believe it's around ten kilometers\nis what Fiber Channel supports.\n\n63\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.700\nSo, we're talking you get an extremely\nfast storage technology that,\n\n64\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.790\nwhen implemented,\n\n65\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.220\ncan give you just about the fastest speeds\nof any storage technology on the planet.\n\n66\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.900\nAnd that's in we're gonna talk\nabout not only the great distances,\n\n67\n00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.420\nI wanna talk about some of the drives,\n\n68\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.390\nwhen they talk about the things like Fiber\nChannel, we talk about host bus adaptors.\n\n69\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.590\nTypically, when you talk today about\ndrives that would be in your SAN they're\n\n70\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.820\ngoing to be something known as cereal\nattached Scuzzy Drive, SAS drives and\n\n71\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.000\nthat's a little bit different than\nfrom the earlier Scuzzy Drive,\n\n72\n00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.200\nthat we would see in the small\ncomputers systems interface essentially\n\n73\n00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.070\nwhich is what allows us to\nattach ourselves to the SAN.\n\n74\n00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.322\nThe older drives,\n\n75\n00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:38.190\nScuzzy Drive, would have been what\nis known as called Parallel SCSI.\n\n76\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.430\nAnd Parallel SCSI had its\nlimitations very expensive as well.\n\n77\n00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.390\nBut, for the most part if\nsomebody is using Parallel SCSI\n\n78\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.900\nstill in their networks today,\nthen they really need to\n\n79\n00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.870\nevaluate where they're spending their\nmoney cuz it is time to upgrade.\n\n80\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.890\nSo typically we see today,\nin these storage areas networks,\n\n81\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.660\nwe'll see things like your SAS drives.\n\n82\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.855\nYou'll also see things like storage SSA\ndrives, and some other ones out there.\n\n83\n00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:08.990\nFibre Channel also happens to be its own\nprotocol, too, and a lot of times you'll\n\n84\n00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.090\nsee something known as FC-AL, and\nthat's Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop.\n\n85\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.450\nAnd that is a dual-fiber technology,\n\n86\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.030\nagain, allowing redundancy and\nhigh-speed access to your storage arrays.\n\n87\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.880\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, by using these techniques,\nwe're not talking about,\n\n88\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.580\nI know you said it was for\nour storage, but\n\n89\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.280\nit's not like if I had a ton of videos and\nmusic files, right?\n\n90\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.771\n&gt;&gt; No, and that's a good question.\n\n91\n00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:35.256\nI want you to think of something like for\n\n92\n00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:37.650\ninstance if we're doing\nelectronic fund transfers, right?\n\n93\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.710\nIf we work for\na banking organization or we work for\n\n94\n00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.240\nour organizations doing insurance.\n\n95\n00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.800\nWe need access to where\nwe're storing information.\n\n96\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.420\nWhether it's sensitive user data,\nagain electronic fund transfers, we need\n\n97\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.620\nhigh speed access and\nagain relatively fast access,\n\n98\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.200\nand we also need that redundancy\ncuz if you think about it,\n\n99\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.420\na company that's gonna use this and\nthey're gonna spend the money on this.\n\n100\n00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.890\nStand to lose a lot of money if they\ndon't have access to their storage.\n\n101\n00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.090\nSo typically, what you're gonna see\nthis is, I say typically it's usually\n\n102\n00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.890\nfirst of all businesses that\ncan afford it just expence.\n\n103\n00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.958\n&gt;&gt; Research entities and\nlike you said financial, yeah.\n\n104\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:17.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n105\n00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.050\nAnd one of the ones I can think of\nis like for instance when you need,\n\n106\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.870\nyou do firm transfers and stuff like that.\n\n107\n00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.502\nThose are almost, almost real time\nnot real time but close to real time.\n\n108\n00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd again, we need those transactions\nthat data moving very, very fast and\n\n109\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.259\nwe can't wait on any delay.\n\n110\n00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.521\nSo, Fibre Channel is going to\nbe what you need to implement.\n\n111\n00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:39.541\nHowever, I did mention\nthat typically we're not\n\n112\n00:06:39.541 --> 00:06:43.084\nputting these over traditional networks,\n\n113\n00:06:43.084 --> 00:06:48.940\nlet me say that with a little bit of\na side note, parenthesis if you will.\n\n114\n00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.200\nWe say that, but at the same time if you\ncan't afford the expense of fiber channel,\n\n115\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.830\ncuz again these are very expensive\nnetworks, thousands and thousands of\n\n116\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.750\ndollars just in one switch alone, the\ncabling is tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n117\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.320\nAnd then, you talk about all the other\ncomponents mixed in with it.\n\n118\n00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.590\nAnd you can get it, again, like I said,\ninto the $100 of thousands really quick.\n\n119\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.630\nSo, what can you do if you\nneed to connect to a SAN,\n\n120\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.160\nbut you only have for instance,\nexisting ethernet technology.\n\n121\n00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.170\nOr existing TCP/IP based networks,\nwhich we typically have.\n\n122\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.020\nWell, I do have one alternative and\nthat's something known as iSCSI.\n\n123\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.190\niSCSI is short for Internet SCSI.\n\n124\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.900\nAgain, all it is, is a protocol\nthat allows us to use our TCP/IP\n\n125\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.720\nbased infrastructure to connect\nto the fibre channel network.\n\n126\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.600\nHowever, we also have something known\nas FCoE, and this is Fibre Channel over\n\n127\n00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.200\nEthernet, cuz keep in mind,\nfibre channel is its own protocol.\n\n128\n00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.524\nSo, if we're going to connect to it, we're\ngonna send Fiber Channel communications\n\n129\n00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:55.551\nover an ethernet based network, then we\nhave to use some kind of encapsulation,\n\n130\n00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.588\nand that's what you might here as FCoE.\n\n131\n00:07:57.588 --> 00:08:01.679\nI will tell you though, in talking to one\nof the other hosts that's worked pretty\n\n132\n00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:03.426\nextensively with these systems,\n\n133\n00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:06.031\nthey say once you have\nthe money to buy one of these.\n\n134\n00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:07.678\nTypically, that's what\nyou're gonna be running.\n\n135\n00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:11.640\nYou're gonna be running straight\nfiber channel connections.\n\n136\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.311\nYou don't really want to invest in this\ntype of technology and use something that,\n\n137\n00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:16.867\nwhile it does allow you to connect,\nit doesn't really give you the performance\n\n138\n00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:19.370\nthat the fiber channel [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Take advantage of that [inaudible].\n\n139\n00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:19.930\nExactly.\n\n140\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n141\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.750\nDoesn't really make sense to\nspend all that money, and\n\n142\n00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.550\nthen connect to it over slower means.\n\n143\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.140\nBut you do have the ability.\n\n144\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.041\nAgain, iSCSI,\nthe ability to connect with storage area\n\n145\n00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:33.220\nnetwork over a TCP IP-based\nrouted infrastructure.\n\n146\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.300\nAnd FCOE is that fiber\nchannel over ethernet.\n\n147\n00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.720\nNow, speaking of ethernet,\nwhen we look at, for instance,\n\n148\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.680\nour ethernet based networks, right?\n\n149\n00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.040\nThey have what's known as an MTU.\n\n150\n00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.990\nThat's maximum transmission unit.\n\n151\n00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.550\nAnd the maximum transmission unit,\nit's typically around 1,500 bytes.\n\n152\n00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.180\nThere are other situations where it\nmight be a little bit more than that for\n\n153\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.340\nthings like VLAN tagging.\n\n154\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.200\nBut for\nthe most part our MTUs are 1,500 bytes.\n\n155\n00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.190\nWell, when you need to\nmove traffic very fast,\n\n156\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.790\nright, and you have, for instance, a\ngigabit supported network, wouldn't it be\n\n157\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.100\nnice to move larger chunks of data\nacross your network than 1,500 bytes?\n\n158\n00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.280\nWell you can potentially if\nyou've got this set up right.\n\n159\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.575\nAnd that's,\nthere's something known as Jumbo frames.\n\n160\n00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:20.185\nAnd jumbo frames,\nthey allow you to set an MTU of 9,000.\n\n161\n00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:23.905\nSo you can see, in fact Cherokee had to\nhelp me with my math earlier on this one\n\n162\n00:09:23.905 --> 00:09:26.405\ncuz I would not have, thank you, by\nthe way, I wouldn't have got this right.\n\n163\n00:09:26.405 --> 00:09:29.045\nSo you're doing five times less work,\nI believe.\n\n164\n00:09:29.045 --> 00:09:33.425\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you've got six frames versus,\nor six to the one.\n\n165\n00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:37.650\n&gt;&gt; Right, so I essentially\nnow instead of sending 1,500,\n\n166\n00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.990\nif it's any more than that, it gets\nfragmented, or it gets split up and\n\n167\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.580\nthen we send another 1,500,\nand another 1,500.\n\n168\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.040\nNo, we just have one big package,\none big MTU, or one big frame, right?\n\n169\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:53.450\nAnd we can send 9,000 bytes across that\nwire at one time, giving you the potential\n\n170\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.140\nto speed up your devices, right,\nspeed up the performance of your network.\n\n171\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.000\nHowever, there could be a drawback.\n\n172\n00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.110\nAnd one of the drawbacks is if\nyour other devices on your network\n\n173\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.960\naren't set to jumbo frame,\nthen what they're gonna do is when they\n\n174\n00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.600\nreceive that jumbo frame they're\ngonna see that it's 9,000 bytes.\n\n175\n00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.600\nAnd they're gonna completely discard it.\n\n176\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.590\nSo you have to make sure that\nyour devices are set up.\n\n177\n00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.237\nThe other thing to keep in mind, any time\nwe talk about, for instance, we talk about\n\n178\n00:10:19.237 --> 00:10:23.688\nretransmissions, I want you to think about\nit when we talk about frame checks and\n\n179\n00:10:23.688 --> 00:10:28.098\nsequences, right, we talk about packet\nswitching via storm forward method.\n\n180\n00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:30.935\nI receive the frame, right,\nwe receive the whole frame and\n\n181\n00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:33.796\nwe look at the frame,\ncheck some sequence, we inspect it.\n\n182\n00:10:33.796 --> 00:10:36.110\nIf it's good we forward it on.\n\n183\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.590\nWell if you inspect a 9,000 byte frame and\nyou find\n\n184\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.500\nthat there's something wrong in that,\nhere's where the drawback comes back.\n\n185\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500\nYou're throwing out more data, and\n\n186\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.830\nyou have to re-transmit that\nsame large amount of data.\n\n187\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.575\nSo in that aspect, if I'm having data\ncorruption, I'm having to throw away data?\n\n188\n00:10:57.575 --> 00:10:59.890\n1,500 bytes is gonna work better,\nbecause I'm throwing away less and\n\n189\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.160\nhaving to re-transmit less.\n\n190\n00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.380\nSo there are pros and cons,\njust like with any other technology.\n\n191\n00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.060\nThis is one of them.\n\n192\n00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.330\nMake sure that your devices are set\nup to receive the jumbo frame, or\n\n193\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.820\nthey're gonna receive it and\nsay, hey, 9,000 bytes?\n\n194\n00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.200\nI've got an MTU of 1,500, I don't know\nwhat this is, and I throw it away.\n\n195\n00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.100\nAnd then you can actually see\nthe performance degrade really\n\n196\n00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.230\neasily on your network.\n\n197\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.634\nNow they also call out something else\nthat's kind of interesting that I\n\n198\n00:11:26.634 --> 00:11:27.550\nwanna talk about.\n\n199\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.140\nAnd this is something, let's see if I,\nyeah I got it in this little diagram here.\n\n200\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.140\nAnd this is something\nknown as a NAS device.\n\n201\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.080\nWe're never short of acronyms\nhere at IT Pro TV, and\n\n202\n00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.340\ncertainly not on any of the technical\nexams that we talk about.\n\n203\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.360\nSo what is a NAS, all right?\n\n204\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.084\nA NAS, if you will,\nis a network attached storage device.\n\n205\n00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:48.181\nDon't get this confused with a SAN.\n\n206\n00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:51.370\n&gt;&gt; They are so different but\nthe acronym looks so similar.\n\n207\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.196\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's a mirror image backwards, right?\n\n208\n00:11:53.196 --> 00:11:53.860\nA SAN and a NAS.\n\n209\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.580\nAnd that's funny.\n\n210\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.830\nWhen I was studying, when I first started\nas a comp T network plus student,\n\n211\n00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:58.790\nthat's the same thing I said.\n\n212\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.590\nI said, yes,\nI've got an acronym that I can remember.\n\n213\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.670\nMirror image backwards.\n\n214\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.530\nSAN NAS, and then I learned they're\ntwo completely different things, and\n\n215\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.760\nI don't know if it helped me in the end.\n\n216\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.160\nSo what do I mean?\n\n217\n00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.150\nWe are not, unlike a storage area\nnetwork where your storage area network,\n\n218\n00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.210\nit's a storage array.\n\n219\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.750\nThe storage array doesn't have\nto be in a single location.\n\n220\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.445\nIt can be spread out all\nover your network, right?\n\n221\n00:12:19.445 --> 00:12:22.605\nThat's why they call it\na storage area network.\n\n222\n00:12:22.605 --> 00:12:26.255\nThe whole thing could be just\nnetworked all over the place.\n\n223\n00:12:26.255 --> 00:12:28.290\nA NAS on the other hand, right?\n\n224\n00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.385\nNetwork-attached storage.\n\n225\n00:12:30.385 --> 00:12:32.609\nNotice I have a file server\nup here on my network?\n\n226\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.350\nWhat's the difference between that and\na NAS?\n\n227\n00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.570\nNot much.\n\n228\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.010\nA NAS really is nothing more\nthan another device that we use,\n\n229\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.870\nkind of like a file server on our network.\n\n230\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.670\nHowever, here is where the file server and\nthe NAS differ a little bit, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.440\nA file server's running an operating\nsystem that's also doing\n\n232\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.060\nother things, right?\n\n233\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.170\nIt's allocating memory for\nprocesses in the background.\n\n234\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.920\nRight?\nIt's running an operating system.\n\n235\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.560\nA NAS while running an operating system\nis usually real stripped down version\n\n236\n00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.160\nof an operating system just giving\nyou the essential functionalities for\n\n237\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.610\nhigh speed data transfer and\naccess, right?\n\n238\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.970\nSo, it is nothing more really than\na high performance, if you will,\n\n239\n00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.540\nfile server on your network.\n\n240\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.120\nIt has drive bays in it,\nit has a small footprint operating system,\n\n241\n00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.090\nhighly optimized for\nfile storage and transfer, all right?\n\n242\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.750\nSo, that's what a network\nattached storage device is.\n\n243\n00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.300\nNotice that on here what we have\n\n244\n00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.870\nare protocols that\nare different than FCOE, right?\n\n245\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.960\nWe talked about\nFiber Channel Over Ethernet.\n\n246\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.070\niSCSI, I'm still connecting to the SAN.\n\n247\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.140\nIf it's FCAL,\nfiber channel arbitrated loop,\n\n248\n00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.790\nI'm still connecting back\nto the fiber channel.\n\n249\n00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.710\nNotice what we're doing here,\nwe're using the same kind of protocols\n\n250\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.190\nthat we would use in a network\nif we had a file server here.\n\n251\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.220\nNow, I have some vendor specific\nprotocols here, like Samba, right.\n\n252\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:57.150\nOr SMB, SMB's in Windows,\nSamba is the Unix or Linux version of SMB.\n\n253\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.970\nRight, we have things like NFS which\nis a network, or an open standard, for\n\n254\n00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.650\nsharing files across the network.\n\n255\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.240\nAnd then we also have Apple's\nimplementation of NFS,\n\n256\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.140\nwhich is the Apple file system, their AFS.\n\n257\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.880\nSo notice that you're using some of the\nsame protocols that you would see on your\n\n258\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.430\nservers, right,\nversus something like fiber channel,\n\n259\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.510\nwhich is using a whole set of its own\ndedicated protocols to communicate.\n\n260\n00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Really granular levels for\nthat storage.\n\n261\n00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.470\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n262\n00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.740\nSo they are two different languages and\nI do want you to keep that in mind.\n\n263\n00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.240\n&gt;&gt; So looking at those particular devices,\nlike if you were to go online and\n\n264\n00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.220\ntry to buy a NAS for\nyour home or business.\n\n265\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.570\nA lot of them you're even seeing have\na secondary feature where they have like\n\n266\n00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.300\nWestern Digital and I think Buffalo and\na lot of the name brands out there.\n\n267\n00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.390\nThey have an integrated,\n\n268\n00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.340\nthey'll give you access to some\ncloud storage as well as a plan B.\n\n269\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.930\nAnd that's perfect because it\nbrings us into the next topic.\n\n270\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.680\nSo what are we gonna look at first here,\nWes,\n\n271\n00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.270\nwhen we're talking about cloud storage?\n\n272\n00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:55.340\n&gt;&gt; That is a great segue in there,\nbecause I've actually got my ASUS\n\n273\n00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.510\nrouter that I got in my home network,\ndoes that same thing.\n\n274\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.850\nIn fact, I just set it up two weeks ago.\n\n275\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.470\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n276\n00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.400\n&gt;&gt; I've had it for a while, but I'm like\nthe cloud, I'm gonna be the one that sits\n\n277\n00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.140\nhere and resists, I don't want\nanybody else having access to my data.\n\n278\n00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:06.920\n&gt;&gt; Resistance is futile.\n\n279\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.380\n&gt;&gt; And now the resistance is futile.\n\n280\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.130\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the cloud.\n\n281\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.620\nSo we talk about the cloud,\nright, well what is the cloud?\n\n282\n00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.530\nThe cloud is really basically\n\n283\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.315\nanother provider has a service\nthat they want to offer you.\n\n284\n00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:25.200\nNow they mentioned some different\ntypes here, the first one is IaaS, and\n\n285\n00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.340\nlet me see if I can find that.\n\n286\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.250\nThere we go.\n\n287\n00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.488\nThat is something known as\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n288\n00:15:30.488 --> 00:15:34.555\nAnd when we say in the cloud, I'm not\ntalking about stuck up here in the glow,\n\n289\n00:15:34.555 --> 00:15:37.371\nI mean that it could be\nanywhere across the internet,\n\n290\n00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.264\ndepending on where the company is.\n\n291\n00:15:39.264 --> 00:15:41.660\nLike for instance, Amazon, Microsoft.\n\n292\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.790\nAmazon has their AWS, Amazon Web Services.\n\n293\n00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.360\nWe have things like\nAzure has their platform\n\n294\n00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.300\nthat is infrastructure as a service.\n\n295\n00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.880\nSo what do we mean when we say\ninfrastructure as a service?\n\n296\n00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.045\nI want you to think about things\nlike your computer, your resources.\n\n297\n00:15:55.045 --> 00:15:56.870\nRemember when we said virtualization?\n\n298\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:02.046\nVirtualization allows us the ability to\nallocate the resources more efficiently.\n\n299\n00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:05.266\nImagine if I have 4,000 servers back here,\n\n300\n00:16:05.266 --> 00:16:09.680\nimagine if I have 10,000 servers,\n100,00 servers.\n\n301\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.955\nI've got a lot of resources.\n\n302\n00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:14.200\nAnd chances are,\nI can allocate that to you as a service.\n\n303\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.340\nAnd since you don't have all of\nthose servers, I'll go ahead and\n\n304\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:23.860\nI'll rent you some computing resources\nfrom my server for a price, right?\n\n305\n00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.340\nInfrastructure as a Service, things like,\nnot only computational power.\n\n306\n00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.500\nLet's give you exact, what do I\nmean by compute, computing power?\n\n307\n00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.540\nI want you to think about this,\n\n308\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.780\nyou're a business, you got a website\ngoing, majority of the year,\n\n309\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.470\nyour business is mediocre, maybe you\nwanna get a little more business.\n\n310\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.130\nBut boy, let me tell you,\nBlack Friday comes and\n\n311\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.710\nyou go from 1,000 customers to\n100,000 customers in a night.\n\n312\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.050\nAre you ready?\n\n313\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.760\nAre you prepared for that?\n\n314\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.705\nIs your IT staff prepared to support\nthat kind of in-fluctuation or\n\n315\n00:16:55.705 --> 00:16:57.027\ninflation of volume?\n\n316\n00:16:57.027 --> 00:16:59.603\n&gt;&gt; Well, that term that they use a lot\nof times, you'll see it quite often,\n\n317\n00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:00.880\nit's called elasticity.\n\n318\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.300\nIt gives you elastic provisioning\nhere to give the appearance of\n\n319\n00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.430\nhaving all that extra hardware on-site,\neven if your business is only seasonal.\n\n320\n00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.630\n&gt;&gt; That's right, the elastic compute\nmeans the ability to grow and\n\n321\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.770\nreduce the growth of your network\nat a moment's notice, right?\n\n322\n00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.680\nBecause I want you to think about that,\n\n323\n00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.740\nnot only can we do what's\nknow as scaling-out.\n\n324\n00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.300\nI don't have enough resources in one\nserver, I'm gonna add another server and\n\n325\n00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.390\nanother server, until finally,\n\n326\n00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.190\nwe've got enough servers that we can\nhandle the rush of Black Friday.\n\n327\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.150\nBut it cost me a lot of money,\njust for that one day, right?\n\n328\n00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.910\nThey're charging me, it's a service,\ncosts me a lot of money.\n\n329\n00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.131\nBut I don't need those servers after\nBlack Friday, the next Friday.\n\n330\n00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:42.450\nI don't know, is that green Friday?\n\n331\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.141\nMaybe it's a green Friday, right?\n\n332\n00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Cyber Monday.\n\n333\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.457\n&gt;&gt; Cyber Monday, [LAUGH] yeah,\n\n334\n00:17:45.457 --> 00:17:48.830\nwe won't get into that one there or it's\ngonna be a whole nother analogy, right?\n\n335\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.106\n[LAUGH] So next Friday comes along and\nI don't need all those resources,\n\n336\n00:17:52.106 --> 00:17:54.170\nshould I continue to pay for them?\n\n337\n00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.750\nWell, like Cherokee said,\nthat's the elasticity part, right?\n\n338\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.665\nBut keep in mind, it's not just\ngrowing to suit the immediate needs,\n\n339\n00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:06.933\nit's also the ability to reduce when\nyou don't need that many resources.\n\n340\n00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:10.669\nSo you get that, things like memory,\nthings like storage,\n\n341\n00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:13.760\nmaybe some of you guys\nare already using storage.\n\n342\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.773\nHow many of you guys out there right now\nmaybe using Dropbox, maybe using OneDrive?\n\n343\n00:18:18.773 --> 00:18:20.455\nWe're kind of all over the place,\n\n344\n00:18:20.455 --> 00:18:23.653\nwe could raise our hands here on\nboth of those occasions, right?\n\n345\n00:18:23.653 --> 00:18:28.110\nI don't have those hard drives sitting\nbehind me in the server closet, right?\n\n346\n00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.889\nThat is on somebody else's network, who\nknows where, and that's the beauty of it,\n\n347\n00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:35.052\nI don't need to know where it is,\njust as long as I can gain access to it.\n\n348\n00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:38.563\nAnd you've got some kind of Service Level\nAgreement that says, if you don't give me\n\n349\n00:18:38.563 --> 00:18:41.341\naccess to it, you're at least gonna\ngive me some of my money back.\n\n350\n00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:44.470\nNow, that's all up to the Service\nLevel Agreement, but either way.\n\n351\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.650\nThings like operating systems, things\nlike your network communications, right?\n\n352\n00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.250\nThings like your operating systems and\nservers,\n\n353\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.610\nthink about spinning up a VM, right?\n\n354\n00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.910\nI need to support my\nbusiness on Black Friday.\n\n355\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.880\nWell, I'm gonna need a virtualized server\nin a virtualized operating system to\n\n356\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.210\nspin up.\n\n357\n00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.096\nAnd I say spin up,\nthink about bringing the server online,\n\n358\n00:19:04.096 --> 00:19:08.096\ninstalling the operating system, and\ngetting it configured with Apache or IIS.\n\n359\n00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:12.110\nIt would probably be Apache, but\none of the web servers, right?\n\n360\n00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.400\nSo you also have the operating system and\nthe servers that can go along with it.\n\n361\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.780\nNow they call that a couple\nof different kinds.\n\n362\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.650\nI wanna go ahead and\nmake mention of these.\n\n363\n00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.760\nPrivate, what does that mean?\n\n364\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:29.050\nWell, private IaaS, if I can get that\nright, that means you control everything.\n\n365\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.250\nTypically, what that\nmeans is it's on-premise,\n\n366\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:37.160\nthat's your own private Infrastructure as\na Service, and you manage and maintain it.\n\n367\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.360\nThere's also community\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n368\n00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.620\nAnd this is sometimes when you have\nmore than one entity, more than one\n\n369\n00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.120\norganization, and they have portions\nof it that they've brought online, and\n\n370\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.630\nanother company has a portion of it\nthat they've brought online, and\n\n371\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.520\nthey both leverage that system together.\n\n372\n00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.660\nIt's not available to everybody, right?\n\n373\n00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.730\nIt's not completely closed off\nto a single company, right?\n\n374\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.812\nPublic IaaS versus a private\nInfrastructure as a Service,\n\n375\n00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:09.312\nversus one that more than one\ncompany uses is called a community.\n\n376\n00:20:09.312 --> 00:20:13.372\nAnd the same thing goes with the other\ncouple of types that we're gonna look\n\n377\n00:20:13.372 --> 00:20:13.895\nat here.\n\n378\n00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:17.720\n&gt;&gt; So we've got a couple different options\nthere for that one particular IaaS.\n\n379\n00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.260\nAnd if you look at this list, Wes-\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot.\n\n380\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.628\n&gt;&gt; In addition to the software,\nI see a lot of hardware components here.\n\n381\n00:20:23.628 --> 00:20:28.020\nAnd sometimes I've even heard people\nsay HaaS, as Hardware as a Service.\n\n382\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:33.130\nThat's how I always remembered it, in your\ninfrastructure you need everything here,\n\n383\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.970\nso this is probably gonna\nbe pretty expensive.\n\n384\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.730\n&gt;&gt; It can get expensive, and that's\nwhere they'll say elastic compute or\n\n385\n00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.990\nthey say computational power, right?\n\n386\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.840\nThat's your CPU,\nthat's your RAM if you need it,\n\n387\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.000\nif you need more RAM,\nif you need additional CPUs.\n\n388\n00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.340\nSo if you need additional hardware,\nthat's what they mean when they say\n\n389\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.840\nyou have your Compute as a Service,\nit's your computing power, right?\n\n390\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.680\nNow rather than having to have that\nserver in the server closet that's got 64\n\n391\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:06.060\nprocessors, it's got 128 gigs of RAM,\nand every time we turn it on or\n\n392\n00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.150\nreboot it the lights dim\nthree blocks over, right?\n\n393\n00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.323\nNow, we've got all of that up\nin the cloud and as we need it,\n\n394\n00:21:12.323 --> 00:21:16.577\nwe can purchase it more in a channelized\nor modular sense and if I don't need it,\n\n395\n00:21:16.577 --> 00:21:18.882\nI can also reduce that\nservice at any time.\n\n396\n00:21:18.882 --> 00:21:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n397\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.630\n&gt;&gt; Now the next thing that we have is\nwhat is known as Platform as a Service.\n\n398\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:24.957\nNow Platform as a Service,\n\n399\n00:21:24.957 --> 00:21:28.143\nI want you to think more development\nthan anything else, right?\n\n400\n00:21:28.143 --> 00:21:30.532\nAnd, guys, when I say development, for\n\n401\n00:21:30.532 --> 00:21:35.243\nthose of you that maybe are watching out\nhere that understand things like Python,\n\n402\n00:21:35.243 --> 00:21:38.127\nJava, C, C++,\nI can spell those on a good day.\n\n403\n00:21:38.127 --> 00:21:41.922\nI know absolutely nothing about PHP\nother than how to spell the acronym, so\n\n404\n00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:44.705\nbear with me on this one,\nit's for you guys out there.\n\n405\n00:21:44.705 --> 00:21:46.965\nBut that's, for instance,\nyour runtime environment,\n\n406\n00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:51.545\nmaybe you are a developer and\nyou have a development\n\n407\n00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:55.500\nruntime environment that is specific to\nwhatever it is that you're coding, right?\n\n408\n00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.705\nWell, you could use the resources,\non a local sense,\n\n409\n00:21:59.705 --> 00:22:03.230\non-premise, but it takes a while to\nget that environment configured,\n\n410\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.910\nto bring it online,\nto make sure that it's stable.\n\n411\n00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.140\nOr I could let somebody else do it.\n\n412\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.310\nJust say hey, you know what, you go ahead\nand you give me the runtime environment.\n\n413\n00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.109\nAnd then I'll just port my code into the\nruntime environment that you've already\n\n414\n00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:17.200\ngot so I can work with and\nI can develop it, but\n\n415\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.024\nI didn't have to worry about\ncreating the environment too.\n\n416\n00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:23.189\nSame thing too, the infrastructure to\nsupport the computational resources\n\n417\n00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:24.175\nthat you need, right?\n\n418\n00:22:24.175 --> 00:22:26.831\nIf we're gonna be running code,\nif we're gonna be developing,\n\n419\n00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:30.138\nwe need some kinda computing resources\nin order to perform that functionality.\n\n420\n00:22:30.138 --> 00:22:33.956\nAnd it gives us the ability to do things\nlike application development and testing.\n\n421\n00:22:33.956 --> 00:22:37.726\nAnd you can see some of the examples,\nright?\n\n422\n00:22:37.726 --> 00:22:41.534\nThe development teams, they can work\non a common program language on top of\n\n423\n00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:44.020\nan environment that\nsomebody else has created.\n\n424\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.275\nSo that's your Platform as a Service,\nthink about your runtime environment for\n\n425\n00:22:48.275 --> 00:22:49.788\ndeveloping apps and stuff.\n\n426\n00:22:49.788 --> 00:22:53.795\nAnd that brings us really to, let me just\nlook over here, yeah, that brings us\n\n427\n00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:57.700\nreally to one of the last ones,\nprobably one of the most common ones.\n\n428\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.026\nAnd I would almost venture\nto say that a lot of people,\n\n429\n00:23:00.026 --> 00:23:03.610\nmaybe if you're watching right now,\nare using this and didn't even realize it.\n\n430\n00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.729\nAnd that's something known\nas Software as a Service.\n\n431\n00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:10.386\nOkay, Software as a Service essentially\ngives you the infrastructure to support\n\n432\n00:23:10.386 --> 00:23:13.407\nan application, only you don't\nhave to support the application,\n\n433\n00:23:13.407 --> 00:23:14.840\nyou let somebody else.\n\n434\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.689\nGives you the infrastructure and support,\nand essentially somebody is running\n\n435\n00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:24.463\nthe applications on their network and\nallowing you to connect, a lot of times,\n\n436\n00:23:24.463 --> 00:23:27.689\nthrough nothing more than a web browser,\nall right?\n\n437\n00:23:27.689 --> 00:23:31.600\nAgain, why would we use web\nbrowsers to use this stuff?\n\n438\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.490\nWell, think about the commonality\nof a web browser,\n\n439\n00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.190\njust about every operating\nsystem has a web browser.\n\n440\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:40.263\nAnd if I could use that to connect to\nthe Internet and connect to things like\n\n441\n00:23:40.263 --> 00:23:45.063\nGoogle Docs, connect to things like Office\n365 Online, then I can run their online\n\n442\n00:23:45.063 --> 00:23:48.830\napplications and I don't have to\nadminister to the applications.\n\n443\n00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.222\nAll I need to know is that my web\nbrowser has access to that interface,\n\n444\n00:23:53.222 --> 00:23:58.098\nand then from there we can work through\nany of the applications that we need.\n\n445\n00:23:58.098 --> 00:24:01.120\nNow with a hybrid model,\nI do wanna make one more mention.\n\n446\n00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.125\nAnd I don't know if I\nhave the hybrid here.\n\n447\n00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:04.949\nYeah, there we go.\n\n448\n00:24:04.949 --> 00:24:07.071\nThere are hybrid models, guys.\n\n449\n00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:11.728\nAnd hybrid models are a blending of\nboth on-premise and off-premise or\n\n450\n00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:16.766\non-premise, or on-premise and\nthen to cloud-based, as well as different\n\n451\n00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:21.371\ninfrastructure platform and\nsoftware as a service implementations.\n\n452\n00:24:21.371 --> 00:24:25.577\nSo for instance maybe I have Site 1 where\nI don't really have a big IT staff,\n\n453\n00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:28.686\nif anything,\nmaybe I don't even have help desk there.\n\n454\n00:24:28.686 --> 00:24:33.196\nWell, I can always use cloud-based\ntechnologies where it's\n\n455\n00:24:33.196 --> 00:24:37.700\nthe cloud provider that does\nall the tech support, right?\n\n456\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.500\nAnd I could just let my users in\nSite 1 connect to the cloud and\n\n457\n00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.990\nI don't have to worry about\nhaving people on-site and\n\n458\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.310\nan IT app trained to\nsupport the infrastructure.\n\n459\n00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:50.630\nSame thing could go with Site 3, but maybe\nwe have a main office that uses both.\n\n460\n00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.860\nMaybe they use some in the cloud,\nthey have some on-premise storage.\n\n461\n00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.490\nAnd then notice we have\na couple of other sites.\n\n462\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:00.480\nMaybe in Site 2, I do have room for\na couple of small servers and\n\n463\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.780\nmaybe a database here too.\n\n464\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.077\nSo maybe they're using local\nconnectivity and local resources.\n\n465\n00:25:06.077 --> 00:25:10.637\nSo you could see really that the hybrid\njust kind of blends both models between\n\n466\n00:25:10.637 --> 00:25:12.490\non-premise and the cloud.\n\n467\n00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.766\nSo one last little recap, just remember,\nwith a public cloud offering,\n\n468\n00:25:17.766 --> 00:25:23.057\nthat means that you are gonna be sharing\nthat resource with other people.\n\n469\n00:25:23.057 --> 00:25:25.310\nAnd now they keep separation there.\n\n470\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.200\nYou don't actually see the other people.\n\n471\n00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.910\nBut understand that it is a public offer.\n\n472\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.450\nYou are going to somebody who is also\nallowing other customers to come in and\n\n473\n00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.920\nuse their infrastructure as well.\n\n474\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.180\nIt's up to them to make sure\nthat there's no I guess,\n\n475\n00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.390\nviolation of security there or anything.\n\n476\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.830\nThe private cloud offering typically means\n\n477\n00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.840\nthat a company owns it and\nthey maintain and they control it.\n\n478\n00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.490\nStill expensive, but it's theirs, it's not\nout there to the public, it's only for\n\n479\n00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:56.680\nthat one company.\n\n480\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.940\nThen you have community cloud offerings,\nwhere it's more than one company,\n\n481\n00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.860\ntypically implementing the cloud-based\ntechnologies that both companies utilize.\n\n482\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.730\nSo for instance,\nmaybe you have a series of\n\n483\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.610\ndoctor's offices that also report to an\ninsurance company, and they work together.\n\n484\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:14.893\nWell, the insurance company\nneeds access to medical records.\n\n485\n00:26:14.893 --> 00:26:18.843\nSo if I have a community where the\ninsurance company can also access the same\n\n486\n00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:23.108\nrecords that the doctors access, now\nwe've got two organizations essentially\n\n487\n00:26:23.108 --> 00:26:26.642\nworking as a community,\nbasically utilizing the same services.\n\n488\n00:26:26.642 --> 00:26:31.190\nSo those are a little bit about\nyour different cloud offerings.\n\n489\n00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.850\nKeep in mind, none of this would be\npossible without virtualization.\n\n490\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.610\nAnd that's one of the reasons you need to\nknow a little bit about virtualization\n\n491\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.940\nwhen you plan on\nsupporting cloud concepts.\n\n492\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.615\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nsharing that with us, Wes.\n\n493\n00:26:43.615 --> 00:26:47.162\nAnd we were able to, in this episode, take\na look at the difference between storage\n\n494\n00:26:47.162 --> 00:26:51.290\narea network, remember, it's very, very\ndifferent than network attached storage.\n\n495\n00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.160\nAnd then of course,\n\n496\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.450\nall the different variations of the cloud\nofferings that Wes had mentioned.\n\n497\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.022\nSo I think that about covers it for\nthis topic.\n\n498\n00:26:59.022 --> 00:27:01.125\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n499\n00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:03.510\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n500\n00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.300\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n501\n00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.253\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n502\n00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:14.250\n[MUSIC]\n\n503\n00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.755\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:12.010\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.654\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ theories.\n\n5\n00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:15.860\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.120\nIn this episode, we're gonna be talking\nabout implementing a basic network.\n\n7\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.410\nWell, sounds pretty basic but I have\na feeling it's a little more than that.\n\n8\n00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.968\nSo with us today, we have Sir Wes Bryan\nin studio to help us with this topic.\n\n9\n00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:30.788\nThank you for joining us, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:31.657\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's awesome.\n\n11\n00:00:31.657 --> 00:00:33.632\nApparently between episodes,\nI was knighted.\n\n12\n00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:34.161\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:36.526\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's great.\n\n14\n00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.562\nYes, we are back.\n\n15\n00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:39.399\nAnd we wanna show you some of the basics.\n\n16\n00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.169\nAnd some of the considerations you have\nto look at when you are gonna implement\n\n17\n00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:44.040\na basic network.\n\n18\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840\nAnd for this objective more\nspecifically it says given\n\n19\n00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.940\na set of requirements\nimplement a basic network.\n\n20\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.660\nSo we're gonna talk about\nwhat those requirements are.\n\n21\n00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.825\nWe're gonna talk about some of the device\ntypes that you might need to implement.\n\n22\n00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.184\nIf you are gonna implement\na basic network,\n\n23\n00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:01.234\nsome of considerations behind them.\n\n24\n00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:04.677\nWe're also gonna talk about some\nof the equipment limitations and\n\n25\n00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:06.160\nenvironment limitations.\n\n26\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.606\nNow, that is an interesting thing,\nwe'll see how that goes here [LAUGH].\n\n27\n00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:13.375\nThen we're also gonna talk about things\nlike compatibility requirements.\n\n28\n00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.773\nAnd then finally last but\nnot least good old security and\n\n29\n00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:20.902\nthat's why we got Cherokee hosting,\ncuz I know you like security.\n\n30\n00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:23.014\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and let's dive in.\n\n31\n00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:25.413\nAnd I'm gonna give you a scenario here.\n\n32\n00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:28.717\nWhen we say that we're gonna give\nyou a list of requirements here,\n\n33\n00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.019\nwe're gonna talk about\nwhat we've got here.\n\n34\n00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:33.889\nI've got three scenarios,\nthree different types of networks and\n\n35\n00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.490\nlet's talk about some of the requirements\nfor them, if you had to implement them.\n\n36\n00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.540\nSo, basic network here, scenario A,\nif we could take a look at my screen here.\n\n37\n00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.982\nThis can be any old home user network, and\nagain, it's about as basic as you get.\n\n38\n00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:50.909\nMaybe a couple of computers here,\nwe got PC1, PC2, and\n\n39\n00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.239\nwhatever the computers are that\nare named on your home network,\n\n40\n00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.680\nyou can always adjust these\nto fit your scenario.\n\n41\n00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.810\nBut, when we look at it, we could have,\nin this case, I've got a local printer.\n\n42\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.700\nWell, we'll switch it up\na little bit here coming up.\n\n43\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.714\nSo we also have some Wifi/Cellular\ndevices, as well as a home router.\n\n44\n00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:14.890\nThe ISP and the good old Internet.\n\n45\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.320\nSo, when we look at,\n\n46\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.410\nwhat is required if we're gonna implement\nsome kind of network like this?\n\n47\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.219\nWell, first of all we need to consider\nwhat kind of connectivity we're\n\n48\n00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:25.923\ngonna need.\n\n49\n00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:29.435\nA lot of devices today\nrequire wireless access, so\n\n50\n00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:34.597\ntypically we have what's known as an MFD,\na multi-functioning device.\n\n51\n00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:36.335\nSo some of the requirements.\n\n52\n00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:40.350\nYou're gonna need Ethernet ports on it\nif you want wired connections, right?\n\n53\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.452\nSo most of your home routers today,\n\n54\n00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:45.759\nthey're actually doing quite\na few different things.\n\n55\n00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.188\nAnd sometimes we don't realize\nthat we overlook it, and\n\n56\n00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.840\nwe call them home routers.\n\n57\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.020\nAnd we think it's a router,\nit's doing a router.\n\n58\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.230\nLayer three at the OSI model, and\n\n59\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.030\nthen actually the fact is\nit's all over the place.\n\n60\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.240\nIf you look at it, it's working, it's\noperating at the physical level because of\n\n61\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.260\nthe fact that you\nare plugging cables into it.\n\n62\n00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.420\nIt's working at the data\nlink layer because, well,\n\n63\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.980\nthose ports on that home router\nare actually doing switching.\n\n64\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.077\nThat's your switching technology.\n\n65\n00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:13.486\nSo right there is layer two.\n\n66\n00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.574\nAnd then finally, it takes\nthe information off of your network and\n\n67\n00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.350\nthen casually dumps it\non your ISPs network.\n\n68\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.820\nNow I know that sounds bad but\nmoves it over to your ISPs network.\n\n69\n00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.963\nSo there is the routing, right.\n\n70\n00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:29.519\nWhen we talk about routing it's gonna be\nthe fact that I need to route traffic for\n\n71\n00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.103\nmy local area network\nup to another network,\n\n72\n00:03:32.103 --> 00:03:35.034\ntypically our ISP when we\ntalk about home network.\n\n73\n00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:38.743\nNow, so what do we have to consider\nhere when it comes to things like\n\n74\n00:03:38.743 --> 00:03:40.110\ncabling, right?\n\n75\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.930\nWell, I tell you what we'll go ahead and\ntalk about that a second,\n\n76\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.210\nnotice what we have in this network.\n\n77\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.660\nNow, we also have maybe another\nset of requirements here.\n\n78\n00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.670\nI've got another scenario.\n\n79\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.759\nNow, this network while basic is a little\nbit more complex than the other one.\n\n80\n00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.434\nNot much, but\n\n81\n00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:58.560\nit is a little bit more complex cuz we're\nthrowing in some additional things, right?\n\n82\n00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.002\nSo, what if you need to support things\nlike local media on a home network or\n\n83\n00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.880\neven on a small home-office-based network?\n\n84\n00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.990\nWell, then you're gonna be required\nto have some kind of media server.\n\n85\n00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.780\nAnd you have to consider, well,\nam I gonna do wireless transfer or\n\n86\n00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.890\nam I gonna do wired transfer on this,\nif you are supporting that.\n\n87\n00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.319\nAgain, we still have our PCs, but\nmaybe this time, you also have a bunch of\n\n88\n00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.423\nwireless devices, including things like\nyour laptops, your Wifi devices, tablets.\n\n89\n00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.893\nAnd you know what's interesting, Cherokee,\nI didn't even put in this list, and\n\n90\n00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.917\nI could on both networks, and\nall the networks, is IOT, right, well,\n\n91\n00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:32.375\nan explosive Internet of things.\n\n92\n00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:33.448\n&gt;&gt; Home automation.\n\n93\n00:04:33.448 --> 00:04:34.998\n&gt;&gt; Home automation, very good.\n\n94\n00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:38.169\nSolar panels, a lot of people\nare going green, have solar systems.\n\n95\n00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:45.020\nAnd you connect IOT devices to them, and\nthey can do all kinds of creative things.\n\n96\n00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.910\nOne guy that I knew, that he, basically,\ntook a Ras Pi, and he knew coding.\n\n97\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.725\nI can't spell to save my life,\nlet alone do any coding.\n\n98\n00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:58.065\nBut he understood like Python, for\ninstance, and he wrote some code that\n\n99\n00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:02.125\nbasically allow that IOT device to\ncollect all the information off of\n\n100\n00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:06.535\nhis solar system, solar panel system\nin his house and do a reverse proxy and\n\n101\n00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:11.166\nsend that information out to a server\nwere he was collecting the information.\n\n102\n00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:15.781\nSo when you travel on a road he could\nsee what the help of his solar panel\n\n103\n00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:18.100\nsystem was anywhere in the world.\n\n104\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.410\nSo we don't have to worry about anything\ncomplex like that when we talk about\n\n105\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.230\na basic network, but with IOT I have to\nmention it here that it really brings us\n\n106\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.100\nto a whole new level in things that we can\ndo in the insides of our networks, right.\n\n107\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.020\nI just basically did things, for\ninstance, maybe we need IP cams.\n\n108\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.644\nRight, if we need IP cams we have\nto figure out are they gonna be\n\n109\n00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:37.357\nwired cameras?\n\n110\n00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:38.925\nAre they gonna be wireless cameras?\n\n111\n00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:42.214\nRight, what else do we have here?\n\n112\n00:05:42.214 --> 00:05:44.410\nYeah, this time now we've got a printer.\n\n113\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.940\nBut notice that it's not a local printer.\n\n114\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.803\nNow we've got a wireless printer, right.\n\n115\n00:05:47.803 --> 00:05:51.650\nSo it's gonna have to be connected\nto the wireless network as well.\n\n116\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.578\nAnd notice we've added something else,\nwe've added a security device, right.\n\n117\n00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:59.037\nIf you're talking about a basic home\nnetwork then maybe the requirements\n\n118\n00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:02.580\nare nothing more than what we call\nlions coming out of a firewall.\n\n119\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.511\nLet's trying it again.\n\n120\n00:06:03.511 --> 00:06:06.060\n[LAUGH] And then we have what\nare known as your hostbase, or\n\n121\n00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.960\nsoftware base firewalls, right?\n\n122\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.040\nWe can essentially this software, and\n\n123\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.130\na lot of times the operating\nsystem has it built in.\n\n124\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.520\nHowever, there might be a necessity for\n\n125\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.810\nyou to have a little bit more\nsecurity on your home network.\n\n126\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.294\nSo for that what we're gonna require\nis some kind of hardware-based\n\n127\n00:06:22.294 --> 00:06:23.264\nsecurity device.\n\n128\n00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:27.230\nAnd that security device that you\nget depends on what you need.\n\n129\n00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.219\nSo, for instance, if I need to\nconnect from my home network and\n\n130\n00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.532\nI need to connect over\nthe public Internet, right,\n\n131\n00:06:34.532 --> 00:06:38.822\nand maybe I've got an office out\nhere that I need to connect to, so,\n\n132\n00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:42.618\nmaybe we've got our main office,\nor main branch, right?\n\n133\n00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:46.034\nWell, then in that case if I need\nto connect over a public network,\n\n134\n00:06:46.034 --> 00:06:48.962\nthen I'm most likely going\nback to a corporate network,\n\n135\n00:06:48.962 --> 00:06:51.966\nconnecting over a public\nnetwork to a corporate network.\n\n136\n00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:53.990\nLet me finish my train of thought there.\n\n137\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.160\nThen I'm gonna need a security device that\nmaybe implements things like VPNs, or\n\n138\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.970\nVirtual Private Networks.\n\n139\n00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.750\nWell, maybe you don't have the money\nto afford one of those fancy security\n\n140\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.290\ndevices.\n\n141\n00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.605\nNow you have to think about maybe\nthe requirement is that you're running\n\n142\n00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:08.532\nan access VPN.\n\n143\n00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:11.816\nAnd it's really nothing more than a piece\nof software that's running on one of\n\n144\n00:07:11.816 --> 00:07:13.270\nthese PCs or even your laptop.\n\n145\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.240\nSo you gotta keep that in mind too,\nif that ends up being a requirement.\n\n146\n00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.090\nNow, so far, what you're gonna\nneed regardless, what these\n\n147\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.895\ntwo different types of networks,\nis you're gonna need some kind of\n\n148\n00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:29.480\nservice-level agreements when it comes to\nconnecting to your ISP's network, right?\n\n149\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.456\nWe need the Internet service provider.\n\n150\n00:07:31.456 --> 00:07:36.070\nThat's gonna be you, talking to whoever\nyour local Internet service provider is\n\n151\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.790\nand making sure that you pay the bill,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.370\nYou gotta pay for your Internet service,\nso that is a requirement.\n\n153\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.940\nThe type of gateway devices that you get,\nagain,\n\n154\n00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.440\nit's really based on the functionality.\n\n155\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.382\nNow even though in the diagram I put\nthese out here, you very well could have\n\n156\n00:07:51.382 --> 00:07:56.264\nthat functionality built into whatever\nthe home router is that you have.\n\n157\n00:07:56.264 --> 00:08:00.113\nLargely speaking though,\nwhen we talk about VPNs keep in\n\n158\n00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:04.129\nmind that we're talking about\na business class offering.\n\n159\n00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:05.995\nAnd this doesn't really necessarily mean,\n\n160\n00:08:05.995 --> 00:08:08.264\nthat it's gonna Gonna be in\nany kind of basic network.\n\n161\n00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:09.657\nBut we do have to throw one out there.\n\n162\n00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:12.835\nBecause maybe you are somebody that\nhas not only your home network.\n\n163\n00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:15.052\nBut maybe you do some\nkind of telecommuting.\n\n164\n00:08:15.052 --> 00:08:19.836\nWhere you are doing remote work and you\nneed to have access back into the office.\n\n165\n00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:24.991\nWell then you're gonna need a device\nthat supports that VPN functionality.\n\n166\n00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:28.184\nNow another scenario that\nyou might have again you\n\n167\n00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:31.690\nmight have a requirement to\nsupport things like BYOD.\n\n168\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.960\nSo for\ninstance bring your own device networks.\n\n169\n00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.100\nIn that case I'm gonna need a wireless\nnetwork that connects to my wired network.\n\n170\n00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.307\nI could have a series of workstations.\n\n171\n00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:42.782\nNow we've gotta be careful with this one.\n\n172\n00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:45.382\nBecause ome of the things that\nyou have to consider are.\n\n173\n00:08:45.382 --> 00:08:47.512\nHow many computers, how many PCs,\n\n174\n00:08:47.512 --> 00:08:50.870\nhow many workstations am I\ngonna have on my network?\n\n175\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.890\nAt this point if I've\ngot ten then I'm at what\n\n176\n00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.640\nMicrosoft calls a maximum of a workgroup.\n\n177\n00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.210\nI can't put any more PCs,\nexcuse me, in this\n\n178\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.750\nkinda network because administratively,\nit's gonna become a nightmare to oversee.\n\n179\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.418\nSo we might have to go from then, from a\nworkgroup, a peer-to-peer implementation.\n\n180\n00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:13.990\nA requirement if we have\nmore than the allowed\n\n181\n00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.720\nclients in a workgroup, we might\nhave to go to a client-server model.\n\n182\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.870\nSo that is another thing\nthat you have to consider.\n\n183\n00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.040\nYou'll also have to commit outbound\nof your local area network so,\n\n184\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.100\nyou might have to have a router.\n\n185\n00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.630\nNow, understand that this is an expense.\n\n186\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:36.100\nSo, maybe I don't have the budget\nto support something like a router.\n\n187\n00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.745\nWell, what can we do?\n\n188\n00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:38.507\nWell, that's fine and dandy.\n\n189\n00:09:38.507 --> 00:09:42.728\nIf you can't support the individual router\nyou can always get one of these layer\n\n190\n00:09:42.728 --> 00:09:44.122\nthree switches, right.\n\n191\n00:09:44.122 --> 00:09:48.429\nAnd again, it's gonna be contingent\non how much money you have to spend.\n\n192\n00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:51.842\nIf I have a layer three switch\nthen it also supports routing.\n\n193\n00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:55.315\nIf I have a switch that doesn't\nsupport routing then well,\n\n194\n00:09:55.315 --> 00:09:57.195\nit's not gonna do me much good.\n\n195\n00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.389\nIt's not gonna get me\ncommunicating off of my network.\n\n196\n00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:00.991\nSo I will have to implement a router.\n\n197\n00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.650\nThen you could go a little\nbit further than this.\n\n198\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.060\nIf you have for instance services that you\nneed somebody to gain public access to.\n\n199\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.560\nYou have to have some kind of security\ndevice that allows you to do DMZs, right?\n\n200\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.770\nWe have our two firewalls here, public\nfacing firewall, internal facing firewall.\n\n201\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.080\nAnd then in the middle, right?\n\n202\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.020\nWe put whatever is the resource\nthat we need public access to.\n\n203\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.290\nSo, those are our list of requirements,\nright?\n\n204\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.783\nThree different scenarios\nthat you could come into.\n\n205\n00:10:28.783 --> 00:10:32.278\nKeep in mind that we don't know exactly\n[LAUGH] what's gonna be on the exam.\n\n206\n00:10:32.278 --> 00:10:35.857\nSo it is gonna be important to understand\neven the basics of what a network is going\n\n207\n00:10:35.857 --> 00:10:36.446\nto require.\n\n208\n00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:41.171\nSo let's go ahead and let's kind of\njump back through these networks.\n\n209\n00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:44.945\nAnd talk about some of the device\ntypes and some of their limitations.\n\n210\n00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:48.469\nSo when I first talked about\nthe first network, right?\n\n211\n00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:52.977\nA lot of times I want you to understand\nthat these home routers do have certain\n\n212\n00:10:52.977 --> 00:10:54.534\nequipment limitations.\n\n213\n00:10:54.534 --> 00:10:58.795\nNamely that being that they don't perform\nthings like VPN communications, right?\n\n214\n00:10:58.795 --> 00:11:02.430\nThey don't support things like L2TP,\nlayer 2 tunneling protocol, right?\n\n215\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.042\nThat's usually gonna be on a more\nexpensive gateway type router.\n\n216\n00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:10.204\nSo in that aspect you might not be able to\nuse one of your home routers to do that\n\n217\n00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:13.994\nconnection over that public network\nback in your corporate office.\n\n218\n00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:17.663\nThe other thing I want you to keep in mind\nis that when you have wired connections.\n\n219\n00:11:17.663 --> 00:11:22.457\nWell, when we have wired connections,\nthere is a considerable\n\n220\n00:11:22.457 --> 00:11:27.358\ndifference between the price in\na CAT 5e cable and a CAT 6 cable.\n\n221\n00:11:27.358 --> 00:11:30.040\nAnd even more so a CAT 6a cable.\n\n222\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.680\nSo, what do we use?\n\n223\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.000\nWell, I don't know, it depends.\n\n224\n00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.360\nHow much money do you have?\n\n225\n00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.240\nWhat are your requirements?\n\n226\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.565\nIf your requirements are to get\na good sustained gigabit speed,\n\n227\n00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:43.480\nthen 5e even though it is gigabit\nmight not be what you need.\n\n228\n00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.540\nBut then if money's your cost,\nthan 6 might not be your option.\n\n229\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.149\nHowever, there is one consideration.\n\n230\n00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:52.542\nJust keep in mind that while we're still\nusing CAT 5e and it's probably be good for\n\n231\n00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:53.560\na good long while.\n\n232\n00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.712\nIt is gonna get to a point where\nit's gonna become outdated.\n\n233\n00:11:56.712 --> 00:11:58.248\nSo when you're implementing your network.\n\n234\n00:11:58.248 --> 00:11:59.592\nDo you wanna go ahead and\n\n235\n00:11:59.592 --> 00:12:04.312\nimplement technology that maybe is already\nat half life or 75% of its life span?\n\n236\n00:12:04.312 --> 00:12:08.272\nOr do you wanna go ahead and implement\nthe technology that'll give you at least\n\n237\n00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:11.690\nfive or six years before you\nhave to think about upgrading?\n\n238\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:16.120\nAgain, based on your requirements,\nbased on your necessity and budget.\n\n239\n00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.889\nMight dictate which one of\nthose cables you choose.\n\n240\n00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:20.306\n&gt;&gt; That is such a big topic.\n\n241\n00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:23.461\nBecause knowing your customer, number one.\n\n242\n00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:27.017\nAnd when I say customer I mean\nrather if it's your employer.\n\n243\n00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:30.596\nOr if you're a contractor and they\nhave a small environment like this, or\n\n244\n00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:31.704\na large environment.\n\n245\n00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:33.704\nThey might know exactly what they want.\n\n246\n00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.571\nThey might even have this diagram and\nbring it to you.\n\n247\n00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:37.012\nDoubtfully, but possibly.\n\n248\n00:12:37.012 --> 00:12:39.951\nAnd then you have those customers who say,\nyou know what?\n\n249\n00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:42.976\nMy buddy got this really\ncool home automation system,\n\n250\n00:12:42.976 --> 00:12:45.550\nI want something a little\nbit cooler than his.\n\n251\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.620\nAnd then you gotta work it all in.\n\n252\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.360\nBut then they give you this really\nsmall budget, so number one of course,\n\n253\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.220\nis budget.\n\n254\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.606\nAnd like Wes said, if you're working\nin a business environment, and\n\n255\n00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.787\nI'm sure we'll look at that one.\n\n256\n00:12:54.787 --> 00:12:56.503\nBut you've gotta think about those things.\n\n257\n00:12:56.503 --> 00:12:58.502\nAnd also what kind of\nequipment do you already have?\n\n258\n00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:00.650\nIs it gonna be compatible so\nI can kind of save money.\n\n259\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.152\nIf I'm given a smaller budget for\ncompatibility and security, and\n\n260\n00:13:04.152 --> 00:13:06.430\nall of these individual factors.\n\n261\n00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.868\nYou can ask them these questions and\ninterrogate them.\n\n262\n00:13:08.868 --> 00:13:11.116\nBut, and like Wes says, we'll talk about\nit in a moment with the environment.\n\n263\n00:13:11.116 --> 00:13:14.821\nSometimes you kinda just have to get\nout there on foot and see for yourself.\n\n264\n00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:17.455\nBecause they're not gonna be able to see\nthe things that you know about that that\n\n265\n00:13:17.455 --> 00:13:18.570\ncould affect that environment.\n\n266\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.405\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n267\n00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:23.588\n[LAUGH] in fact one of the things I think\nabout is how I bought an AC router.\n\n268\n00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:26.522\nWhen I say an AC router, I'm not\ntalking about routing air conditioning.\n\n269\n00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:29.431\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What we're talking about is I\n\n270\n00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:33.870\nbought 802.11 AC before it\nactually was out of draft, right.\n\n271\n00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.680\nSo I've got a pre AC draft router and\nI paid some money.\n\n272\n00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.260\nIt's a nice router, I absolutely love it.\n\n273\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.540\nIt was about 280 bucks\nwhen I first bought it,\n\n274\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.180\nso fairly expensive router,\nat least for the home network.\n\n275\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.165\nSo if you're thinking, my god,\nI don't wanna spend $300 on a home router.\n\n276\n00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:50.833\nWell if you need certain functionalities.\n\n277\n00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.225\nYou might see that basic and\nbare functionality starts at 500 and\n\n278\n00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:57.570\nworks its way into the thousands\nof dollars really, really easy.\n\n279\n00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.960\nAnd that's why this most likely is not\ngonna be suitable for a home network.\n\n280\n00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.085\nNobody wants to spend that type of money.\n\n281\n00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:06.057\nOr if you have that type of money, well,\nyou can always lend me some of it, but.\n\n282\n00:14:06.057 --> 00:14:07.728\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're the one with the big bucks.\n\n283\n00:14:07.728 --> 00:14:09.203\n300 bucks, Wes, what?\n\n284\n00:14:09.203 --> 00:14:10.212\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n285\n00:14:10.212 --> 00:14:14.015\nSo what are some of the other\nconsiderations with the equipment that we\n\n286\n00:14:14.015 --> 00:14:16.276\nhave to configure or we have to consider?\n\n287\n00:14:16.276 --> 00:14:19.548\nWe talked about for instance,\nlimitations of a home router and\n\n288\n00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:23.520\nsome of the home functionality and\nfeatures, the cabling as well.\n\n289\n00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.420\nAll right, here's another thing.\n\n290\n00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.550\nHow about wireless?\n\n291\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.110\nI have to kind of figure out,\n\n292\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.320\nwhen it comes to wireless, what\ndevices am I supporting on my network?\n\n293\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:38.030\nNow, I would say a, b, g and n, and\nac, like the exam objectives call for.\n\n294\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:42.326\nAnd we're gonna talk about those wireless\ntechnologies in another episode.\n\n295\n00:14:42.326 --> 00:14:47.390\nBut honestly, I don't think I'm\ngonna see any a devices, right?\n\n296\n00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:53.040\nI might be supporting older devices that\nare b and g, maybe not even b, but g.\n\n297\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.095\nSo we also have to consider what is\nthe standard, and what are the devices?\n\n298\n00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:57.550\nIf I have an older device, right?\n\n299\n00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.490\nWe have a mixed amount of devices.\n\n300\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.190\nMaybe I'm supporting an older device.\n\n301\n00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.006\nMaybe I'd find that I wanna support\nolder devices in the future.\n\n302\n00:15:08.006 --> 00:15:10.338\nSo I'm running my router\nin a mixed-mode network.\n\n303\n00:15:10.338 --> 00:15:13.598\nAnd I have to make sure that those\nstandards match whatever the devices\n\n304\n00:15:13.598 --> 00:15:14.490\nare on my network.\n\n305\n00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.930\nSo you also have to keep in mind what your\nwireless standards are on your router,\n\n306\n00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.140\nversus your other devices.\n\n307\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.062\nSo this is something that we\nhave to keep in mind too.\n\n308\n00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:25.431\nNow, we kinda talked about this\ntechnology in another episode.\n\n309\n00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:27.393\nBut also if I'm setting up for instance.\n\n310\n00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:32.361\nAnd I'm giving tips on, hey,\nwhat is it that you're gonna use for\n\n311\n00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.580\nyour cellphone communications, right.\n\n312\n00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.481\nAnd we do have some different\ntechnologies here and\n\n313\n00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:42.200\nwe got to keep all of these really\nin the back of our heads, right.\n\n314\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.471\nAm I gonna use older 3G technologies?\n\n315\n00:15:44.471 --> 00:15:48.492\nAm I going to use something more like a 4G\ntechnology, like long term evolution,\n\n316\n00:15:48.492 --> 00:15:49.788\nwhere I get those speeds?\n\n317\n00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:53.677\nWell again it's easy to say go\nwith the latest and greatest.\n\n318\n00:15:53.677 --> 00:15:57.423\nNot every company has the money to\ngo with the latest and the greatest.\n\n319\n00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:58.704\n[LAUGH] And certainly not a home user or\n\n320\n00:15:58.704 --> 00:16:01.115\nlet alone a small business that\nmaybe they're a start-up company.\n\n321\n00:16:01.115 --> 00:16:01.892\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n322\n00:16:01.892 --> 00:16:05.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't have the money, we\nthink, we joke around, you throw money at\n\n323\n00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:10.051\nthe problem And then eventually it's gonna\nfix itself once you thrown money at it.\n\n324\n00:16:10.051 --> 00:16:13.602\nI know another guy, another host here that\nwas talking and he talked to the CIO,\n\n325\n00:16:13.602 --> 00:16:15.790\nthe Chief Information Officer for\nthe company.\n\n326\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:21.410\nThe CIO said I want 100% availability\nall the time, 100% up time.\n\n327\n00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.250\nNot even five nines.\n\n328\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.150\nI want it to be up all the time, right?\n\n329\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.560\nWell, my friend, said, sure.\n\n330\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.740\nI need a budget of $1 million.\n\n331\n00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.750\nI will make sure that you\nare online at all times.\n\n332\n00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.430\nHe said, maybe 95% is good.\n\n333\n00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.370\n[LAUGH] You notice that when\nthe money gets too high,\n\n334\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.520\nwe gotta kind of take these\nthings into consideration.\n\n335\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.830\nSo we have to out weight\ncost versus performance.\n\n336\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.350\nSo am I using GSM, and I using CMA?\n\n337\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:53.590\nIs this something where maybe I wanna be\nable to keep the phones In my organization\n\n338\n00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.590\nand as I get a new phone I still wanna\nbe able to use it for other customers?\n\n339\n00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.500\nWell that's gonna be a big decision\non whether you use CDMA versus GSM.\n\n340\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.520\nCause I use CDMA or,\nyeah CDMA well then guess what?\n\n341\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.360\nThat cellular technology is gonna lock me.\n\n342\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.410\nIt's gonna bender lock me.\n\n343\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.640\nI'm gonna be locked to the carrier.\n\n344\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.130\nSo if I know that I wanna take\nthis phone and say for instance,\n\n345\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.090\nCherokee it's time to upgrade her phone.\n\n346\n00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.990\nI want her old phone to be\npassed over to somebody else.\n\n347\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.280\nMaybe a new employee\nthat we're onboarding.\n\n348\n00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.960\nWell then I have to make sure\nthat I'm using GSM, right?\n\n349\n00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.690\nI can't use CDMA because then\nI'd be carrier locked, right?\n\n350\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.370\nSIM cards are in the GSM phones.\n\n351\n00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.480\nSo that's things that\nyou have to consider and\n\n352\n00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.990\nsome of the limitations that you\nmight find based on those choices.\n\n353\n00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.430\nAgain the limitations with\nsupporting legacy technology.\n\n354\n00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.240\nEven though I can support\nthe new technology\n\n355\n00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.690\nwhen I'm supporting the old technology\nI get the speeds of the old technology.\n\n356\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.440\nSo then you see a performance decrease.\n\n357\n00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.580\nSo have to keep this in mind.\n\n358\n00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.410\nHaven't even considered about the local\nprinter here that I've mentioned.\n\n359\n00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.640\nI said this is a local printer,\nwhat if it's attached locally to PC1 but\n\n360\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.380\nwe wanna share it out.\n\n361\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.280\nYou know how to set the permissions?\n\n362\n00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.400\nCuz now we got a shared object,\n\n363\n00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.920\na shared resource on out network,\nhow are the other, whether it's employees,\n\n364\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.200\nfamily members, how are they\ngonna access the shared resource?\n\n365\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.060\nDo you know the permissions to set?\n\n366\n00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.767\nBecause that's another consideration\nthat you have to think about.\n\n367\n00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:14.676\n&gt;&gt; Wes always wastes the color ink.\n\n368\n00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:19.488\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that's why you've\nstuck me with a group policy that keeps me\n\n369\n00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:21.272\nto black and white printing.\n\n370\n00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.265\n[LAUGH] So, let's go ahead and\n\n371\n00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:24.300\nlook at some of the the other\nthings that we need to consider.\n\n372\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.710\nAnd again, all of them are really\nclose to the same thing.\n\n373\n00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.440\nI want you to pay attention too\nto notice this here, right?\n\n374\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.060\nI need connections back into\nmy home router if you will.\n\n375\n00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.940\nWell, notice that we have\na lot of connections here.\n\n376\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.350\nMaybe I have to consider that I need to\nthrow another connectivity device in here.\n\n377\n00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:45.160\nMaybe my home router wasn't all\nthat we have to implement and\n\n378\n00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.530\nI have to take another connectivity\ndevice, spend additional money, and\n\n379\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.350\nthen eventually find it and\nthrow it in here.\n\n380\n00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.000\nOop, that's definitely not it,\nthere we go right?\n\n381\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.970\nI have to throw another device in here\nthat allows me to connect wired cameras to\n\n382\n00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.180\na single location and\nthen run them down into the switch.\n\n383\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.910\nOr in this case, the home router.\n\n384\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.610\nWe have to consider things like that for\n\n385\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.510\ninstance if we are using a media server,\nright.\n\n386\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.000\nIf we're using a media server\ndo I want to run the CAT5 E?\n\n387\n00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.490\nWell again, you could.\n\n388\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.000\nBut you wanna,\ndo you wanna do that again in two years?\n\n389\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.860\nHere's the other thing too,\nwhen you're stretching your cables out,\n\n390\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.550\nwhen you're throwing your cables\nin throughout the location, and\n\n391\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.480\nyou pulling on them too much?\n\n392\n00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.210\nThink about that.\n\n393\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.270\nBecause that can cause\ncompatibility issues.\n\n394\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.110\nI say compatibility,\nit's more performance issues, right, so\n\n395\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.210\nwe do have to consider that as well.\n\n396\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.110\nThe other thing too that\nI might think of is,\n\n397\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.880\nwhat if we can't afford\nthings like local storage?\n\n398\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.090\nLet's say that that was a media server,\nand that was just a file server.\n\n399\n00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.760\nWell maybe my company can't support that.\n\n400\n00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.390\nWell then this is where you would have to\nbe the one, that recommends some kind of\n\n401\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:54.820\nstorage based solution, right, like\nDropbox, like something like OneDrive.\n\n402\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.970\nMaybe I don't have the money to store\nthis locally, so now I need a way or\n\n403\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.930\na solution that will support this network.\n\n404\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:02.740\nAnd, what do I do?\n\n405\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.110\nI recommend something like OneDrive,\nsomething like Dropbox.\n\n406\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.230\nNow, I don't have to worry\nabout having the local storage\n\n407\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.849\nbecause I can have that in the cloud.\n\n408\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.960\nAnd then there's management of the,\nI am to talk about the management of these\n\n409\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.630\ndevices and\nyou have a lot of devices, right?\n\n410\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.750\nWe're gonna talking about\ncouple of cellphones,\n\n411\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.140\nmaybe we've got a couple\nof different tablets.\n\n412\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.620\nBut, when you start talking about\nmultiple devices, multiple tablets now,\n\n413\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.800\nwe've got also think about requirement\nof some kind of MDM Solution, right?\n\n414\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.200\nSo, what are they called\nMobile Device Management Solution.\n\n415\n00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.490\nThat's where it starts getting tricky.\n\n416\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.420\nThat's where right away I'd say,\nyou got to go to the cloud.\n\n417\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.090\nYou don't even don't want\nto do this on-premise.\n\n418\n00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.610\nThey've got somebody good cloud\ntechnologies out there that you can\n\n419\n00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.710\ntake care of.\n\n420\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.780\nAll right, so that is a consideration.\n\n421\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:50.980\nNow, let's talk a little bit\nmore about C here, network C.\n\n422\n00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.590\nMy requirement is that I have to support,\nI have to support BYOD,\n\n423\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.550\nI have to support wireless devices.\n\n424\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.890\nI have to support wireless clients.\n\n425\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.200\nI need local storage.\n\n426\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.780\nWell, if you need local storage,\nthen you need some kind of server.\n\n427\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.300\nAnd again,\nif you need some kind of server,\n\n428\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.810\ndo you have to do things like multi homes,\nright.\n\n429\n00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.950\nI wanna make sure I wanna\nset up redundancy, so\n\n430\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.240\nI have two network adapters\nattached to my network.\n\n431\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.560\nSo that if one link fails,\nI still have access to my data.\n\n432\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.199\nIf I have something like switching\ntechnologies can I, afford a completely\n\n433\n00:21:21.199 --> 00:21:25.990\nseparate device, right,\ncan I afford to put a router in there?\n\n434\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.540\nIf not, then maybe it's more feasible to\npay the money for a layer 3 switch because\n\n435\n00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.510\nwe know that the layer 3 switch is\nnot only allowing me to communicate\n\n436\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.530\nlocally on my network, but it allows me\nto route traffic across the Internet.\n\n437\n00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:46.160\nAgain, we kinda mentioned some of these,\nbut if I've got a public facing\n\n438\n00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.410\nresource that I want users outside\nof my corporation to have access.\n\n439\n00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:55.160\nWell, then I need a security device\nthat supports DMZs, demilitarized zones.\n\n440\n00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:55.750\nRight?\n\n441\n00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.220\nI'm protecting my internal network but I'm\nstill allowing public access through and\n\n442\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.940\ninto my web server so maybe somebody\ncan see ordering information, right?\n\n443\n00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.910\nSome kind of form they fill out to\npurchase a product within my company.\n\n444\n00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.900\nWell now I've got to talk about,\nthink about that,\n\n445\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.630\nI got to think about\nthe security concerns, right?\n\n446\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.090\nSo we have to think about,\nare we gonna implement things like DMZs?\n\n447\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:19.400\nAre we gonna implement things like VPNs?\n\n448\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.840\nNow I know you're an,\nyou're the data security policies right?\n\n449\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.160\nIf I'm a small,\nmaybe I'm a claims company or\n\n450\n00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.900\nsomething like that, maybe I have\nto store payment card information.\n\n451\n00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.170\nAll right, now I need to figure out\nis the firewall that I'm using.\n\n452\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.880\nAnd our all the networking components and\n\n453\n00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.528\nmy data retention policies\nall in compliance with PCI?\n\n454\n00:22:41.528 --> 00:22:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably gonna need\nnetwork policy server just to ensure that.\n\n455\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.262\n&gt;&gt; Just to ensure it.\n\n456\n00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:48.830\nSo now we talk about more of\nan expense for the security, right?\n\n457\n00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.324\nSo, as you need more security, it's\nthrowing money at it unfortunately, so\n\n458\n00:22:53.324 --> 00:22:55.360\nyou gotta think about that.\n\n459\n00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.700\nNow I do wanna talk about some\nof the limitations, right?\n\n460\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.751\nWe've talked about for\ninstance, if I have 5E,\n\n461\n00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:03.450\nwhere if I have older CAT 5 cables, right?\n\n462\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.970\nYou probably don't but if you do, right,\n\n463\n00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.190\nthat's gonna slow down\nthe performance of you network.\n\n464\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.550\nI also wanna talk about things like\nwireless communications, right?\n\n465\n00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.040\nWhen it comes to wireless communications,\ndo we have obstacles in our way?\n\n466\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.330\nRight, do I have points of interference?\n\n467\n00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.650\nRight, have I placed my antenna's\nwithin the building appropriately?\n\n468\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.280\nDo I have my antennae?\n\n469\n00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.210\nMost of it's power directed out to\nthe parking lot with the person\n\n470\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:28.450\nthat's seating out there doing war\ndriving can now capture all the data or\n\n471\n00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.860\ndo I have all those antenna's facing\nback towards the internal company, so\n\n472\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.260\nthey get the majority of the signal?\n\n473\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.710\nIf we're using things like infrared,\nline-of-sight communication,\n\n474\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.560\ndo I have that line of sight?\n\n475\n00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.940\nIf we're using things like, for instance,\nencryption protocols, everybody would say,\n\n476\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.160\nmore security, the best security,\nthrow it at it, that's what we need.\n\n477\n00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.039\nWell, if I throw you at\n\n478\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:54.210\nAES 256 bit encryption at you\ndoes your device support that?\n\n479\n00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.690\nMaybe, I don't know.\n\n480\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:03.411\nYou might find that in securing your\nnetwork compatibility is completely lost.\n\n481\n00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:07.290\nMaybe your computer doesn't support\nthe higher level encryption of AES and\n\n482\n00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.056\nall these crazy things like CCMP.\n\n483\n00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:12.993\nAnd trying to secure Secure your networks,\nyou've actually locked your users out, and\n\n484\n00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:16.020\nthey can't because of\nthe compatibility concerns.\n\n485\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.620\nSo we do need to keep\nthat in mind as well.\n\n486\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.660\nDo you have voice over IP services\nthat you need to implement?\n\n487\n00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.130\nBecause then we need to implement\nsomewhere on our network things like\n\n488\n00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.310\nvoice over IP.\n\n489\n00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.980\nAnd we need to secure that as well.\n\n490\n00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.230\nWe might even need things\nlike power over ethernet.\n\n491\n00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.940\nIf we need power over ethernet to\npower those voice over IP phones,\n\n492\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.480\ndoes your switch support that?\n\n493\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.890\nIf it doesn't support that, do you need\nto get something like a POE injector?\n\n494\n00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.710\nThese are all things that we have\nto take into consideration when\n\n495\n00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.219\nwe're gonna implement even\nthe most basic of networks.\n\n496\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.930\n&gt;&gt; Looking at POE, all right?\n\n497\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.130\nPower over ethernet, if I'm using, and\none of your diagrams you have the IP,\n\n498\n00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.440\nthe security camera system.\n\n499\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.979\nBut let's say, if I have blueprints for\n\n500\n00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:58.350\nthe building where I'm asked\nto set this network up.\n\n501\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.258\nI can look and see where the electrical\noutlets are spaced out and use a legend\n\n502\n00:25:02.258 --> 00:25:06.043\nand make sure that my distances are going\nto be within reach of the outlet so\n\n503\n00:25:06.043 --> 00:25:08.000\nI can plug all these cameras in.\n\n504\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.940\nBut if not, then I can us those\nblueprints to help me determine well,\n\n505\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.540\nI'm gonna need to utilize POE.\n\n506\n00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.470\nMy switch is gonna need to support it.\n\n507\n00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:18.400\nSome things, they're like,\nyou just can't understand from blueprints.\n\n508\n00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.150\nThere might be something\nlike reflective tinting\n\n509\n00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.425\non buildings that's interfering\nwith your wireless signal bounce or\n\n510\n00:25:25.425 --> 00:25:29.630\nbookcases that are metal that\naren't listed on the blueprints.\n\n511\n00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.420\nSo I think we're gonna be talking\nabout site surveys and environmental.\n\n512\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.946\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and that's something-\n&gt;&gt; Things to think about, there's a lot.\n\n513\n00:25:35.946 --> 00:25:38.837\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, one of the things,\nnow that you mentioned,\n\n514\n00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:41.620\nwe think of our wiring techniques, right?\n\n515\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.740\nWe need to stay away from\nfluorescent lights, why?\n\n516\n00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.439\nCuz they give off electromagnetic\ninterference, that's a good point,\n\n517\n00:25:46.439 --> 00:25:48.170\nthings like to HVAC system, right?\n\n518\n00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.850\nI see where the HVAC system is but\n\n519\n00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.620\nthen there's nothing in\nrelationship to my network diagram.\n\n520\n00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.930\nArchitecturally, I see where it is,\n\n521\n00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.510\nbut how does that reflect\nthe cabling that's gonna be run?\n\n522\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.835\nThe other things too,\naround the outside of your building,\n\n523\n00:25:58.835 --> 00:26:01.360\nyour parameter of your building\nwhere you have your IP cameras.\n\n524\n00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.350\nAre they sitting next to high\nintensity discharge lamps?\n\n525\n00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.270\nWell, there's a lot of electromagnetic\ninterference, cuz not only,\n\n526\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.510\nyour cameras don't do you\nany good if you can't see.\n\n527\n00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.700\nWell, maybe you need to consider that\nyou can't use those cameras near high\n\n528\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.720\nintensity discharge lamps because of the\nelectromagnetic interference that they're\n\n529\n00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.830\ngiving off.\n\n530\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.800\nRight, this is why you need to do like,\nCherokee mentioned,\n\n531\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.520\nyou need to do things like site surveys.\n\n532\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.950\nI need to find out, are there other\nwireless access points within my networks,\n\n533\n00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.380\nand if there are,\nwhat channels are they on?\n\n534\n00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.753\nRight, because, if I find, with the little\nnetwork list that's in your phone, and\n\n535\n00:26:34.753 --> 00:26:37.485\nyour WiFi analyzer,\nI'm like I got let's see,\n\n536\n00:26:37.485 --> 00:26:40.760\nin this industrial park\nI've got 15 access points.\n\n537\n00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.410\nAnd every single one of them\nare defaulting to channel six.\n\n538\n00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Woo hoo.\n\n539\n00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.588\n&gt;&gt; Channel congestion at its finest,\nright?\n\n540\n00:26:46.588 --> 00:26:51.190\nSo I need to know that, I need to be\naware of those environmental limitations.\n\n541\n00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.120\nEquipment limitations,\ndo I have the right cables?\n\n542\n00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.830\nA 100-meter cable for ethernet,\nright, do I need more than that?\n\n543\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.610\nWell, if I need more than that,\nremember, it's a 100-meter limitation.\n\n544\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.810\nI'm probably gonna have to put\nin some kind of repeater, or\n\n545\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:07.230\nconsider maybe going to a longer\ntype of cable, like fiber optics.\n\n546\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.180\nAgain, spend starts to\ngo through the roof.\n\n547\n00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.880\nOne of the last things I want to mention,\ntoo, is we talked about some of\n\n548\n00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.730\nthe compatibility requirements,\nthings like speeds and duplexing.\n\n549\n00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.670\nWe talked about auto-negotiation,\nand a lot of your devices today,\n\n550\n00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.650\nwhen they turn on, they will talk to the\nswitch and say, hey, what are you running?\n\n551\n00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.320\nAnd the switch can say,\nI'm running at a gigabit speed, and\n\n552\n00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.200\nI'm running a full duplex, or\na simultaneous two-way communication.\n\n553\n00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.240\nYour network adapter says, that's great.\n\n554\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.600\nLet me go ahead and configure it.\n\n555\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.220\nWhat happens if they get it wrong?\n\n556\n00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.560\nWell, that's gonna severely limit\nthe compatibility of your network to send\n\n557\n00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.120\ninformation.\n\n558\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.170\nYou'll still send information, but\n\n559\n00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.300\nyou'll swear you're on\na dial-up connection, right?\n\n560\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.769\nCuz the performance is not going\nto be where it's supposed to be.\n\n561\n00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.360\nLet's see again, security standards, keep\nin mind things like security standards.\n\n562\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.490\nIncompatible security protocol.\n\n563\n00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.380\nEspecially when you get in\nthe higher levels of encryptions.\n\n564\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.060\nFirewalls, do you need\nhost-based firewall?\n\n565\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.940\nOr do you need like what we'd been\nshowing you, a network-based firewall.\n\n566\n00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.650\nWell, again, that depends on if you're\nsupporting things like DMZs, VLANs.\n\n567\n00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:13.250\nAre you supporting things\nlike VPN communications?\n\n568\n00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.250\nIt's gonna depend on\nwhat you're gonna need.\n\n569\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.530\nDo you have data retention policies?\n\n570\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:22.240\nDo you have secure data disposal,\n\n571\n00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.080\ndata destruction technologies\nthat you need to implement?\n\n572\n00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.018\nAnd again-\n&gt;&gt; Data retention.\n\n573\n00:28:26.018 --> 00:28:27.480\n&gt;&gt; Retention, that's right.\n\n574\n00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.080\nSo you can get away, you don't wanna\nget charged with an audit and say well,\n\n575\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.486\nI'm sorry, I've got about three months.\n\n576\n00:28:32.486 --> 00:28:34.191\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] somewhere, I swear [LAUGH].\n\n577\n00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:36.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI've got three months of data but\n\n578\n00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:39.904\nI don't know where the last seven years\nare, it's Pandora's box or something.\n\n579\n00:28:39.904 --> 00:28:41.457\nBut you have to keep these in mind,\n\n580\n00:28:41.457 --> 00:28:44.470\ncuz keep in mind that you might not\nonly be supporting the end user.\n\n581\n00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.881\nNow, at the Network+ level we don't expect\nyou to go into a multi-site location and\n\n582\n00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:55.166\nyou're gonna be implementing PBXs and\nPSTN to ISDN, it's not really about that.\n\n583\n00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:58.402\nBut it's about knowing those basic\nrequirements that you need to get that\n\n584\n00:28:58.402 --> 00:28:59.570\nnetwork set up.\n\n585\n00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.260\nWe've given you a couple of examples here.\n\n586\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.450\nOne very basic home network,\none that's not quite so basic,\n\n587\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.710\ncould be a home network,\ncould be a very small business.\n\n588\n00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.212\nAnd then, even one that is\nmore of a SOHO environment.\n\n589\n00:29:10.212 --> 00:29:13.745\nAnd you gotta keep these things in mind,\nif you are gonna implement those networks,\n\n590\n00:29:13.745 --> 00:29:17.010\nso that, not only can you implement\nthem right, you can support them right.\n\n591\n00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.292\nAnd that the customer,\nin the end, is gonna be happy.\n\n592\n00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:22.226\nAnd when it comes down to it,\nremember, if the customer's happy,\n\n593\n00:29:22.226 --> 00:29:24.344\nchances are you're gonna\nhave a lot better day.\n\n594\n00:29:24.344 --> 00:29:25.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is so true.\n\n595\n00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.466\nI mean, that's really what it's all about,\nlike they said,\n\n596\n00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.827\nunderstanding your customer.\n\n597\n00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:30.832\nAnd you know Wes,\n\n598\n00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:34.861\nsomething that you said that really\nresonated with me was being aware.\n\n599\n00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:37.950\nAnd I know this is a lot of\ninformation that he's just covered.\n\n600\n00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.040\nIt really is, this is not for\nthe faint of heart.\n\n601\n00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.876\nBut being aware is gonna keep you on\ntop of your game, staying organized,\n\n602\n00:29:45.876 --> 00:29:49.788\nkeeping specialized diagrams,\nknowing it's your baby.\n\n603\n00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:50.850\nYour networks are your babies.\n\n604\n00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.420\nSo just really be aware.\n\n605\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.619\nThat's the best thing I've thought about,\nyou know?\n\n606\n00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:57.340\n&gt;&gt; How do you be aware?\n\n607\n00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.870\nWhat's the best way you can be\naware of how the network looks,\n\n608\n00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.900\nwhere the network is at this point.\n\n609\n00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.360\nDocumentation.\n\n610\n00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.470\nDocument, document, document.\n\n611\n00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.080\nYou just have to.\n\n612\n00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.140\nDo I have documentations of my networks?\n\n613\n00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.510\nAbsolutely not, right?\n\n614\n00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.935\nSo do as I say, not as I do.\n\n615\n00:30:13.935 --> 00:30:15.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And a couple weeks back,\n\n616\n00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.150\nI have to tell you,\n\n617\n00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.770\neven at a very basic home network,\nI had to redo my home network.\n\n618\n00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:24.200\nI had to redo port forwarding rules, and\nstuff that I completely forgot about.\n\n619\n00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.740\nNow, if I would have had documentation,\nand all my configuration files backed up,\n\n620\n00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.610\nI would have been doing good.\n\n621\n00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.040\nI could, probably, have done\nthe whole thing in less than an hour.\n\n622\n00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.140\nVery simplistic network,\nnothing very outrageous but\n\n623\n00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.730\nbecause I didn't have anything,\nanything documented.\n\n624\n00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.140\nHow did I set it up,\nwhat was the configuration?\n\n625\n00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:44.220\nNot only did I have to go\nresearch how to do it again,\n\n626\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.060\nI had to figure out how to\ncustomize it for myself.\n\n627\n00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.230\nHad I had those documentation, those build\ndocuments, the configuration documents.\n\n628\n00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.280\nIf you're in a bit little bit\nbigger of an organization,\n\n629\n00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.240\nmaybe you have patch management and\nchange management policies.\n\n630\n00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.350\nBut regardless, you have it documented.\n\n631\n00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:02.620\nIt comes in handy, and it can make your\njob a lot easier at the end of the day.\n\n632\n00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.960\nAnd don't overlook it on even\nsomething as simple as a home network.\n\n633\n00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.580\nBecause as you're documenting things that\nyou come across, it's gonna help you to\n\n634\n00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.120\nnot only troubleshoot, but\nsupport networks in the future as well.\n\n635\n00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.030\nRather than having to\nre-relook something up.\n\n636\n00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:21.100\nLike, for instance, my router,\nI'll give you an example, case in point.\n\n637\n00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.490\nI needed to update the firmware,\nright, on my router.\n\n638\n00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.800\nI didn't know what the port\nforwarding rules were.\n\n639\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.730\nNow a smarter me would have said Wes,\n\n640\n00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.030\nyou don't have a backup of\nthe configuration file.\n\n641\n00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.660\nNo, I did the firmware update that\ncompletely erased everything, and\n\n642\n00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.350\nthen I had to set up\neverything from scratch.\n\n643\n00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:39.441\nHad I had it documented, I wouldn't have\nbeen up on the Asus website looking for\n\n644\n00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:41.901\ntheir manuals, trying to figure\nout what the heck I was doing.\n\n645\n00:31:41.901 --> 00:31:44.090\nSo be aware of your environment.\n\n646\n00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.120\nAnd one of the best ways I can say\nto be aware of your environment is\n\n647\n00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.310\ndocument what you're doing.\n\n648\n00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.250\nSo for future reference if\nyou have to support it,\n\n649\n00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.660\nif you have to bring the network down,\nbring it back online, repair or\n\n650\n00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.070\ntroubleshoot anything,\nyou'll have a place to look.\n\n651\n00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.560\nAnd you'll have something that's\ngonna be very informative\n\n652\n00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.540\non the decisions that you're gonna make.\n\n653\n00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\njoining us today, Wes.\n\n654\n00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.380\nIt was like I said, a lot of information,\nbut you guys got this, and guess what,\n\n655\n00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.180\nif not,\nthat's the joy of the rewind button.\n\n656\n00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.660\nDo we even have any\nrewind buttons anymore?\n\n657\n00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:11.650\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if they exist.\n\n658\n00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.130\n&gt;&gt; But anyways, you get the point.\n\n659\n00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.830\nThank you for joining us today guys, but\n\n660\n00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.210\nwe do have some more Net Plus information\nheaded your way, so stay tuned.\n\n661\n00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.310\nRemember, I'm your show\nhost Cherokee Boose.\n\n662\n00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:21.120\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n663\n00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.581\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n664\n00:32:25.705 --> 00:32:31.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n665\n00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.740\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.410\nAnd welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.330\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in todays\nepisode well we're continuing on with\n\n7\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.710\nmore on our CompTIA series for Network+.\n\n8\n00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.400\nAnd joining us in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.740\nagain our mentor in that endeavor,\nour good friend Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.440\nWes welcome my man how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.723\n&gt;&gt; It's going all right man Dan thanks for\nhaving me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:37.112\nYep, we are gonna go right into the next\ntopic, which is monitoring tools,\n\n13\n00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:40.620\nI checked my script here,\nmake sure that I've got it right.\n\n14\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.130\nMonitoring tools, it's gonna be about\nsome of the different utilities that we\n\n15\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.220\ncan use to kinda find out\nwhat's going on in networks.\n\n16\n00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.520\nAnd it really just kind\nof dive pretty deep,\n\n17\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.450\nif you will,\ninto different aspects of the networks.\n\n18\n00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.370\nSo, we're gonna talk about some\ndifferent types of tools and even talk\n\n19\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.300\nabout some of the maybe the scenarios that\nyou might see these tools utilized in.\n\n20\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.700\nThe very first one we're gonna talk about\nis probably one of the most commonly\n\n21\n00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.070\nused technologies when you really want to\ndiscover what is going on on your network.\n\n22\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.200\nAnd these are what are known as packet or\nnetwork analyzers, if you will.\n\n23\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.240\nAnd with a packet analyzer,\nwe have a few choices out there.\n\n24\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.750\nBut what this does is,\nit looks in to the network and\n\n25\n00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.110\nit looks at the communications\nthat are going across the network.\n\n26\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.440\nAnd depending on where you run it from,\nwill tell what you actually see on your\n\n27\n00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.495\nnetwork versus,\nit's all about where you run it.\n\n28\n00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.715\nLet's go ahead, I'll show you\na couple that we've got here.\n\n29\n00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:42.825\nDan and I were just talking, before we\nstarted this, by far gotta be one of\n\n30\n00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:47.135\nthe best, if not the best, of all of\nthe wire, I keep wanting to say wireless\n\n31\n00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:52.025\nanalyzers, target analyzers that we\nhave out there, and this is Wireshark.\n\n32\n00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:55.660\nAnd you can see here Wireshark.org,\n\n33\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.720\nif you want to get an idea of what's gonna\nhappen when you use a packet analyzer,\n\n34\n00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.780\nby all means, go up here and\ngrab this one again because it is free.\n\n35\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.810\nNow also just to kind of give\na couple of options here,\n\n36\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.650\nmaybe some of you guys have been around\nthe Microsoft world for a while.\n\n37\n00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.460\nYou probably remember the earlier\nNetwork Monitor or NetMon.\n\n38\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.920\nNetwork Monitor is no longer\nsupported by Microsoft.\n\n39\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.150\nIt's lower technology, but\nthis is the one that is currently\n\n40\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.870\nsupported by Microsoft here, and they give\nyou some information about it as well.\n\n41\n00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.750\nIt's called\nthe Microsoft Message Analyzer.\n\n42\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.140\nBut when it comes down to it,\nthese two, WireShark and\n\n43\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.910\nMicrosoft's Message Analyzer,\n\n44\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.720\nthey're really doing a lot\nof the same functionality.\n\n45\n00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.690\nIn fact, let's go ahead and\nkinda show you what you might see here.\n\n46\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.400\nI've got a Server 2016 box here and\n\n47\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.800\nI've got my Wireshark already set up\nto go on this so we'll go ahead and\n\n48\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.510\nwe'll launch this up here and give it\na second to load up the interfaces.\n\n49\n00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.220\nAnd one of the cool things,\nthis is kinda really cool\n\n50\n00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.900\nthat I just found out the other\nday when I was installing it.\n\n51\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.800\nIt's been a little bit since\nI've installed Wireshark,\n\n52\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.960\nis it now has USBPcap.\n\n53\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.280\nSo, it can inspect USB devices as well,\nwhich I thought that was kinda cool.\n\n54\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.660\nIt's got a USB packet\ncapture driver built into it.\n\n55\n00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.380\nSo, I have a multi-home server here.\n\n56\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.050\nAnd as you can see,\nthere are two Ethernet interfaces.\n\n57\n00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.330\nAnd if I hover over them, one of the great\nthings I like about this is it shows you\n\n58\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.940\nwhat the IP address is and you could\nsee the link loca IPv6 address here.\n\n59\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.840\nSo, if I need to figure out\nwhich one of these interfaces\n\n60\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.090\ndo I want to capture information on,\nI can choose it.\n\n61\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.070\nNow, you can, if you need to know,\n\n62\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.950\nI don't know which interface is which Here\nin Windows you can always go down, and\n\n63\n00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.850\nmy heads kind of covering it up right now,\nyou can actually right click on the little\n\n64\n00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.380\nnetwork monitor icon there and\nyou can choose Network and Sharing Center.\n\n65\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.500\nWhen the Network and Sharing Center comes\nup you can go to Change adapter settings\n\n66\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.090\nand you can really see which one of those\nnetwork adapters you want to utilize.\n\n67\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.050\nThat's a couple of ways.\n\n68\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.690\nLike I said I like the way that\nWireshark's got it built right in.\n\n69\n00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.380\nIf you don't want to do that\nyou really don't have to.\n\n70\n00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.460\nThat proverbial saying that we say\naround here a lot, hover to discover.\n\n71\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.440\nYou can just kind of hover over that and\nyou can find that information.\n\n72\n00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.290\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll take, it\ndoesn't look like there's a lot of traffic\n\n73\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.370\ngoing on here, but\nwe'll take Ethernet1 here.\n\n74\n00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.060\nAnd it is going to ask me to\nelevate my privileges here,\n\n75\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.430\nkeep in mind because this allows\nme to inspect network traffic.\n\n76\n00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.630\nDoesn't look like we're\ngetting any information here,\n\n77\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.820\nlet's see if we can help\nthis out a little bit,\n\n78\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.910\nconvince this machine to make\na little noise on the network.\n\n79\n00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.370\nSo what we're gonna do is we're just\ngonna do a simple ping here and\n\n80\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.270\nsince we're in Windows we have,\nif we wanna make it persistent,\n\n81\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.670\nrun that in the background and it does\nlook like that's on the other interface.\n\n82\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.730\nSo, no package captured, let's go ahead\nand we'll switch to the other interface,\n\n83\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.050\nthere we go,\nwe got a little bit of information.\n\n84\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.294\nSo, then you can kinda see here that\nwe could see some ICMP information and\n\n85\n00:05:00.294 --> 00:05:05.223\nIf you guys aren't aware of that protocol,\nI'm using the ping packet right there and\n\n86\n00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:10.086\nthe ping packet actually uses the Internet\ncontrol message protocol to send a couple\n\n87\n00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:12.578\nof those ICMP echo request to an endpoint.\n\n88\n00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:16.183\nIn this case I just happen to be pinging a\nDNS service somewhere in Atlanta there and\n\n89\n00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.638\nit's responding back to me\nit's saying hey I'm here so\n\n90\n00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.430\nit's giving me some echo replies back.\n\n91\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.700\nSo under the hood,\nI could see if I'm looking at this,\n\n92\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.230\nif I'm looking at this\npacket capture utility.\n\n93\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.350\nAnd I'll go ahead and stop that.\n\n94\n00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.570\nWe don't need to keep running that,\ngive me a second here, guys.\n\n95\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.400\nDo a Ctrl+C on this and\nstop that as well, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.710\nSo I can see that very thing, right\nI can look at these packets right and\n\n97\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.550\nI can see that I've got\nan echo request right.\n\n98\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.680\nSo I've got an ICMP, I get a ping.\n\n99\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.430\nWhat Windows is using packet and\nare not over it it's\n\n100\n00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.610\nsending out a request to the endpoint and\nthe endpoint replies back here.\n\n101\n00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.350\nI can also see where is this going?\n\n102\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.310\nWhere's it coming from, and\nwhere is it going to, right?\n\n103\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.230\nI can see it's coming from 192.168.45.177,\nso\n\n104\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:06.090\nthat's the local private\nIP address of the server.\n\n105\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.850\nAnd I can see that the destination is\nsending it outbound to the destination IP\n\n106\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.910\naddress that I use the ping packet on.\n\n107\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.612\nBut we can go even farther than that,\nright?\n\n108\n00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:17.720\nDan, and I know you've spent some time\nin these packet capture utilities.\n\n109\n00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.380\nYou can really get lost quick.\n\n110\n00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.850\nBut the good thing is this bottom\ninterface kind of lays it out for you.\n\n111\n00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.250\nIn face I'm gonna kinda shrink\nthis down a little bit.\n\n112\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.790\nBy the way,\nthat's the actual data that we're seeing,\n\n113\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.370\ndepending on what you're\nselecting down here.\n\n114\n00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.800\nBut let's go ahead and we will just\ndrop that out of sight real quick.\n\n115\n00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.500\nAnd I kinda wanna look at these,\nthis section right here.\n\n116\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.120\nAll right, in a previous episode we\ntalked about the OSI model, right?\n\n117\n00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.964\nWell the good thing about the packet\nanalyzer here is it actually\n\n118\n00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:50.307\nbreaks it down according to the OSI model,\nin fact we can\n\n119\n00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:54.453\nsee Internet Control Message Protocol\nall the way up here at the top.\n\n120\n00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:58.932\nAnd if I look I can start\nto see the information that\n\n121\n00:06:58.932 --> 00:07:03.530\nis literary in the ICMP protocol here,\nright?\n\n122\n00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.610\nIt's sequencing numbers and\nstuff and identifiers.\n\n123\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.300\nI can see the IP layer, right.\n\n124\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.200\nSo we can go down to the IP layer here.\n\n125\n00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.190\nInteresting you can even see things\nlike differentiated service code,\n\n126\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.380\npoints right if we were using\nthings like quality of service.\n\n127\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.240\nWe aren't there but\nyou can see that as well.\n\n128\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.560\nAnd then here I can see the source and\nthe destination.\n\n129\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.650\nSo, yes, we can see that\ninformation right up above here.\n\n130\n00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.330\nBut I can also see that\ninformation right there as well.\n\n131\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.470\nWe can go a little bit farther.\n\n132\n00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.320\nWe can even see things like\nthe layer 2 information right,\n\n133\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.090\nEthernet if you will and\n\n134\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.570\nnow I see those things like the physical\naddresses and we had actually talked about\n\n135\n00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.230\nthis when we were talking like in our\nIP schema mini series that we did.\n\n136\n00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.656\nWe talked about in fact I think it was you\nDan that mentioned like that the first\n\n137\n00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:50.598\npart of it we talk about\nthe OUI being the vendor ID.\n\n138\n00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:52.600\nWell you can see,\na lot of these utilities,\n\n139\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.105\nthey don't even worry about\nthose first three bytes.\n\n140\n00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:56.176\nIt's VMware, right?\n\n141\n00:07:56.176 --> 00:08:00.207\nIt's a virtualized adapter but\nthat's VMware's OU ID there that's is\n\n142\n00:08:00.207 --> 00:08:04.569\norganizationally unique identifier and\nthen I can also see the unique network\n\n143\n00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:08.928\nadapter ID it's part of the Mac address\nand the great this is if you really wanna\n\n144\n00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:12.540\nknow what it is like kind\nof put parenthesis here so.\n\n145\n00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.130\nProtocol analyser package analyser\nif you will, these are very,\n\n146\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.170\nvery good for finding out the information\nthat's going along your network, right?\n\n147\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.520\nI can see some DNS traffic.\n\n148\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.290\nWe could see TCP, right?\n\n149\n00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.120\nWe talked about TCP.\n\n150\n00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.970\nIf I double click on any of these\npackets here, I can see, I believe,\n\n151\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.480\njust a little bit, there it is.\n\n152\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.200\nJust above IP, right I can see\na destination port here, Dan do\n\n153\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.720\nyou have any idea what you think that\nmight be just based on that port number,\n\n154\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.980\nwhat kind of communication\ntype that might be?\n\n155\n00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.720\n&gt;&gt; Looks like it is a secure web traffic.\n\n156\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.650\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n157\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.155\nSo, and\nthat right there's the benefit, right?\n\n158\n00:08:46.155 --> 00:08:48.275\nAnd we can see right there Port 443.\n\n159\n00:08:48.275 --> 00:08:49.295\nIt's got to be HTTPS, right?\n\n160\n00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:52.295\nSo it's really good when you're\nmonitoring traffic, right?\n\n161\n00:08:52.295 --> 00:08:57.575\nA monitoring tool, to be able to have one\nof these protocol analyzers here dig in,\n\n162\n00:08:57.575 --> 00:08:59.455\nand then see what is going on.\n\n163\n00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:01.840\nAll right, so.\n\n164\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.285\nProtocol analysers, packing analysers or\nnetwork analysers if you will,\n\n165\n00:09:06.285 --> 00:09:10.870\nkeep in mind they have their place in,\nit is a heavily used monitoring tool that\n\n166\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.748\nwe use sometimes depending on what your\njob depending on your daily basis.\n\n167\n00:09:15.748 --> 00:09:18.630\nMight be something where you\nuse it every other week.\n\n168\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.640\nSometimes we're just interested, right?\n\n169\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.340\nSometimes administrators\ndon't wait until the network\n\n170\n00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.120\nperformance starts to degrade to just\nkind of find out what's going on.\n\n171\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.030\nI need to figure out if I'm doing\na disaster recovery policy,\n\n172\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.190\nwhat are the most utilized\nservices on my network?\n\n173\n00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.910\nWell, I can sit here and I can use\none of these packet analyzers and\n\n174\n00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.760\nI can find all these protocols\nthat are going over the network.\n\n175\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.820\nAnd find their sources and\ndestinations, and that might tell me,\n\n176\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.240\nby monitoring that traffic, which services\nI utilize on my network the most.\n\n177\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI've had to use these quite extensively,\n\n178\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.100\ntroubleshooting problems is where\nthey really earn their money.\n\n179\n00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.080\nYou think, why is this not working?\n\n180\n00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.790\nI'm sending something out.\n\n181\n00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.870\nI've fired it up, just to find out\nthat I was using the wrong adaptor,\n\n182\n00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.700\nI had one adaptor shut down.\n\n183\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.447\nI thought there's the problem I can't get\nto that network because that adaptor is\n\n184\n00:10:03.447 --> 00:10:04.382\nnot on that network.\n\n185\n00:10:04.382 --> 00:10:06.999\nI have to fire up the correct adaptor and\n\n186\n00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:10.340\nwire shark showed me that\nwas what was happening.\n\n187\n00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.105\nYou can use that in a lot\nof good ways like that\n\n188\n00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:14.350\n&gt;&gt; Definitely that was the first\n\n189\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.640\nthing that I did here too.\n\n190\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.530\nI Grab the wrong network adapter.\n\n191\n00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.930\nAnd what does it say?\n\n192\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.020\nIt's zero, it says absolutely nothing.\n\n193\n00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.130\nAnd that's your first telltale sign so\nyou'd know.\n\n194\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.520\n&gt;&gt; So you run to the adapter.\n\n195\n00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.350\nYou use ipconfig or\nIP config depending on your OS.\n\n196\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.220\nAnd you would see there's nothing there.\n\n197\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.050\nI don't have the adapter turned on.\n\n198\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n199\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.710\nThe other thing that I didn't mention, and\n\n200\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.810\nI went ahead cuz I stopped\nthat packet capture.\n\n201\n00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.170\nAnd as Dan was telling you\nsome of the things he's seen.\n\n202\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.400\nI actually close the download.\n\n203\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.230\nI don't want to do that so\nI started a new one here.\n\n204\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.430\nThat's probably why you still see some\nICMP but we don't see DNS anymore.\n\n205\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.020\nWe see our peer address\nresolution protocol and\n\n206\n00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.390\nhere's the reason I wanted to do that.\n\n207\n00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.270\nNotice what happens ,when\nI shut this down right?\n\n208\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.450\nThis is another good thing about\nthese packet capture utilities.\n\n209\n00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.580\nLet's say Dan needed a snapshot.\n\n210\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.240\nHe's not physically in the building or\nsomething, he calls me up and\n\n211\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.700\nsays Wes, I need to know what's going on\nwith such and such because I see X, Y, Z.\n\n212\n00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.230\nIs not happening appropriately, right.\n\n213\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.420\nWell guess what I can do, I can save\nthis packet capture you file, right,\n\n214\n00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:22.130\nand we'll just go ahead, we'll call it\ntest, because I'm so creative here.\n\n215\n00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:23.340\nWe'll call it test.\n\n216\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.440\nAnd notice that it puts\na file on my desktop.\n\n217\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.780\nNow what's so good about that file is\nthe fact that I can email it to Dan.\n\n218\n00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.688\nAll right now, I would recommend HTTPS,\nand maybe even some for this,\n\n219\n00:11:32.688 --> 00:11:34.980\nbecause this has got valuable information.\n\n220\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.850\nIt's not information that, necessarily,\n\n221\n00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.210\nyou want just any old\nperson getting a hold of.\n\n222\n00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.390\nBut he can open this up by double clicking\non it, and because I've got it configured.\n\n223\n00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.620\nNow, this is not a running packet capture,\nright?\n\n224\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.170\nYou notice that my play button here,\nmy stop button are grayed out.\n\n225\n00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.480\nIt's because it's already\ngathered that information and\n\n226\n00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.590\ndump it into a PCAT file that I could turn\naround or in this case in the scenario\n\n227\n00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.350\ngoes Dan can load it up and you can say,\nokay, I see, I see a P traffic,\n\n228\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.695\nsomebody wanna paying and then, walk away\nfrom their computer [LAUGH] or something.\n\n229\n00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:09.885\nSo, it would give you some kind\nof indication of what's going on.\n\n230\n00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:12.125\nAnd I don't have to be right in\nfront of it doing a live capture.\n\n231\n00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:14.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and some of the other great\noptions that WireStar, specifically,\n\n232\n00:12:14.765 --> 00:12:15.635\ncuz that's what I use.\n\n233\n00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.805\nI know most people do use WireStar,\n\n234\n00:12:17.805 --> 00:12:20.885\nthat will allow you to do is\nto follow the TCP stream.\n\n235\n00:12:20.885 --> 00:12:23.675\nYou can see what's happening\njust by right-clicking and\n\n236\n00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:25.465\nsee the whole entire conversation.\n\n237\n00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:29.310\nYou gotta follow the TCP, and\nyou'll also use filtering as well.\n\n238\n00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.240\nYou start, you gotta remember,\nonce you turn on Wireshark,\n\n239\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.390\nit puts your adapter\ninto promiscuous mode.\n\n240\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.740\nSo every packet that comes its way,\nit's seen.\n\n241\n00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.340\nAnd it's gonna display it in the upper\nportion there of your window.\n\n242\n00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.750\nSo if you don't want to see everybody\nin their brother you're looking for\n\n243\n00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.360\nan specific type of conversation or\n\n244\n00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.190\nconversation between two specific end\npoints then you can filter those out.\n\n245\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.540\nVery, very handy feature.\n\n246\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, since you've\nmentioned it, let's go ahead and\n\n247\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.630\nshow you exactly what Dan's talking\nabout so you can kind of get what he is\n\n248\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.980\nmentioning here Notice is says right\nup here, apply a display filter.\n\n249\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.250\nWell maybe I'm not looking for\nthings like what is it?\n\n250\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.690\nThe NetBIOS naming service there.\n\n251\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.980\nMaybe I'm just looking for\nthings like ARP.\n\n252\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.380\nAll right, well I'm gonna\ncapitalize it on purpose first.\n\n253\n00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.110\nIt says, well wait a second,\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n254\n00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.280\nSo text is everything, right?\n\n255\n00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.180\nYou notice that it kinda gives\nme this little drop-down.\n\n256\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.270\nIt says, no, you better do that\nin lower case and it turns green.\n\n257\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.170\nIt's great,\nyou can tell if your filter works right.\n\n258\n00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.490\nYou can get very,\nvery creative with these filters.\n\n259\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.740\nAnd some of these filters,\n\n260\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.270\nI believe that you could use\nregular expressions and stuff.\n\n261\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.560\nI'm not sure.\n&gt;&gt; I think it does, yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.300\n&gt;&gt; But\nit can get really advanced filtering so\n\n263\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.640\nyou could find exactly what you want.\n\n264\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.700\nAnd if I want to find ARP, well I just\nfilter out and boy I didn't have to search\n\n265\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.630\nall of those individual little\npackets that were captured.\n\n266\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.236\nI can get right to what I want, so\nyes that's great information there.\n\n267\n00:13:45.236 --> 00:13:47.260\nNow, there's a couple of other things,\n\n268\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.900\nwell there's quite a few\nother things they call out.\n\n269\n00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.200\nBut the next one here guys is called,\ninterfaced monitoring.\n\n270\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.820\nAnd when we look at interfaced monitoring\nsome of this technology can get very\n\n271\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.570\nexpensive very quick.\n\n272\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.060\nOne of the ones that I want\nto kind of call out, because\n\n273\n00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.760\nI don't know if it's going to be on\nthe exam specifically because there are so\n\n274\n00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.120\nmany third party utilities and\nso many great ones.\n\n275\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.640\nI know that we kind of talk\nabout solar winds a lot.\n\n276\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.110\nGreat utility,\nthey got a lot of good utilities.\n\n277\n00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.190\nGuys these aren't cheap.\n\n278\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.200\nRight?\nThat's one of the reasons.\n\n279\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.651\n&gt;&gt; I see you're starts at $2,895.\n\n280\n00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:19.710\n&gt;&gt; Yea, yea you like that exact.\n\n281\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.750\nSo it's very, very expensive.\n\n282\n00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.850\nBut, with these network monitors.\n\n283\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.790\nThis one is called network\nperformance monitor.\n\n284\n00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.090\nBut it is an interface monitor.\n\n285\n00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.830\nIn fact it's monitoring more\nthan just a single interface.\n\n286\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.770\nIt's monitoring your whole network and.\n\n287\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.400\nWell why?\n\n288\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.370\nYou can see right here and\nI get I'm not making any money off this.\n\n289\n00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.450\nBut these are really good products.\n\n290\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.360\nReduced network outages, right.\n\n291\n00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.440\nProactive administration rather\nthan reactive administration.\n\n292\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.330\nAnd that's one of the good things\nabout interface monitoring.\n\n293\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.120\nI don't wanna wait til my web server's\noverburdened by a Black Friday\n\n294\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.200\nsale, right?\n\n295\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.380\nI wanna know that, and plan for\n\n296\n00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.940\nthat, and see where the capacity for\nproviding those services are now.\n\n297\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.680\nSo that I can prepare for\n\n298\n00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.320\nmaybe that explosive growth that'll\nhappen Friday night or whatever.\n\n299\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.090\nSo, I can see that information\nthere with one of those, too.\n\n300\n00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.680\nAnd there's so many different\nthings that this does, right?\n\n301\n00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.530\nTopology and dependency awareness,\ndynamic wireless networks as well,\n\n302\n00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.760\nwireless network monitoring.\n\n303\n00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.420\nThe more features that it has,\nit usually means the price goes up a lot.\n\n304\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.008\nAnd these are enterprise-level\ntechnologies.\n\n305\n00:15:23.008 --> 00:15:27.313\nSo you say, well, if I don't have $4000 or\n\n306\n00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:32.650\n$2000 to implement one of\nthese interface monitors.\n\n307\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.706\nIs there anything that might\nbe built into the the system?\n\n308\n00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:41.929\nAnd there is, I don't think this is\nexactly what they're calling out, but\n\n309\n00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:47.314\nwe do have something that does allow you\nto kind of monitor your interface, and\n\n310\n00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:53.054\nsomething called Netstat and it has been\nin Windows, and I believe it's in Linux.\n\n311\n00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:54.684\nI think it's in Linux as well.\n\n312\n00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:57.490\nHere in netstat, so for\ninstance, what do I wanna do?\n\n313\n00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.220\nMaybe I wanna monitor things\nlike unicast transmissions.\n\n314\n00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.450\nI wanna know have we\nhad fragmented packets?\n\n315\n00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.440\nHave we had things that\nhave been discarded?\n\n316\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.310\nWell, I can actually do this, and\nI can say netstat -e, and I can run that.\n\n317\n00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.240\nAnd the -e guys, by the way,\nreally just means Ethernet,\n\n318\n00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.000\nshort for Ethernet statistics.\n\n319\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.170\nAnd notice I can see things,\nUnicast packets that are sent.\n\n320\n00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:25.050\nI can see byte-wise how many bytes\nI've sent, discards, errors.\n\n321\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.280\nAnd then, well, unknown protocols.\n\n322\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.630\nI don't know how we'd classify\nthem other than unknown.\n\n323\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.100\nI have no clue what they are.\n\n324\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.852\nBut NetStat-\n&gt;&gt; Apparently neither does it.\n\n325\n00:16:32.852 --> 00:16:34.245\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And apparently netstat's not\n\n326\n00:16:34.245 --> 00:16:36.030\nsmart enough to know that either.\n\n327\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.903\nBut I can monitor the interface right?\n\n328\n00:16:37.903 --> 00:16:39.440\nYou can do a little bit more with this.\n\n329\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.474\nYou can do this by protocol also.\n\n330\n00:16:41.474 --> 00:16:45.167\nIf I run netstat, and I wanna say,\nhey, I wanna know everything.\n\n331\n00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.693\nThat's ports and\nstuff that are open right now, and\n\n332\n00:16:47.693 --> 00:16:49.710\nwhat's the state of their connections.\n\n333\n00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.630\nI can do a -a, and boy,\nthis one's gonna take a while.\n\n334\n00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.369\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and just\nCtrl+C this cuz there's other information\n\n335\n00:16:57.369 --> 00:16:59.610\nthat's down there and that's UDP as well.\n\n336\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.709\nBut this is just looking at\nthe state of the connections, right?\n\n337\n00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:05.917\nListening, I could've established\na connection with one of these\n\n338\n00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:06.882\nprotocols before.\n\n339\n00:17:06.882 --> 00:17:10.143\nAnd I'm still listening for\nan inbound communication.\n\n340\n00:17:10.143 --> 00:17:11.910\nI tell you what, let's do this.\n\n341\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:19.190\nLet's go ahead and let's connect to\n\n342\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.530\ncuz you should always surf on a server,\nright?\n\n343\n00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.030\nLet me see.\n\n344\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.015\n&gt;&gt; They really don't like that.\n\n345\n00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:27.096\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:17:27.096 --> 00:17:27.860\n&gt;&gt; No, they don't like this.\n\n347\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.390\nGuys, you shouldn't\nsurfing on your server.\n\n348\n00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.670\nPlease understand that this is in\na lab and demonstration environment.\n\n349\n00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:41.032\nSo and let me see here, Add,\nAdd, get through all our Adds.\n\n350\n00:17:41.032 --> 00:17:44.938\nEnhanced security configuration,\nand we'll Add that for now.\n\n351\n00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:48.520\nAnd boy, I tell you what, at the end of\nthis episode I'm definitely rolling Mr.\n\n352\n00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.020\nRebec for sure.\n\n353\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.220\nSo now if I run that netstat -a,\n\n354\n00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:57.440\nI should find here in a bit that I\ndo have one that is established.\n\n355\n00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.016\nLooks like I got a TIME_WAIT here,\nSRVR2.0.\n\n356\n00:18:01.016 --> 00:18:01.774\nThere we go, okay.\n\n357\n00:18:01.774 --> 00:18:03.321\nSo we can see some established connection.\n\n358\n00:18:03.321 --> 00:18:07.418\nSo again netstat is not, I think in\nthe context that they're saying,\n\n359\n00:18:07.418 --> 00:18:09.410\ninterface monitoring here.\n\n360\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.270\nWhere you quite literally can watch\nnot only a single interface, but\n\n361\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:15.960\na lot of interfaces on your networks.\n\n362\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.797\nAnd really see things like your net flow,\n\n363\n00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:23.290\nhow the information is flowing\nacross the network as well.\n\n364\n00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.250\nAll right, so\nSolarWinds an example of a technology.\n\n365\n00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.230\nWe also have things like netstat as well.\n\n366\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.310\nAll right, so\n\n367\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.868\nthe next thing that they also call out\nare what are known as port scanners.\n\n368\n00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:36.589\nAll right,\nnow when it comes to port scanners,\n\n369\n00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:38.193\nit's exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n370\n00:18:38.193 --> 00:18:40.828\nWe have TCP/IP based ports.\n\n371\n00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:46.380\nThe ports, it really defines the end\npoint of a logical connection.\n\n372\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.500\nWhen I need to know where I'm gonna send\nthat information to a service on a server,\n\n373\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.910\nit's designated a lot of times by\nthe protocol, the IP address, and\n\n374\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.470\nthen the port number associated, right?\n\n375\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.900\nWe call them sockets, we've talked\nabout that in our OSI model there.\n\n376\n00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.690\nThat when I establish a communication\nbetween two network aware applications,\n\n377\n00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.570\nwe use what's known as a socket, right?\n\n378\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.660\nAnd again, it's a protocol,\nit's an IP address, and\n\n379\n00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.330\nthen on the end, it's a port value.\n\n380\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.518\nWell, port scanners,\nyou have to understand, are good for\n\n381\n00:19:13.518 --> 00:19:15.092\nquite a few reasons, right?\n\n382\n00:19:15.092 --> 00:19:19.060\nMost of these utilities, and we gotta\ntell you this, heads up, are systems\n\n383\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.528\nadministration utilities that can also be\nused to, basically abused, if you will.\n\n384\n00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:26.405\nAnd they can be really hacking utilities.\n\n385\n00:19:26.405 --> 00:19:30.100\nSo from a network monitoring standpoint,\nnot as in a hacking or\n\n386\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.566\nattacking standpoint,\n\n387\n00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:36.290\nport scanners are great to find out what\nservices are running on your network.\n\n388\n00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.480\nOr maybe not just your network,\nmaybe a specific end point.\n\n389\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:45.630\nSo for instance, if I was to, actually\nI've got Nmap running on this machine.\n\n390\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.455\nNmap is one of those there,\nlet me see if I can.\n\n391\n00:19:48.455 --> 00:19:50.850\nI tell you what, we'll run a new one here.\n\n392\n00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:56.120\nSo we'll do a nmap -v,\n\n393\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.160\nand then we will do -pn,\nand then we'll put a host.\n\n394\n00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.977\nWe're gonna scan a target here.\n\n395\n00:20:02.977 --> 00:20:07.320\nLet's see if I can remember that IP\naddress, and we'll go ahead and run this.\n\n396\n00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.650\nAnd you can see that it's\nbeginning a very basic scan, guys.\n\n397\n00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.170\nI'm not trying to fool you here.\n\n398\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.770\nThis is a very basic scan, and\nit shows me the open ports here.\n\n399\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.256\nI can see, for instance,\nI can see port 135,\n\n400\n00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:25.838\nthat's Microsoft remote procedure call,\nrpc.\n\n401\n00:20:25.838 --> 00:20:30.957\nYou can see things like your netbios,\nyou can see 445.\n\n402\n00:20:30.957 --> 00:20:33.079\nvmrdp, which is kinda interesting,\n\n403\n00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:37.067\nI think that's a VMWare edition of\nremote desktop protocol, as well.\n\n404\n00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:39.766\nSo then we got PORT 3389 and that's open.\n\n405\n00:20:39.766 --> 00:20:42.640\nAnd I know it sounds weird,\nIt's like Microsoft what server?\n\n406\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.140\nThat's actually the listening side of\nthe remote desktop connection software.\n\n407\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.398\nThis is the server side.\n\n408\n00:20:48.398 --> 00:20:52.036\nAnd understand that basically what a\nserver means is, it doesn't mean that it's\n\n409\n00:20:52.036 --> 00:20:54.883\ngotta be an expensive machine that\ncost thousands of dollars and\n\n410\n00:20:54.883 --> 00:20:56.220\nit's a real beefy computer.\n\n411\n00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.360\nIt just means that it's\nlistening to provide a service.\n\n412\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.214\nAnd remote desktop does that.\n\n413\n00:21:01.214 --> 00:21:04.140\nWhoever you're connecting to\nis essentially the server.\n\n414\n00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.440\nDoesn't matter if it's a client or\nan actual, physical, server-based machine.\n\n415\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.410\nAnd I could even see things\nlike the MAC address, too.\n\n416\n00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.040\nAnd with this Nmap, you can really,\n\n417\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.130\nreally get fancy with some of\nthe scans that you can do.\n\n418\n00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.020\nIn fact, I give props here to Daniel.\n\n419\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.230\nDan has an episode that you guys\nneed to go check out with Nmap,\n\n420\n00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.100\nwhere you really can get complex\nwith what you're scanning here.\n\n421\n00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.520\nAgain, in the concept of Net Plus and\n\n422\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.510\nnet monitoring, you don't have to worry\nabout knowing individual switches or any.\n\n423\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.200\nJust understand what Nmap is doing.\n\n424\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.670\nAgain, it's an open source port\nscanner that you can have access to.\n\n425\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:46.870\nI believe it's www.nmap.org,\nI believe, is where you can go to, and\n\n426\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:47.980\nyou can download this free.\n\n427\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.320\nThere is a little bit of a warning and\na disclaimer we gotta be careful with.\n\n428\n00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.740\nSee, the people in the network, the people\nthat administer to this network here at\n\n429\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.510\nITProTV know that I'm doing a port scan.\n\n430\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:04.035\nI made sure it was okay before we\never shot this episode to run a port\n\n431\n00:22:04.035 --> 00:22:05.320\nscan against one of our machines.\n\n432\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.330\nIf you're in a business environment, and\n\n433\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.840\nyou run one of these port\nscanners on your network, you\n\n434\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:16.030\ncould have some kind of legal consequences\nthat might ensue, I don't know.\n\n435\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.230\nMake sure you're running\nthis only on your network\n\n436\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.670\nagainst approved target on your network.\n\n437\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.757\nDo not just think that you can fire one\nof these at work and say, I wanna go and\n\n438\n00:22:25.757 --> 00:22:27.173\nsee what's on my network.\n\n439\n00:22:27.173 --> 00:22:29.580\nIt might actually do damage.\n\n440\n00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.330\nIf you have intrusion\nprevention systems or\n\n441\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.470\nprotection systems on your network, these\nport scans flag as a potential attack.\n\n442\n00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.660\nAnd you could cause some problems,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n443\n00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.750\nNow if you want something that is\nmaybe against just a single machine,\n\n444\n00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:45.530\nyou wanna find out, right?\n\n445\n00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.540\nI don't know,\ndoes my machine here have open ports?\n\n446\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.830\nWell, there also have some online versions\nof types that you can run as well.\n\n447\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.895\nSo for instance, if you've ever\nbeen to this site, whatsmyip.org,\n\n448\n00:22:57.895 --> 00:23:01.302\nwe use this a lot of times to\nfind out what our external IP is.\n\n449\n00:23:01.302 --> 00:23:02.213\nAnd you can go even farther.\n\n450\n00:23:02.213 --> 00:23:04.460\nYou can do things like\nlocation searches and\n\n451\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.230\nfind where you are on a map\nbased on your IP address.\n\n452\n00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.880\nBut you can also do port scans, too, and\nthey've got different types of tests.\n\n453\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.360\nAnd these tests, understand,\n\n454\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.950\nguys, don't necessarily mean that you're\ntrying to protect yourself from attack.\n\n455\n00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:19.950\nMaybe I'm helping a customer\nset up a gaming system, and\n\n456\n00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.600\nI need certain ports open.\n\n457\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.340\nAre those ports open?\n\n458\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.525\nHeck if I know, let's find out.\n\n459\n00:23:24.525 --> 00:23:26.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I might.\n\n460\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.620\nAnd then it goes through\na series of common, in this case,\n\n461\n00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.010\nonline gaming platforms that\nneed certain ports open.\n\n462\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.950\nWhat those ports are I don't know, but\n\n463\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.720\nyou can see that it's essentially\ntrying to hit my system.\n\n464\n00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.430\nAnd then find out of those\nports are open or not.\n\n465\n00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.130\nSo Dan, what would you say?\n\n466\n00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.470\nLike I said, I know you've\nused things like this before.\n\n467\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.250\nWith all of these time-outs here,\nwhat do you think?\n\n468\n00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.280\nDo you think I'm set up for\nsome kind of gaming rig?\n\n469\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're probably not\nready to go on that there, Wes.\n\n470\n00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.545\nYou gotta little bit of set up to go.\n\n471\n00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:58.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, so you can\nsee it, at least from this standpoint.\n\n472\n00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.900\nAgain, you can use these\nto help customers, right?\n\n473\n00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:05.190\nMaybe a customer says, I don't know\nwhy something isn't communicating on\n\n474\n00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.120\na gaming platform or gaming rig, right?\n\n475\n00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.010\nSo you can use these as well.\n\n476\n00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.950\nThere's other ones out there,\nthere's one that's been out there forever.\n\n477\n00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.730\nSteve Gibson out there at Gibson Research\ncompany's got one called SheildsUP!\n\n478\n00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.440\nAnd this one's actually doing it for\nthe purposes, and\n\n479\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.400\nyou can read a disclaimer here.\n\n480\n00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.600\nThis is actually doing it to see,\nhow safe is your computer?\n\n481\n00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.520\nIt does the same thing.\n\n482\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.760\nIt runs a port scan, and\nyou gotta do a little waiver there.\n\n483\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.180\nAgain, because you're telling the company\nit's okay to scan against your system.\n\n484\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.760\nIf you don't have the permission, again,\nyou could get in trouble with these.\n\n485\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.290\nBut they have very, very valid usases,\nusages, if I can say that, on our network.\n\n486\n00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:46.894\nWe need these systems to tell\nwhat's going across our networks.\n\n487\n00:24:46.894 --> 00:24:50.800\nAnd really to find out things like what\nservices are available on the network.\n\n488\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.948\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\n\n489\n00:24:51.948 --> 00:24:54.582\nI'm looking at our list of\ntopics that we have to go over.\n\n490\n00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:56.700\nAnd then I glanced over at our clock.\n\n491\n00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.964\nAnd the two are not vibing right now,\nso our clock's well out of time.\n\n492\n00:25:00.964 --> 00:25:03.650\nAnd we have a whole laundry\nlist of items to go through.\n\n493\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.930\nSo it looks like we're in for\nat least another part.\n\n494\n00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.980\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n495\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.425\nThanks so much for explaining things like\nport scanners, using protocol analyzers,\n\n496\n00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:12.300\nbig topics, right?\n\n497\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.265\nThat's stuff that you need to\nknow as a network technician.\n\n498\n00:25:15.265 --> 00:25:19.132\nAnd for someone who's trying to pass\nmaybe the Network+ exam as well.\n\n499\n00:25:19.132 --> 00:25:22.131\nThat being said, it looks, like I said,\nour clock is well out of time.\n\n500\n00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:23.766\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n501\n00:25:23.766 --> 00:25:26.165\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie\n\n502\n00:25:26.165 --> 00:25:26.874\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n503\n00:25:26.874 --> 00:25:29.023\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n504\n00:25:29.023 --> 00:25:35.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n505\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.456\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.090\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.176\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.176 --> 00:00:16.920\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.600\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well you knew it.\n\n7\n00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.060\nWe are back for more of that Network+, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.680\nof course that's what\nwe're dishing out today.\n\n9\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.570\nComing back in the studio with us today,\nour good friend, our mentor, and\n\n10\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.300\nthe king slinger of hash that is Network+,\nis Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.730\nWes, welcome back sir, how you doing?\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Man, I'm doing great.\n\n13\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620\nAs always, good to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.680\nThat's right, we are moving\nthrough part two, and we are going\n\n15\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.940\nto pretty much just pick up where we\nleft off in the first part of this.\n\n16\n00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.860\nWe dealt with a few different tools.\n\n17\n00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.580\nWe talked about things like port scanners.\n\n18\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.960\nWe talked about protocol analyzers.\n\n19\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.135\nWell, and we also showed you\nthings like Nmap and stuff, and\n\n20\n00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.198\neven some online scans that you can do.\n\n21\n00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:57.050\nWe talked a little bit about\ninterface monitoring, as well.\n\n22\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.000\nKeep in mind, guys, most of these\nutilities that can monitor the entire\n\n23\n00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900\nnetwork, they're typically really,\nreally expensive.\n\n24\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.160\nYou do find some out there,\n\n25\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.420\nthank goodness, we've got some out\nthere that fall under the lovely GPL.\n\n26\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.140\nSo we have some open source software\nout there as well, like Nmap.\n\n27\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.410\nSo definitely check those guys out and\nthen come on back here to this episode.\n\n28\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.220\nAs for this episode,\n\n29\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.040\nwe're gonna start this off with\nanother monitoring protocol, really.\n\n30\n00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.870\nI mean this protocol's got many\ntechnologies just built all around it, and\n\n31\n00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.930\nthat's something known as the simple\nnetwork management protocol.\n\n32\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.340\nAnd there's quite a few moving\npieces in this when it comes\n\n33\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.360\nto getting it set up and\nkinda understanding what's going on.\n\n34\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.150\nSo I've got a little diagram here.\n\n35\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240\nIf we could take a look at it real\nquick we'll kinda walk through\n\n36\n00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.240\nthese pieces here.\n\n37\n00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.340\nAnd we'll really zoom in here and\nlook at what we have.\n\n38\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.640\nSNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol.\n\n39\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.700\nReally, what it boils down\nto is a way to keep track\n\n40\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890\nof the status of your different\nnetwork devices across the network.\n\n41\n00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.860\nAnd what they have is they\nhave what are known as SNMP\n\n42\n00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.530\nagents that are running on them.\n\n43\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.890\nAnd periodically, after you have this set\nup, what they will do is they will report\n\n44\n00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.060\ncertain parameters depending\non how you set it up.\n\n45\n00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.700\nThey'll report different parameters\nback into a management station.\n\n46\n00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.600\nAnd the management station is where we\ncan view the results of those reports.\n\n47\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.370\nOne of the great things,\n\n48\n00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.980\ntoo, is that we can also do\nthings like sending out alerts.\n\n49\n00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.623\nIf you find out things like your\nuptime on a device that maybe you\n\n50\n00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:23.118\nwere expecting the uptime to be 17 days.\n\n51\n00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:24.996\nCuz it's been a long time\nsince you rebooted it and\n\n52\n00:02:24.996 --> 00:02:27.230\nyou find that it's only been up for\ntwo hours.\n\n53\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.010\nWell that two hours, that could've been 6,\n5, 4 in the morning and\n\n54\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.030\nyou weren't there at the time,\nso you weren't even aware of it.\n\n55\n00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.400\nSo it is good to have alerts as well.\n\n56\n00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.160\nNow, when we look at\nthe different components in here,\n\n57\n00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880\nthey talk about a couple\nof different things.\n\n58\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.967\nOne of the things they call out\nis what's known as an SNMP trap.\n\n59\n00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:54.492\nSNMP traps basically, what's happening\nhere guys is the agent is sending\n\n60\n00:02:54.492 --> 00:03:00.700\nthat information into a centralized\nmanagement station that is the SNMP trap.\n\n61\n00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.630\nAnd what it's doing it's essentially just\nsending these unsolicited SNMP messages.\n\n62\n00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.890\nAnd what it does is it essentially has\nthe warnings of significant events.\n\n63\n00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.430\nIt doesn't have to be warnings just It\ngenerates the significant events that have\n\n64\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.260\ngone on,\nbased on what you were looking at.\n\n65\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.690\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's talk about another concept here.\n\n66\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.900\nAnd that is something known as an OID.\n\n67\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.668\nThe OID are the parameters that\nthis agent is sending via the trap,\n\n68\n00:03:34.668 --> 00:03:38.500\ndown into the management station.\n\n69\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.410\nAnd these OIDs,\nthey're called object identifiers.\n\n70\n00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.260\nWhen we look at the object identifiers,\nsometimes it's kinda hard to tell what's\n\n71\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.760\ngoing on cuz they're not really in\nanything that's human readable.\n\n72\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.700\nReally, if we kinda look at,\nI think I've got an OID down here.\n\n73\n00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.050\nYeah, so Dan, I just got a report here.\n\n74\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.700\nI've collected the OID, and\nI need to interpret what this means.\n\n75\n00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.920\nCan you help me out with that number?\n\n76\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.605\n&gt;&gt; Sure,\ncuz I know exactly what that number means\n\n77\n00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:08.330\nJust give me a second to think\nabout it on my computer.\n\n78\n00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.815\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we've got to Google it.\n\n79\n00:04:10.815 --> 00:04:13.715\nAnd he's absolutely right,\nI would have no clue.\n\n80\n00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:17.855\nSo the OIDs, they're not really in\nanything that is human readable.\n\n81\n00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:22.285\nAnd that's why we need things like MIB,\nmanagement information bases,\n\n82\n00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:26.740\nthat actually contain a listing,\na database of these OIDs.\n\n83\n00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.420\nAnd we need some kind of software,\n\n84\n00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.400\nthat allows us to interpret what\nwe are actually seeing here.\n\n85\n00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.030\nBut I do wanna kinda talk just briefly\nabout the hierarchical tree, essentially,\n\n86\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.590\nthat these OIDs or object identifiers are.\n\n87\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.500\nWhen we break it down there's actually\na method to the madness that's\n\n88\n00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.710\nkind of interesting.\n\n89\n00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.920\nAgain, I don't know if they're gonna go in\nto this detail when you get into the exam.\n\n90\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.120\nBut not only is it good to know here\nat Net+, so that when you move on\n\n91\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.780\nif this becomes a leaping stone\nto additional certifications.\n\n92\n00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.940\nYou'll be aware, at least aware, of what\nSNMP is rather than just saying hey,\n\n93\n00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.020\nSimple Network Management Protocol.\n\n94\n00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.910\nIt allows you to manage your\ndevices over the network.\n\n95\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.700\nSo if you look from left to right, you'll\nsee that we have this hierarchical nature.\n\n96\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.190\nAnd certain portions of this,\n\n97\n00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.150\njust like we kinda talk about when we\ntalked about IPv6 in another episode.\n\n98\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.950\nWe talked about that routing prefix and\nthat it's hierarchical.\n\n99\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.460\nIt goes all the way up to INA.\n\n100\n00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.240\nThen internet backbone providers,\nto regional, and then local ISPs.\n\n101\n00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.320\nRight, locally like us, we have GRU and\nCox Communication here, right?\n\n102\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.460\nSo that's what you're seeing here.\n\n103\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.930\nYou're seeing ISO, International\nOrganization of Standardization,\n\n104\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.108\nup at the top, right?\n\n105\n00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:39.250\nNow this ISO-identified organization\ncould be somebody that is, for\n\n106\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.160\ninstance, anybody that goes to the ISO and\nsays, hey.\n\n107\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.040\nWe have products that we\nwant to have included,\n\n108\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.620\nor parameters included in those\nmanagement information bases.\n\n109\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.688\nAnd, again,\n\n110\n00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:59.033\nyou have to go to the ISO in order to\nhave that included in part of the OID.\n\n111\n00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:00.944\nNow, depending on who you go to,\n\n112\n00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.510\nI've seen this actually written\na couple of different ways.\n\n113\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.360\nThat third one being DOD,\nDepartment of Defense.\n\n114\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.740\nI've also seen in called the IEEE portion,\ntoo.\n\n115\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.320\nThen we have internet, private.\n\n116\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.720\nApparently I don't know how to\nspell private so let's try that.\n\n117\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.150\nPrivate then something\nspecific to your enterprise.\n\n118\n00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.690\nAnd then finally we get down\nto system level information.\n\n119\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.360\nAs well as what specifically it is\nwithin the system that you want to\n\n120\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.690\nkind of find and get that information.\n\n121\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.170\nSo that's a little about the OIDs.\n\n122\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.700\nThe MIBS, again, it's just a database\nof hierarchical management information.\n\n123\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.950\nWe want you to keep that in mind.\n\n124\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.190\nThe trap, again,\nis just the way the agents here,\n\n125\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.320\nthey keep the management\nstation up to date\n\n126\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.630\non any kind of significant events\nthat have gone on, they're on them.\n\n127\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.180\nThe next thing that we gotta\ntalk about is you know\n\n128\n00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.610\nhow do we get the information, all right?\n\n129\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.030\nWell it's with what's known\nas an SNMP GET message.\n\n130\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.300\nAnd what it does,\nit's a request sent by a manager.\n\n131\n00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.860\nAnd you send it out to the device,\nthe get parameter.\n\n132\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.580\nAnd it allows the management\nstation to retrieve one or\n\n133\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.740\nmore values from the device itself.\n\n134\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.450\nIn fact, we can kinda show you here.\n\n135\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.200\nWe're going to look at\nalso an SMNP walk does.\n\n136\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.530\nThe SMNP walk allows you to view\na portion of the OID tree hierarchy.\n\n137\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.680\nAnd you can get individual\ninformation if you want, as well.\n\n138\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.480\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nlet me show you that.\n\n139\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.540\nI've actually got a sent server,\nand it is online.\n\n140\n00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.182\nLet me see if I can remember\nwhat the IP address is here.\n\n141\n00:07:40.182 --> 00:07:43.608\nLet me go ahead and\nget logged in here to it.\n\n142\n00:07:46.588 --> 00:07:50.652\nAll right, and then we'll show\nyou kinda what we mean here.\n\n143\n00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:56.014\nAll right, so\nif I want to find out The parameters or\n\n144\n00:07:56.014 --> 00:08:01.003\nsee this hierarchical OID,\nthen what I can do is\n\n145\n00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:06.360\nI can do something like snmpwalk,\nall right?\n\n146\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.900\nAnd we can put the version,\n\n147\n00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.090\nwe'll talk about those version\nnumbers here in a second.\n\n148\n00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.790\nAnd I can do what the version is.\n\n149\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.170\nAnd then I'll talk about the community\nstring here in a second, but then I can\n\n150\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.928\ntype in, I'll go ahead and mention that\nhere, the community string is interesting.\n\n151\n00:08:20.928 --> 00:08:22.130\nIn version two,\n\n152\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.380\nin order to protect this information\ncuz there is sensitive information in\n\n153\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.440\ndoing one of these SNMP walks,\nversion two2 isn't really that secure.\n\n154\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.550\nIt's okay for very secure environments,\n\n155\n00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.720\nbut all new deployments really should\nbe using SNMP version three cuz it\n\n156\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.500\nadds things like your authentication\nas well, so it's more complex to setup.\n\n157\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.100\nVersion two here is a little\nbit less complex to setup, but\n\n158\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.430\nagain not quite as secure.\n\n159\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.760\nSo new deployments really\nshouldn't be using version two.\n\n160\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.680\nThey should be really using version three.\n\n161\n00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.050\nAll right, so when I put in this\ncommunity string, again keep in mind,\n\n162\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.055\nit's kinda like a password.\n\n163\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.390\nWe'll go ahead and do this.\n\n164\n00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:09.580\nAnd you could see how easy this is to\njust rattle off in a command prompt.\n\n165\n00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:15.120\nNow, when I run this, what we're seeing\nhere are the individual OIDs, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.210\nAnd, remember I said\nthat it's hierarchical.\n\n167\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.800\nDepending on how you set\nthis up depends on how\n\n168\n00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.000\nmuch information do you want\nto give somebody access to?\n\n169\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.010\nAll right, so for instance,\nif I was to do, let's go ahead and\n\n170\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.900\nlook at some of that information here.\n\n171\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.520\nIt's down in the etsy folder here.\n\n172\n00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.936\nLet's see, SNMP.\n\n173\n00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:35.588\nI believe that's where it is.\n\n174\n00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:39.720\nYou know what?\n\n175\n00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.410\nMaybe I don't have that right.\n\n176\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.417\netc/snmp, My caps.\n\n177\n00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:48.400\n&gt;&gt; Having a little trouble\nwith that caps lock.\n\n178\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.176\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I am.\n\n179\n00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:52.180\nIt definitely, there we go.\n\n180\n00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:52.740\nThere we go.\n\n181\n00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.465\nYes, yes.\n\n182\n00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:55.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That caps lock did not like me.\n\n183\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.360\nSo if I get into the comp file over here.\n\n184\n00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.720\nLet's kind of talk about a little bit\nmore about what we are seeing here.\n\n185\n00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.120\nWe've got our individual users,\nthat we are going to assign to groups.\n\n186\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.960\nAnd then what we do is we\nconfigure these groups and\n\n187\n00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.260\ngive them certain amount of access\nto the OID hierarchy, all right?\n\n188\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.530\nNow notice that we have\nthis community up here?\n\n189\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.490\nThese community strings are kind\nof like a pre-shared key?\n\n190\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.360\nIt's kind of like a password, all right?\n\n191\n00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.189\nAnd I want to protect that information,\nsee?\n\n192\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.720\nVersion 2c is a little bit more secure or\na lot more secure than version 1 but\n\n193\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.410\nnot quite as secure as version three.\n\n194\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.130\nSo at least we have\na little bit of security.\n\n195\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.610\nAgain, it's still relatively weak.\n\n196\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.120\nSo when I wanna do in SNMP walk, first of\nall, I've gotta be one these users, right?\n\n197\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.600\nThat's why we do things like\na row-based access control,\n\n198\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.100\nwe have essential ACLs all\nthrough any operating system.\n\n199\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.100\nWell, I have to be a part of this group\nin order to have access, all right?\n\n200\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.000\nAnd notice the OIDs here?\n\n201\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.212\nNotice that we've got one.\n\n202\n00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:58.483\nI've got one configured as the AllView,\none configured as just the SystemView.\n\n203\n00:10:58.483 --> 00:11:02.813\nNow, in the AllView,\nnotice where the number,\n\n204\n00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:07.151\nthe OID starts and\nstops right at the beginning.\n\n205\n00:11:07.151 --> 00:11:12.157\nWhat that means is I'm going to let\nthem see every single portion of the OID\n\n206\n00:11:12.157 --> 00:11:17.460\nhierarchy cuz I'm saying,\neverything from one, well, guess what?\n\n207\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.810\nThe ISO is the one that defines 1,\nthat will never change,\n\n208\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.620\nit's always gonna start with 1 so what\nyou're saying is let them see everything.\n\n209\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.140\nAnd that's why I've\ncalled the the AllView.\n\n210\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.350\nNow, SystemView here, I've just got it\nset up for a portion of the hierarchy and\n\n211\n00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.700\na little bit more of the hierarchy.\n\n212\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.410\nSo they get a little bit more information,\nbut they don't get all the information.\n\n213\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.490\nThat might be for some, and which is why,\nI have according to the names here I've\n\n214\n00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.190\ngot one set up for help desk and\nI've got one set up for admins, right?\n\n215\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:47.140\nDan's the admin, I want him to\nsee all the information in there.\n\n216\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.460\nYou don't wanna restrict that.\n\n217\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.354\nBut if it's somebody that\nyou're calling you say, well,\n\n218\n00:11:50.354 --> 00:11:52.430\nI don't know I'm having a hard time.\n\n219\n00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.000\nMaybe they're running Apache on\nthis set box or Red Hat, right?\n\n220\n00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.960\nThey're running Apache,\nthey've got a web server and\n\n221\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.580\nit's not performing appropriately.\n\n222\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.230\nWell, we can call helpdesk to tel them\nto an snmpwalk or even better connect to\n\n223\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.540\na management interface,\nwhich will explain what these OIDs are.\n\n224\n00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.880\nSo we don't have to do like Dan was going\nto do a minute ago and hit Google, right?\n\n225\n00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.490\nBecause if we don't have that,\nthat's exactly what you'll be doing.\n\n226\n00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.730\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n227\n00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.460\nYou do have pieces of software.\n\n228\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.500\nNow I've got a management software that'\nactually stored on my server box here.\n\n229\n00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.000\nIt's running Windows Server,\nwe get logged in here.\n\n230\n00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.620\nAnd if I go to the management console.\n\n231\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.335\nAnd I go to monitoring, all right.\n\n232\n00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:38.691\nDan, you recognize what we were looking at\nthere before compared to what we see here?\n\n233\n00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:39.586\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n\n234\n00:12:39.586 --> 00:12:43.985\n&gt;&gt; Right, so we've got essentially,\nthese are all your OIDs.\n\n235\n00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:46.610\n[LAUGH] Your OIDs are here.\n\n236\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:52.050\nNotice that they tell us in\nthese more human friendly terms,\n\n237\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.760\nwhat the heck that crazy\nnumber even means?\n\n238\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.600\nAnd that's what you can see\nthat they're mapping here.\n\n239\n00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.430\nAnd that's why one of the pieces\nof software here that allows\n\n240\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.330\nyour devices to forward out\n\n241\n00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.290\ntheir SNMP to that management station\njust like a management station like this.\n\n242\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.580\nTypically they have some kind\nof human readable interface, so\n\n243\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.490\nit makes a little bit more\nsense of what's going on here.\n\n244\n00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.810\nAll right, so, real quick recap too.\n\n245\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:22.430\nThat's really what I would think you\nneed to know about SNMP on the exam.\n\n246\n00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.960\nDo understand what it's doing.\n\n247\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.630\nUnderstand a little bit about,\nlike we talked about the trap,\n\n248\n00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.540\nthe GET, Walk and the MIBs.\n\n249\n00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.680\nThe other thing is also\nunderstand the versions.\n\n250\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.900\nVersion 2c, easy to configure,\nnot very secure.\n\n251\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.430\nYou use those community strings.\n\n252\n00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.320\nAnd you typically have\ntwo types of communities.\n\n253\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.070\nYou have what's known as a read-only,\nthey'll say an RO community or\n\n254\n00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.250\nyou'll see an RW community.\n\n255\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.790\nIt exactly what it sounds like.\n\n256\n00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.550\nRO means read-only.\n\n257\n00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.317\nThat's something I might\nwanna give to a helpdesk.\n\n258\n00:13:51.317 --> 00:13:53.328\nRead and write configuration changes,\n\n259\n00:13:53.328 --> 00:13:56.826\nthat's something you're gonna\nwanna save for your administrator.\n\n260\n00:13:56.826 --> 00:14:03.462\nSo again it's suitable for private\nnetworks very, very secure networks,\n\n261\n00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:08.240\nagain that whole term could\nbe a bit of a debate as well.\n\n262\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.640\nThere's no such thing as\na secure network but for\n\n263\n00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.720\nbrand new implementation,\nmake sure you use version three.\n\n264\n00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.510\nIt's a little bit more complex to set up,\nbut it allows for\n\n265\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.750\nthings like usernames and passwords.\n\n266\n00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.140\nAnd it's a lot more secure.\n\n267\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.370\nSo if security is definitely a concern,\n\n268\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.470\nwhich it usually is, version 3 is\nthe one you're gonna want to use.\n\n269\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.200\n&gt;&gt; And what's interesting is we talked\nabout SolarWinds in the previous episode.\n\n270\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.640\nSolarWinds is a great monitoring\nstation to work with your SNMP,\n\n271\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.278\nit does a fantastic job on\nthe graphic zone there.\n\n272\n00:14:37.278 --> 00:14:40.643\nI know that it's little expensive,\nit costs a little bit of money but\n\n273\n00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:43.719\nmen if you get the networking,\nand you get infrastructure, so\n\n274\n00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:45.414\nit's definitely worth a cheese.\n\n275\n00:14:45.414 --> 00:14:48.410\nI know I sound like a SolarWinds\nsales rep right now.\n\n276\n00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:51.240\nI've just, I've used it extensively and\nit's always been phenomenal.\n\n277\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.370\nAnd well worth the money you spend on it.\n\n278\n00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, most definitely.\n\n279\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:59.330\nAnd there are other things too like for\ninstance, I don't know, I think it's here.\n\n280\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.199\nNetwork monitoring and,\nI can't find it in here.\n\n281\n00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:11.212\nBut there is a location in here where you\ncan setup things like outbound email and\n\n282\n00:15:11.212 --> 00:15:15.771\nSMS is what I was trying to say,\ntype alerts.\n\n283\n00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:19.962\nAnd so if you're one that's always on\nthe run, we usually always have one or\n\n284\n00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:22.280\ntwo on us at all times as administrators.\n\n285\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.570\nWe usually got our cell phone,\nit's usually got email and\n\n286\n00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.430\nSMS text messages as well.\n\n287\n00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.790\nSo you could set that up likewise, and\nthat's one of the good things about having\n\n288\n00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.470\na utility like this is cuz\nit can make it a lot easier.\n\n289\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:39.798\nNow, Windows doesn't have SNMP natively\nbuilt in, it is a feature that you can\n\n290\n00:15:39.798 --> 00:15:45.541\nturn on, they use something called the\nWindows Management Instrumentation, WMI.\n\n291\n00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:47.872\nThis is their own prietary implementation,\nso\n\n292\n00:15:47.872 --> 00:15:50.737\nit doesn't fall in industry wide standard,\nso it can be.\n\n293\n00:15:50.737 --> 00:15:55.077\nJust as, if not more complex,\nto deal with than an SNMP, and why is it?\n\n294\n00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:58.280\nI'm not picking on Microsoft, I'm not\npicking on Windows, it's a good product.\n\n295\n00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.820\nIt's a good thing to have in your Windows\nbased systems, but anytime you start\n\n296\n00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.470\nto deviate from standards and you're\nnot following like an open standard.\n\n297\n00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.201\nWhat you end up having is some\nkind of situation where it's\n\n298\n00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:12.988\nonly really gonna be supported\nin one infrastructure, and\n\n299\n00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:15.735\nit doesn't seem to have\nconsistency around all vendors.\n\n300\n00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:20.387\nOne thing about SNMP is that\nit is a standardized protocol,\n\n301\n00:16:20.387 --> 00:16:24.213\nits set up and\nits foundation are standardized.\n\n302\n00:16:24.213 --> 00:16:28.660\nSo if you understand one, on a single\nsystem, you will have the basics for\n\n303\n00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.105\nanother system,\nyou'll just have to learn the Syntax or\n\n304\n00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:37.020\nwhatever the operating system like if you\ngo into Cisco how does the IOS set it up?\n\n305\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.200\nConceptionally, there gonna be the same.\n\n306\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.494\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Wes I'm looking at our\nflow our little bulleted list here of\n\n307\n00:16:42.494 --> 00:16:43.946\nthings we're gonna talk about.\n\n308\n00:16:43.946 --> 00:16:47.308\nThe next thing you have is\npacket flow monitoring.\n\n309\n00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:50.683\nI can't say that I've ever\nheard that as a term before.\n\n310\n00:16:50.683 --> 00:16:52.541\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I'm familiar with the concept,\n\n311\n00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:53.700\nbut the term is new.\n\n312\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.060\n&gt;&gt; You probably have.\n\n313\n00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.723\nHave you heard of NetFlow?\n\n314\n00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:56.297\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n315\n00:16:56.297 --> 00:16:59.850\n&gt;&gt; NetFlow, Packet Flow where\nis the information going?\n\n316\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.430\nAnd I actually got, now I'm not\ngonna set this up on our network and\n\n317\n00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:05.930\nhave it start monitoring.\n\n318\n00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.189\nAnd then show you all the lovely-\n&gt;&gt; Come on Wes.\n\n319\n00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.802\n&gt;&gt; Secret traffic.\n\n320\n00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:11.528\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna show you all the YouTube\n\n321\n00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:14.660\nvideos Dan has been watching on\nMartha Stewart Bread Recipe's.\n\n322\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.500\n&gt;&gt; They're really good.\n\n323\n00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.241\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n324\n00:17:16.241 --> 00:17:16.966\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen them?\n\n325\n00:17:16.966 --> 00:17:19.690\nThey're amazing.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's one of the great\n\n326\n00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.390\nthings about NetFlow, if you take a look\nI can see things like one minute data,\n\n327\n00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.570\nautonomous user data, raw data,\n\n328\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:32.870\nsend me an email alert when free disk\nspace goes below a certain percentage.\n\n329\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.900\nSo you basically can get information about\nwhat's happening on your network related\n\n330\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.420\nto your data, and that's something,\nagain, it can be quite expensive.\n\n331\n00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.661\nAnd some of these really\ncan get very expensive.\n\n332\n00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:45.160\nI wonder if the dashboard.\n\n333\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.180\nYeah, let me go to the dashboard.\n\n334\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.391\nThis actually shows it across WAN links,\ntoo.\n\n335\n00:17:48.391 --> 00:17:50.887\nAll right, so there's our information.\n\n336\n00:17:50.887 --> 00:17:53.923\nWe've got a LAN over here in New York.\n\n337\n00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:56.180\nWe've got one there in Georgia, Alabama.\n\n338\n00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.947\nTexas, Mexico, Colorado, California, and\nwell, still California, San Diego there.\n\n339\n00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:06.990\nSo you can also see the conditions of\nlinks and stuff and a lot of alarms there.\n\n340\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.666\nSo basically keeping an eye on\nthat information as it passes\n\n341\n00:18:09.666 --> 00:18:10.688\nacross your network.\n\n342\n00:18:10.688 --> 00:18:14.920\nAnd what is the good thing about\nfinding out packet flow monitoring?\n\n343\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.020\nI wanna find out,\nmaybe I'm going an audit and\n\n344\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.080\nI wanna find out what my\nmost critical systems are.\n\n345\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.170\nWell my voice over IP systems are,\nthey're fairly critical,\n\n346\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.517\nmy email system,\nmaybe some of our databases.\n\n347\n00:18:25.517 --> 00:18:29.981\nBut we can find out exactly what is\nbeing utilised the most on our network,\n\n348\n00:18:29.981 --> 00:18:34.670\nwith a piece of software like this doing\nthings like packet flow monitoring.\n\n349\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.176\nAll right so there's another type of\nlogging when it comes to monitoring your\n\n350\n00:18:40.176 --> 00:18:43.551\ninformation that we have and\nthat's something known as SISLOG.\n\n351\n00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:48.323\nNow with SISLOG, SISLOG is a standard\nthat's pretty much built in to, and\n\n352\n00:18:48.323 --> 00:18:53.018\nDan you might help me out with it here\nI think it's all Unix based systems,\n\n353\n00:18:53.018 --> 00:18:58.780\nLinux as well, and SISLOG just, it's kinda\nlike if you come from a Windows location.\n\n354\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.368\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you on a Windows machine.\n\n355\n00:19:02.368 --> 00:19:06.034\nIf I wanna find out events that\nare going on in my system in Windows,\n\n356\n00:19:06.034 --> 00:19:07.440\nright what do I do?\n\n357\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.217\nWell, I open up event viewer, right.\n\n358\n00:19:09.217 --> 00:19:12.210\nAnd I kinda see what's\ngoing on with the system.\n\n359\n00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.720\nI can get down in here and\nI can open the system logs.\n\n360\n00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.900\nAnd then we got this nice pretty\nGUI that tells me boy, everything\n\n361\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.792\nis dying on this machine apparently a lot\nof errors, all right but I can see that.\n\n362\n00:19:24.792 --> 00:19:26.941\nWell, what do you have when\nyou only have a graphical or\n\n363\n00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:28.738\nyou don't have a graphical user interface?\n\n364\n00:19:28.738 --> 00:19:32.987\nWell, SISLOG is one of those it's\nbuilt into the Unix based systems,\n\n365\n00:19:32.987 --> 00:19:36.530\nthat essentially is doing\npretty close to the same thing.\n\n366\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:42.790\nIn fact In fact, if we go ahead and\nwe do, for instance, a cat\n\n367\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.820\nand what is that, /, oops, /var/log.\n\n368\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.082\nI wanna say it's / messages if I remember,\nyes.\n\n369\n00:19:52.082 --> 00:19:56.090\nPermission denied I guess\nI got to sudu there.\n\n370\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Do sudu and\nthen two exclamation points.\n\n371\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.181\n&gt;&gt; Two exclamation points all right.\n\n372\n00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:02.595\n&gt;&gt; Put a space between them.\n\n373\n00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:06.768\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sudo cat all right there we go.\n\n374\n00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:07.848\nSo sudo.\n\n375\n00:20:07.848 --> 00:20:08.593\n&gt;&gt; You can't do it now.\n\n376\n00:20:08.593 --> 00:20:10.416\n&gt;&gt; No you can't do it now?\n\n377\n00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:13.159\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right two exclamation\npoints will run the previous command.\n\n378\n00:20:14.238 --> 00:20:16.567\n&gt;&gt; And if you do sudo,\ntwo exclamation points.\n\n379\n00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:18.511\n&gt;&gt; Yes-\n&gt;&gt; Little Linux trick there for you.\n\n380\n00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:19.700\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n381\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.640\nThat's what happens when you have your\nhost that's a freaking Linux guru here.\n\n382\n00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.760\nSo bear with me on this one.\n\n383\n00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.684\n[LAUGH] All right, so we'll try that\nagain now that I got root here.\n\n384\n00:20:29.684 --> 00:20:31.104\nWe'll go ahead and do a cat here.\n\n385\n00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:35.590\nWe'll do var/log/messages.\n\n386\n00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.260\nAnd now we'll look at that.\n\n387\n00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.467\nNow notice that it says snmpd\nconnection from certain location,\n\n388\n00:20:41.467 --> 00:20:46.068\nthese are events that are happening\non this machine right now, right?\n\n389\n00:20:46.068 --> 00:20:49.720\nAnd every time some kind of event happens,\nit throws it here into syslog.\n\n390\n00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.956\nIf I run and what is that,\nis it tail option there Dan?\n\n391\n00:20:52.956 --> 00:20:55.772\nI can hit tail and it'll give me\nthe last ten messages I believe.\n\n392\n00:20:55.772 --> 00:20:58.710\n&gt;&gt; Just do tail and\nthe file name that you're looking for.\n\n393\n00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.730\n&gt;&gt; Got you, very cool.\n\n394\n00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.870\nSo, and if you look here,\nagain, all of these,\n\n395\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.570\nit's telling me what's kinda\ngoing on in the machine.\n\n396\n00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.670\nNow, you might say, well,\nwait a second, Wes,\n\n397\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.973\nthat's a really decentralized\ntype of environment.\n\n398\n00:21:09.973 --> 00:21:13.962\nAnd if you're looking it on the local\nmachine, it would really be no different\n\n399\n00:21:13.962 --> 00:21:17.045\nif I was looking at an event\nviewer on a single Window Server,\n\n400\n00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:21.216\none of the great things about syslog is\nyou can actually configure your server, to\n\n401\n00:21:21.216 --> 00:21:25.467\nforward your syslog over to a collection\nlike a centralized collection location.\n\n402\n00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:30.294\nAnd even in that the ops network\nmonitor there that I had,\n\n403\n00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:36.140\nit does support receiving syslogs,\nand being able to view them too.\n\n404\n00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.650\nSo syslogs is another thing\nthat we have in there.\n\n405\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.476\nAnd it is in the Unix based systems.\n\n406\n00:21:42.476 --> 00:21:47.292\nNow that brings me to the next topic\nthat we're gonna talk about, and\n\n407\n00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:53.010\nthat's something known as security\nincidents and event management.\n\n408\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.315\nAnd with these type of systems,\n\n409\n00:21:56.315 --> 00:22:00.485\nthese are typically very expensive,\na lot of moving pieces.\n\n410\n00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:04.135\nBut essentially it's a software that,\nas we can see, can do things like for\n\n411\n00:22:04.135 --> 00:22:08.160\ninstance grab event information\nfrom your operating systems.\n\n412\n00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.504\nApplication data as well.\n\n413\n00:22:09.504 --> 00:22:12.630\nNetwork devices, your databases right.\n\n414\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.130\nSo event level information\nlike we see in event viewer.\n\n415\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.143\nLike we see in syslog here\nin the Unix/unix world.\n\n416\n00:22:20.143 --> 00:22:24.093\nWell it can also grab security information\nlike your perimeter security that's being\n\n417\n00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.450\nmonitored.\n\n418\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.000\nThreat intelligence or\nthreat intel, if you will.\n\n419\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.010\nThings like vulnerability scans,\nasset information, and patch management.\n\n420\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.362\nAnd then all of that information,\n\n421\n00:22:33.362 --> 00:22:35.562\nthat's where the information\nis coming from, right?\n\n422\n00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:37.300\nThat's our system inputs.\n\n423\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.480\nBut then the goal of the Security Incident\nand Event Management software,\n\n424\n00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.830\nor the SIEM software is data\ncollection and then normalization.\n\n425\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.409\nWhat does that mean?\nWell,\n\n426\n00:22:47.409 --> 00:22:51.350\nif you remember we looked at those OIDs\nand I asked Dan about it and he says man,\n\n427\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.790\nI'm gonna hit the search\nengine I have no clue.\n\n428\n00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.230\nWell SIEM's job is to then\ngive us a system output\n\n429\n00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.450\nthat is in something that's human readable\nsomething that makes sense to us.\n\n430\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.955\nAnd we're not just talking\nfrom a specific point.\n\n431\n00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:11.140\nWe're talking about collecting information\nacross your entire infrastructure, right?\n\n432\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.654\nLarge infrastructures that\nare implementing good security practices\n\n433\n00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:18.107\nusually use defense in depth then\nit's not just a single technology,\n\n434\n00:23:18.107 --> 00:23:21.563\nit's a collection of technologies\nthat collaborate together to make\n\n435\n00:23:21.563 --> 00:23:23.457\nsure that your network stays secure.\n\n436\n00:23:23.457 --> 00:23:27.964\nYou also have a lot of other information\nthat might relate to security might just\n\n437\n00:23:27.964 --> 00:23:31.342\nbe about the general performance\nof your network, right?\n\n438\n00:23:31.342 --> 00:23:34.905\nAnd I'm not saying that we're saying, hey,\nis it operating at its peak performance?\n\n439\n00:23:34.905 --> 00:23:37.117\nBut the vent information\nis also important.\n\n440\n00:23:37.117 --> 00:23:41.602\nImagine a centralized location where\nwe can gather all of that data in,\n\n441\n00:23:41.602 --> 00:23:46.162\nit can process that information And\nthen it can show me things like simple\n\n442\n00:23:46.162 --> 00:23:51.120\ngraphs that make it human readable and\nI can tell what is even going on, right?\n\n443\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.407\nSo you got data event analysis,\nincident and event reports, and\n\n444\n00:23:54.407 --> 00:23:57.237\nyou'll also have things\nlike real-time monitoring.\n\n445\n00:23:57.237 --> 00:23:59.673\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, this is all wonderful things.\n\n446\n00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:01.515\nI've actually used AlienVault as a seam.\n\n447\n00:24:01.515 --> 00:24:04.879\nIt's a fantastic thing, you can download,\nplay with it, work with it.\n\n448\n00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:07.636\nIt's pretty simple to get it up and\nrunning as a matter of fact So\n\n449\n00:24:07.636 --> 00:24:09.990\nI would encourage you all to go and\ndo that very thing.\n\n450\n00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.095\nGive yourself some hands on experience.\n\n451\n00:24:12.095 --> 00:24:15.688\nBut when we're talking about monitoring,\nwe would be remiss, right?\n\n452\n00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:16.942\nWe have been talking about networks right?\n\n453\n00:24:16.942 --> 00:24:19.481\nWe have been saying,\nwhat kind of packet flow are we having?\n\n454\n00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:22.461\nAre there things that are down or up?\n\n455\n00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.430\nWhat is the uptime, what is the downtime?\n\n456\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.390\nThings of that nature.\n\n457\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.450\nBut there's also the physical\naspect of our devices.\n\n458\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.500\nIs it overheating?\n\n459\n00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.890\nIs there a problem with\nthe electrical current?\n\n460\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.959\nAll of these things can also be monitored,\ncorrect?\n\n461\n00:24:35.959 --> 00:24:40.249\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and we've gotta have\nsome kind of climate control system,\n\n462\n00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:42.337\neven in the most basic server closet.\n\n463\n00:24:42.337 --> 00:24:45.880\nLet alone if you have something like\na data center, where there's probably many\n\n464\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.930\ncollective technologies that are\nmonitoring things, like your temperature.\n\n465\n00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.360\nRemember servers are hot.\n\n466\n00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.150\nMassive amounts of servers\nare even hotter, right?\n\n467\n00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.820\nAnd then you take things like humidity.\n\n468\n00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.410\nWe gotta worry about humidity, right?\n\n469\n00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.880\nRemember when it gets too humid, right?\n\n470\n00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.770\nAnd we don't have to worry about moisture\nin Florida, we got plenty of it.\n\n471\n00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.580\nWhat happens, we get condensation.\n\n472\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.742\nCondensation leads to short circuiting,\nright?\n\n473\n00:25:08.742 --> 00:25:13.300\nBut then opposite side of that\nspectrum is the less humid, right?\n\n474\n00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.700\nThe less humidity, then it leads to static\ncharge generation that ultimately leads to\n\n475\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.110\nelectrostatic discharge.\n\n476\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.380\nAnd we certainly don't want that.\n\n477\n00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.610\nThat's why, even when they bring in things\nlike brand new servers, a lot of times,\n\n478\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.520\nwhat they'll do is they won't put\nthem right in the server closet.\n\n479\n00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.650\nThey'll bring them in, and they'll sit\nthem in the box, and they'll just sit them\n\n480\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.960\nthere, and let them acclimate themselves\nto the environment that they're in.\n\n481\n00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.390\nRather than hooking them right in,\n\n482\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.960\nyou don't know if it's\nbeing delivered on a truck.\n\n483\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.940\nI'm not saying that the delivery truck\nperson's bad, but there's a certain\n\n484\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.690\nenvironment in the back of that\ntruck that doesn't really co-exist.\n\n485\n00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.730\nIt doesn't mix and mingle well with the\nenvironment that's in your server closet.\n\n486\n00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.750\nThe other thing that we gotta look at,\ntoo, are things like power, right?\n\n487\n00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.120\nPower can be monitored.\n\n488\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.546\nA few different things that you can\ndo when it comes to power monitoring,\n\n489\n00:25:58.546 --> 00:26:01.992\none of the very basic things that we\ncan get are things like UPSs, right?\n\n490\n00:26:01.992 --> 00:26:03.680\nAPC is their smart UPS.\n\n491\n00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.552\nI've actually had to plug into these\nbefore where you just take an Ethernet\n\n492\n00:26:07.552 --> 00:26:10.441\njack, plug it in your laptop,\nplug it right in the UPS,\n\n493\n00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:14.683\nthe uninterruptible power suppl,y and\nit starts spitting out it's information\n\n494\n00:26:14.683 --> 00:26:18.390\ntelling you what's the current life\ncycle of your batteries, right?\n\n495\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.680\nHow much power is being produced?\n\n496\n00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.230\nWhat's the power draw?\n\n497\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.620\nWhat's the life, I say lifetime,\nit's not really lifetime.\n\n498\n00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.380\nHow long, if it's under maximum load,\n\n499\n00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.840\nwill it keep your devices on long enough\nto do things like your graceful shutdowns.\n\n500\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.700\nBut then they also have things,\na lot of other things, in fact Dan gave\n\n501\n00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.770\nme a credit card, he doesn't really know\nit, right before we started this episode.\n\n502\n00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.320\nSo let's go ahead, let's do some shopping.\n\n503\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.450\nIn fact APC, they make really good\nproducts and again, just like we're\n\n504\n00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.840\ntalking with Solar Winds, these are just\nsome common places that we can go to.\n\n505\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.950\nAnd if I go to APC metered rack PDU,\nright?\n\n506\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.240\nPower distribution unit,\nyou can see quite a few of these.\n\n507\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.950\nAnd you can see they can get\nreally expensive really quick.\n\n508\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.450\nYou might say my gosh, really,\n\n509\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.310\ndo you really want to spend, let's see,\ndo they make it easy for me?\n\n510\n00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.540\nLet's see, we're gonna go,\nthere we go, United States.\n\n511\n00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.030\nAll right, and\nhopefully this doesn't take too long here.\n\n512\n00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:17.760\nI'll tell ya what.\n\n513\n00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.240\nWe'll just back up here and\nwe'll show you one of these by CDW.\n\n514\n00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.790\nYou can see on some of these that what\nthey'll have is they'll have a little bit\n\n515\n00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.740\nof an LED.\n\n516\n00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.270\nThere we go, hopefully we can see that.\n\n517\n00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.069\nLet me zoom in here.\n\n518\n00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:34.840\nIt looks like I might just\nhave to zoom in myself here.\n\n519\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.740\nIt's kind of hard to see but\nthere's a little LED readout there, and\n\n520\n00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.520\nthat lets me know the condition the power,\nthat this PDU,\n\n521\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:47.420\nthis power distribution unit, that would\nbe on the inside of a server rack.\n\n522\n00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.670\nWhat is the voltage on it, right?\n\n523\n00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.713\nThere's other things, too,\nlike in another episode, and\n\n524\n00:27:52.713 --> 00:27:54.979\nI don't have a picture\nof it to show you here,\n\n525\n00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:59.055\nwhere we talked about remote telemetry\nunits, RTUs, as part of a SCADA system.\n\n526\n00:27:59.055 --> 00:28:01.314\nWell some of those, or\nremote terminal units,\n\n527\n00:28:01.314 --> 00:28:05.122\ndepending on what you're talking about,\nit's an interchangeable acronym.\n\n528\n00:28:05.122 --> 00:28:12.360\nThey have power based RTUs or remote\nterminal units, remote telemetry units.\n\n529\n00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.790\nAnd what does it do.\n\n530\n00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.940\nIt can connect to a wireless system, and\nsend the condition of your power back to\n\n531\n00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.370\nthe central SCADA system, so\nthat you can monitor it, right?\n\n532\n00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.830\nSo you can see this even in big, large\ndistributed type SCADA systems as well.\n\n533\n00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.330\nAll right, so\nthat really does have the majority of it.\n\n534\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.792\nThere are a couple more things,\nDan, I'd like to talk on.\n\n535\n00:28:33.792 --> 00:28:36.574\nBecause we've talked about\nthings like packet analyzers.\n\n536\n00:28:36.574 --> 00:28:40.423\nOne of the things that we haven't really\nmentioned that they do call out on\n\n537\n00:28:40.423 --> 00:28:41.740\nthe exam, is wireless.\n\n538\n00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.420\nThings like wireless analyzers.\n\n539\n00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.760\nI actually have on my Mac,\n\n540\n00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.790\nI got a pretty decent one that\nI like called WiFi explorer.\n\n541\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:54.830\nLet me show you what this is about,\nall right.\n\n542\n00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.240\nWireless analyzers, what they're really\ngood about is, not only just say, hey,\n\n543\n00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.080\nthey analyze the wireless.\n\n544\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.930\nYou can see this one's doing a lot.\n\n545\n00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.690\nWhat's it's doing right now, is it's\ndetecting all the wireless access points\n\n546\n00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.880\nwithin the range of this network adapter.\n\n547\n00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.770\nIt's showing me, for instance,\nwhat channels they're running on,\n\n548\n00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.030\nwhat band, what frequency, right?\n\n549\n00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.120\nI can hover over them,\n\n550\n00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.300\nsee signal strengths, see things\nlike their MAC addresses as well.\n\n551\n00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:28.040\nI can see, we talked about wireless,\nwe talked about those channels and stuff.\n\n552\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.870\nI can see that this is running 802.11ac.\n\n553\n00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.380\nIt's running in the 5 GHz spectrum.\n\n554\n00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.590\nInterestingly enough,\nI can see it's running AES encryption.\n\n555\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.370\nAnd thank goodness Wi-Fi\nprotected setup is disabled.\n\n556\n00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:43.900\nSo we can see information like that and\nthat's one of the great things\n\n557\n00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.660\nabout the wireless analysers is the fact\nthat it does give you that ability.\n\n558\n00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:50.950\nAnd you can change different maps and\nstuff,\n\n559\n00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:56.110\nyou can select a specific one\nhighlight it and see it's information,\n\n560\n00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.530\nrelated to the adjacent wireless\naccess points in your area.\n\n561\n00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:04.610\n&gt;&gt; It's good to know our ITProTV\nguest network, it says right there,\n\n562\n00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.010\nsignal quality is very poor.\n\n563\n00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:06.580\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n564\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.920\nThere we go.\nWe don't want the guests on the network.\n\n565\n00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.348\n&gt;&gt; Don't need that.\n&gt;&gt; Just kidding.\n\n566\n00:30:10.348 --> 00:30:11.265\n&gt;&gt; We like to tease them with it, right?\n\n567\n00:30:11.265 --> 00:30:12.610\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n568\n00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.610\nSo if we go to things like signal\nstrength, I really like this one here.\n\n569\n00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.730\nThey've gone to plaid,\nludicrous speed go right?\n\n570\n00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.690\nAnd you can see and\nyou can find out what access points are,\n\n571\n00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.910\nwhat the signal strengths\nare measured in your decibels there.\n\n572\n00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.200\nYou can see since I\nhighlighted ITProTV_Guest here,\n\n573\n00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.910\nthat's the one right there that are.\n\n574\n00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:36.810\nThat we would just selected so\nI could see the information related to it.\n\n575\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.820\nSo really good little tool to have.\n\n576\n00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.530\nNow the other thing that they call out\ntoo, is something that is known as,\n\n577\n00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:46.650\nlet me see if I've got this up here,\nI believe I do.\n\n578\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.150\nIf not,\nwe can just load it up here real quick.\n\n579\n00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.270\nThe other thing is a Wi-Fi survey tool.\n\n580\n00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.800\nI've actually got one here called NetSpot.\n\n581\n00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've used that before.\n\n582\n00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:58.850\nIt's a nice little tool.\n\n583\n00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.380\n&gt;&gt; It's really, really cool.\n\n584\n00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.130\nSo this one, it has the same ability.\n\n585\n00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.610\nSo it's also a Wi-Fi analyzer but\nwe've just seen a Wi-Fi analyzer so\n\n586\n00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.000\nI wanna show you this side\nof it that's really cool.\n\n587\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.290\nI can start things like site surveys.\n\n588\n00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.360\nI wanna find out where I should\nbe placing access points or\n\n589\n00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.350\nafter I have what's the quality\nof where they've been placed.\n\n590\n00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:23.130\nWell one of the great things here is\nyou can generate these maps, right?\n\n591\n00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.060\nAnd these maps can show you\nwhere the access point is,\n\n592\n00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.920\nthe heat signature of them.\n\n593\n00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.048\nAnd I can find out just by\nclicking on a location, well,\n\n594\n00:31:33.048 --> 00:31:36.858\nwhat's the signal strength in\nhere measured in decibels, right?\n\n595\n00:31:36.858 --> 00:31:39.216\nThe higher the decibel,\nthe better the signal strength, right?\n\n596\n00:31:39.216 --> 00:31:40.977\nThe lower the decibel,\nthe lower the strength.\n\n597\n00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:44.572\nWell I could see that if I'm right here,\nlook at some of these numbers, and\n\n598\n00:31:44.572 --> 00:31:46.799\nas you get closer to where\nthe access point is,\n\n599\n00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:49.390\nyou can start to see\nthese numbers increase.\n\n600\n00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.950\nSo, this is a great thing to have.\n\n601\n00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.640\nLet me go ahead and show you something\nkinda cool, let me go ahead and\n\n602\n00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.115\nI'm gonna remove this real quick.\n\n603\n00:31:58.115 --> 00:32:02.725\nImagine if we were here in the studios,\nwe wanted to use one of these.\n\n604\n00:32:02.725 --> 00:32:05.555\nIn fact, Don Pezet did use one of these,\n\n605\n00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:09.145\none of our other hosts, when he was\nstarting to help set up this network.\n\n606\n00:32:09.145 --> 00:32:11.765\nI can actually, if I want,\nI could start a new survey.\n\n607\n00:32:11.765 --> 00:32:16.871\nAnd we'll call this the,\nwhy don't we call it netplus-demo survey,\n\n608\n00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:18.766\nright, that's unique.\n\n609\n00:32:18.766 --> 00:32:21.910\n[LAUGH] And\nwe'll call this maybe Studio 2.\n\n610\n00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.780\nAll right, and I'm gonna tell\nit what kind of zone type it is.\n\n611\n00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.510\nAnd maybe I'll load the zone\nfrom a file here, let's see.\n\n612\n00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.530\nDo I have one in here?\n\n613\n00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.470\nThere we go, studio quad plan,\nthere we go.\n\n614\n00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.950\nSo I can load up something\nlike a floor plan,\n\n615\n00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:45.850\nlike here is our studio plan for\nthe ITPro TV.\n\n616\n00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:51.277\nAnd if maybe I wanted to say here in,\nwhere are we here, studio five.\n\n617\n00:32:51.277 --> 00:32:53.771\nThat's studio four.\n\n618\n00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:55.960\n&gt;&gt; Studio two will be to your right.\n\n619\n00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.510\n&gt;&gt; To your right, yeah.\n\n620\n00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.650\nYep, right there.\n\n621\n00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.220\nThere we go, now notice that what\nwe're seeing here, I can turn around.\n\n622\n00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.100\nAnd if I wanna find out where's the access\npoints, I can actually drop a few points\n\n623\n00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:13.340\nin here and I can find out what the,\nlet it calculate it.\n\n624\n00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.970\nLet's see, and continue, there we go.\n\n625\n00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.660\nAnd we'll just go through this,\n\n626\n00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.580\nyep I didn't finish\nthe setting up the survey here.\n\n627\n00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.760\nSo we can go like this, I can drop a space\nhere, give it a second, let it calculate.\n\n628\n00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.420\nAnd then what it'll do is it'll give\nme some kind of heat signature and\n\n629\n00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.860\nshow me what the strength is related\nto the access points that I have.\n\n630\n00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.946\nSo it's a really good piece of software to\nhave to kind of see that strength, right.\n\n631\n00:33:38.946 --> 00:33:41.431\nAnd I can throw a couple\nof these down if I want and\n\n632\n00:33:41.431 --> 00:33:44.180\nstart to build up what's\ngoing on with our network.\n\n633\n00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:49.380\nAnd it may give me any idea as to where I\nmight need to reposition access points or\n\n634\n00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.550\nbeforehand, if we've got things like\ninterference around the outside of\n\n635\n00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.686\nthe building, I would be aware of\nhow much interference is there.\n\n636\n00:33:55.686 --> 00:34:00.410\nSo sites, or it might even be\ncalled wireless site survey tool,\n\n637\n00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.380\nthey just generically call\nit a wireless survey tool.\n\n638\n00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.952\nSo these survey tools are very,\n\n639\n00:34:03.952 --> 00:34:07.633\nvery good when you are going to be\nthe one setting up your wireless network.\n\n640\n00:34:07.633 --> 00:34:11.028\nAnd then even re-checking it to make sure\nthat everything's within the parameters\n\n641\n00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:14.060\nthat you've expected the moment\nyou put the network into play.\n\n642\n00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.270\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Wes, we've really\nrun the gamut on monitoring tools.\n\n643\n00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.940\nIt took two parts to do it, but\n\n644\n00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.330\nthere's a lot of monitoring that\nwe do as network technicians.\n\n645\n00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.890\nIf you found it to be a little rote,\nmaybe,\n\n646\n00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:29.830\na little bit mundane, it can be, but\nit is definitely a part of your job.\n\n647\n00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.790\nIt's something that you\nhave to be a master of,\n\n648\n00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.040\nbecause where it's usually a set it and\n\n649\n00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.560\nforget it kind of thing, it's when those\nalerts start going off that you've set up.\n\n650\n00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.880\nThat's when they really earn their money.\n\n651\n00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.310\nSo learn how to do those things, learn\neach one of these different techniques.\n\n652\n00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.820\nGet your feet wet with those so that you\nunderstand them not only conceptually but\n\n653\n00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.860\npractically as well.\n\n654\n00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.170\nWes, you've done a fantastic job of\nexplaining each and every one that we need\n\n655\n00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:57.610\nto know for our exam, and that they're\nalso good in our practical experience.\n\n656\n00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.640\nThat being said, it looks like we're\nwell out of time for this episode.\n\n657\n00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.710\nSo we need to sign off.\n\n658\n00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.581\nSo for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n659\n00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:05.686\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n660\n00:35:05.686 --> 00:35:07.814\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n661\n00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:13.691\n[MUSIC]\n\n662\n00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:16.932\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.173\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.173 --> 00:00:13.661\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n5\n00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.666\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.240\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n7\n00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.210\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\non with more on our Network+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.480\nOf course, joining us in the studio for\nthat series, the man that's been walking\n\n9\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.040\nus through this whole entire thing,\nof course, it's Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.030\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n11\n00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.710\nHow's it going today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.120\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, as always.\n\n13\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.080\nThanks for having me here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.250\nThat's right, and well, I tell you what?\n\n15\n00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.510\nOur title here is a little\nabbreviated because man,\n\n16\n00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.990\nI can tell you this objective, there was\nno way it was gonna fit in that screen.\n\n17\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.850\nSo, we're gonna be looking at.\n\n18\n00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.560\nGiven a scenario, analyze metrics and\nreports for monitoring and\n\n19\n00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.120\ntracking performance tools.\n\n20\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.520\nSo, you might have seen the title of\nthis show was slightly abbreviated.\n\n21\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.160\nBut, keep in mind in the show notes.\n\n22\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160\nThat if you are following\nalong with the objectives.\n\n23\n00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.210\nWe will have the full\nobjective title there.\n\n24\n00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.290\n&gt;&gt; I love when they say, given a scenario.\n\n25\n00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.700\nOkay, what scenario is that?\n\n26\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.750\nI'm sure Wes has a few of them for\nus today.\n\n27\n00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.555\n&gt;&gt; Just a few, that's right.\n\n28\n00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:10.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, how about a scenario like this.\n\n29\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.040\nLet's say somebody users complains or\ncalls.\n\n30\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.539\nBetter be careful on that complaints,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.905\nEverything is okay as long as\nthe network is running fine.\n\n32\n00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:24.561\nBut, and the moment comes, that point in\ntime when you're gonna get a call that\n\n33\n00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.520\nsays, Hey I'm trying to get to\nthe web server or I'm trying to get to\n\n34\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.108\nthe intranet server to pull down the\nemployee handbook or I'm trying to get out\n\n35\n00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:38.035\nto the internet for whatever reason and\neverything is very, very slow.\n\n36\n00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.855\nWell, at this point it's gonna be time to\nstart firing up some kind of performance\n\n37\n00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:45.185\nmonitor and checking for\nthings that we call bottlenecks, right?\n\n38\n00:01:45.185 --> 00:01:46.395\nWell, what is a bottleneck?\n\n39\n00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.225\nI want you to think of a bottleneck as\nkinda like the weakest link when it comes\n\n40\n00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:50.875\nto performance, right?\n\n41\n00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.900\nI can have a lot of RAM in the system,\nright.\n\n42\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.748\nThose of you maybe that\nare coming over from Net+.\n\n43\n00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.610\nI can have a lot of RAM in a system,\nright.\n\n44\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.690\nI can have one of those i7 processors,\nabsolutely amazing.\n\n45\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.155\nAnd then, I could have a 5,400 RPM\nmechanical drive in it, and what happens?\n\n46\n00:02:06.155 --> 00:02:10.485\nWell, the whole entire system is pretty\nmuch set to launch the space shuttle as\n\n47\n00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:15.155\nfar as technology goes, but it's using\none of the old mechanical drives, right?\n\n48\n00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:19.015\nSo, that drive becomes what's known\nas the bottleneck because it's gonna\n\n49\n00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:21.115\nslow the whole entire system down.\n\n50\n00:02:21.115 --> 00:02:25.215\nAnd that's one of the reasons for\nperformance monitoring is important.\n\n51\n00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:30.000\nIf you do get a call that says this\nservice that we typically rely on for\n\n52\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.680\nwhatever reason is slow, and\nnow we have to figure it out.\n\n53\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.102\nSo, we need a way some\nkind of measurement.\n\n54\n00:02:35.102 --> 00:02:40.460\nSome kinda graphing utility,\nif you will, in order to determine that.\n\n55\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.150\nSo, I tell you what.\n\n56\n00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.920\nWe'll go ahead and\nwhat we're gonna use here.\n\n57\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.120\nWe'll use a Windows machine here.\n\n58\n00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.120\nI've got a Windows Server machine here,\nand\n\n59\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.880\nwe're gonna look at\nsomething called baselines.\n\n60\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.610\nBaselines, now we do baselining inside\n\n61\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.240\nof Windows with a technology that\nis called Performance Monitor.\n\n62\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.950\nAnd, let's understand what a baseline is.\n\n63\n00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.850\nWhen I need to know, so\nI get that phone call right, and\n\n64\n00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.152\nsomebody tells me this service is not,\nits running really slow.\n\n65\n00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:11.223\nAll right,\nwell is that really running slow or\n\n66\n00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:14.306\nis it just your perception\nof it running slow.\n\n67\n00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:15.960\nLet me give you an example.\n\n68\n00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.155\nBoth Dan and I have some pretty decent\nlaptops, and when we first got them.\n\n69\n00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:23.680\nI don't know about you Dan but I was like\nwow this like really, really is fast.\n\n70\n00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.892\nBut, over time as you get used to it,\nit doesn't seem as fast anymore.\n\n71\n00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:28.090\nHas that happen to you at all?\n\n72\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.920\n&gt;&gt; That has happened to me\ndefinitely in the past.\n\n73\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.230\nYou see this all the time.\n\n74\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.870\nYou're thinking,\nman this thing's a screaming demon.\n\n75\n00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.320\nAnd then, after about two years of use,\nyou're like, I hate this machine.\n\n76\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.435\nIt does not do anything.\n\n77\n00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:39.238\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that's right.\n\n78\n00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:43.349\nAnd we can't tell if that's more of us,\njust that's kinda how we feel, or\n\n79\n00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.750\ndo we have hard facts that says, no,\nno the solid state drive's about to fail?\n\n80\n00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.800\nYour RAM is about to fail.\n\n81\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.330\nWhat is going on the machine?\n\n82\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.340\nWell, the baselines that we're gonna\nset here with Performance Monitor.\n\n83\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.180\nIn this case,\nthis type of a baselining utility says,\n\n84\n00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.128\nwhat is the expected performance levels?\n\n85\n00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:03.005\nAnd then will, that becomes the baseline.\n\n86\n00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:06.988\nAnd then, what we can do is we can run\nthose series of tests later, and compare\n\n87\n00:04:06.988 --> 00:04:10.992\nthem back to the original baseline,\nthe original snapshot of performance.\n\n88\n00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:14.711\nAnd see has performance really\ndegraded over that time or\n\n89\n00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:19.450\nis it just the fact that computers\nget faster the more impatient I get.\n\n90\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.720\nWhich could be also be true as well.\n\n91\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.930\nAnd it certainly can be something that you\nhave to deal with, maybe on a daily or\n\n92\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.080\nevery other day basis.\n\n93\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.190\nSo, we're gonna use Performance Monitor\nhere to set up a baseline.\n\n94\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.530\nAll right now, there are certain\nthings that we might wanna monitor.\n\n95\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.860\nWe might wanna monitor things\nlike our network device CPU,\n\n96\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.000\nwhatever the network device is.\n\n97\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.300\nIt could be something like a switch,\nright?\n\n98\n00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.900\nNetwork devices memory, could be switch\nas well, could be a router, right?\n\n99\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.030\nI just happen to be using a server here.\n\n100\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.130\nSo, we need some kind of test right?\n\n101\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.930\nSome kind of test that\nallows us to set that up.\n\n102\n00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.530\nSo I'll tell you what, let's go ahead, and\n\n103\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.290\nwe're gonna set up a baseline\ntest here for our server here.\n\n104\n00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.559\nAll right, so on Performance Monitor,\nwhat I'm gonna do.\n\n105\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.640\nIs I'm gonna ahead and show some\nreal-time graphing information, right?\n\n106\n00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.810\nNow by default,\n\n107\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.710\nwhen you use Performance Monitor, it only\nhas one thing that it's really monitoring.\n\n108\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.050\nYou can probably see that down there\nat the bottom, the % Processor Time.\n\n109\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.930\nBut, if I know that I have certain other\ncharacteristics that I wanna monitor,\n\n110\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.600\nwell I can always go up here\nto this plus symbol and\n\n111\n00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.650\nI can add those characteristics, right?\n\n112\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.810\nIn Windows we call these counters, and\n\n113\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.120\none of the attributes of a component\nwithin the system that we wanna monitor.\n\n114\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.680\nSo, I might wanna say okay,\nwell I see % Processor Time.\n\n115\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.444\nRight, but maybe that's not what I want,\n\n116\n00:05:35.444 --> 00:05:37.804\nmaybe I wanna add something\nlike interrupts per second.\n\n117\n00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.640\nSo, I can add that to the list, right.\n\n118\n00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.080\nMaybe I want to add, let's see here,\nand this is just realtime.\n\n119\n00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.280\nWe're gonna set up an actual\nbaseline coming up.\n\n120\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.760\nMaybe when it comes to the Processor Time,\nI want to see things like processor que\n\n121\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.080\nlength, and\nI add those attributes to be monitored.\n\n122\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.790\nNow, when I add those you can start\nto see that in the graph here,\n\n123\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.510\nas we go through the graphing process,\nit's adding more information.\n\n124\n00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.000\nAnd at any one point,\nI can click on this graph here, right?\n\n125\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.160\nSometimes it stays static,\nsometimes it doesn't.\n\n126\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.589\nBut I can hover over it, there we go,\nas long as I don't move [LAUGH].\n\n127\n00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.570\nAnd I can see what the value\nis at that certain time.\n\n128\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.980\nWhen it comes to the performance\nmonitor here itself,\n\n129\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.900\nWhat happens if I close this utility down?\n\n130\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.530\nWell, I don't know let's find out, right.\n\n131\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.050\nSo, I'm gonna close the utility down,\nand I'm gonna launch it back up.\n\n132\n00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.390\nAlright so, Performance Monitor,\nand when I launch it back up, and\n\n133\n00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.110\nI choose Performance Monitor,\nwell what happened?\n\n134\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.740\nYou might notice that those two\ncharacteristics that I just added,\n\n135\n00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.420\nthey're not there anymore.\n\n136\n00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.832\nAlright so, the first part of Performance\nMonitor really isn't the baseline, and\n\n137\n00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.717\nthat should just for\na real time information.\n\n138\n00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:47.157\nIf I wanna set a baseline then\nwhat I have to do here is,\n\n139\n00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:50.374\nI to create what's known\nas a Data Collector Set.\n\n140\n00:06:50.374 --> 00:06:54.190\nLet's go ahead and\ndo that,let's create Data collector Set.\n\n141\n00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.536\nYou can see that there\nare some Under System,\n\n142\n00:06:56.536 --> 00:07:00.364\nif I expand out Data Collector Set,\nuser-defined and system, then I can\n\n143\n00:07:00.364 --> 00:07:04.590\nperform things like system diagnostics and\nsystem performance tests, right?\n\n144\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.330\nThese, if I select one,\nit gives me performance counter.\n\n145\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.740\nAnd it's got a series of those\nattributes already predefined by what\n\n146\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.740\nMicrosoft considers the system you should\nbe monitoring with system performance.\n\n147\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.930\nBut, there might be certain\ncharacteristics that these system defined\n\n148\n00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.130\nones don't suit your needs.\n\n149\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.650\nYou might have to tailor-make\nit to suit your needs.\n\n150\n00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.890\nSo, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n151\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.647\nWe're not gonna go by what\nthe system defines are.\n\n152\n00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:33.322\nWe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\nright click, and we're gonna choose new,\n\n153\n00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:34.330\ndata collector set.\n\n154\n00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.360\nI abbreviate acronyms city here.\n\n155\n00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.700\nAny of you guys that have been watching\nus know it's alphabet soup here.\n\n156\n00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.470\nThat's a DCS.\n\n157\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:49.433\nAnd I'm gonna call this our\nDemo Network + Baseline.\n\n158\n00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:52.605\nOr something close.\n\n159\n00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:56.040\n[LAUGH] And\nwe're not gonna create a template.\n\n160\n00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.530\nIf I create a template it does\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n161\n00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.874\nIt's got a predefined template.\n\n162\n00:08:00.874 --> 00:08:04.300\nI wanna show you individual\ncharacteristics that we can add if we\n\n163\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:04.813\nneed to.\n\n164\n00:08:04.813 --> 00:08:06.202\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\n\n165\n00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:09.290\nchoose Next Now what we're going to\ndo is Performance Counters, right?\n\n166\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.890\nWe need those characteristics that we're\ngoing to monitor, we'll choose Next.\n\n167\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.370\nAll right, Sampling Interval, I'm going to\ntake it down to about a second here, guys.\n\n168\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.640\nYou can, again,\nyou can suit this to your needs.\n\n169\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.880\nIt just gives us, for our demonstration\npurposes, quicker results.\n\n170\n00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.200\nThat's why we're doing one\nsecond intervals here.\n\n171\n00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.900\nAnd I'm gonna choose add, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.850\nNow maybe there are certain things,\nmaybe I wanna know my network device.\n\n173\n00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.820\nHow much of the CPU is currently\nbeing utilised, right?\n\n174\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.180\nWell, what I can do is I can find\nthe processor here in this list.\n\n175\n00:08:42.192 --> 00:08:46.900\nAll right, I think I just\nscrolled past it, now we go,\n\n176\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.140\nit was the first one that was highlighted.\n\n177\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.240\nJumped a little too quickly there, and\nI wanna choose percent processor time.\n\n178\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.580\nThe one that by default was already\non the list, I'm gonna go and\n\n179\n00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.590\ninclude that in our baseline.\n\n180\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.370\nBut then maybe there is some\nother characteristics of CPU\n\n181\n00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.450\nutilization that I want to look at right?\n\n182\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.180\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna go down to system.\n\n183\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.880\nNow again keep in mind that the ones that\nyou add to your baseline are really gonna\n\n184\n00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:15.080\nbe continued on what you're\ntrying to see with your system.\n\n185\n00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.050\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll open up system\nand there should be the processor q link\n\n186\n00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.880\nthat I added earlier,\nwe'll add that, all right.\n\n187\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.720\nAll right, so that's got maybe the CPU\nutilization that I wanna form a baseline\n\n188\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.380\non and I wanna kind of know what's going\non but maybe there are other stuff too.\n\n189\n00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.430\nMaybe for instance we've got network\ndevice memory that we wanna be able to\n\n190\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.290\nsee, what's going on with that.\n\n191\n00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.910\nWell, we also have a way that we could\ntrack and graph that information too.\n\n192\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.790\nLet me go ahead and scroll, if fact it's\nprobably just easier to scroll here.\n\n193\n00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.927\nAnd there is a memory location in here.\n\n194\n00:09:50.927 --> 00:09:53.651\n&gt;&gt; Why do they have such long lists?\n\n195\n00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:55.347\nThey should be able to just\nallow you to type it in.\n\n196\n00:09:55.347 --> 00:09:59.540\n&gt;&gt; It would be nice if they\nhad a search functionality.\n\n197\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.120\nI've commonly thought that,\nwe definitely get on that for sure.\n\n198\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.930\nSo maybe I wanna find out things like what\nare the percent committed, or cache bytes.\n\n199\n00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.470\nMaybe I want cache bytes, right?\n\n200\n00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.130\nMaybe I also want to find out, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.370\nDo I have enough memory in the system,\nright?\n\n202\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.720\nMaybe it's being over-subscribed and\nnetwork device memory isn't available for\n\n203\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.280\nwhatever reason, and I'm trying to\ndetermine why that's happening.\n\n204\n00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.080\nMaybe we've got an application\nrunning on this web server and\n\n205\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.790\nit's a memory leak, and\nit just keeps raising and\n\n206\n00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.300\nraising the bar until all the memory's\ncompletely over-saturated.\n\n207\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.455\nAnd now, nobody else can get services.\n\n208\n00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:38.975\n&gt;&gt; Louis, we got a question from\nthe chatroom about this topic and that is,\n\n209\n00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:42.047\nis should we run these baseline\nby the machine or by the device?\n\n210\n00:10:42.047 --> 00:10:45.708\nI plug it in, I turn it on and\nthen I run a base line or\n\n211\n00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:50.336\nshould I allow it to acclimate\nto its normal operating I guess,\n\n212\n00:10:50.336 --> 00:10:53.853\nsystem, the way's it's\ngoing to be working.\n\n213\n00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.410\nShould I allow it to acclimate and\nthen run the baseline, and\n\n214\n00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.790\nthen should I then compare\nthose to similar devices?\n\n215\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:01.970\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.010\n&gt;&gt; That was not a yes or\n\n217\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.220\nno question guys you gotta\nhate answers like that.\n\n218\n00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.150\nWell it really depends, and that's\nanother answer that I hate, Imagine this.\n\n219\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.688\nI'm bringing in a work station.\n\n220\n00:11:09.688 --> 00:11:10.640\n&gt;&gt; It depends.\n\n221\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.370\n&gt;&gt; Right, it depends.\n\n222\n00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.310\nAnd now we're gonna end it on\nnothing got answered [LAUGH].\n\n223\n00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.620\nSo if it's a work station and\nmaybe I'm just doing basic user stuff,\n\n224\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.280\nI might go ahead and\nrun a baseline on it the very first day.\n\n225\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.880\nIf it's a web server,\nif it's a database server.\n\n226\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.820\nI might not be running the stock\nconfiguration, so I might have to\n\n227\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.190\nconfigure my roles, if you will, but\nthen once my roles are configured.\n\n228\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.400\nAnd I think that machine is set up\nwhere its going to be released into\n\n229\n00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.840\nthe production environment.\n\n230\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.170\nThat's at the moment that I take the\nsnapshot because that's when its still in\n\n231\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.730\nits pristine state.\n\n232\n00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.730\nBefore things happen, right?\n\n233\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.310\nNetwork, I would say like happens but\nnetworks happen,\n\n234\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.350\nbefore users happen, right?\n\n235\n00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.260\nAnd we start to see\nthe performance a degrade, again,\n\n236\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.760\nbecause how can we tell if it's\nactual performance degradation\n\n237\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.250\nversus we think it's not running well?\n\n238\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.680\nAnd that's why we need these metrics,\nso I would say, set your baseline.\n\n239\n00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.880\nThe moment you know that the role or\n\n240\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.610\nthe service that the network device\nserver switch router is gonna perform and\n\n241\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.820\nit's configured to perform that service,\ntake your baseline then.\n\n242\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.600\nSo that you'll have\nan apples to apples and\n\n243\n00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.590\nnot an apples to oranges comparison,\nright?\n\n244\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.450\nIf we don't run the same exact tests,\nand that's the other thing that I'm glad\n\n245\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.810\nyou asked that question,\nbecause later on when we run those tests,\n\n246\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.950\nafter we've run our baseline,\nwe need to run the same tests, right?\n\n247\n00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:35.640\nI can't say, well, I think I'm having\noversaturation of the network,\n\n248\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.000\nor the memory on the device.\n\n249\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.780\nAnd then go test the CPU,\nthat really doesn't help.\n\n250\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.972\nSo hopefully, that answers\nthe question there, all right?\n\n251\n00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.830\nWhat else?\nSo I've got pages here in the memory.\n\n252\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.880\nMaybe we want things like,\nmaybe this is a database server, right?\n\n253\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.508\nAnd I wanna find out things like Reads,\nwell I can go ahead and\n\n254\n00:12:54.508 --> 00:12:56.652\nmaybe I do right copies per second.\n\n255\n00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:04.444\nAnd I get, no down there at the bottom and\nwe have that.\n\n256\n00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:05.019\nAll right,\n\n257\n00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:08.710\nmaybe storage utilization is another\nthing that I've got to consider too.\n\n258\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.095\nSo I can add something like for instance\nour logical disk if I can find that.\n\n259\n00:13:14.903 --> 00:13:17.734\nYou would think that alphabet\nwould be easy enough, but\n\n260\n00:13:17.734 --> 00:13:19.430\nsometimes it does challenge me.\n\n261\n00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:23.891\nAll right.\n\n262\n00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:25.850\nAm I missing it?\n\n263\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.320\nThere it is, logical disc.\n\n264\n00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.630\nAll right, maybe we're gonna do\nsomething like disc percent time.\n\n265\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.730\nMaybe I want to find out things like for\ninstance,\n\n266\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.210\nthe disk write in bytes per second.\n\n267\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.760\nOr disk writes per second I can add that,\nright,\n\n268\n00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:48.630\nmaybe I wanna go down the system again and\nI wanna find out how first does it,\n\n269\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.310\nwhen it's writing maybe files, maybe I\nwanna find that information out too.\n\n270\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:57.070\nSo I can find file write bytes per second\nagain these are all gonna be something\n\n271\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.230\nthat you will customize for your own\nwhatever baseline that you're gonna run,\n\n272\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.910\nand then I'm going to go ahead and\nI'm going to choice okay.\n\n273\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.630\nNow that I've considered what it\nis that I want to monitor right.\n\n274\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:12.160\nIn this case it's cpu, it's going to\nbe the memory and storage utilization.\n\n275\n00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.780\nNow I can go ahead and\nI can finish this, and\n\n276\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.940\nunder user define,\nthat becomes the base line right.\n\n277\n00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.110\nI'm going to run this report, right now,\n\n278\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.850\nbefore I put this machine into play,\nall right, in our production environment.\n\n279\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.640\nAnd all I did, guys, and I know I\nkinda did that a little bit quick, so\n\n280\n00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.430\nlet me slow that down a little bit.\n\n281\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.700\nBeen working with it a lot before,\nright-click and just choose Start.\n\n282\n00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.130\nYou see the little play button\nright there, all right?\n\n283\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.370\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and stop it.\n\n284\n00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.070\nAgain, we're just kinda trying to\ngather a little bit of information.\n\n285\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.440\nBut now I've got the performance baseline,\nnow I've to gather the information,\n\n286\n00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.850\nthe metric if you will from the report\nthat was generated from that baseline.\n\n287\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.640\nSo if I go under reports,\n\n288\n00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.250\nI can then go under demo network plus\nbaseline and I can grab this information.\n\n289\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.440\nAnd you can see what\nthe statistical snapshot\n\n290\n00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.930\nof this machine was the moment we\nput it in a production environment.\n\n291\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.350\nNow when somebody calls us and\nsays, hey Dan,\n\n292\n00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:15.220\nhey Wes, why is the Internet, we had a\ncomment from the chatroom that's so true,\n\n293\n00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.240\nwhy is the whole entire Internet slow?\n\n294\n00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.350\nWhen it really is the only thing they're\ndoing is they're visiting the company\n\n295\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.490\nwebsite right?\n\n296\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.650\nWell I can turn around and\nI can rerun the same test.\n\n297\n00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.940\nRemember what apples to apples, and\nI can compare it back to the base line and\n\n298\n00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.810\nI can find out.\n\n299\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.170\nAre there bottle necks right?\n\n300\n00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.030\nMaybe the bottle next is an over\nsaturation of the resources,\n\n301\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.910\nmaybe it's bandwidth right,\nmaybe it's storage.\n\n302\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.570\nAgain we've talked about the network\ndevice CPU, memory as well.\n\n303\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:48.590\nSo there are- that is an example of some\nof the things that we can do as well.\n\n304\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.460\nAll right,\nnow the next thing that they call out, or\n\n305\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.473\nthey call out something known\nas well log management.\n\n306\n00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:55.417\nAll right?\n\n307\n00:15:55.417 --> 00:16:00.130\nLog management,\nremember logs are important.\n\n308\n00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.206\nAll right, if you have logging\ngoing on on your system, right?\n\n309\n00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:07.137\nIf you have auditing going on on your\nsystem which essentially produces your\n\n310\n00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:08.900\nlogs you need to check them.\n\n311\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.030\nAnd that is important.\n\n312\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.270\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that logs\ncan become a performance hinder on your\n\n313\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.630\nsystems, if you don't check them, and they\nstart to elude to much hard drive space.\n\n314\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.150\nAll right, so\n\n315\n00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:23.040\nlet's go to everybody's favorite in\nWindows, [LAUGH] log management system.\n\n316\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.240\nAll right?\nOr at least a log viewer I should say.\n\n317\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.480\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and what I'll do is\nI'm just gonna right click on the Windows\n\n318\n00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.600\ncharm here, to start button if\nyou will and choose event viewer.\n\n319\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.850\nI don't know what it's actually today,\nit changes,\n\n320\n00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.670\nprobably gonna change by the end\nof this episode again too.\n\n321\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.100\nAll right, and\nnotice that we have Event Viewer, okay?\n\n322\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.500\nInside of Event Viewer I have\nsome Windows logs, right?\n\n323\n00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.340\nAnd you can see some different logs\nthat we have in here, Application,\n\n324\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.630\nwe can see Security.\n\n325\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.600\nWe can see System Events,\nSecurity Events by default,\n\n326\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.366\ntracking things like File Object Access,\nLog-ons and Log-offs, right?\n\n327\n00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:01.510\nSo, this is all important\ninformation to have set up as well.\n\n328\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.610\nWell, if you are gonna manage these logs,\n\n329\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:08.380\nwhat if you're gonna try and maybe\naccess these logs from another machine?\n\n330\n00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.120\nMaybe I don't want to have to, and\nusually you don't want to have to do this,\n\n331\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.730\ngo Sneakernet, machine to machine\nto machine to machine, right?\n\n332\n00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.680\nWell, you can also set up things\nlike remote log management as well.\n\n333\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.290\nLet me show you how you can do that.\n\n334\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.110\nNow the first thing you have to\ndo in order to set this up is\n\n335\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.740\nyou have to go into the firewall,\nall right?\n\n336\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.570\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\njust type wf.msc.\n\n337\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.000\nBring up the Windows Firewall\nwith Advanced Security here.\n\n338\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.230\nAnd we're gonna set this machine up for\nremote log management, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.090\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n340\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.440\nthere's a couple of things that you\nhave to do in order to set this up.\n\n341\n00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.990\nWe're gonna,\nfirst thing that we're gonna do here is\n\n342\n00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:49.390\nyou'll see that there's this\nCOM+ Network Access DCOM-In.\n\n343\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.410\nThat is turned off by default,\nwe need to enable that role,\n\n344\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.980\nthere is yet\nagain some other ones in here.\n\n345\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.890\nIn fact it would be probably\neasier just to cycle through\n\n346\n00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.162\nthese alphabetically, there we go.\n\n347\n00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:05.790\nAll right, notice that we have a series\nof remote event log management,\n\n348\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:11.560\nrules, we gotta go ahead and\nwe've gotta enable these all right.\n\n349\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.570\nAnd I would just go thru Remote Events,\nand just go thru and\n\n350\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.570\nenable the whole group.\n\n351\n00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.900\nAll right now,\nnotice one thing I didn't tell you to do.\n\n352\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.495\nAnd some forums I've seen that tell\nyou to do this, disable your firewall.\n\n353\n00:18:24.495 --> 00:18:28.390\n[LAUGH] That is not\na good way to do remote.\n\n354\n00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.660\nThat's not a good way\nto do anything really.\n\n355\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.370\n[LAUGH] So we'll take the principle\nleast privilege here, or\n\n356\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.370\nwe'll just basically\njust open what we need.\n\n357\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:39.940\nAll right.\nNow, we'll go ahead and\n\n358\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:47.310\nwe'll switch over to my other machine here\nand let's see We can get logged in here.\n\n359\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.670\nLet's see if we can do some\nremote log management.\n\n360\n00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.390\nAll right.\nOne of the first things I'm gonna go ahead\n\n361\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:19:00.000\nand do is I'm gonna launch up a blank\nMMC So we'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n362\n00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.100\nWe'll launch our Microsoft\nmanagement console.\n\n363\n00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.830\nAll right, and here's,\nso here's our blank MMC.\n\n364\n00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:12.990\nControl m brings up the add or remove snap\nins option, or you can just go up to file.\n\n365\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.950\nAnd you can see this option\nright here add, remove snap in,\n\n366\n00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.590\nso either one all right.\n\n367\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.790\nAnd the one that I want in the list,\njust gotta scroll down just a little bit,\n\n368\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.090\nis Event Viewer, and we're gonna add it.\n\n369\n00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.800\nAll right.\nNow it's asking me,\n\n370\n00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.520\nright now it says well, wait a second\nhere, you wanna do the local computer or\n\n371\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.700\ndo you wanna do another computer?\n\n372\n00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.600\nWe already seen what it look like on\nthe local computer when I was logged in\n\n373\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.940\nto the other computer.\n\n374\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.360\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's do another computer, all right.\n\n375\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.615\nAnd that'll be SRVO2, And we'll choose OK.\n\n376\n00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:49.770\nAnd I want you to notice something,\nthere is a difference.\n\n377\n00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.820\nNow, notice that the remote computer's\nname is on the outside of Event Viewer.\n\n378\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.250\nThat's important.\n\n379\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.480\nNow I will also tell you that it\ndoesn't necessarily mean you've\n\n380\n00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.100\nconfigured it right.\n\n381\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.890\nHere's the moment of truth.\n\n382\n00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.570\nJust because it says the name,\nit can find, in this case,\n\n383\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.380\nit's an active directory domain so\nit says, yeah, I know exactly who that is.\n\n384\n00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.690\nAnd it puts it right there on the outside.\n\n385\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.140\nBut it doesn't mean you've\nconfigured it right.\n\n386\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.190\nHopefully Wes has.\n\n387\n00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.470\nWe'll go ahead and expand it out.\n\n388\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.450\nNow, I can tell you I have just because\neverything opened up real quick.\n\n389\n00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.250\nIf it doesn't open up real quick chances\nare you might have to check those\n\n390\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.550\nfirewall rules.\n\n391\n00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.660\nWe'll go ahead and\nopen that up and you can see,\n\n392\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.030\nnotice that I also have the same logs\nthat we seen locally on that machine.\n\n393\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.210\nBut now I can tell that it's for\na remote machine.\n\n394\n00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.250\nSo I can now the remote log management.\n\n395\n00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.540\nAll right, well let's find out who's\nlogs these actually are in this system.\n\n396\n00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.630\nNow right?\n\n397\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:49.200\nWe'll give it a second here and,\nI am on, just to kind of show you guys\n\n398\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.750\nwhere I'm at, CMD, let's go ahead and do a\nhost name so you know what machine I'm on.\n\n399\n00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.290\nI'm actually on SRV01, right.\n\n400\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.090\nBut when I look at the log information,\n\n401\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.100\nI can see that the computer that\nthis log belongs to is at SRV02.\n\n402\n00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.540\nSo when you do log management it's\nmore efficient to do it this way.\n\n403\n00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.340\nIn fact, Dan I know you come\nextensively from the Linux realm, and\n\n404\n00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.890\nI know they do SIS log there, right?\n\n405\n00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.490\nWhere all of your Linux machines,\n\n406\n00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.190\nthey report back to a centralized SIS log\nserver You could check them locally but\n\n407\n00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.380\nthat's not really feasible\nin a large environment.\n\n408\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.220\nBut they can report to a larger\ncentralized system and\n\n409\n00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:33.650\nthen you can manage the logs all\nfrom the same centralized location.\n\n410\n00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.450\nAll right.\nSo\n\n411\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.710\nthat is a little bit about some\nof the things you can do as well.\n\n412\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.370\nNow there's other things that you can\ndo too, you can also do this like for\n\n413\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.530\ninstance with Power Shell if you're\ngonna do things like log management.\n\n414\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:50.390\nSo for instance, if I go ahead and\nI'm back on SRVO2 here,\n\n415\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.240\nand if I open up my Command Prompt,\n\n416\n00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.000\nmake sure that it's an administrative\ncommand prompt when you do this.\n\n417\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.455\nCouple of things that we have to do We\nhave to take the Windows Remote Management\n\n418\n00:22:00.455 --> 00:22:02.205\nservice and turn it on.\n\n419\n00:22:02.205 --> 00:22:05.825\nSo we'll do winrm space qc.\n\n420\n00:22:05.825 --> 00:22:10.185\nLet's me know, hey, this is already set\nup and ready to go, and that's fine.\n\n421\n00:22:10.185 --> 00:22:14.285\nI want to check that because then,\nif we want to do this through PowerShell.\n\n422\n00:22:15.665 --> 00:22:17.205\nApparently I had something\nin the clipboard there.\n\n423\n00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:19.987\nWe want to do this in PowerShell,\nin fact, let me go ahead and\n\n424\n00:22:19.987 --> 00:22:25.010\ndo the native PowerShell All right,\n\n425\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.372\nwe could also do that and, let me\nadjust our font here just real quick.\n\n426\n00:22:33.265 --> 00:22:37.874\nThere we go, all right, so the next thing\n\n427\n00:22:37.874 --> 00:22:42.660\nthat we have to do is enable -psremoting.\n\n428\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.670\nAll right, and we're gonna do a space, and\nwe're gonna do the word force, all right?\n\n429\n00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.630\nThe reason I'm doing the force\nis because it checks,\n\n430\n00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.662\nthis isn't any certain sci-fi movie,\nright?\n\n431\n00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:55.430\nThis is the command you're looking for.\n\n432\n00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.650\nWhat this saying it says,\ncheck to see if Wen RM is turned on,\n\n433\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.540\nwe already see that it is, but\ncheck to see that it's turned on.\n\n434\n00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.460\nIf it's not turn it on, and\ndon't ask me questions.\n\n435\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.244\nThen check to see if PowerShell's\nremoting is turned on, and\n\n436\n00:23:08.244 --> 00:23:11.147\ndon't ask me questions,\nkind of like when you do a yum install.\n\n437\n00:23:11.147 --> 00:23:12.280\nI think it's a dash y,\n\n438\n00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.580\nyou say just don't ask me any\nquestions when you do your install.\n\n439\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.170\nI know I wanna install it, I don't need\nto sit here and click yes 100 times.\n\n440\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.400\nSo we'll go ahead and run that.\n\n441\n00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.480\nAll right if I had to run the switch force\nI'd to begin a little bit of a dialogue\n\n442\n00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.230\noutput here and since we're not doing\nthat we don't have to worry about it.\n\n443\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:39.160\nAll right now let's go ahead and\nwe'll switch over to our server 01 and\n\n444\n00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:45.120\nI'm not gonna save this console, and\nwe are going to open the Power Shell here.\n\n445\n00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.940\nAll right.\n\n446\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.176\nAnd let's see if we would be\nable to connect to that remote\n\n447\n00:23:53.176 --> 00:23:57.988\nmachine in order to do things\nlike viewing its logs.\n\n448\n00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.025\nAll right, there we go.\n\n449\n00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:07.651\nOkay, so the next thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna do a commandlet here.\n\n450\n00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:12.620\nWe're gonna do Invoke-Command, all right.\n\n451\n00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.520\nWe're gonna do -computername,\n\n452\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.270\nwe need to tell it what computer\nit is that we're gonna use.\n\n453\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.539\nAnd in this case,\nit's gonna be Srv 02, and\n\n454\n00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:26.550\nthen, not credential,\nthe other part of this here,\n\n455\n00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.670\nis going to be a parameter\ncalled script block.\n\n456\n00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.500\nThen I'm going to tell it,\nwhat is it that I want to do?\n\n457\n00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:41.308\nIn this case,\nI want to get an event log all right,\n\n458\n00:24:41.308 --> 00:24:46.400\nand we're gonna do log name and\nthen it's application.\n\n459\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.170\nAnd then what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n460\n00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.370\nwe're gonna close that off and\nwe're gonna run it, all right.\n\n461\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:56.298\nNow, I probably should\npipe this out to more.\n\n462\n00:24:56.298 --> 00:25:01.349\nIf not, I've a feeling it's gonna dump\nall the application logs back at us.\n\n463\n00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:03.230\nLet's hope this works.\n\n464\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.780\nHopefully I've spelled that right.\n\n465\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.643\nCould tell you,\nif it takes this one, chances are,\n\n466\n00:25:08.643 --> 00:25:11.521\nwe're gonna have to do a little\nbit of trouble shooting here.\n\n467\n00:25:14.403 --> 00:25:21.960\nAll right, let me go ahead and\njust Ctrl+C that, see it ping.\n\n468\n00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:26.000\nGo to.\n\n469\n00:25:28.707 --> 00:25:31.470\nDan, I'm sure this\ncatches you all the time.\n\n470\n00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.940\nIf you're in Linux, I forgot the sudo.\n\n471\n00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.805\nIf you're in Windows,\nI forgot to elevate my privileges, and\n\n472\n00:25:36.805 --> 00:25:38.345\nthat can hit you every time, right.\n\n473\n00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:41.125\n&gt;&gt; That's why I just like logging\nin as the head admin, right.\n\n474\n00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:41.865\nWhy not, right?\n\n475\n00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:44.045\nCuz it's wrong,\nthat's security badness right there.\n\n476\n00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:45.247\nDon't do that.\n\n477\n00:25:45.247 --> 00:25:47.075\nDo like Wes says and\njust make the mistake and\n\n478\n00:25:47.075 --> 00:25:49.365\nthen go, yeah,\nI have to elevate my privileges.\n\n479\n00:25:49.365 --> 00:25:50.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n480\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.070\nSo that's what was going on here guys.\n\n481\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.580\nIn fact, let's go ahead and take a look at\nmy screen real quick and we'll go ahead\n\n482\n00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.920\nand we'll rerun that command and this\ntime, I'm gonna pipe it out to the more\n\n483\n00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.500\noption, so it'll slow it down a little\nbit and it should just take a second.\n\n484\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.050\nAnd you know,\nhonestly to tell you the truth,\n\n485\n00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:09.170\nit might end up being just, there we go.\n\n486\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.950\nAnd the more option was,\n[INAUDIBLE] what's going on.\n\n487\n00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.715\n&gt;&gt; You have to do dash p for patience.\n\n488\n00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:16.306\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and we've told you how do\n\n489\n00:26:16.306 --> 00:26:19.243\nwe tell a performance has\nactually gone south on us or\n\n490\n00:26:19.243 --> 00:26:22.015\nit's the fact that it's just my patience,\nso.\n\n491\n00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:25.045\n[LAUGH] We'll leave that one to you guys,\nthe viewers.\n\n492\n00:26:25.045 --> 00:26:26.382\n[LAUGH] So I can see right here.\n\n493\n00:26:26.382 --> 00:26:28.450\nI can see Windows.\n\n494\n00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.760\nI can see things like Windows\nerror reporting and stuff.\n\n495\n00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.911\nSo I do have login\ninformation that I can set.\n\n496\n00:26:32.911 --> 00:26:36.871\nSo you can see it here inside of\nthings like command line, interfaces,\n\n497\n00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:40.080\nas well as like we've\nshowed you in the GUI.\n\n498\n00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.100\nNow Dan, that being said,\n\n499\n00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.420\nI've got a few more things that it looks\nlike we've gotta take care of, but\n\n500\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.440\nit does look like, I think we're coming\nto the end of another episode, right.\n\n501\n00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.570\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we definitely are.\n\n502\n00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.360\nOur little clocky clock\nover here is going,\n\n503\n00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.800\nactually it's the time timer which is\nfunny, a little weird, name for the thing.\n\n504\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.000\nBut it is well out of time.\n\n505\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.820\nYou say, hey this episode has got to come\nto a close, but Wes is not finished.\n\n506\n00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.960\nHe's got plenty of other things\nthat he needs to talk to us about,\n\n507\n00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.190\nwhen it comes to performance monitoring\ntools, looking at the output thereof, and\n\n508\n00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.520\nthen interpreting that data.\n\n509\n00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.920\nSo it looks like we're headed into,\nyep that's right, a part two.\n\n510\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.345\nWes, thanks for\njoining us here in part one.\n\n511\n00:27:14.345 --> 00:27:16.470\nLook forward to seeing you in part two and\n\n512\n00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.268\nfinish culminating this information for\nus.\n\n513\n00:27:19.268 --> 00:27:22.377\nWe do thank you guys for watching,\nbut like I said, it's that time for\n\n514\n00:27:22.377 --> 00:27:23.073\nus to sign off.\n\n515\n00:27:23.073 --> 00:27:25.697\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie\n\n516\n00:27:25.697 --> 00:27:26.646\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n517\n00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:27.784\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n518\n00:27:30.037 --> 00:27:35.960\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.921\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:13.107\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n4\n00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:17.080\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.760\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode you come back for\n\n6\n00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.920\nnone other more Of our\nCompTIA Network+ Series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.210\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nis the man, the myth, the legend,\n\n8\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.290\nyou know him as Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.940\nIt's Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.769\nWelcome, Wes.\nHow's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's going great, Dan.\n\n12\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.160\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.310\nYeah, we had a little bit more that we\nneeded to round up, wrap up, I should say.\n\n14\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.750\nAnd well,\nI just didn't get to it in the first part.\n\n15\n00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.370\nSo, we've got a couple more things\nthat we are going to tackle.\n\n16\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.430\nKeep in mind that we spent pretty much\nthe large portion of well, just about\n\n17\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.290\nthe whole episode the first part, talking\nabout performance monitoring, performance\n\n18\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.000\nbaselines and some of the things that\nyou can get out of performing baselines.\n\n19\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.800\nSo if you're not familiar with that,\ngo check out that part then come back and\n\n20\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.002\nyo can watch us wrap up\nthe last few things here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:07.300\nWe're gonna talk about well, we really\nalready mentioned graphing, right.\n\n22\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.940\nWhen we look at graphs,\nperformance monitor's one of\n\n23\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.250\nthem that can show us different graphs and\nwe can actually change it around.\n\n24\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.300\nChange it up a little bit if we want\ndepending on what it is that we need.\n\n25\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.160\nSo for instance, let me go ahead and we'll\nlaunch up our performance monitor again.\n\n26\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.600\nAnd let me launch up my Performance\nMonitor again here, and we should still\n\n27\n00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.540\nhave our data collector set left over\nfrom the first part of this episode here,\n\n28\n00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.640\nand that means that we should\nalso have our report, right.\n\n29\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.820\nAnd if you remember from the first part\nwhen we did a baseline that was our\n\n30\n00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.540\nDemo Network + Baseline and if I expand\nthat out here was the log, right?\n\n31\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.360\nWe also talked about log\nmanagement in that first part.\n\n32\n00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.390\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe are gonna double click this and\n\n33\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.000\nthese are the statistics,\nin fact let me go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.800\nmake this a little bit easier to see for\nyou guys out there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.780\nNow this might not be\nthe view that you like right.\n\n36\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.600\nYou notice you got this line graph.\n\n37\n00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.450\nWell you can actually change\nthis up if you need to in\n\n38\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.770\nfact there's an option up here.\n\n39\n00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.450\nIf I zoom in you'll see that\nthere's a change graph type and\n\n40\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.400\nI can actually change it to something\na little bit different if I want for\n\n41\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.410\ninstance I can do the histogram bar.\n\n42\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.760\nAnd maybe that's a little bit easier for\nyou to interpret the information.\n\n43\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.500\nCould be just a way that you\nwanna view the information,\n\n44\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.270\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n45\n00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.290\nThere's also, and\nthe default by the way is the Line graph.\n\n46\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.970\nRight?\nWe can also do not only the histogram bar,\n\n47\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.300\nwell you just say in this case.\n\n48\n00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.480\nI mean maybe I don't want the graph,\nmaybe I just want the actual data itself.\n\n49\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.710\nSo I can see that as well\nrelated to that baseline and\n\n50\n00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.510\nthere are those counters that added.\n\n51\n00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.240\nRemember those characteristics of\nthe components that we wanted to monitor?\n\n52\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.960\n&gt;&gt; Counting away.\n\n53\n00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.790\n&gt;&gt; Counting away, absolutely,\nand giving us our valid data, and\n\n54\n00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.430\nreturning it back to us.\n\n55\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.370\nAgain, you can modify the graph\njust a little bit more.\n\n56\n00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.020\nYou can see, for instance,\na stacked area or two, so\n\n57\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.880\nif that makes a little bit more sense.\n\n58\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.110\nI tell you some of these, and that's why\nit's important to only add the tests that\n\n59\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.010\nyou want and the criteria that\nyou want because you can gain so\n\n60\n00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.220\nmuch information that you\ncan't tell what's going on.\n\n61\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this looks like a modern\nart masterpiece right here.\n\n62\n00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.950\n&gt;&gt; Picasso eat your heart out, for sure.\n\n63\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.340\n&gt;&gt; We've got performance monitor.\n\n64\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.070\n&gt;&gt; We definitely do.\n\n65\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.810\nThe way you interpret the data,\nlike the other one here is area,\n\n66\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.930\nit really doesn't change too much.\n\n67\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.840\nThat's why I usually,\nI like either the line graph honestly.\n\n68\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.680\nAnd because here is why,\nlike if I'm not sure which counter this\n\n69\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.810\nis I can interpret the information\na little bit easier by choosing\n\n70\n00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.990\nthe highlight option right here\nif you hover to discover here.\n\n71\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.960\nAnd that highlight button\nmakes it really easy.\n\n72\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.780\nIf I push the highlight button and now you\ncan see that it does have a mark on it.\n\n73\n00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.640\nI could turn around and\nI can select any one of these counters.\n\n74\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.300\nAnd it tells me that's my\nprocessor present processor time.\n\n75\n00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.770\nWell, I don't know what this red one is.\n\n76\n00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.800\nOkay, that's my processor queue link,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.730\nSo I can correlate the information\nin the graph based on whatever\n\n78\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.950\nmetric it is that it gives me back.\n\n79\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.850\nAll right, so\nI did wanna kinda just talk about that.\n\n80\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.290\nNow there are other ways that you\ncan have graph type information and\n\n81\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.950\nI kinda marked this one wrong in the\nnotes, and I'll definitely change it for\n\n82\n00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.920\nyour show notes,\ncuz I did perform it's monitor.\n\n83\n00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.590\nI also wanna do something known as\nreliability monitor, so I'll make sure\n\n84\n00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.160\nthat I do update those notes for you\nguys out there, if you guys need those.\n\n85\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.420\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll just do our Windows search.\n\n86\n00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.160\nYou can do perf mon for\nperformance monitoring.\n\n87\n00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.320\nYou can also do R-E-S-M-O-N for res mon,\nit's an older command that's been around.\n\n88\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.860\nOne of the things I love about the search\nfeature is if it can kinda delineate what\n\n89\n00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.340\nyou're thinking or what you're typing,\nit'll try to fill it in for you there.\n\n90\n00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.080\nAnd this is the resource monitor.\n\n91\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.340\nNow, you can see that we also have\nour graph type information here,\n\n92\n00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.890\nbut now we've got what I like to\ncall our four horsemen, right?\n\n93\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.120\nThese are the ones that,\n\n94\n00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.830\nthe four components that we really\nhave to monitor in any system and\n\n95\n00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.030\nyou can see things like your CPU,\nyour processor utilization right?\n\n96\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.960\nStorage utilization in this\ncase it's disk utilization.\n\n97\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.600\nIn this it's a DAS,\ndirect attached storage.\n\n98\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.660\nVersus something like a SAN where you\nwould have other monitoring software\n\n99\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.010\nthird party software that can\nmonitor like a storage area network.\n\n100\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.880\nAs well as,\nyou've got your network bandwidth, and\n\n101\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.130\nwe can see our bandwidth monitoring right\nhere as well as our memory utilization.\n\n102\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.820\nSo that's another location that we can\nsee information related in a graph but\n\n103\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.540\nwe can also get more statistical\ninformation here too.\n\n104\n00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.300\nSo notice that I'm running\nthe resource and performance monitor.\n\n105\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.830\nIt's kinda interesting.\n\n106\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.850\nIf I want to find out\nhow much of a resource,\n\n107\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.910\nmaybe a certain service\nmight be using here.\n\n108\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.940\nI can always just select\nit in the overview option.\n\n109\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.210\nAnd then what happens here.\n\n110\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.750\nI can turn around and\nI can expand this out and boy, you can see\n\n111\n00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.080\nthat it's filtering this information\ndown by just the performance monitor.\n\n112\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.700\nWhat is it using when\nit comes to my disk IO?\n\n113\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.360\nWell, I can see the language\ninterfaces here.\n\n114\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.970\nI can see things like the dlls, the\ndynamic link libraries which are more or\n\n115\n00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.770\nless an executable that only\nan application calls on, right.\n\n116\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.550\nSo I can see some of the resources\nthat it's utilizing.\n\n117\n00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.910\nI can tell that it, well, it really isn't\ndoing anything to the network there so\n\n118\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.200\nI'm not worried about it.\n\n119\n00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.400\nI can also see things\nlike memory utilization.\n\n120\n00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.940\nAll right, but what if I was\nrunning something like IIS on here.\n\n121\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.920\nNow, I know, probably a lot of\nyour computers out there running\n\n122\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.800\npublic basing web servers\nmost likely running Apache.\n\n123\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.722\nFor the Windows environment here if I\nhappen to be running an internal web\n\n124\n00:06:35.722 --> 00:06:40.110\nserver and I want to find out what's\nthe resource utilization on this\n\n125\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.830\nmachine related to the service\nthat it's providing.\n\n126\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.980\nWell I could also filter that down and\nI can put a filter for IIS and then look\n\n127\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.910\nacross all four of my major resources\nto get some information about that.\n\n128\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.400\nI really like the resource monitor.\n\n129\n00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.330\nIt's been at Windows for awhile.\n\n130\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.190\nNow speaking of being at Windows for\nawhile, there's another one here and\n\n131\n00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.750\nif I right click on I see Task Manager and\nTask Manager, it's got an update.\n\n132\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.100\nIn fact the update is so good that they\ntook what all the information out.\n\n133\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.950\nNo they start with the basic interface and\n\n134\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.490\nthen you have to go down to\nthe More details option here.\n\n135\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.630\nWhen you got on the More details\nyou can get a lot of details there.\n\n136\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.440\nYou could see things like your processes,\n\n137\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.530\nthe performance information,\nusers that are logged in.\n\n138\n00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.090\nProcesses tab and\nthe Details tab are pretty much the same.\n\n139\n00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.330\nThe difference is with the Processes tab,\nit gives you more of this hierarchical\n\n140\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.620\ntree and then whatever's being,\nlike if there's any\n\n141\n00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.720\nprocesses below it that are treed out\nyou can just kind of expand them out.\n\n142\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.190\nThe difference here is Details,\ndoes exactly that.\n\n143\n00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.724\nIt give you every single\ninstance of something running.\n\n144\n00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:49.634\nAnd you can also see things\nlike the processor ID that\n\n145\n00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:52.875\nidentifies it according to the processor,\nthe status and\n\n146\n00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.937\nstuff and also the context\nthat this is running in too.\n\n147\n00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:59.515\nRight because am I worried\nabout a system account,\n\n148\n00:07:59.515 --> 00:08:03.350\nam I worried about a user account,\nwell I'm not sure.\n\n149\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.350\nIs it the user that's\nhaving the problem and\n\n150\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.280\nit's only related to their user account.\n\n151\n00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.830\nMaybe I need to see that information\nversus maybe a system account or\n\n152\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.860\na network service account that\nmight be causing problems, right?\n\n153\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.600\nI can see for instance here,\nnotice the search UI, it's suspended,\n\n154\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.670\nit completely turned off.\n\n155\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.350\nWell, not completely turned off but\nit might as well be, right?\n\n156\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.800\nSo it's not even running,\n\n157\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.010\nwhich I don't really care if Cortana's\nrunning on the server or not.\n\n158\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.670\nPersonal opinion there.\n\n159\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.060\nI can see that everybody's favorite\nservice in Windows in running there,\n\n160\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.230\nthe print spooler.\n\n161\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.170\nJust kidding, guys.\n\n162\n00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.940\nBut again, you can see information\nlike that, as well as things like,\n\n163\n00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.500\nwhat are the services, right?\n\n164\n00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.820\nSo task manager's really, really good for\nseeing that kind of information.\n\n165\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.460\nAnd if you want just a quick view,\nyou don't need something like\n\n166\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.380\nresource monitor where you're\nnot going to be doing detailed,\n\n167\n00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.510\nmaybe step by step trouble shooting and\nthen couple that with a baseline.\n\n168\n00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.440\nThis is good for\n\n169\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.990\na real quick snapshot of what’s going\non on the machine on any given time.\n\n170\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.340\nAll right, now what’s kind of interesting,\nDan, they put another one in utilization,\n\n171\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.910\nright, so we've been really\ntalking about utilization.\n\n172\n00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.410\nSome of the things that\nwe can do to identify\n\n173\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.160\nwhat services are being utilized, right.\n\n174\n00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.750\nWhat resources, like memory disk,\nnetwork bandwidth are being utilized.\n\n175\n00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.660\nBut, they also call out things like,\nwireless channel utilization.\n\n176\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.110\n&gt;&gt; And that's an important topic,\nbecause once a channel gets saturated,\n\n177\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.300\nit starts degrading network performance,\nright?\n\n178\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.130\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n179\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.910\nIn fact, how do we even know that?\n\n180\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.440\nAnd that's where other utilities that\ncreate graphs also come in handy.\n\n181\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.800\nIn fact, I've got one here\nin the background here and\n\n182\n00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.020\nthis is the wi-fi explorer.\n\n183\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.240\nIn fact we've used this\nbefore in other episodes.\n\n184\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.940\nBut, what we're really talking about, what\nthey're calling out is exactly what Dan\n\n185\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.330\nwas talking about,\nshadow congestion, right?\n\n186\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.850\nWhen he mentions that hey,\nperformance is really gonna go south here.\n\n187\n00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.530\nWe're not talking about\na direction on the map.\n\n188\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.610\nWhat we're talking about,\nits performance is gonna get horrible.\n\n189\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.840\nAnd why is that?\n\n190\n00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.230\nWell you do have sometimes\nthe tendency for\n\n191\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:04.060\npeople to leave access points\non their default configurations.\n\n192\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.027\nAnd their default configurations,\na lot of times,\n\n193\n00:10:07.027 --> 00:10:09.532\nare what are known as\nauto channel sensing.\n\n194\n00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:11.927\nAnd it will control it on its own.\n\n195\n00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:16.302\nAll right, well, what happens if you\nsee like, right here for instance,\n\n196\n00:10:16.302 --> 00:10:20.410\nwe have quite a few of these access\npoints on channel 11, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.710\nIf I know that this signal is me and\nreally, really weak signals\n\n198\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.416\nare maybe buildings next door,\nmaybe I'm not so worried about it.\n\n199\n00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:35.079\nBut when I have some pretty sizable\nstrength on those access points and\n\n200\n00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:39.362\nthey're running the identical channels\nadjacent to me, and what I mean by that is\n\n201\n00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:43.290\nthey're on the same channel, but\ntheir access point is adjacent to mine.\n\n202\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.370\nIt could cause problems, all right.\n\n203\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:51.008\nAnd I can use one of these type of\nwireless analyzers and I can find that.\n\n204\n00:10:51.008 --> 00:10:52.205\nIn fact wow, look at this.\n\n205\n00:10:52.205 --> 00:10:57.075\nWe go up to channel one and we can say,\nwell I can find out that there's a lot of\n\n206\n00:10:57.075 --> 00:11:01.417\nthese machines, these devices or\naccess points that are currently\n\n207\n00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:06.130\nbroadcasting their information\nat 20 MHz across channel one.\n\n208\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.410\nI see channel 2, so this looks like\nmaybe somebody didn't do auto, right.\n\n209\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.350\nThey statically said no.\n\n210\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.219\nI don't care access point what\nyou think should be happening,\n\n211\n00:11:15.219 --> 00:11:16.960\nthis is what I want to happen, right.\n\n212\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.189\nI can probably guess that\nmaybe some of these 1, 6, and\n\n213\n00:11:20.189 --> 00:11:22.626\n11's are some default installations.\n\n214\n00:11:22.626 --> 00:11:25.800\nWell, maybe the default\nisn't good enough for me.\n\n215\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.530\nMaybe I need to get in and I got to say,\nwell, wait a second here, now I know that\n\n216\n00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:35.230\nif I rely on auto negotiation or auto\nconfiguration, maybe it puts me in 11,\n\n217\n00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.810\nmaybe it puts me into 6,\nmaybe it puts me into 1, and I don't that.\n\n218\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:43.760\nOr maybe I just, let's say theoretically\nI find out that nobody is in 11.\n\n219\n00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.000\nEverybody is on 1 and 6.\n\n220\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.260\nWell then, what I have to do from here\nis I have to determine, am I going\n\n221\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.750\nto go ahead and am I going to bump on,\nI'm not going to save this information.\n\n222\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.320\nAm I gonna,\n\n223\n00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.922\napparently I am going to save the\ninformation even though I said I wasn't.\n\n224\n00:11:57.922 --> 00:11:58.665\n[LAUGH] All right, there we go.\n\n225\n00:11:58.665 --> 00:11:59.269\n&gt;&gt; Guess you're saving.\n\n226\n00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:00.250\n&gt;&gt; Don't save.\n\n227\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.420\nThat's right, we're going to save\nit whether you want to or not.\n\n228\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.840\nSo I need to jump over to my wireless\naccess point, and if I'm going to\n\n229\n00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.690\nimplement it then I need to get logged in\nhere and what I need to do is figure out,\n\n230\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.700\nis it going to be okay if I dig\ndown in here into wireless, right?\n\n231\n00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.180\nNotice that we have mixed mode network.\n\n232\n00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.890\nAnd Dan, you see that channel,\n\n233\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.980\nwhat do you think's gonna happen\nif I leave it implemented, or\n\n234\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.630\npotentially could happen if I leave\nit with these settings right here?\n\n235\n00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.370\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna obviously choose\nthe channel that it thinks best.\n\n236\n00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.930\nAnd that might very well may be the exact\nsame channel every other router\n\n237\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.661\nout there access point thinks is best.\n\n238\n00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:38.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, absolutely.\n\n239\n00:12:38.504 --> 00:12:41.217\nSo now we're all in the same boat,\nwe're all holding hands on channel 1, and\n\n240\n00:12:41.217 --> 00:12:42.300\nnobody can get anything done.\n\n241\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.520\nSo I'm probably gonna have to\nchange something like this.\n\n242\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.030\nSo I just wanted to kind\nof show you how you could\n\n243\n00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.800\nuse one of these wireless\nanalyzers to find out.\n\n244\n00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.890\nIs your access point gonna have\nthe potential for channel congestion?\n\n245\n00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.100\nAnd in this case, most likely it will.\n\n246\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.740\nAnd I can say, you know what?\n\n247\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.280\nI don't wanna do auto, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.540\nYou guys seen there were a lot\nof them that were in the 1's.\n\n249\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.790\nThere was a lot of them 6 and what,\nor a lot of them that are on 11.\n\n250\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.740\nNow if you go back and watch our little\nwi-fi section where we talked about\n\n251\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.490\nthose standards, just remember\nthey are non-overlapping, right?\n\n252\n00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.790\nSo I might say, okay,\nwell I have seen a whole bunch at 1.\n\n253\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.200\nI've seen a whole bunch in 6, but\nI haven't seen anybody in 11, all right.\n\n254\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.650\nAnd I don't want this access\npoint flipping back and forth.\n\n255\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.680\nLike Dan said,\njust automatically choosing what it will.\n\n256\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.070\nAll right, so I choose 11 and\nthen I save the settings.\n\n257\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.450\nAnd then I wait, and obviously it's going\nto save the settings and hopefully allow\n\n258\n00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.510\nme to get back into it, if not then maybe\nI [INAUDIBLE] some other configurations.\n\n259\n00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.310\nBut I also want to let you guys know\nthat if you find this information,\n\n260\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.160\nwe talked about things like\nconfiguration backup, this is a very,\n\n261\n00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.820\nvery simplistic home router, right?\n\n262\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.500\nWhen you talk about more\nadvanced technologies,\n\n263\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.520\nlike your Cisco devices that we show\nyou guys in the Cisco classes as well.\n\n264\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.830\nThey can have really complex\nconfigurations, right.\n\n265\n00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.606\nYou could somebody that come in there and\nmaybe is a wireless expert that does\n\n266\n00:14:02.606 --> 00:14:05.910\nthings like adjusting of the strengths\nof the antennas and stuff,\n\n267\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.754\nsetting beaconing rates and stuff.\n\n268\n00:14:07.754 --> 00:14:12.305\nA lot of advanced configuration stuff,\neven just a simple modification like\n\n269\n00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:15.463\nthis isn't usually gonna\nhappen on a major network.\n\n270\n00:14:15.463 --> 00:14:18.782\nYou're going to go through some change\ndocumentation, a change management.\n\n271\n00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:22.490\nYou're gonna probably submit a change\nrequest that's gonna go in front of a cab,\n\n272\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.720\na change advisory board.\n\n273\n00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.480\nI's gonna either get approved or denied.\n\n274\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.710\nYou're gonna implement it and\ndocument your results, right.\n\n275\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.990\nIt's not gonna just be, let's go in\nhere and change something like that so.\n\n276\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.850\nAnd the other thing is\nbacking up the configurations\n\n277\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.560\nbefore you make your changes.\n\n278\n00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.960\nSo that if you do make your changes and\nsomething goes wrong,\n\n279\n00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.170\nyou can always restore them before hand.\n\n280\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.440\nOr to the point that they\nwere before hand, and\n\n281\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.490\nyou can know that the configuration\nwas exactly the way you found it, and\n\n282\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.700\nyou don't have to worry about\ncausing additional problems.\n\n283\n00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.360\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes,\nwhere's the fun in that, man?\n\n284\n00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.360\nThere's the excitement, is this gonna work\nand if it doesn't, are we totally hosed?\n\n285\n00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.070\nYeah, that, if you think that's exciting,\nyour heart will palpitate.\n\n286\n00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.330\nThere is no doubt about that.\n\n287\n00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.050\nEspecially when you're being\ncalled into your boss's office\n\n288\n00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.340\nto explain what you have done.\n\n289\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.960\nWhat else do we have to learn\nabout when it comes to monitoring?\n\n290\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.080\n&gt;&gt; You know, one of the last things\nthey call out is they call out interface\n\n291\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.710\nmonitoring.\n\n292\n00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.970\nAnd I know that there are many\ndifferent locations that\n\n293\n00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.130\nyou can do things like\ninterface monitoring.\n\n294\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.040\nWe've kind of already talked about some of\nthe things that we might need to look at.\n\n295\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.940\nFor instance, utilization,\njust bandwidth in general, right?\n\n296\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.600\nWe didn't talk about some other things\nthat you could potentially look at too,\n\n297\n00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.480\nand you can also do this in\nperformance monitor as well.\n\n298\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.200\nIf you're on like a Cisco system,\nyou can log into the console,\n\n299\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.450\nthey could show you information.\n\n300\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.540\nIn fact, Dan and I,\nwhat Dan was mentioning.\n\n301\n00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.850\nHe goes, man, I've seen that where I\nlogged into Linux and Linux will tell me,\n\n302\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.730\nthese errors, I can see utilization and\nI can see it really detailed.\n\n303\n00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.818\nYou can also do limited amount of\nthis inside of a Windows machine,\n\n304\n00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:50.989\nlikewise as well.\n\n305\n00:15:50.989 --> 00:15:57.335\nSo for instance, if I wanna find\nout like speed and duplex, alright.\n\n306\n00:15:57.335 --> 00:16:01.129\nSpeeds and duplex typically today are auto\nThat does not mean that every time\n\n307\n00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:04.865\nthe switch and the device that's\ncommunicating with the switch will get it\n\n308\n00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:06.782\nright, sometimes they get it wrong.\n\n309\n00:16:06.782 --> 00:16:11.349\nAnd when you have that mismatch,\nwhether be it speed, maybe not so much but\n\n310\n00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:14.250\ndefinitely the duplexing\ncan cause problems,\n\n311\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.729\ncan bring your whole network to a crawl.\n\n312\n00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:19.745\nYou can have things like\nconnection resets, right.\n\n313\n00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:23.040\nWhether if I have a mismatch like that,\nlet me show you where you can actually set\n\n314\n00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.200\nthis information as well as monitoring\nwhat type of speed you're at.\n\n315\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.890\nSo, for instance,\non my Windows server machine here,\n\n316\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.010\nif I go ahead and\nright-click on the Windows charm here and\n\n317\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.590\nI choose Device Manager there's a couple\nof cool little places that you can go.\n\n318\n00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.890\nWe think of Device Manager pretty much as\njust a place we can update drivers and\n\n319\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.140\nwhat is my machine aware of?\n\n320\n00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.480\nWhat hardware is my machine aware of?\n\n321\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.930\nBut there are awesomeconfigurations that\nyou can do a little bit farther than\n\n322\n00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.490\nthat, that get a little bit more advanced\nwhen you talk about things like your\n\n323\n00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.490\nnetwork adaptors.\n\n324\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.780\nSo, for instance,\nif I expand out my network adaptor here,\n\n325\n00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.250\nwe can see things like some of your\ntunneling protocols that are in here.\n\n326\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.010\nThis machine, I wanna say I have routing\nand remote access installed and that's why\n\n327\n00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:12.620\nwe're seeing all of these remote access\nprotocols and VPN protocols here.\n\n328\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.710\nBut, what I'm looking at is, the network\nadaptor and if I right-click on it and\n\n329\n00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.360\nI choose properties, all right,\nI'll get the properties dialogue box and\n\n330\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:27.320\nwhat I'm really looking for\nis the Advanced tab, right here.\n\n331\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.830\nSee the Advanced tab, first of all,\nit shows you the features that you have.\n\n332\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.601\nThe more advanced, and\nI know that's obvious from the tab, but\n\n333\n00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:39.088\nall of some of these features that I have\non my network adapter that a lot of times,\n\n334\n00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:40.652\nI don't even bother with, right?\n\n335\n00:17:40.652 --> 00:17:43.510\nMaybe you don't,\nmaybe you have a reason to.\n\n336\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.565\nThere might actually be a reason\nthat maybe this device-\n\n337\n00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:48.940\n&gt;&gt; Has lost its mind.\n\n338\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.784\n&gt;&gt; Just lost its properties, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:51.784 --> 00:17:54.833\nMaybe you need to implement jumbo frames,\nright.\n\n340\n00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:56.980\nWe'll talk about implementing\njumbo frames on a switch.\n\n341\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.508\nWell, maybe you have to be able to set it\non the network adapter within the device\n\n342\n00:18:01.508 --> 00:18:03.940\nthat is going to receive that jumbo frame,\n\n343\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.399\nor send that jumbo frame, because of\nthe fact that by default, for instance,\n\n344\n00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:12.553\nWindows I think sets an MTU of\n1500 bytes sent, that's it, right.\n\n345\n00:18:12.553 --> 00:18:16.480\nSo I'm not gonna understand 9,000 bytes\nwhat the heck is that, that's crazy,\n\n346\n00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.580\nI can't bite off that.\n\n347\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.598\nBut you could come in here and you\ncould make some changes to the advanced\n\n348\n00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:23.376\nproperties, and\nthere's that 9,000 bytes a little over.\n\n349\n00:18:23.376 --> 00:18:27.637\nI believe and I'm not sure if you know\nthis, Dan, but I believe the extra patting\n\n350\n00:18:27.637 --> 00:18:31.899\nis for VLAN tagging cuz there's a little\nbit of extra information that's always\n\n351\n00:18:31.899 --> 00:18:35.177\nassociated when you start doing\nthings like VLANS and stuff.\n\n352\n00:18:35.177 --> 00:18:39.060\nBut the one that I want is I believe if I\nremember right it's closer to the bottom.\n\n353\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.090\nThere we go Speed &amp; Duplex.\n\n354\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.450\nNotice we have Auto Negotiation.\n\n355\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.470\nAuto Negotiation is typically\nthe way that these are defined.\n\n356\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.140\nHowever, if you ever have a reason to\nmanually define whatever the duplex is or\n\n357\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.840\nwhat the speed is you can come in here and\nyou could do that.\n\n358\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.920\nAnd you could also find out, right?\n\n359\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.440\nIs it on Auto Negotiation, right?\n\n360\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.540\nAre we on, well, that's an old\nnetwork 10 megs, full duplex,\n\n361\n00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.750\nbut you never know,\nyou might just be on that.\n\n362\n00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.750\nSo we can also do that right here.\n\n363\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:13.580\nNow, I did mention they talk about other\nthings, for instance, things like errors,\n\n364\n00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.870\ndiscards, packet drops, we've mentioned\nthis kind of in other episodes.\n\n365\n00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.860\nBut there is a command inside\nof Command Prompt that will let\n\n366\n00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.160\nyou see a little bit of that\ninformation and that's netstat -e.\n\n367\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.130\nAll right, netstat being short for\nnetwork statistics.\n\n368\n00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.340\nAll right, and if I run that, it does\nshow me things like the errors if any.\n\n369\n00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.680\nIt shows me that discards\nNon-unicast packets which basically,\n\n370\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.100\nthey lump it into two categories,\n\n371\n00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.550\nUnicast, what is going between let's say\nDan and my computer versus Non-unicast.\n\n372\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.210\nWhat is a multi-cast communication?\n\n373\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.750\nWhat is a broadcast communication?\n\n374\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.650\nYou could say it doesn't\nappear that we have any.\n\n375\n00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.950\nBut maybe I wanna go a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n376\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.640\nLet's take you back to\nperformance monitor and\n\n377\n00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.550\nshow you something that you can actually\ndo inside a performance monitor\n\n378\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.740\nif you want to actively\nmonitor these type of things.\n\n379\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.589\nSo, for instance,\nif I do performance monitor here and\n\n380\n00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:08.133\nwe're just going to go ahead,\nwe wanna add this to\n\n381\n00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:11.547\nour baseline I just want to show you\nguys were this is at real quick.\n\n382\n00:20:11.547 --> 00:20:14.960\nAnd I go ahead and I'm going to add\nadditional counters just like we did when\n\n383\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.280\nwe were setting up our\ndata collectors set.\n\n384\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.850\nAnd now I'm gonna scroll,\nI believe, closer to the bottom.\n\n385\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.250\nThank goodness this one's\na little easier for me to find.\n\n386\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.320\nAs I say that, TCPv4, right?\n\n387\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.574\nIf I wanna see that, now,\n\n388\n00:20:27.574 --> 00:20:31.350\ntransmission control protocols\ncan actually no reads set, right?\n\n389\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:37.550\nSo if drops happen, if errors happen, what\nis transmission control protocol gonna do?\n\n390\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.720\nHold on a second, that's an error,\nlet me discard that.\n\n391\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.320\nLet me reach back out.\n\n392\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.010\nAnd let me grab that packet again.\n\n393\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.090\nI might need to know that information.\n\n394\n00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.040\nI might need to know there's something\non my network that's causing\n\n395\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:49.740\nnetwork corruption.\n\n396\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.030\nIt might not even be a hack.\n\n397\n00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.470\nWe're talking from\nsecurity standpoint here.\n\n398\n00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.080\nI might have some device causing\nerrors on my network, right?\n\n399\n00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:04.070\nSo I can come in here and if I wanted to,\nI could see that very thing, right?\n\n400\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.600\nThings like established connections,\nyou can see active connections,\n\n401\n00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.490\nfailures, connection or\n/interface resets that might happen.\n\n402\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.950\nWhat's received, again,\nyou can see it in things like discard too.\n\n403\n00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.720\nSo again, not gonna set that one up, but\n\n404\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.310\nyou could also monitor from inside\nof your operating system too.\n\n405\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.180\nNow if you're on a connectivity device\nsuch as a Cisco switch or a Cisco router,\n\n406\n00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.810\nyou're gonna enter some\nkind of command and\n\n407\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.900\nit's gonna output that information, right.\n\n408\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.260\nIf you're in a Linux machine\nyou're gonna enter a command and\n\n409\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.880\nit can output that information for you so\n\n410\n00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.110\nyou can see it right there in your\nterminal or your console as well.\n\n411\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.310\nSo where you see this information is\ncontingent on the system that you're on.\n\n412\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.900\nAnd what information you see is also\ncontingent on the device that you're on.\n\n413\n00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.230\nBut, if you know where to look and\n\n414\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.330\nif you know a couple of the things\nthat you're looking for\n\n415\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.650\nit could make your networks perform a lot\nbetter when it comes to knowing what\n\n416\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:00.700\nthe information is that's being\npresented to you, how to interpret it.\n\n417\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.140\nAnd sometimes it could be as simple as\ndo I have a piece of software that can\n\n418\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.320\ntake that raw data load it up\ninto a human readable format and\n\n419\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.980\nthen we can make some sense out of it.\n\n420\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.100\nAnd knowing where to go will show you or\n\n421\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.160\nwill make it a lot easier when it comes\nto interpreting that information.\n\n422\n00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.800\n&gt;&gt; Man I do love spending those multi\nthousands of dollars on great software\n\n423\n00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.250\nthat will actually do that stuff for you\ncuz there are those systems inside of our\n\n424\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.660\noperating systems, Linux and Windows if\nyou're a network device, CISCO, whoever.\n\n425\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.370\nYeah, that's there, but\nman is it nice to sit behind some\n\n426\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.310\nconsole management one stop shopping and\ntake a look at everything that's happening\n\n427\n00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.790\non your network, all these lovely\npieces of information for output.\n\n428\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.570\nWes, we have run quite the gambit my man,\na lot of performance monitoring,\n\n429\n00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.400\na lot of networking monitoring,\nutilization, you name it, it's there.\n\n430\n00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.902\nWe have to be able to be comfortable\nwith these systems because why?\n\n431\n00:22:50.902 --> 00:22:54.185\nWell, we wanna be the network people and\nif you wanna be the network people then\n\n432\n00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:56.690\nyou gotta understand\nthat's how networks work.\n\n433\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.340\nFind where the problems are,\nbe able to interpret that data and\n\n434\n00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.560\nsay hm looks like we might be\nhaving some flapping on a port.\n\n435\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.450\nOr this computer has some\nseverely high utilisation\n\n436\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.200\nto an unknown Internet resource.\n\n437\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.960\nWhat's going on there?\n\n438\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.920\nMaybe they've got malware or\nsomething like that.\n\n439\n00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.670\nThat's what we need to be able to do,\nand looking at the status,\n\n440\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.490\nshould lend you to those things.\n\n441\n00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.650\nWes, you did a great job\nof showing us the myriad\n\n442\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.980\nof different places that that might\nbe done, we thank you for that.\n\n443\n00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.370\nWe thank our good members for\nwatching, but it does,\n\n444\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.120\nI'm looking at the clock, and guess what?\n\n445\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.450\nIt's going tickety toppety\ndown to the last talk.\n\n446\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.210\nSo thanks for joining us today.\n\n447\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.350\nWe are gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n448\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.150\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n449\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.024\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n450\n00:23:37.024 --> 00:23:38.241\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:12.410\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.870\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.010\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.885\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.792\nIn today's episode, that's right,\n\n8\n00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.926\nwe are continuing on with more\non our CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:27.055\nOf course, joining us in the studio,\nour friend, our mentor,\n\n10\n00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:28.970\nour good friend, Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.100\nWesley, welcome back to the studio,\nman, how's it going?\n\n12\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, Dan.\n\n13\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.350\nThanks for having me back here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.065\nThat's right, we are moving on in Net+,\nand today it's all about paperwork.\n\n15\n00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:42.345\nWell, close, it's about supporting\nconfiguration management.\n\n16\n00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:45.495\nThere's quite a few different ways\nthat they call out supporting\n\n17\n00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:49.555\nconfiguration management, so that is\nwhat we are gonna be looking at today.\n\n18\n00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:52.585\nOne of the first things that they talk\nabout in the objectives are archives and\n\n19\n00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.375\nbackups.\n\n20\n00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:57.295\nNow we know from other episodes,\nother courses, and\n\n21\n00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.415\nif you don't know we're gonna tell you.\n\n22\n00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:03.424\nBackups are probably one of\nthe most important things that you\n\n23\n00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:07.743\ncan do to support your infrastructure\nwhen it comes to disasters,\n\n24\n00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:11.929\nwhen it comes to faults in your hardware,\nfailures if you will.\n\n25\n00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.516\nNot only supporting\nconfiguration management but\n\n26\n00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:17.050\nalso supporting things\nlike disaster recovery.\n\n27\n00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.226\nBackups cross the lines on\na lot of different topics, and\n\n28\n00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.890\nthey are very, very important.\n\n29\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.410\nSo, I'll tell you what, let's go ahead.\n\n30\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.080\nWe'll just dive right into backups,\n\n31\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.710\nand the first thing that we wanna\ntalk about, what is a backup?\n\n32\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.310\nNow we gotta understand\nthat a backup really is.\n\n33\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.490\nEven though it's configuration management,\nsometimes we call it preventative\n\n34\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.920\nmaintenance, it really should\nbe ongoing system maintenance.\n\n35\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.330\nThere are different backup\ntypes that we can implement and\n\n36\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.980\nthey do have some considerations\nthat we need to take.\n\n37\n00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.520\nLike for instance, how long does it take\nto gather all the crucial information\n\n38\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.580\noff of our machine versus how\nlong does it take to restore it.\n\n39\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.750\nSo we'll look at some\ndifferent backup types.\n\n40\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.670\nWe're gonna look at one that's called\na full backup type, we'll look at another\n\n41\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.470\none called differential, and we're\ngonna look at one called incremental.\n\n42\n00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.540\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe're gonna dive right into the first one,\n\n43\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.270\nwe're gonna start with what's\nknown As a differential backup.\n\n44\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.170\nNow, the differential backup, this is\none where when we are backing up data.\n\n45\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.760\nI tell you what let's go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.980\nwhat we'll do is we'll step back a little\nbit cuz we've also got to understand\n\n47\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.840\ninside of like, for instance,\ninside of a Windows machine.\n\n48\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.610\nHow do we determine what\nneeds to be backed up at all?\n\n49\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.210\nAnd that's usually dependent\non an attribute Of files and\n\n50\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.040\nfolders called an archive bit or\nan archive attribute.\n\n51\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.050\nAnd the archive attribute lets a backup\nsubsystem know whether it's got a current\n\n52\n00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.510\ncopy of this file or\nfolder in a backup already.\n\n53\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.050\nNow when you run a full backup, what\nhappens is archive bits are cleared, and\n\n54\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.920\nagain what it lets, for\ninstance a Windows subsystem know is hey\n\n55\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.440\nYou've already got a copy of\nthis in this full back up.\n\n56\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.640\nOnce I back everything up,\nI'm gonna clear that archive bit so\n\n57\n00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.790\nthat the next day when you come in,\nwe shouldn't have any archive bits\n\n58\n00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.790\nThe different back up types,\nsometimes they look at out archive bit,\n\n59\n00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.390\nsometimes they clear it,\nsometimes they dont.\n\n60\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.300\nAnd that's something that's before\nwe even start with back ups,\n\n61\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.590\nwe need to understand.\n\n62\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.040\nIn fact, if I jump on a Windows\nmachine here a real quick,\n\n63\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.070\nlet me show you what I mean by\narchive bit, we'll go ahead,\n\n64\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.380\nwe'll just jump down real quick to\na command prompt, And I'll go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.770\nnavigate into my desktop here and\nwe'll do a DIR.\n\n66\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.660\nAnd yo can see there is that file\nthat I have on the desktop, putty.\n\n67\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.800\nAll right,\nwe've used this in other episodes here.\n\n68\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.770\nNow Has putty been backed up before?\n\n69\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.510\nIt's an executable, it's still a file,\nhas it been backed up?\n\n70\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.350\nWell how do you tell?\n\n71\n00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.750\nWe use something known inside of Windows\nas the attrib command, a t t r i b,\n\n72\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.290\nand then I can type the name of the file.\n\n73\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.660\nAnd we could run that.\n\n74\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.350\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n75\n00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.770\none of the things that you're going\nto notice is that there's a little\n\n76\n00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.880\nA over here.\n\n77\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.790\nWhat does the A mean for us?\n\n78\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.930\nThe A is that archive bit\nthat I was telling you about.\n\n79\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.350\nAnd what that lets me know is that a full\nbackup hasn't been run on this machine\n\n80\n00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.150\nsince one of two things have happened.\n\n81\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.490\nEither since I've downloaded this file\nmaybe we've already had a back up run and\n\n82\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.720\nthen I downloaded the file.\n\n83\n00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.360\nWell that creates a new\nfile on your machine.\n\n84\n00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.810\nEvery time you create a file or\n\n85\n00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.730\nfolder on your machine, instantly\nthe archive attribute gets flagged.\n\n86\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.100\nIt says,\nnext time you run this backup subsystem,\n\n87\n00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.360\nyou need to back this file up, all right.\n\n88\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.790\nNow if you wanted to know You know\nwhat the actual attributes are,\n\n89\n00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.150\nwhich we don't need to\nreally look at all of them.\n\n90\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.980\nBut there are a couple that\nare definitely worth mentioning right.\n\n91\n00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.980\nWe talk about in other episodes\nthe read only system and hidden.\n\n92\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.050\nAlright but this is the one that we're\nreally really looking at, right.\n\n93\n00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.480\nAnd sometimes you might hear people,\nyou might hear me call it,\n\n94\n00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.750\nmatter of fact I'm calling\nit an archive bit.\n\n95\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.360\nYou might hear other people call it\narchive bit or just the archive batch.\n\n96\n00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.590\nIf you just know that those\nare synonymous terms.\n\n97\n00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.570\nAll right?\n\n98\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.710\nNow, understanding that archive BIC\nhelps us to understand how these backup\n\n99\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.280\ntypes that we're gonna talk about, are\ndetermining what needs to be backed up.\n\n100\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.490\nOr if they're really doing\nanything with that archive BIC.\n\n101\n00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.360\nSometimes they do, and\nsometimes, they don't.\n\n102\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.070\nSo, the very first one is\ncalled a differential backup.\n\n103\n00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.960\nAnd it is important to understand\nthat Any backup that we have.\n\n104\n00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.850\nAny backup type that we implement always\nstarts with a full backup, all right?\n\n105\n00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.980\nThat is important to understand.\n\n106\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310\nNow, that being said,\nwhat are we doing here?\n\n107\n00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.325\nAll right, All right.\n\n108\n00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.745\nNow let's say I run a full back up.\n\n109\n00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.195\nArchive attributes are clear.\n\n110\n00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:48.825\nThat means Monday morning\nbefore anything starts.\n\n111\n00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:52.185\nBefore I even start any work or\nany company does,\n\n112\n00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:56.230\nwe shouldn't have any archive attributes\npresent on any files or folders, right.\n\n113\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.700\nBecause when I run a full back up\nit clears all the archive bits,\n\n114\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.150\nwe start fresh.\n\n115\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.310\nBut then as Monday goes a long right and\npeople come in, they start working,\n\n116\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.890\nthey gonna modify files right.\n\n117\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.770\nIf you modify a file, sends a full back\nup Boy, flags that archive once again.\n\n118\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.240\nSomething's changed, so\n\n119\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.760\nyou don't have a current copy of\nwhatever information's changed.\n\n120\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.970\nOr if I create a file,\nin this case I have download putty.\n\n121\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.030\nRight?\nYou say well Wes,\n\n122\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.970\nyou're not really creating a file.\n\n123\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.270\nWell yes you are, when you download,\n\n124\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.680\nyou're actually kinda transferring\nthat file to that system,\n\n125\n00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.504\nit becomes a new file on that system and\nthe archive gets flagged.\n\n126\n00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:35.050\nNow, what happens at the end of the day,\n\n127\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.180\nin a differential back up type When\nwe run our backup software on Monday.\n\n128\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.320\nWell, differential is interesting because\nwhat it does is it looks to the last\n\n129\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.660\nbackup alright, and it says, let me look\nat the information that I have currently\n\n130\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.140\nhere, at the end of Monday And see what\nhas changed since that last back up.\n\n131\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.170\nWell, how is it finding\nout what's changed?\n\n132\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.930\nIt's looking to the archive bit.\n\n133\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.200\nAnd when it finds those files that have\nbeen modified or have been changed.\n\n134\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.400\nIt says, yeah,\nI need to back those up, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.200\nAnd then what does it do?\n\n136\n00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.920\nYou'll run the back up and now we have\nan archived copy of those new files.\n\n137\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.630\nBut here's something I\nwant you to keep in mind.\n\n138\n00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.830\nUnlike running a full back\nup that clears archive bits,\n\n139\n00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.690\nthe differential does not So,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n140\n00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.580\nWhen I come in on Monday, all right,\nlet's not worry about any changes.\n\n141\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.150\nWhat happens when I come in,\nI mean, on Tuesday?\n\n142\n00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:31.190\nWell, on Tuesday, remember,\nthe only things that have changed\n\n143\n00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.770\nare really just what\nactually happened on Monday.\n\n144\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.510\nBecause when I ran that backup,\nnone of the archive bits are clear.\n\n145\n00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.560\nThat means come in on Monday\nmorning before anything happens.\n\n146\n00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.350\nWe've already got some archive bits\npresent, which means we're gonna have\n\n147\n00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.630\ndata that we need to back up even\nif we don't change a single thing.\n\n148\n00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.572\nBut then Tuesday, as Tuesday goes along,\npeople are gonna make their changes, and\n\n149\n00:07:50.572 --> 00:07:54.348\nthat's all these These blocks really\nrepresent is the different changes here,\n\n150\n00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.977\njust so you can see it in a diagram.\n\n151\n00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:58.199\nBut then at the end of Tuesday,\nwhat happens?\n\n152\n00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.680\nThere again, differential backup\nsays let's look to the last backup.\n\n153\n00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.071\nAnd let's figure out what's changed.\n\n154\n00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:06.837\nAgain, how do we do that?\n\n155\n00:08:06.837 --> 00:08:10.862\nWell, now on Tuesday what changes in\nmodifications and the creations of files,\n\n156\n00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:14.370\nwe've got additional archive bits\nthat weren't present on Monday.\n\n157\n00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.100\nSo when we run the backup software,\nnotice what's happening here.\n\n158\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.620\nNow, not only did we have those archive\nbits that were included on Monday.\n\n159\n00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.550\nAnd again, just generically saying\narchive bits all those files and\n\n160\n00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.980\nchanges from Monday.\n\n161\n00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.470\nAre now included in Tuesday's backup and\n\n162\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.540\nthen Tuesday changes are now\nincluded at the end of the day.\n\n163\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.417\nYou might not start to notice\na pattern here, differential,\n\n164\n00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:41.110\nit's the difference between\nthe last full backup.\n\n165\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.390\nBecause then there is just cycle\njust repeat itself, right?\n\n166\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.220\nWednesday, we come in, so that we\nhaven't cleared archive bits on Monday,\n\n167\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.790\nwe haven't cleared\narchive bits on Tuesday.\n\n168\n00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.750\nGoing out the gate before I modify or\nchange anything or anybody does any work.\n\n169\n00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.420\nWe're gonna have those\narchive bits present and\n\n170\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.860\nthen we're gonna make modifications again\nand changes and we're gonna do our work.\n\n171\n00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.080\nAnd then at the end of the Wednesday,\nwe're gonna look to that last backup and\n\n172\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.140\nwe're gonna say okay, what's changed?\n\n173\n00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.200\nWell, I know it's changed today,\n\n174\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.800\nas well as all of those archived\nbits from the previous days.\n\n175\n00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.650\nSo what you might be seeing here, Dan, is\nthat you notice anything about each day as\n\n176\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.300\neach day goes, what's kind of\nhappening here from Monday to Friday?\n\n177\n00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.540\n&gt;&gt; They get a different color.\n\n178\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.600\n&gt;&gt; They get a different color, right?\n\n179\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.780\nAnd by getting a different color,\nit means that the archives or\n\n180\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.800\nthe backups keep getting bigger, right?\n\n181\n00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.160\nNotice that they start\ncompounding on each other, right?\n\n182\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.580\nSo that means at the end of Thursday,\nsame thing happens, I gotta figure out.\n\n183\n00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.610\nWhat do I need to change?\n\n184\n00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.510\nI'm gonna look to the last backup.\n\n185\n00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.680\nWe didn't clear any archive bits Monday,\nTuesday or Wednesday.\n\n186\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.390\nSo guess what?\n\n187\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.020\nEvery one of those archive\nbits will still be present.\n\n188\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.270\nAnd when the differential figures out,\nwhat do I need to backup,\n\n189\n00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.190\nit's looking at those archive bits.\n\n190\n00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.880\nAnd then finally, on Friday, same thing\nhappens, now I know my head is gonna\n\n191\n00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.660\ncover another, but just a little\nbit we'll move it over there.\n\n192\n00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.300\nNow,on Friday, what's happened?\n\n193\n00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.230\nNotice that what is essentially\nhappened is we keep adding more and\n\n194\n00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.120\nmore data to our backup.\n\n195\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.570\nNow you might be saying well,\nwhat happens at the end of Friday?\n\n196\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.460\nWell, at the end of Friday,\n\n197\n00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.810\nwe backed up all the changes essentially\nwhat's happened throughout the week\n\n198\n00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.210\nsince the last full backup,\npull a little sneaky one in here.\n\n199\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.460\nPut an arrow right there first.\n\n200\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.760\nAnd guess what?\n\n201\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:29.360\nThat becomes your full backup for the next\nweek and then the cycle repeats itself.\n\n202\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.750\nSo you follow me there on that one.\n\n203\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.920\nNotice that with the differential backup,\nyou're only backing up the changes but\n\n204\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.940\nyou don't clear the archived bits.\n\n205\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.050\nSo those changes keep growing, and\ngrowing, and growing until Friday,\n\n206\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.190\nyou're essentially backing up all\nthe changes for the entire week.\n\n207\n00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.900\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\n\n208\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.930\nhow come they don't clear the archive bit\nwhen they're doing this type of echo?\n\n209\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm not exactly sure why the archive\nbit, it doesn't get changed here.\n\n210\n00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.926\nBut I will tell you that one of the\nreasons in the differential that they do\n\n211\n00:10:59.926 --> 00:11:01.877\nthat is for the restoration side and\n\n212\n00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:05.076\nwe'll see that coming up when\nwe talk about restoration.\n\n213\n00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:06.750\nWhy are they [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n214\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.170\nI'm not exactly sure because there's\nanother one that does clear,\n\n215\n00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.550\nI mean it doesn't look much different.\n\n216\n00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.490\nIn fact, if we look at it,\nit's color box again.\n\n217\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.710\nWhat's going on here?\n\n218\n00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.360\nWe're missing some data, aren't we?\n\n219\n00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.420\nI don't know.\n\n220\n00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.560\nThe incremental backup is one that,\nbelieve it or not, will look.\n\n221\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.370\nLet's say we come in on Monday, right, and\nthere's changes that are gonna be made.\n\n222\n00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.190\nNow we're gonna look to the last backup,\njust like we did before.\n\n223\n00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.845\nAnd we're gonna find those archive bits,\nwe're gonna back the data up there.\n\n224\n00:11:42.845 --> 00:11:45.503\nAnd here's something that's a little\ndifferent with a differential\n\n225\n00:11:45.503 --> 00:11:47.230\nversus the incremental.\n\n226\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.960\nThe incremental actually\nclears the archive bits.\n\n227\n00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.030\nSo now what happens on Tuesday?\n\n228\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.520\nOn Tuesday, we come in first thing in\nthe morning and because the archive\n\n229\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.700\nbits were cleared on Monday, they don't\nexist, that data hasn't changed, right?\n\n230\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.260\nTuesday, we're gonna make some changes and\nat the end of the day, the backup\n\n231\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.380\nsoftware's gonna look to the archive bit\nand say what changes have been made.\n\n232\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.250\nWell, remember on Monday,\nat the end of the day,\n\n233\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.330\nwe cleared all those archive bits,\nso they're not present on Tuesday.\n\n234\n00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.480\nSo the incremental backup,\n\n235\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.400\nwhen it does happen to look at the last\nbackup to determine what has changed.\n\n236\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.600\nIt finds those archived bits and\nthen once it finds them, it clears them.\n\n237\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.760\nAnd then Wednesday, right.\n\n238\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.740\nWe come in on Wednesday, we don't\nhave any of Monday's backup files or\n\n239\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.100\nTuesday's files that need to\nbe backed up in Wednesday.\n\n240\n00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.630\nBecause at the end of each day\non the incremental backup,\n\n241\n00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.800\nwe're clearing the archive bit.\n\n242\n00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.530\nAll right, and\nthen Thursday and then Friday.\n\n243\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.090\nSo what you'll see here is what\nthe incremental backup, unlike\n\n244\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:55.310\nthe differential backup,\nis that the backups are smaller.\n\n245\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.050\nThey're not as large by the end of Friday,\nall right?\n\n246\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:06.230\nThen on the end of Friday, maybe Friday\nnight, we actually do a full backup again.\n\n247\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.650\nAnd then that full backup will\nstart the next week, all right?\n\n248\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.900\nNow that's so\nfar we talked about two, right?\n\n249\n00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.270\nWe talked about the differential and\nwe talked about the incremental.\n\n250\n00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.300\nThe next one that we gotta talk about\nis probably one that's just about easy\n\n251\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.510\nto figure out.\n\n252\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.550\nThis is a full backup.\n\n253\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.110\nThis is a full back up type.\n\n254\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.670\nNow the full back up type is interesting.\n\n255\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.990\nBecause I told you that the full backups,\nthey look to the archived bits to\n\n256\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.380\ndetermine what's changed and\nthey clear the archive bits.\n\n257\n00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.390\nThis is interesting.\n\n258\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.685\nA full backup type,\neven though it clears archive bits,\n\n259\n00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:42.550\nit doesn't care about archive bits.\n\n260\n00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.940\nIt doesn't look at an archive bit.\n\n261\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.730\nSo what does that mean?\n\n262\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.350\nLet's just say that on\nMonday I make a change, right?\n\n263\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.205\nSo here's Change 1, right?\n\n264\n00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:55.125\nDan, I run a full back up\nat the end of the day,\n\n265\n00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:57.665\ndoes that Change 1 that have\nan archive bit anymore?\n\n266\n00:13:57.665 --> 00:13:59.800\n&gt;&gt; I can't tell you.\n\n267\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.175\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nit's gonna be cleared, right.\n\n268\n00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.605\nBack up, full backup types\nalways clear though, right.\n\n269\n00:14:04.605 --> 00:14:05.872\n&gt;&gt; Because it's a full back up.\n\n270\n00:14:05.872 --> 00:14:07.602\nIf I'm backing up everything,\n\n271\n00:14:07.602 --> 00:14:10.252\nI'm gonna backup all the changes\nwhether it's an archive bit or not.\n\n272\n00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:12.402\n&gt;&gt; Very good, he's on to me.\n\n273\n00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:16.481\nRight, that means that even though\nChange 1, its archive bit was cleared,\n\n274\n00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.188\nwe don't have it on Wednesday.\n\n275\n00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:19.132\nWell, guess what?\n\n276\n00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:20.342\nFull backup says I don't care.\n\n277\n00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:21.952\nI don't care about the archive bits.\n\n278\n00:14:21.952 --> 00:14:23.040\nI don't care if its been backed up or not.\n\n279\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.232\nI'm gonna back up everything and it does.\n\n280\n00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:30.060\nSo you could have Change 1\nthat has never been modified.\n\n281\n00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.850\nBut it is still included in\nevery single full backup.\n\n282\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.430\nBecause you know why?\n\n283\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.570\nWe don't care about the archive bits.\n\n284\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.350\nNow I just have to be\ncareful with that one because\n\n285\n00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.290\nfull backups still clear archive's bits.\n\n286\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.477\nRight, but they just don't care.\n\n287\n00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:47.710\nThey don't say I don't care if\nyou have an archive bit or not.\n\n288\n00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.560\nThat archive bit could\nbe cleared on Monday.\n\n289\n00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.168\nBut guess what?\n\n290\n00:14:51.168 --> 00:14:56.010\nYou're still gonna have the same copy on\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\n291\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.710\nNow that might seem like whoa,\nthat's a slight overkill.\n\n292\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.420\nAnd it could be, all right.\n\n293\n00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.430\nWe've gotta look at some considerations\nwhen we talk about these backup types as\n\n294\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.760\nto why would I ever choose\none over the other.\n\n295\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.540\nWell, let's look at the considerations.\n\n296\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.150\nUsually a lot of the considerations\nare time to restore versus time to backup.\n\n297\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.660\nThe incremental backup is the lowest\nwhen it comes to the time to backup.\n\n298\n00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.384\nBecause all it's basically\nbacking up is daily changes,\n\n299\n00:15:24.384 --> 00:15:27.450\nthen it clears the archive bits.\n\n300\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.820\nNow however,\nlet's look at the restoration, all right?\n\n301\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:38.280\nLet's say on Friday, I come in and\nI don't have my data.\n\n302\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.620\nI have a failure, all right?\n\n303\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.670\nNow Thursday, we're not gonna throw\nany curve balls here, all right?\n\n304\n00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:49.430\nMonday's, Tuesday's, Wednesday's and\nThursday's backups are just fine.\n\n305\n00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.920\nNow whatever happened happens,\n\n306\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.960\nsometime early in the morning before\neverybody got here on Friday.\n\n307\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.643\nDan, if I was to do a restoration,\ncan you give me a guess of which of\n\n308\n00:15:58.643 --> 00:16:03.178\nthese day's media I would need to\nget my data fully back online?\n\n309\n00:16:03.178 --> 00:16:04.284\n&gt;&gt; This is where it gets tricky.\n\n310\n00:16:04.284 --> 00:16:07.683\nI always get these things reversed\nbecause it's very tricky.\n\n311\n00:16:07.683 --> 00:16:11.177\nYou definitely need the full,\nso you need to have that full.\n\n312\n00:16:11.177 --> 00:16:14.633\nAnd then I can never remember\ndo I need only the Thursday,\n\n313\n00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:17.873\nso I need the full and and\nthe Thursday or I need full and\n\n314\n00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:21.559\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday and\nThursday but not Friday.\n\n315\n00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:22.721\n&gt;&gt; Here's why I color code them,\n\n316\n00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:23.904\nnow you're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n317\n00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:25.330\n&gt;&gt; See the color coordination, right?\n\n318\n00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:32.030\nIf I wanna restore the data\nfully to the way that it was.\n\n319\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.385\nDan's already mentioned and\nI'm glad you said that,\n\n320\n00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:36.595\nevery restoration has to\nstart with a full backup.\n\n321\n00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.230\nSo which days, oops, and\na big arrow in the way.\n\n322\n00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.603\nWhich days am I gonna need?\n\n323\n00:16:42.603 --> 00:16:44.078\nNow my data is fully restored.\n\n324\n00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:44.693\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n325\n00:16:44.693 --> 00:16:49.730\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna need the full backup\nin every single day, okay?\n\n326\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:55.620\nSo when we look at the incremental backup,\nthe time the backup isn't that bad.\n\n327\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.730\nIt's real small, but you can see the time\nto restore is as far as it goes because\n\n328\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.210\nyou have so much media that you\nhave to take care of, right?\n\n329\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.420\nI have all of those days that\nI have to gain access to,\n\n330\n00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.900\nto collectively put that information back\nthe way it was prior to the failure.\n\n331\n00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.866\nNow if we look at the differential,\nthis one is always, and\n\n332\n00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:17.895\nI don't know if I've got this\nmedia mother road because it is.\n\n333\n00:17:17.895 --> 00:17:22.289\nThis is the moderate between time to\nrestore and time to backup, right?\n\n334\n00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:25.680\nSo if you look at it,\nif I'm doing a differential backup,\n\n335\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.170\nand the same thing happens, our failure\nand I'm just gonna put this here.\n\n336\n00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.615\nFailure happens on Friday, all right?\n\n337\n00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:35.480\nNow let me see if I can\ntrick you this time.\n\n338\n00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.320\nWhich tapes would I need\nin the same situations?\n\n339\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.193\n&gt;&gt; So I'm assuming that this is\nthe one I always get reversed.\n\n340\n00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:44.474\nSo you need the full backup\nfrom the previous week and\n\n341\n00:17:44.474 --> 00:17:48.373\nonly the one tape that is\nfrom the previous day.\n\n342\n00:17:48.373 --> 00:17:49.697\n&gt;&gt; I can't fool him, I'm trying.\n\n343\n00:17:49.697 --> 00:17:50.614\nI'm trying-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n344\n00:17:50.614 --> 00:17:52.332\n&gt;&gt; Like heck and you know what?\n\n345\n00:17:52.332 --> 00:17:56.778\nI've been teaching this for a while and I\ndo the same thing, getting them reversed.\n\n346\n00:17:56.778 --> 00:17:57.371\n&gt;&gt; That's so twisty, yeah.\n\n347\n00:17:57.371 --> 00:18:02.460\n&gt;&gt; It really is, so that's why we wanted\nto take some time and explain this, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:08.130\nBecause you need to know why you\nwould pick one backup over the other.\n\n349\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.820\nAnd you also have to know the restoration\nprocess, is it gonna be a beast or\n\n350\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.490\nnot, all right?\n\n351\n00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.640\nAnd this one, it's medium of the road\nwhen we talk about the backup time.\n\n352\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.940\nAnd it's medium of the road\nif you will kind of,\n\n353\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.090\nmoderate moderate between\nthe restoration time.\n\n354\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:26.600\nBecause unlike the incremental,\nwhen I needed all of the individual days\n\n355\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.010\nto backup or restore my data,\nwhen we look at the differential.\n\n356\n00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:38.040\nSince I've already got what,\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday,\n\n357\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.970\nand Thursday's backup in that single media\nthen I only need two forms of media.\n\n358\n00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.320\nI need the last full backup,\nlike Dan's already mentioned.\n\n359\n00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.430\nDoesn't matter what your\nrestoration process is,\n\n360\n00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.750\nyou always need the full backup.\n\n361\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.440\nDon't let that fool you on the exam.\n\n362\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.718\n&gt;&gt; A lot of this does\ncome down to as well,\n\n363\n00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.790\nis like why would I choose\ndifferential over incremental?\n\n364\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.231\nIt comes down to storage, right?\n\n365\n00:19:00.231 --> 00:19:00.847\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n366\n00:19:00.847 --> 00:19:04.177\n&gt;&gt; It costs money to store your backups,\nwhether it's in the cloud or on tape or\n\n367\n00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:05.336\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n368\n00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:08.592\nYou have to store that somewhere else\nother than the server that it came\n\n369\n00:19:08.592 --> 00:19:09.316\nfrom, right?\n\n370\n00:19:09.316 --> 00:19:13.832\nSo that costs money with\nthe help me out here, Wes-\n\n371\n00:19:13.832 --> 00:19:14.738\n&gt;&gt; The incremental or the differential?\n\n372\n00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:17.860\n&gt;&gt; The differential requires\nall the tapes, right?\n\n373\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.522\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n374\n00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:20.860\n&gt;&gt; You're building\n[CROSSTALK] the incremental,\n\n375\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.620\nif was doing tapes on this example.\n\n376\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.177\nI'll need one tape for Monday, two tapes\nfor Tuesday, three tapes for Thursday,\n\n377\n00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:28.032\nfour and so on.\n\n378\n00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:30.232\nI need more tapes,\nif I'm doing the differential or\n\n379\n00:19:30.232 --> 00:19:33.084\nthe incremental like I said,\nI can't remember which one is which.\n\n380\n00:19:33.084 --> 00:19:36.392\nI will need one tape per day,\nso it costs me less money.\n\n381\n00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:41.360\nI need less storage to provide that\nservice for one versus the other.\n\n382\n00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.728\nNow, restoring that might take\nme longer with one versus\n\n383\n00:19:44.728 --> 00:19:45.888\nthe other-\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n384\n00:19:45.888 --> 00:19:47.734\n&gt;&gt; So you gotta start weighing\nwhat's more important.\n\n385\n00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:50.641\nThe cost of storing that data and\nhaving all that available or\n\n386\n00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:53.719\nif we have a failure,\nwe need to restore as quickly as possible,\n\n387\n00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:55.837\nwe need to get back to\nbusiness continuity.\n\n388\n00:19:55.837 --> 00:19:58.301\nThat's where you gotta make your decision.\n\n389\n00:19:58.301 --> 00:20:02.178\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nthat's what leads us into the full backup.\n\n390\n00:20:02.178 --> 00:20:05.706\nFull backup is the longest time to backup\nthe information because you're backing up\n\n391\n00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:06.811\neverything regardless.\n\n392\n00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:07.705\n&gt;&gt; And the most expensive.\n\n393\n00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:09.707\n&gt;&gt; And one of the most expensive, but\n\n394\n00:20:09.707 --> 00:20:12.407\nit is the least of the time to restore,\nright?\n\n395\n00:20:12.407 --> 00:20:14.903\nBecause I only need a single tape, right?\n\n396\n00:20:14.903 --> 00:20:16.226\nOr whatever-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n397\n00:20:16.226 --> 00:20:17.201\n&gt;&gt; Media you're using, right?\n\n398\n00:20:17.201 --> 00:20:21.200\nI only need the day prior to\nthe failure cuz I did a full backup.\n\n399\n00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:26.300\nWhich leads us to the last thing, storage\nrequirements, that Dan was mentioning.\n\n400\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.744\nStorage requirements\nare another consideration.\n\n401\n00:20:28.744 --> 00:20:31.242\nAnd he's already mentioned them before.\n\n402\n00:20:31.242 --> 00:20:35.740\nFull backup,\nI'm gonna be storing a lot of information.\n\n403\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.920\nBecause I'm backing up everything, every\nsingle day, whether I need to or not.\n\n404\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.408\nDifferentials always medium of the road,\n\n405\n00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.155\nit seems to be medium of\nthe road across the board.\n\n406\n00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:47.620\nWhether it's backup time,\nrestore time, or storage time.\n\n407\n00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.160\nIncremental on the other hand, since we're\nnot storing that much information, right?\n\n408\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.000\nIncremental just the changes,\nI'm not compounding information.\n\n409\n00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.240\nIt's gonna be the least when it\ncomes to the storage requirements.\n\n410\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:04.750\nAll right, so\nthat's a little bit about backup types.\n\n411\n00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.468\nI do wanna let you know that\nthere's another consideration\n\n412\n00:21:07.468 --> 00:21:08.672\nthat we have to consider.\n\n413\n00:21:08.672 --> 00:21:09.995\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n414\n00:21:09.995 --> 00:21:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Is the fact that how much\ndown time do you have, right?\n\n415\n00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.160\nWe talk about data at rest,\nhow long is your data at rest?\n\n416\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.000\nIf you're an Ecommerce Site, you're\ndata's probably never at rest, right?\n\n417\n00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.418\nYou're constantly having sales.\n\n418\n00:21:23.418 --> 00:21:27.070\nIf you're an international company,\nthe sun never sets on you.\n\n419\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.260\nYou don't have a lot of time,\ndowntime if you will.\n\n420\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.310\nSo you might choose an incremental.\n\n421\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.065\nHowever if you're a company that\nmaybe looses $100 million or\n\n422\n00:21:36.065 --> 00:21:40.470\n$1 million an hour for every bit\nof time you don't have your data,\n\n423\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.700\nmaybe it's worth it for\nyou to do a full backup.\n\n424\n00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.300\nBecause if you do have a failure, you need\nto restore that as quick as possible and\n\n425\n00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.870\nget back online.\n\n426\n00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.089\nSo you might have something where\nyou have a mixed hybrid mode, right?\n\n427\n00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:53.457\nMy critical systems,\nI've got a full backup going.\n\n428\n00:21:53.457 --> 00:21:56.752\nI need those, I cannot afford downtime.\n\n429\n00:21:56.752 --> 00:22:00.530\nMy noncritical systems maybe\nI'm doing a differential,\n\n430\n00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.300\nmaybe I'm doing an incremental.\n\n431\n00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.982\nSo again, you always have\nto weigh the pros and cons.\n\n432\n00:22:03.982 --> 00:22:06.790\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you an example of a backup here.\n\n433\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.387\nI've got a Windows Server box here and\nshow you guys,\n\n434\n00:22:09.387 --> 00:22:13.036\nif you don't already know how to login,\nI'll show you how to login again.\n\n435\n00:22:13.036 --> 00:22:16.449\n[LAUGH] And let's go ahead and\nlet's perform one of these backups.\n\n436\n00:22:16.449 --> 00:22:18.342\nNow, we're gonna go ahead.\n\n437\n00:22:18.342 --> 00:22:19.561\nWe'll launch up Server Manager.\n\n438\n00:22:21.477 --> 00:22:25.877\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and scroll\ndown all the way to the bottom in Tools.\n\n439\n00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:30.917\nAnd we'll get down there eventually, and\nI know my head's gonna cover this one up.\n\n440\n00:22:30.917 --> 00:22:33.756\nBut you can see right down here at\nthe bottom of the Tools list is\n\n441\n00:22:33.756 --> 00:22:34.910\nWindows Server Backup.\n\n442\n00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:40.704\nAll right, and\nyou can see that it's reading the data.\n\n443\n00:22:40.704 --> 00:22:43.320\nI will tell you,\nthis is kinda interesting Dan.\n\n444\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.830\nIf you guys get in here,\nyou're probably gonna get in here, and\n\n445\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.100\nsay, it doesn't actually let me backup.\n\n446\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.532\nWindows Server Backup is one that's in the\nlist, but then it tells you to install it.\n\n447\n00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:54.610\nI've never [LAUGH] really understand it.\n\n448\n00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.773\nMinimalistic footprint in their defense,\nI understand.\n\n449\n00:22:56.773 --> 00:22:59.472\nBecause a lot of people might\nbe using third party, most\n\n450\n00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:03.450\npeople are gonna be using a third party\nbackup system because it's so efficient.\n\n451\n00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.840\nNow, am I downing\nthe Window's Server backup?\n\n452\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.170\nNo, not that all at least you got\nsomething to keep you safe for\n\n453\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:09.950\na little bit.\n\n454\n00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.940\nBut a lot of people use third\nparty backup software, all right?\n\n455\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.106\nAnd then what we can do is we can run,\nif we want.\n\n456\n00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:16.581\nWe can run a Backup Schedule.\n\n457\n00:23:16.581 --> 00:23:19.461\nWe can do a Backup Once if we want,\nall right?\n\n458\n00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:21.156\nSo maybe I'll do something like that,\nright?\n\n459\n00:23:21.156 --> 00:23:22.955\nI'll go ahead and I'll do a backup.\n\n460\n00:23:22.955 --> 00:23:25.184\nBackup Options here.\n\n461\n00:23:25.184 --> 00:23:27.990\nWe'll go ahead and choose Next and this.\n\n462\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.870\nNow to ask me do I want to\ndo a full server backup?\n\n463\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.440\nI don't know, maybe I do, maybe I don't.\n\n464\n00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.680\nFor were times sake, I'm here because\nthe choices that you make here,\n\n465\n00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.890\nwe are gonna be exactly\nwhat we talk about.\n\n466\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.110\nHow long is it going to take the backup\nthe information versus restore?\n\n467\n00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.580\nI'm gonna go ahead just for\ndemonstration purposes and\n\n468\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.960\nI'm gonna do a custom backup,\nand I'll choose Next.\n\n469\n00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.186\nAnd then it gives me the items,\nwhat items do I wanna select for backup.\n\n470\n00:23:52.186 --> 00:23:55.031\nSo we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do some Add Items here.\n\n471\n00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:59.618\nNow here's another thing that you gotta\nconsider, when you're doing a backup,\n\n472\n00:23:59.618 --> 00:24:02.288\nhow much information do\nyou keep in the backup?\n\n473\n00:24:02.288 --> 00:24:04.808\nWe told you the backup types and\nchanges and stuff.\n\n474\n00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:07.002\nHow much information do you need?\n\n475\n00:24:07.002 --> 00:24:08.256\nWell, that depends.\n\n476\n00:24:08.256 --> 00:24:12.458\nDo you wanna be able to rebuild\nthe server completely, operating system,\n\n477\n00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:14.670\nconfigurations, user files and all?\n\n478\n00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.950\nWell, you might need to do\nsomething like a full backup\n\n479\n00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.950\nthat does your bare metal recovery,\nthat does your system state data.\n\n480\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.723\nWhat is system state data?\n\n481\n00:24:21.723 --> 00:24:26.661\nSystem state data is the crucial\nconfiguration, the crucial components of\n\n482\n00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:31.380\nthe operating system, that your\nserver needs to function, all right?\n\n483\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.840\nSo if you don't back up your system state\ndata, you're not gonna be able to restore\n\n484\n00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.560\nthe server fully with its configurations,\nhence the term, system state, all right?\n\n485\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.398\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\n\n486\n00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:44.720\nwhat we'll do, I'm gonna do kind\nof like a selective backup here.\n\n487\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.680\nI'm gonna go into the Users folder,\nand my Administrator,\n\n488\n00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.251\nthe account that I'm logged into now.\n\n489\n00:24:51.251 --> 00:24:52.690\nWe see the Desktop.\n\n490\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.590\nOoh, got a couple copies of desktop.ini.\n\n491\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.050\nI'll just do Desktop here.\n\n492\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.710\nAll right, and we'll choose OK,\nand then we'll choose Next.\n\n493\n00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.239\nAnd then it's gonna ask me\nwhere do I wanna put this.\n\n494\n00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:06.690\nI've got another drive in this machine,\nso I'm gonna save it on that drive.\n\n495\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.710\nAnd then we'll go ahead choose Next,\nand then we'll back this up.\n\n496\n00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.590\nAnd it's run through this process.\n\n497\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.060\nNow once the backup's finished,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n498\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.720\nwe'll show you how to do\na recovery all right?\n\n499\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.592\nNow, again, I just chose the bare\nminimum that it was to show you what\n\n500\n00:25:24.592 --> 00:25:26.779\nthe demonstration is, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:30.934\nI want you to keep in mind that,\nobviously, the bigger your server is,\n\n502\n00:25:30.934 --> 00:25:35.092\nthe more roles you have installed,\nthe more data that's stored on it,\n\n503\n00:25:35.092 --> 00:25:38.030\nit could take a very,\nvery long time, all right?\n\n504\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.940\nAnd we can see, backup in process,\nlooks like it's already completed.\n\n505\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.150\nThat's what we want,\nwe'll choose Close, all right?\n\n506\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.520\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nclose down Server Manager.\n\n507\n00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.320\nWe're gonna kinda simulate a failure here.\n\n508\n00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.485\nI'll go ahead and delete PuTTY off the\ndesktop, we'll make sure that it's gone,\n\n509\n00:25:55.485 --> 00:26:01.440\nand then, last, we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do a recovery, all right?\n\n510\n00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.935\nNow, it's gonna ask me\nwhere's the backup stored?\n\n511\n00:26:06.935 --> 00:26:08.984\nIn this case,\nit's stored direct attached storage.\n\n512\n00:26:08.984 --> 00:26:10.450\nIt's not on a network location.\n\n513\n00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.300\nAnd I'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n514\n00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:19.430\nAnd it gives me a set of\ndates that I can choose.\n\n515\n00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.026\nWhich one do I want to back up?\n\n516\n00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:22.900\nAll right, and then I'll go ahead and\n\n517\n00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.350\njust leave it at the defaults,\nand we'll choose Next.\n\n518\n00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:31.290\nAnd it's gonna ask me what is\nit that I want to restore.\n\n519\n00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.680\nAsk me if I wanna restore in\nthe original location, all right?\n\n520\n00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.420\nDo I wanna create copies\nthat have both versions?\n\n521\n00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.110\nAll right, I'm gonna say,\noverwrite existing versions.\n\n522\n00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.252\nI don't need three desktop INI hidden\nfiles [LAUGH] on my desktop there,\n\n523\n00:26:46.252 --> 00:26:48.039\nwhich is recover, all right?\n\n524\n00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:50.200\nAnd then it's gonna look at that.\n\n525\n00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.600\nIt's going to say, hey, what do I see\nthat's in this backup that I don't\n\n526\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.780\ncurrently see in the system, and\nlet me restore that information.\n\n527\n00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.611\nAnd if I look here on my desktop,\nI should have PuTTY back.\n\n528\n00:27:01.611 --> 00:27:05.340\nAll right, so, kind of shows you\nthe backup and the restore process.\n\n529\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.120\nKeep in mind, which one you use is really\ncontingent on those things that we told\n\n530\n00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.510\nyou about already.\n\n531\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.870\nIt's not a one size fits all solution, and\nyou have to pick what's gonna be good for\n\n532\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.070\nyour environment.\n\n533\n00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.102\nNow Dan, I noticed,\n[LAUGH] I'm looking, and\n\n534\n00:27:18.102 --> 00:27:20.198\nwe've got a little bit\nmore information to go.\n\n535\n00:27:20.198 --> 00:27:23.040\nBut I think Dan's telling me that we\nmight have to save that for a part two.\n\n536\n00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm over here giving him the high\nsign, like, we're out of time, player.\n\n537\n00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.890\nWe gotta go, right,\ncuz the time has ticked away.\n\n538\n00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:29.990\nBut, Wes, thanks for\n\n539\n00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.560\nhitting me in the face with a baseball\nbat that is known as backups.\n\n540\n00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.770\nIt is one of my most loathed\ntopics to talk about.\n\n541\n00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.600\nCuz, for whatever reason,\nmy brain will not put those words and\n\n542\n00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.610\nconcepts together in the correct order,\nso it's like a jumbled mess.\n\n543\n00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.810\nBut I can do it.\n\n544\n00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:44.590\nI just can't talk about it very well.\n\n545\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.790\n[LAUGH] But, Wes,\n\n546\n00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:49.350\nyou on the other hand did a fantastic job\nof keeping things straight, unlike myself.\n\n547\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.580\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n548\n00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.750\nWe do have a part two coming,\ncuz we do have a few other concepts and\n\n549\n00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.390\nmanagement techniques that we\nwant you guys to be aware of.\n\n550\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.960\nSo, that being said,\nhopefully we'll see you there.\n\n551\n00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.460\nThat being said,\nnow we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n552\n00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.090\nFor ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n553\n00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.070\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n554\n00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.269\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n555\n00:28:09.001 -->

00:00:06.731\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.195\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:12.420\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.040\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n7\n00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.320\ngreeting everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.860\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n9\n00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.270\nwell, we are back with more on\nour CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.211\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio\nis none other than the person we know and\n\n11\n00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:28.178\nlove as Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:29.761\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:30.848\nHopefully you're not a Doppelganger.\n\n14\n00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:31.537\n&gt;&gt; No, I am not.\n\n15\n00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:34.403\nI am the true me and\nI'm already standing up, so\n\n16\n00:00:34.403 --> 00:00:37.068\nwe don't even have to reference that song.\n\n17\n00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:37.827\nThat's right,\n\n18\n00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:41.310\nwe are coming back with a part two on\nsupporting configuration management.\n\n19\n00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.030\nWe had few extra topics that\nwe need to do a round up here\n\n20\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.550\nbefore we call it a day on this subject.\n\n21\n00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.430\nAnd in the first part we really just\ntalked about our backups and so\n\n22\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.270\nare back up types.\n\n23\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.456\nAnd gave you an example of performing\na back up on a windows server operating\n\n24\n00:00:55.456 --> 00:01:00.181\nsystem, so that you guys would see what it\nwould look like in order to perform those.\n\n25\n00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.804\nNow, the next thing that we are going to\ntalk about in this episode, we are gonna\n\n26\n00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:09.644\njust briefly talk about these and that is\nbecause that topic is known as baselines.\n\n27\n00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:13.473\nAnd in another episode we showed you how\nto configure a baseline, how to run it and\n\n28\n00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.572\nhow to interpret\nthe information off of it.\n\n29\n00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:19.927\nSo I'm not really gonna spent too much\ntime on baselines here in this episode but\n\n30\n00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:23.958\nI will say as far as supporting\nconfiguration management one of the things\n\n31\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.183\nthat's important about our baseline\njust keep in mind that's what we expect\n\n32\n00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:32.790\nthe performance of any device to\nbe in under normal circumstances.\n\n33\n00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.440\nAnd if we suspect that maybe our\nnetworks or a portion of our network or\n\n34\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.050\ncertain devices isn't performing well or\nadequately, we can find out.\n\n35\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.070\nWell, have configurations been made?\n\n36\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.700\nIf they have, hopefully it's documented\nif it's not then we have problems.\n\n37\n00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.460\nBut if it happens to be some\nkind of hardware failure,\n\n38\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.980\nif it has to maybe RAMs failing,\nmaybe disk storage if you will, we\n\n39\n00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.320\ndon't have much capacity left we can rerun\nthe same test so that we can find out.\n\n40\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.750\nWe can compare apples to apples and\nfind out truly if the performance or\n\n41\n00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.740\nthe lack of performance we're\nseeing is not based on more like a,\n\n42\n00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.500\nwell we think it's not\nrunning like it used to.\n\n43\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.850\nWe can actually have some\nreal concrete information.\n\n44\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right, remove the subjectivity,\nreplace it with objectivity.\n\n45\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.570\nYes, we can tell you it is running\nworse or better than it was before.\n\n46\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.180\nAnd it's not just me going,\nI think this thing sucks, right.\n\n47\n00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.870\nI think this is really bad.\n\n48\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.260\nNo, actually, I'm looking at the baseline.\n\n49\n00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.910\nIt's right on par.\n\n50\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.100\nYou just got used to it.\n\n51\n00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and\nwe've said that before.\n\n52\n00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.590\nThe faster computers gets,\nI don't know about you, Dan,\n\n53\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.730\nbut the more patient I get.\n\n54\n00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.190\nAnd the more I get used to things like\nsolid state drives, I want my data and\n\n55\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.440\nI want it on the screen yesterday.\n\n56\n00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.850\nAnd I certainly don't wanna wait.\n\n57\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.800\nWell, guess what?\n\n58\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.370\nYour users aren't much different [LAUGH],\nso you'll definitely get some calls,\n\n59\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.690\nyou might find out that if you do have\nthose baselines and you run them,\n\n60\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.050\nthat like Dan said, there's nothing wrong,\nit's just somebody maybe didn't have their\n\n61\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.080\ncoffee that morning, and\nthey're not having a good day.\n\n62\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.460\nSo, we would definitely wanna\nmake sure whether it is actual\n\n63\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.010\nproblems with the network.\n\n64\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.720\nNow the next thing that they kinda call\nout here and this is becoming more and\n\n65\n00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.790\nmore prevalent.\n\n66\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.910\nIn fact we were kinda having\na little bit of a chat\n\n67\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.710\nin the chat room earlier about this,\nmobile devices right.\n\n68\n00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.460\nWe have this trend today\nthat bring your own device\n\n69\n00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.950\nlot of these mobile devices here.\n\n70\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.940\nThis is the consumerization\nof IT if you will.\n\n71\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.420\nI've got down here somewhere,\nI've got a phone right here.\n\n72\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.970\nI know Dan's got one in his pocket.\n\n73\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.170\nWe want to be able to use these\ndevices inside of our networks.\n\n74\n00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.510\nWhy?\nIt can lead to productive employees,\n\n75\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.890\nprovided they're not on social media and\nbrowsing YouTube, right?\n\n76\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.000\nBut we work in a familiar environment,\nsomething that we're used to,\n\n77\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.420\nand something we can kind of\ncustomize to suit our needs.\n\n78\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.200\nBut at the same time, we still wanna be\nable to use those inside of work, right?\n\n79\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.810\nWell here's the challenge for\nsecurity or your security team or\n\n80\n00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.750\neven your administrative team.\n\n81\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.206\nWhen it's property of the company,\nthey can control it.\n\n82\n00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.870\nWhen it's something like a Windows machine\nthat can join an active directory domain,\n\n83\n00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.690\nyour administrators can set policies that\ndictate how it's gonna be configured.\n\n84\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.240\nHow that run time\nenvironment is gonna happen.\n\n85\n00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.810\nWith these devices though, these smaller\ndevices it's not quite the same.\n\n86\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.738\nSo what we need are things\nlike on-boarding process and\n\n87\n00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:16.972\noff-boarding processes when\nit comes to mobile, right?\n\n88\n00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:20.020\nSo on-boarding you're gonna\nbring your device in, and\n\n89\n00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.150\nyou're gonna want access to\ncertain company resources.\n\n90\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.880\nWell your IT staff is gonna want to\nbe able to secure that access and\n\n91\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.020\nalso secure those files, right?\n\n92\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.560\nThe next thing that we wanna make\nsure is that what happens when you\n\n93\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.640\nleave the company,\nthe off-boarding process right.\n\n94\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.760\nWe wanna make sure that well you're data\nstays where it's supposed to be right.\n\n95\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.455\nPictures of my family and stuff and\nthose are my pictures right.\n\n96\n00:04:43.455 --> 00:04:45.215\nThat's my data.\n\n97\n00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:47.635\nBut the company data, how about that?\n\n98\n00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:48.745\nWhat happens to that?\n\n99\n00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:51.305\nWell, we don't want that information\nending up in the wrong hands so\n\n100\n00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.965\nin the off-boarding process we might\nimplement things like remote data wipes.\n\n101\n00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:56.345\nThere are many different\nsolutions out there.\n\n102\n00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:59.882\nOne of the client server type\nprotocols that they have today,\n\n103\n00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:01.249\nit's called open MDM.\n\n104\n00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.491\nThat's the mobile device\nmanagement solution and\n\n105\n00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:09.170\nit is overseen by\nthe open mobile alliance.\n\n106\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.250\nIt's an open community if you\nwill that sets those standards.\n\n107\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.100\nSo you do need an on-boarding and\noff-boarding process for\n\n108\n00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.380\nyour mobile devices and you will see that\nthat is gonna become more and more and\n\n109\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.980\ncontinue to be important\nthroughout your infrastructure.\n\n110\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.010\nFrom the smallest company right\nup to large enterprise companies.\n\n111\n00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.960\nAnd when you get into\nenterprise level companies\n\n112\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.072\nwe typically have some kind of like\ninternal operating procedure, a policy or\n\n113\n00:05:32.072 --> 00:05:35.340\na standard,\npolicies like acceptable use policies.\n\n114\n00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.980\nYeah, you can connect your phone to\nour network if you will, and you can\n\n115\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.330\nbrowse to where ever your email is, but\nwe have rules that you have to follow.\n\n116\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.440\nAcceptable use policies right.\n\n117\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.350\nThings like that.\n\n118\n00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.010\nProcedures for what happens if somebody\nmaybe violates one of those policies.\n\n119\n00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.564\nSo we have those in place as well.\n\n120\n00:05:54.564 --> 00:05:59.023\nAll right, so some of the other things I\ntalked about in supporting configuration\n\n121\n00:05:59.023 --> 00:06:01.231\nmanagement it's a kind of hefty topic.\n\n122\n00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:05.111\nIt's hard to sum it up all in just one\nepisode let alone probably an entire\n\n123\n00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:06.330\nnetwork plus course.\n\n124\n00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.899\nDan and I we were kind of joke around and\nthen talking about the different options\n\n125\n00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:13.160\nthat you have and\nthis is called network access control.\n\n126\n00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.050\nAnd there really is nothing\nsimplistic about this topic, so\n\n127\n00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.070\nI could say simply it's a way to govern,\naccess to your network but\n\n128\n00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.760\nthat's not gonna do you guys any justice.\n\n129\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.330\nIn fact,\nlet me give you an example of Microsoft's\n\n130\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.200\nform of network access control.\n\n131\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.670\nThey call it network access protection.\n\n132\n00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.840\nThat's just one of them.\n\n133\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.600\nMore common is probably gonna be something\nlike Cisco's network access control system\n\n134\n00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.890\nand access them themselves.\n\n135\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.000\nA very, very robust.\n\n136\n00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.570\nBut let me give you an example here.\n\n137\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.680\nSo for instance we have like\na remote access client, right?\n\n138\n00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.470\nAnd that remote access client\nsitting at their house they wanna\n\n139\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.340\nmake connection over a public network.\n\n140\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.730\nSo we've got a VPN server here.\n\n141\n00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.060\nAnd they can make VPN communication.\n\n142\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.220\nWell remember what that VPN communication,\na VPN tunnel allows them to do.\n\n143\n00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.280\nIt allows them to enter our network and\n\n144\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.530\nfrom their perspective they are on\nour local network no different than\n\n145\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.960\nif they were sitting in our company's\nbuilding attached to the network locally.\n\n146\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.030\nWell, here's the problem with that,\nor potential problem with that.\n\n147\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.360\nThis laptop out here and\nI just used a laptop as an example.\n\n148\n00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.370\nDoes it have its firewall on?\n\n149\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.790\nIs it up to date?\n\n150\n00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.480\nDoes it have all its patch\nmanagement being done?\n\n151\n00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.910\nSee if it's a server something\nlike inside of our network, right?\n\n152\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.540\nIf I got the laptop, the company laptop,\nyou better believe our administrators,\n\n153\n00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.730\nwhoever the administrators are,\n\n154\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.420\nwhoever the support team is, they're gonna\nmake sure you have an anti-virus software.\n\n155\n00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.280\nThey're gonna make sure\nyour firewall is there.\n\n156\n00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.980\nThey're gonna make sure that\nthat computer is up to date.\n\n157\n00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.320\nAnd they can again,\nthey can implement that policies.\n\n158\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.040\nBut how do we make sure that somebody\nthat connects to my network,\n\n159\n00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.190\nlet's say through a remote connection\nlike this, does have those things?\n\n160\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.247\nAnd if they don't, we can control\nthe level of access they have.\n\n161\n00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:53.130\nWell, Microsoft, for example,\nhas got network access protection.\n\n162\n00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.508\nThat's the Microsoft implementation\nof network access control.\n\n163\n00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:57.183\nAll right.\nAnd\n\n164\n00:07:57.183 --> 00:07:59.415\nwhat you have is a series of components.\n\n165\n00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:01.667\nSo when the VPN server\nallows the connection,\n\n166\n00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:05.017\nfirst thing that it's gonna do is\nit's gonna send that connection or\n\n167\n00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:09.077\nthat information, it's usually something\ncalled a security health validator.\n\n168\n00:08:09.077 --> 00:08:12.128\nA security, I can't think of it,\na statement of health.\n\n169\n00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:13.854\nI don't know,\nwhy I couldn't think of the SOH.\n\n170\n00:08:13.854 --> 00:08:15.865\nA statement of health, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:20.060\nWhen this remote access client\nconnects to the VPN server,\n\n172\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.252\nit's gonna present to this VPN server\nsomething known as a statement of health.\n\n173\n00:08:24.252 --> 00:08:27.140\nIt's gonna say,\nthis is what I have right now.\n\n174\n00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.680\nI have my firewall on.\n\n175\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.470\nRight now, I have my antivirus\nsoftware up to date and it's running.\n\n176\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.530\nBut, I'm behind a couple\nmonths on my updates.\n\n177\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.640\nAll right, so we'll just give\nyou that scenario, all right.\n\n178\n00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.140\nWell, when that's passed to\nthe Health Registration Authority,\n\n179\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.260\nthe Health Registration Authority then\nchecks with the Health Policy Server, and\n\n180\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.160\nin Windows it's just gonna be\nan NPS network policy server.\n\n181\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.150\nAnd it's gonna say, all right,\n\n182\n00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.700\nwhat does your policy say that is\nrequired to connect to this network?\n\n183\n00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.370\nAnd then, like I said, it says well,\nyou've gotta have your firewall turned on,\n\n184\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.700\nyou've got to have your anti virus\nturned on and up to date, but\n\n185\n00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.760\nyou also need to have your\npatch management done.\n\n186\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.960\nYou need those Windows update.\n\n187\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.440\nSo they need to be done and\nthey need to be up to date, all right.\n\n188\n00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.120\nSo then the, once the helper registration\nauthority says, okay, that's the policy.\n\n189\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.730\nI got it.\nNow,\n\n190\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.590\nlet me look at this statement of health.\n\n191\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.240\nDo they match?\n\n192\n00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.320\nThey don't match,\nyou're missing something.\n\n193\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.970\nSo do you gain access?\n\n194\n00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.360\nNo, well, that again depends on\nhow the administrator sets it up.\n\n195\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.060\nBut a lot of times,\n\n196\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.288\nwhat's gonna happen is we're gonna\nkick you off to an isolation network.\n\n197\n00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:34.010\nYou're not going to be able to\ntalk to the rest of our network.\n\n198\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.520\nYou're gonna go into\na remediation network.\n\n199\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.060\nIsolation network,\nremediation network if you will.\n\n200\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.580\nTypically, where we have\na remediation server, right.\n\n201\n00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.520\nThat could be a server that's\nholding things like our\n\n202\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.570\ncompany antivirus software.\n\n203\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.540\nCould be something like including and\nthere could be more than one.\n\n204\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.211\nCould be like a WSUS\nserver where we've got our\n\n205\n00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:55.706\npre-approved updates that\nallow this computer to update,\n\n206\n00:09:55.706 --> 00:10:00.517\nthen present that statement of health back\nto the Health Registration Authority.\n\n207\n00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:05.043\nAnd when that happens, it's gonna say,\nokay, I see that you have your\n\n208\n00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:10.113\nFirewall turned on, your antivirus\nsoftware is turned on and it's up to date.\n\n209\n00:10:10.113 --> 00:10:15.950\nAnd now, I see that you've updated through\nthe remediation network, the WSUS server.\n\n210\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.800\nSo you're good to go.\n\n211\n00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.210\nNow you gain access into the network.\n\n212\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.500\nThat's a form of network access control.\n\n213\n00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.160\nLike I said, Cisco has their\nimplementation of this as well.\n\n214\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.370\nThis is just one flavor of it.\n\n215\n00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.320\nNetwork access control is\nnot just a single thing, but\n\n216\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.560\nit's a group of policies,\nprocedures if you will.\n\n217\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.500\nTechnologies that do control\nwho can join the network,\n\n218\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.380\nwho can access the resources on\nthe network, whether they can and\n\n219\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:52.360\nwhat conditions must they meet in order\nto get access to the internal network.\n\n220\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.190\nAll right, all right so that’s a little\nbit about Network Access Control.\n\n221\n00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.720\nNow some of the final things they talk\nabout here, they talk about documentation,\n\n222\n00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.920\nand I tell you documentation\ncannot be over stressed enough.\n\n223\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.250\nAll right, it’s not fun.\n\n224\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.736\nWe understand, sit down,\ndoing paperwork and\n\n225\n00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:09.494\nI don't even know if you're\ndoing paperwork anymore.\n\n226\n00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:11.708\nYou might be typing it out\ndoing data entry any more.\n\n227\n00:11:11.708 --> 00:11:12.336\n&gt;&gt; Visio diagrams.\n\n228\n00:11:12.336 --> 00:11:16.445\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right so, it's not the most\nglorious thing that you might be doing,\n\n229\n00:11:16.445 --> 00:11:18.810\nbut it's definitely an important thing.\n\n230\n00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.210\nJust like we started out,\nwhen we started out with backups.\n\n231\n00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.980\nWe talk about configuration management.\n\n232\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.540\nConfiguration management, one of the key\nsupporting factors is the documentation\n\n233\n00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.500\nthat you have of the current configuration\nof every device within your network.\n\n234\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.250\nDoes that always happen?\n\n235\n00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.650\nNo.\nWe understand.\n\n236\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.890\n&gt;&gt; That's unfortunate, too.\n\n237\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.590\n&gt;&gt; It is.\nNow, Dan,\n\n238\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.130\nyou've been in to some situations there.\n\n239\n00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.260\nI know you've worked for\nsome massive organizations.\n\n240\n00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.079\nHave you ever run into that situation?\n\n241\n00:11:41.079 --> 00:11:42.403\n&gt;&gt; Where things aren't documented?\n\n242\n00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:43.258\nYeah, yeah.\n\n243\n00:11:43.258 --> 00:11:48.840\nAnd it's kinda a pet peeve of mine,\nI am all about documentation.\n\n244\n00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.710\nYou know why?\n\n245\n00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.230\nBecause you might not be the person that\nis working on the device that you're\n\n246\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.440\nsetting up In ten years from now, right.\n\n247\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.920\nThere might be someone\nthat comes along and\n\n248\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.560\ngoes, wow this is an interesting\npiece of equipment.\n\n249\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.380\nHow is this supposed to be set up?\n\n250\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.470\nCuz it died and now we have to replace it.\n\n251\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.260\nAnd we have no idea, now we've gotta\nto figure out from scratch and\n\n252\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.250\ndeductive reasoning,\nhow should I most best set this up?\n\n253\n00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.980\nAnd now, maybe you'll get it right,\nmaybe you won't,\n\n254\n00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.830\nbut it becomes a very arduous process.\n\n255\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.810\nAnd all someone had to do was go, this is\na network switch for the third floor HR\n\n256\n00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.290\ndepartment and it's set up on these VLANs,\nthese are the passwords, this is that.\n\n257\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.040\nBoom, you reset everything and\nyou're back.\n\n258\n00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.035\nIt's that simple.\n\n259\n00:12:29.035 --> 00:12:33.090\nYeah, it's not fun like Wes said\nto write all these things down.\n\n260\n00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.070\nBut it might even save yourself\na lot of headache in the long run,\n\n261\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.530\ndocumentation is where it's at.\n\n262\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.290\nGosh, we were talking about,\n\n263\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.330\nif you wanna hear some of things\nthat we talk about off-camera.\n\n264\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.040\nLike him talking about him and a gentleman\nthat worked with him having to completely\n\n265\n00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.170\nrebuild the network because of lack\nof understanding of what's going on.\n\n266\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.450\nWhat better to figure out what's going\non than to start over from scratch and\n\n267\n00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.100\nthen build everything back up?\n\n268\n00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.620\nNow if you have your support\ndocumentation, if you have your\n\n269\n00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.800\nconfiguration management documentation,\nyou wouldn't have to go through that.\n\n270\n00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.660\nSo it is important.\n\n271\n00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.340\nSo what type of documentation?\n\n272\n00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.140\nWe've hammered on the documentation.\n\n273\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.920\nWhat type of documentation\nare we talking about?\n\n274\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.870\nWell, let me give you one example here.\n\n275\n00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.440\nThings like physical network diagrams.\n\n276\n00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.200\nIn fact,\nI got this little diagram here, guys.\n\n277\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.910\nNothing real fancy,\njust a small, simplistic network.\n\n278\n00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.860\n&gt;&gt; Your diagramming software is\nperfect for this type of work.\n\n279\n00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.890\nIt has all the little pictures that\nlets you know that's a firewall,\n\n280\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.510\nthis is a switch, that's a router.\n\n281\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.380\nEverything is nice and\nneatly put together.\n\n282\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.080\nI can easily look at this and\nkinda tell what's going on.\n\n283\n00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.190\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and that would have\nprobably saved him quite a few hours of\n\n284\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.990\nwork rather than the hassle\nthat he had to do at one time\n\n285\n00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.140\nof completely dismantling the network\njust to figure out what's going on.\n\n286\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.529\nIf you have this information,\nit's at least a start.\n\n287\n00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:48.176\nSo you can see things like where we've got\na router, we've got a firewall, right?\n\n288\n00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:52.700\nI know that I've got a switch and\na series of IP cams connected to it.\n\n289\n00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.060\nI know that I have\na domain controller here.\n\n290\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.600\nI've got an email server, a file server.\n\n291\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.570\nI know that I've got some work\nstations here, maybe even a printer.\n\n292\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.190\nI can see the physical documentation or\nthe physical layout.\n\n293\n00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.870\nThis might be things like the cabling,\nright?\n\n294\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.420\nThe cabling type, the electrical\nmechanics of that as well, all right?\n\n295\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.890\nSo these are a couple of things\nthat you can certainly have.\n\n296\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.250\nNow, the physical diagrams aren't the only\nthing that we need to worry about.\n\n297\n00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.920\nThere's other things too,\nlike the logical, right?\n\n298\n00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.620\nIf we could take a look at my physical\ndiagram, could you tell me, Dan,\n\n299\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:33.780\nreal quick by the physical diagram I have,\nwhat subnets client one is on?\n\n300\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.120\n&gt;&gt; That is gonna be\na little more difficult.\n\n301\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.300\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be challenging, right?\n\n302\n00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.950\nSo the physical diagram is great so\nyou know things like asset management.\n\n303\n00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.140\nWhat do I actually have?\n\n304\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.550\nAnd this doesn't really tell\neverything in the asset management.\n\n305\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.510\nCuz you have things like software binders,\nyou have contracts and SLAs that that\n\n306\n00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.190\nvendor documentation, and again, an asset\nmanagement documentation can really help.\n\n307\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.034\nBut you also need things like well,\nthe logical network diagram, right.\n\n308\n00:14:57.034 --> 00:15:00.277\nI need to know,\nwhat are the subnets that we have?\n\n309\n00:15:00.277 --> 00:15:01.709\nWhat are the networks that are on?\n\n310\n00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:06.100\nIf I say hey, Dan,\nI've got a 10.10.0.16 network, and\n\n311\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.035\nI've got one of those machines can't talk\nto another machine on another network.\n\n312\n00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:13.825\nWell, Dan knows right away,\nwell let me go ahead,\n\n313\n00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.245\nlet me find out where our IP address is.\n\n314\n00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:17.625\nWhat are the subnets that we have?\n\n315\n00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.135\nAnd what are the computers on?\n\n316\n00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:23.370\nThat's a big difference between how\nthey're laid out in relationship to one\n\n317\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.620\nanother physically.\n\n318\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.510\nAll right, why?\n\n319\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.850\nBecause I can control all this\nstuff in software, all right?\n\n320\n00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:34.410\nWhich also leads into things like for\ninstance, IP address utilization, right.\n\n321\n00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.270\nI need to know what are the IP addresses\nI have available on my network?\n\n322\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.344\nWhat networks do I have, right?\n\n323\n00:15:41.344 --> 00:15:45.860\nI want Dan to be able to tell,\nDan needs to have that kinda information.\n\n324\n00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.531\nI know right away that\nI've got 10.100.0.24.\n\n325\n00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:53.570\nRight well,\nwhat addresses do we have available?\n\n326\n00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.857\nWell, I've got an address\nspreadsheet that says, okay, well,\n\n327\n00:15:56.857 --> 00:15:58.687\nI can tell where my first address is.\n\n328\n00:15:58.687 --> 00:15:59.967\nI know what device is.\n\n329\n00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:02.910\nIn this case, this is kinda like\na logical documentation as well.\n\n330\n00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.438\nIt's Part of your logical diagram.\n\n331\n00:16:04.438 --> 00:16:08.490\nNow, it's that showing you the\nrelationship to the subnets at all, but\n\n332\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.011\nit's still part of your logical diagram,\ncuz I know that DNS,\n\n333\n00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:14.760\nthe names can be changed,\nright, in software.\n\n334\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.280\nSo I can see, okay, well I've got a series\nof IP addresses that at one point,\n\n335\n00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.470\nmaybe I said,\nI wanna reserve these for expansion.\n\n336\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.690\nMaybe I know, talking to somebody else,\nthat we're gonna bring in some\n\n337\n00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.560\nnew devices, and I wanna rearrange\nthe networks so I've got them reserved.\n\n338\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.240\nWell, if I've got this documentation,\nI can look through here.\n\n339\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.306\nAnd I can see, okay,\nI got clients on the sale floor, right.\n\n340\n00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:41.826\nI've got some areas where I've purposely\nleft some IP addresses open so\n\n341\n00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:43.985\nthat we can expand later, right.\n\n342\n00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:49.082\nI've can see that I've got things like,\nfor instance, I've got those IP cams.\n\n343\n00:16:49.082 --> 00:16:51.390\nWell, what kind of cams are they?\n\n344\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.228\nWell, again,\n\n345\n00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:56.810\npart of asset management says I know that\nthey're the Ubiquiti UniFi G3s, right?\n\n346\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.291\nOr they're the Axis Comm M3045, right?\n\n347\n00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:01.545\nI need to know this.\n\n348\n00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:05.778\nI need to know this kind of information\nif I have one of these spreadsheets or\n\n349\n00:17:05.778 --> 00:17:09.406\nsome kind of a documentation,\nI can look through the network and\n\n350\n00:17:09.406 --> 00:17:11.910\nI could see what we have available, right?\n\n351\n00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.620\nI can see that maybe towards the end of\nthe range it's all on the side, all right.\n\n352\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.490\nSo, this information is very,\nvery variable when it comes to finding out\n\n353\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.270\nwhat's currently going on with your\nnetwork, what do I have and room for\n\n354\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.080\nexpansion how do I troubleshoot\ndifferent things if I need to.\n\n355\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.920\nBut, more so\nto know what is going on right now?\n\n356\n00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.760\nIf you have this type of information,\ndoes it make your job easier?\n\n357\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.570\nYou bet.\n\n358\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.880\nDoes it solve everything?\n\n359\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.705\nNo.\nAnd we know that doesn't, but\n\n360\n00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:38.654\nit is a good start.\n\n361\n00:17:38.654 --> 00:17:41.665\nIt's better to know what you\nhave on your network now, so\n\n362\n00:17:41.665 --> 00:17:44.564\nyou can know what's going wrong and\nhow you can fix it.\n\n363\n00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:48.230\nAnd just to know just be able to\nidentify your network in general.\n\n364\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes,\nsome other important information or\n\n365\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.450\ndocumentation that you might want\nto have on hand, at the ready, for\n\n366\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.580\nwhenever you may need it,\nyour vendors, right?\n\n367\n00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.776\nYou have SLA's, things of that nature.\n\n368\n00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:01.410\nI've bought equipment from Cisco, maybe.\n\n369\n00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.160\nI need to have all the documentation for\nthat.\n\n370\n00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.270\nWhat I've bought,\nwhat I've spent, how much,\n\n371\n00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.680\nany kind of warranty\ninformation that might be,\n\n372\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.140\ntons of information when it comes to\nwhat you are using with your vendor.\n\n373\n00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.211\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\nlike service numbers, right?\n\n374\n00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:12.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!.\n\n375\n00:18:12.768 --> 00:18:14.104\n&gt;&gt; Service contracts.\nFor instance,\n\n376\n00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:18.133\nmaybe you have an enterprise level\nDell service contract, right?\n\n377\n00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:21.679\nMaybe you bought a deployment of\ncertain amount of network devices or\n\n378\n00:18:21.679 --> 00:18:23.890\ncertain amount of computers.\n\n379\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.800\nWe need to have that vendor\ndocumentation cuz you can find,\n\n380\n00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.455\nam I still within the ever\napproaching warranty deadline?\n\n381\n00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:33.170\n[LAUGH] Do I have an SLA?\n\n382\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.810\nDo I have the option to extend warranties,\n\n383\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.820\nto continue to get that sort of,\nthat support.\n\n384\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.500\nOr if you dont have this information and\nyou wont be aware of it, and\n\n385\n00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.980\nwhen that deadline comes,\nI can almost guarantee\n\n386\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.390\nyou Murphy's Law dictates about half\nof your computers are gonna die, right?\n\n387\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.730\nWell, there is a reason they do research\nand they put deadlines, warranties only\n\n388\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.940\na certain time cuz they know what\nthe mean time between failure is.\n\n389\n00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:59.530\nSo its a good time, it would be good for\nyou to know when that warranty end, so\n\n390\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.020\nyou can save yourself a lot\nof headache in the future.\n\n391\n00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.700\nSo documentation, documentation and\nyeah, documentation.\n\n392\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.730\n&gt;&gt; And leads us to our last\nbit of documentation and\n\n393\n00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.260\nthat is what are my guidelines for\ndoing my job?\n\n394\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.510\nWhat are your guidelines for\nyou doing your job.\n\n395\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.540\nIf it's different than mine, and, Wes,\n\n396\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.620\nthis comes into internal procedure and\nthings of that nature, right?\n\n397\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.340\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n398\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.300\nWe kinda mentioned a little bit about it,\nthings like accept AUPs,\n\n399\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.498\nthey call them acceptable use policies.\n\n400\n00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.460\nOn-boarding and off-boarding process,\nthat's all gotta be documented.\n\n401\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.560\nI need to know what's\nthe acceptable use for\n\n402\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.510\nusing my device on a corporate network,\nright?\n\n403\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.860\nAm I allowed to connect my device\nto an internal WiFi network and\n\n404\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.800\nthen visit the file server?\n\n405\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.350\nMaybe, I don't know and that's why I\nneed those policies and procedures.\n\n406\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.952\nIs it a security policy, all right?\n\n407\n00:19:47.952 --> 00:19:51.498\nThe formal statement of what\nsecurity means to your company,\n\n408\n00:19:51.498 --> 00:19:55.588\nhow it's gonna be implemented,\nthe guidelines to follow the policy,\n\n409\n00:19:55.588 --> 00:19:59.910\nand then implement, what might happen\nif you violate the policy, right?\n\n410\n00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.720\nSo, you have to have those\ninternal procedures,\n\n411\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.260\nthe internal policies, as well as\njust setting some kind of standard.\n\n412\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.190\nSome kind of framework, a guideline,\nso that you know that, when\n\n413\n00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.860\nyou're doing your job, how do I do it, how\ndo I do it right, what's expected of me?\n\n414\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.060\nAnd then,\nwhat's gonna happen if I don't do it?\n\n415\n00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.300\nYou don't always wanna focus on the bad,\nbut you always got to have those too.\n\n416\n00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.520\nWhat are the repercussions for\na violation of the internal standards or\n\n417\n00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.530\npolicies as well.\n\n418\n00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n419\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.870\nWell, once we talked a lot\nabout going through management,\n\n420\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.390\nthings that can help us support that,\nand all the configurations thereof.\n\n421\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.960\nWanna make sure that, documentation is\nhuge, definitely be documenting your\n\n422\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.170\nnetworks people, it's not only gonna\nhelp others, it's gonna help you,\n\n423\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.790\ncuz you're gonna forget, what's the IP\nof that switch on the fourth floor,\n\n424\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.700\nthat we stuck in that closet, that's\nbeen running for the last six years?\n\n425\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.900\nI don't remember, I don't remember\ncuz if we never logged into it,\n\n426\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.200\nit finally died, right, so\nkeep the documentation going.\n\n427\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.770\nThat being said,\n\n428\n00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.030\nWes it looks like we've come to the end\nof yet another fantastic episode.\n\n429\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.990\nWe do thank you for joining us today,\nwe thank you for joining us as well.\n\n430\n00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.230\nBut, it looks like it's that time for\nus to sign off, for ITProTV,\n\n431\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.830\nI've been your host

00:00:10.457\n&gt;&gt; Your watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:12.568\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:15.690\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.520\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.590\nwe are continuing on with more\non our network plus series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.430\nAnd of course joining us in the studio,\nyet\n\n9\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.110\nagain to lend his expertise on the very\ntopic, our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.730\nWes welcome sir, how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.270\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great, great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.080\nYep we're having a great time in\nnet plus and we're continuing on.\n\n13\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.130\nAnd in this subject we're gonna be\ntalking about the importance and\n\n14\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.110\nsome of the consideration when it\ncomes to network segmentation.\n\n15\n00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.040\nAnd it is an important topic, not only\njust for the exam, but theory wise,\n\n16\n00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.300\nthe concept's important, too.\n\n17\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.760\nCuz really, when it comes to it,\n\n18\n00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.170\nthere's two reasons we would\nwanna take a larger network.\n\n19\n00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.960\nWhether it be at layer two, or\n\n20\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.030\nlayer three, and we wanna divide\nit up into smaller networks.\n\n21\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.210\nIn fact, one thing that I can think\nof right away, like we talked about,\n\n22\n00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.680\nis the performance gains that\nyou get from doing that.\n\n23\n00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.570\nTaking a larger based network and then\nisolating broadcast communications and\n\n24\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.060\nstuff and dividing them up\ninto smaller networks as well.\n\n25\n00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.080\nThe other thing too is security,\n\n26\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.740\none of the things that this segmentation\ncan do is it can help to assist security.\n\n27\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.140\nIt's not the one-stop shop for\nsecurity, as you've probably seen,\n\n28\n00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.680\nmaybe in other episodes or\nin other course in general.\n\n29\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.120\nWe've got a bunch of security\ncourses here at ITPro TV\n\n30\n00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.170\nthat there's more than one thing\nyou have to do for security.\n\n31\n00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.280\nIt's never just one thing,\n\n32\n00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.910\nit's usually a collection of\nthings called defense and depth.\n\n33\n00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.006\nBut the segmentation part of it, it can\nstart, it can be one of the things that\n\n34\n00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.740\nyou implement that co-exist with\nother things inside your network.\n\n35\n00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.800\nThat help to assist security, so\nthat's what we're gonna go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.702\nwe're gonna look at right here.\n\n37\n00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:58.377\nIn fact we're gonna start out with a topic\nthat we've really touch base on in other\n\n38\n00:01:58.377 --> 00:02:01.902\nepisodes here at Network Plus and\nthat's our SCADA systems,\n\n39\n00:02:01.902 --> 00:02:04.365\nright,our industrial control systems.\n\n40\n00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:08.684\nWhy is it important to keep\nthese networks divided?\n\n41\n00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:12.490\nWell, I want you to think about something,\nin fact, I got a little diagram here.\n\n42\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.380\nYou probably, if you've already\nseen from one of other episodes,\n\n43\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.340\nyou've probably seen this type\nof network before, right,\n\n44\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.130\nyour SCADA system, supervisory, control,\nand data acquisition if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.010\nSo there a lot of moving parts, right,\nthese can be small systems, typically not.\n\n46\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.960\nBut they can go right up\nto very large systems, and\n\n47\n00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.230\nwhen we look at all these\nmoving components, right.\n\n48\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.730\nWe talk about a remote telemetry unit,\nwe have sensors.\n\n49\n00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.470\nThis is sensitive information\nthat's being reported back to\n\n50\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.610\nyour central data acquisition and\nstorage locations, right.\n\n51\n00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.940\nThe other thing, too, remote telemetry\nunits, or remote terminal units.\n\n52\n00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.540\nThey can be doing power monitoring,\nright, so\n\n53\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.240\nimagine if somebody could tap into that\ninformation, right, and get access to it.\n\n54\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.610\nSo there is a reason why we would want\nsomething like these RTUs, if you will,\n\n55\n00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.980\nthat are controlling or not they can\ncontrol but are giving us a very, very\n\n56\n00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.420\nsensitive information about things like\nmaybe pressure, temperature if you will.\n\n57\n00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.890\nThink about this too, our water plants,\nright, our water plants,\n\n58\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.980\nelectrical plants, these are very,\nvery important systems.\n\n59\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.240\nWe have things like typical networks\ncommunications that go on, so\n\n60\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.610\nwouldn't it be nice if I had things\nlike for instance, if we implemented,\n\n61\n00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.440\nfor instance, maybe something like VLANs.\n\n62\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.170\nWhere a certain area of this network can\nonly talk between other devices that\n\n63\n00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.530\nwere on that VLAN or\ngoing even farther, right.\n\n64\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.300\nWe can create things like ACLs that govern\nthe traffic, but if you have all of this,\n\n65\n00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.550\nlet's say, and it's not going to happen\nthis way cuz the systems are so big.\n\n66\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.460\nCan you imagine if you had\nall of this connected to\n\n67\n00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.160\none centralized connectivity device?\n\n68\n00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.610\nWell, there's a problem with that, right?\n\n69\n00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.905\nHigh availability, this is something\nthat we think about, in security,\n\n70\n00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:05.463\nwe talk about the CIA triad availability,\nis that third part confidentiality,\n\n71\n00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:08.735\nintegrity, and availability, and\nif I don't have access to this data.\n\n72\n00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:15.330\nEspecially important information that we\nneed access to, that can cause problems.\n\n73\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.746\nSo we definitely don't want people\nhaving access to all this information or\n\n74\n00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:22.230\nbeing able to tap in to a single system,\nand\n\n75\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.140\ngain all the information that they need,\nright.\n\n76\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.390\nSo we wanna implement techniques\nthat allow us to break\n\n77\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.910\ndown the pieces of these networks where\nwe can implement things like ACLs, right.\n\n78\n00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.730\nWe can implement things, like for\ninstance a port based authentication,\n\n79\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.530\nmaybe implement something like 802.1X.\n\n80\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.170\nAgain, just because we have so\nmany different moving pieces, like for\n\n81\n00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.940\ninstance the programming interface.\n\n82\n00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.800\nImagine if I'm the hacker, and\n\n83\n00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.530\nsomebody leaves the programming interface\nopen, and I can gain access to it.\n\n84\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.500\nNow I know,\nthat's security is a bigger concern there.\n\n85\n00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.030\nBut wouldn't it be nice to have some kind\nof separation between all of the devices?\n\n86\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.320\nYour programmable logical controllers,\n\n87\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.060\nright, maybe separating that information\nout and that control, if you will.\n\n88\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.290\nThings like your cameras, right,\nyour IP cameras, maybe you have them for\n\n89\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.300\na building.\n\n90\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.397\nMaybe the storage information, right,\nmaybe we don't want, for instance,\n\n91\n00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:21.884\nbroadcast traffic being just\nbroadcast to everybody on the network\n\n92\n00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:24.592\nthat's coming from for\ninstance, these servers.\n\n93\n00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:27.009\nThe other thing we gotta\nthink about too is,\n\n94\n00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.957\nwhen we think about our spy\nmovies out there, right.\n\n95\n00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:31.807\nWe gotta go action film here,\n\n96\n00:05:31.807 --> 00:05:35.519\nwhat are some of the things\nthat people concerned at right?\n\n97\n00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:38.633\nAnd when we talk about things like,\nterrorist attacks, or\n\n98\n00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:41.888\nwe talk about some disgruntled\nemployee attacking a system.\n\n99\n00:05:41.888 --> 00:05:45.412\nWe gotta watch this because when they\ntalk about things like terror attacks,\n\n100\n00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:48.920\nwell what do you think it is really\nthat they're trying to attack?\n\n101\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.530\nThey are trying to attack infrastructure\n\n102\n00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.160\nthat governs major things\nlike power plants.\n\n103\n00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.601\nAgain power distribution grids,\nif you will,\n\n104\n00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:03.030\nnuclear facilities and\nthen the list just goes on.\n\n105\n00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.140\nSo lots of moving parts,\na massive system, and\n\n106\n00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.690\nit is good to make sure that\nwe divide these systems up.\n\n107\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.860\nThat is important.\n\n108\n00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.870\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes I'm definitely starting to hear\na lot about security here, security here.\n\n109\n00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.420\nIt seems like segmentation,\n\n110\n00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.200\none of the main themes we're gonna\ncontinue to see, is all about security.\n\n111\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.370\n&gt;&gt; It really is,\nwhen it comes down to it, Dan,\n\n112\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.850\nthere are two major topics\nit's always security, and\n\n113\n00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.870\nI think you and I have talked about\nthe second one on many occasions.\n\n114\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.760\nIsolating communications to a certain\nsegment, if you will, for the purposes for\n\n115\n00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.640\nperformance, right.\n\n116\n00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.210\nSo security for sure, and again,\nI gotta stress the fact that this isn't\n\n117\n00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.210\nthe one size fits all\nsecurity implementation.\n\n118\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.291\nWe have to do defense in that, right?\n\n119\n00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:48.820\nThere's multiple other technologies\nthat have to be put in place, but\n\n120\n00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.077\nif I can take,\nlet's say 50 computers, right.\n\n121\n00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:56.293\nAnd I could put 25 on one segment,\nand I could put 25 on the other, and\n\n122\n00:06:56.293 --> 00:07:00.533\nthen I could put an ACL that governs\nthe traffic between the two, right.\n\n123\n00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:03.581\nNot only could we see\nthe performance gain on that but\n\n124\n00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:08.350\nwe could also see it helping to\nassist our security infrastructure.\n\n125\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:13.510\nNow one thing that certainly doesn't\nassist our security infrastructure,\n\n126\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.620\nin any way, is legacy systems.\n\n127\n00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.910\nAnd we always have to worry\nabout legacy systems okay.\n\n128\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.710\nYou might say well Wes,\nwhy don't we just take the legacy systems.\n\n129\n00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.850\nAnd let me define what legacy system is\nrather than just assuming you know what\n\n130\n00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.180\nthat means, right.\n\n131\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.840\nA system that is no longer supported,\nright, it might have vulnerabilities.\n\n132\n00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.930\nIt could have vulnerabilities, it could\nhave a lot of them, we don't know.\n\n133\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.760\nWhy?\n\n134\n00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.573\nBecause whoever the software manufacturer\nwas, or could be hardware manufacturer\n\n135\n00:07:41.573 --> 00:07:45.276\nsaid, you know what, that product is out\nof it's life cycle and guess what we're\n\n136\n00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.567\ngonna do, we're gonna stop supporting\nit and we're letting you know.\n\n137\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:52.749\nMicrosoft is a big one, you know there\nwas big to do years ago when XP lost\n\n138\n00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:56.655\nit's life cycle, people,\nit's a great operating system,\n\n139\n00:07:56.655 --> 00:08:01.232\nthere's nothing wrong with it, but\nYou gotta move it to the future, right?\n\n140\n00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:06.900\n2003 Server also fell under\nthat same end of life cycle.\n\n141\n00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.320\nYou have things like Cisco devices\nthat are no longer supported.\n\n142\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.190\nSo, you have network devices too\nthat you have to worry about.\n\n143\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.570\nAnd, what are some of the issues with\nthese legacy systems more so than anything\n\n144\n00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.130\nis there's no support and they're out of\ntheir patch management life cycle, right?\n\n145\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.380\nSo if, let's say Dan makes the latest and\ngreatest security exploit, right,\n\n146\n00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.570\nthat gets around a certain what we thought\nwas a hot fix but it really wasn't, right?\n\n147\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.485\nI can't call up Microsoft and\nsay, Microsoft, I found a bug.\n\n148\n00:08:34.485 --> 00:08:35.745\nAnd somebody's exploiting it right?\n\n149\n00:08:35.745 --> 00:08:38.195\nThey're gonna say well we gave\n\n150\n00:08:38.195 --> 00:08:41.415\nyou 14 years to come up with an update,\nall right.\n\n151\n00:08:41.415 --> 00:08:46.325\nNow again you might be thinking, well why\ndon't we just get rid of those systems?\n\n152\n00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:48.880\nThat's not always\nsomething that you can do.\n\n153\n00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.770\nYou ever heard of the term, if it's\nnot broke, don't fix it till it is?\n\n154\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.660\nYou might have older legacy\nsystems that run software and\n\n155\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.760\nyou just can't get rid of them.\n\n156\n00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.800\n&gt;&gt; It's funny, one of the guys\nwe've had on this show, for\n\n157\n00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.706\nthe CISA, is a Brian O'Hara,\nhe was telling me about a SCADA system,\n\n158\n00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:06.630\na SCADA system that is running Window NT,\nright?\n\n159\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.260\nWhy?\n\n160\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.720\nBecause that's what it runs on.\n\n161\n00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.180\nThere is no new code for it.\n\n162\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.390\nThey can't take the system down.\n\n163\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.150\nIt's a water management plant.\n\n164\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.370\nIf they take the system down,\npeople don't get water.\n\n165\n00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.800\nSo they literally have to wait until\nnew infrastructure is built, so\n\n166\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.260\nthat they can remove\nthe old infrastructure.\n\n167\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.700\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and you look at\ncertain things like the space program.\n\n168\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.240\nI'm sure their technology that they're\nusing, some of it's probably 30, 40,\n\n169\n00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.350\n50 years old, cuz you're gonna\nget your money's worth out of it.\n\n170\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.470\nThat's not the only type of story that\nI've heard where it's been an old system.\n\n171\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.590\nWhere it might be, for instance,\nthings like PBX system.\n\n172\n00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.310\nMaybe it only runs under Server 2000,\nright?\n\n173\n00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.170\nWell, Server 2000 isn't\nsupported anymore so\n\n174\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.560\nit's gonna be really important that like\nthat SCADA system that Dan is talking,\n\n175\n00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.340\nthat Server 2000 box that's no longer\nsupported, those XP machines are isolated\n\n176\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.450\nand we really lock that network down\nwhile doing the segmenting, okay?\n\n177\n00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.480\nSo legacy systems you can't just get rid\nof them just because they're no longer\n\n178\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.340\nsupported.\n\n179\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.570\nBecause like we've seen here as example\nthat there might be systems that somebody\n\n180\n00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.900\nhas invested a lot of money and time, or\nthere might not be a replacement for it.\n\n181\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.890\nSo they also have there place\nin our networks even if,\n\n182\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.440\nfrom a security standpoint some\npeople might say that they don't.\n\n183\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.427\nAll right, what else?\n\n184\n00:10:21.427 --> 00:10:24.810\nWe have a great question in the chat room.\n\n185\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.970\nAnd somebody asked well what about\nthe difference between guest networks and\n\n186\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.460\nmaybe our company network?\n\n187\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.720\nAnd we are gonna take care of that.\n\n188\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.770\nBecause that is honestly,\nthat's part of network segmentation.\n\n189\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.530\nIn fact, let me go ahead and we'll\njump right to, we'll kinda skip ahead\n\n190\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.120\nthere Dan, because it's a great\nquestion that came from the chat room.\n\n191\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.200\nIn fact let me show you a little\ndiagram that I have here,\n\n192\n00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.300\nyou've probably heard of these\nbefore right, guest network?\n\n193\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.200\nRight if I have a wireless access point\nyou probably maybe running on it home\n\n194\n00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.850\nmaybe it came with a piece of\nsoftware that you load up and it does\n\n195\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.190\nthe configuration of guest network for you\nand maybe even all the security settings.\n\n196\n00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:04.130\nBut the point in a guest network is it\ndoesn't allow you access into your own\n\n197\n00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.110\nlocal area network.\n\n198\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.060\nIt says okay you can access the network,\nand we'll allow you this one service.\n\n199\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.160\nWhat is that one service?\n\n200\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.388\nA lot of times it's just HTTP and HTTPS\nand it's an outbound communication, so\n\n201\n00:11:16.388 --> 00:11:20.441\nyou can join our network and you can\ncommunicate back out with the Internet.\n\n202\n00:11:20.441 --> 00:11:27.280\nBut when it comes to internal private\nlocal area network, you don't gain access.\n\n203\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.170\nNow again, we could couple this, I could\ngo on with the explanation that we can\n\n204\n00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.350\ncouple this with things like\nACLs on the access points that\n\n205\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.350\nhelp to further control the level\nof access, but definitely.\n\n206\n00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.050\nSo the question in the chatroom is,\nhey, is that called out?\n\n207\n00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.260\nIs that part of network segmentation?\n\n208\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.190\nAnd I would say, absolutely, it is.\n\n209\n00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.790\nAnd it's definitely a good concept to\n\n210\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.460\nunderstand why do we even\nhave guest networks, right.\n\n211\n00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.000\nWell, I've got people like contractors,\nright.\n\n212\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.350\nNot that I don't look like contractors-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.580\n&gt;&gt; He looks a little evil there.\n\n214\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.990\n&gt;&gt; Like a different kind of contractor so\n\n215\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.862\nwhen would you like\nthe body delivered ma'am?\n\n216\n00:12:01.862 --> 00:12:03.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n217\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.080\nSo we've got things like contractors here,\nmaybe we've got customers, right?\n\n218\n00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.510\nYour customers don't need access\nto your internal network.\n\n219\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.380\nI know here at ITProTV,\nwe've got a guest network because we've\n\n220\n00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.250\ngot people that are visiting\nus all the time.\n\n221\n00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.000\nAnd we certainly don't wanna\nbother them by not giving them\n\n222\n00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.920\nsome kind of network access because\npeople are just connected today.\n\n223\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.850\nThat's the way it is.\n\n224\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.690\nSo we have our own guest network.\n\n225\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.490\nAnd when you come in,\nyou can join that guest network.\n\n226\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:31.530\nBut when it comes to the network that the\ninternal employees use, well, guess what?\n\n227\n00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.030\nYou don't gain access to that one, right?\n\n228\n00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.280\nWe got to keep that information protected.\n\n229\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.220\nNow that also lens itself to\nthings like DMZs, all right.\n\n230\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.100\nThey call it out specifically\nthe objective is a public network versus\n\n231\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.100\na private network.\n\n232\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.140\nAnd I just kinda even though it's\nnot called out specifically.\n\n233\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.422\nI put guest network and\n\n234\n00:12:50.422 --> 00:12:54.590\nthe private wireless local area network\nall lumped into the same thing.\n\n235\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.260\nBecause really they do kinda\nfall under the same concept.\n\n236\n00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.750\nBut now we also implement things like\nDMZs, right, demilitarized zones.\n\n237\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.710\nNow why would we implement\na demilitarized zone, or what is it?\n\n238\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.870\nWell, that is just,\nessentially, a portion,\n\n239\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.080\nit's like a network on the edge\nof your network, right?\n\n240\n00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.800\nIt is set typically between two firewalls.\n\n241\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.820\nLet's say I'm a company and\n\n242\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.030\nI've got a resource that I need\nto give somebody access to.\n\n243\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.200\nMaybe I've got a form that\nwe're selling a product and\n\n244\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.400\nthere's a web server on the front end\nthat you need to fill out this form and\n\n245\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.680\nit ends data to the back end into\nsome kind of database, right.\n\n246\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.150\nWell I need people from the public network\nwhich in this case is gonna be something\n\n247\n00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.210\nlike the Internet to gain access\nto that web server to be able\n\n248\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.790\nto fill out that form with whatever\nproduct it is that we might be selling.\n\n249\n00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.830\nWell this demilitarized zone\nis essentially a logical zone\n\n250\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.620\nset between an external, in fact let me go\nahead and kind of finish my diagram here.\n\n251\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.980\nYou have what's known as\na external firewall and\n\n252\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.410\nthen you have what's known as\nyour interior firewall, right?\n\n253\n00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.210\nYour external firewall allows people that\nare coming in from the Internet that want\n\n254\n00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.790\nto visit that website in\norder to fill out that form.\n\n255\n00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.290\nThey could communicate through\nthe external firewall so\n\n256\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.530\nthat they can gain access\nto the web server.\n\n257\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.190\nBut what they can't do, and this is\nwhat makes it public versus private,\n\n258\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.350\nis that the internal\nfirewall doesn't allow them\n\n259\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:30.090\naccess to my internal network,\nexcept if I'm an authorized user.\n\n260\n00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.760\nI'm authenticated, I'm authorized.\n\n261\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.150\nOur administrators have said yeah,\nyou know what, you can have remote access.\n\n262\n00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.560\nAnd they've got some,\nmaybe some kind of remote access system,\n\n263\n00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.200\nmaybe some remote desktop gateway\ntype server that's set up so\n\n264\n00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.690\nyou can do a remote desktop\nback into your network.\n\n265\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.070\nMaybe work from home.\n\n266\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:55.030\nBut the point is everybody else can access\nthe web server but they cannot access\n\n267\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.370\nthe resources on the internal network and\nthat's very very important to understand.\n\n268\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:03.030\nA few different names for DMZs,\nI kind of agree with them.\n\n269\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.660\nWe were talking about this one, and this\nis another one we were kind of discussing\n\n270\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.100\nis that the DMZ concept tells you\nexactly what's going on here, right?\n\n271\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.760\nIt's no man's land, all right?\n\n272\n00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.290\nDemilitarized zone, if you will.\n\n273\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.270\nYou might here other things saying screen\nsubnet, perimeter networks as well.\n\n274\n00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.770\nPay attention to the context of that\n\n275\n00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.800\nto make sure if they're\ntruly talking about a DMZ.\n\n276\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.070\nSo just pay attention to\nthat if it ever comes up.\n\n277\n00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.080\nI don't think it's gonna be something\nthat you have to worry about too much on\n\n278\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.600\nthe Net+ exam.\n\n279\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.762\nThe other one that I might talk about,\nyou know, publicly accessible,\n\n280\n00:15:39.762 --> 00:15:43.187\npublic versus private is things\nlike isolation networks.\n\n281\n00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:46.875\nNow, I know, I'm pretty sure the newest\naddition of Windows Server and\n\n282\n00:15:46.875 --> 00:15:51.350\nWindows Server 2016 doesn't have this\nanymore for whatever reason they took out,\n\n283\n00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.704\nbut if you've got something like network\naccess control that's implemented inside\n\n284\n00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:59.511\nof your network maybe you're running\nan older edition On Windows sever and\n\n285\n00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:02.203\nyou're implementing\nnetwork access protection.\n\n286\n00:16:02.203 --> 00:16:05.010\nAll right, I want you to think\nabout segmentation here.\n\n287\n00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.790\nIf I have a, maybe a remote connection,\n\n288\n00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.210\nsomebody, our employee wants to\nconnect back into the private network.\n\n289\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.384\nBut when they do, I have a server\nout there on the DMZ that says okay,\n\n290\n00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:18.737\ntell me what your health is right now.\n\n291\n00:16:18.737 --> 00:16:23.639\nSo the computer sends me over\na little health certificate and says,\n\n292\n00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:29.577\nI've got an out of date definitions on\nmy antivirus, my firewall's turned off.\n\n293\n00:16:29.577 --> 00:16:32.898\nI think it's been six months\nsince I've done an update.\n\n294\n00:16:32.898 --> 00:16:36.686\nMy server goes well, wait a second here,\nI don't know if I want you as a security\n\n295\n00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:40.549\nrisk on the internal network here so what\nI'm gonna do is I'm gonna isolate you.\n\n296\n00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:42.970\nI'm gonna throw you to another network.\n\n297\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.930\nAgain, it's a perimeter network.\n\n298\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.631\nNot necessarily a DMZ at this point.\n\n299\n00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:50.338\nBecause what it's doing is we put\na remediation server in that isolated\n\n300\n00:16:50.338 --> 00:16:50.903\nnetwork.\n\n301\n00:16:50.903 --> 00:16:52.140\nAnd what does it do?\n\n302\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.160\nIt connects right to it,\nit updates, right?\n\n303\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.570\nCould have WSUS there.\n\n304\n00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.260\nIt pulls down its updates,\nit updates all of its definitions.\n\n305\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.499\nThere's a group policy\nthat maybe is enforced and\n\n306\n00:17:02.499 --> 00:17:06.212\nit turns on the firewall and\nit remediates the computer.\n\n307\n00:17:06.212 --> 00:17:08.218\nNow the computer goes back,\nmaybe to the DMZ,\n\n308\n00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:11.678\nit presents access, here's my health\ncertificate we're all good to go.\n\n309\n00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:16.220\nAnd the server says okay,\nlet me look at my network policy.\n\n310\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.560\nAll right, you're good to go,\nyou have access into the private network.\n\n311\n00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.980\nSo even your private versus public\nnetworks could be just a temporary\n\n312\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.020\nstaging area.\n\n313\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.840\nIf you've got some kind of compliance or\nsecurity policy that says XYZ\n\n314\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.040\nis the requirements for\nconnecting the computer to this network.\n\n315\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.920\nYou need to meet them before you can.\n\n316\n00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.530\nOnce you do,\nyou can connect to the private network.\n\n317\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.800\nSo, there are other terms\ntoo that might come out,\n\n318\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.900\nlike an isolation network and something\nlike that, that you can implement.\n\n319\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Now West, we're gonna keep continuing\ndown the idea of, again, security.\n\n320\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.940\nIt's a theme we're gonna see\nhere when it comes to isolation.\n\n321\n00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.822\nRemember, security and performance, the\ntwo big deals on why we actually do this.\n\n322\n00:17:54.822 --> 00:17:59.930\nAnd nowadays it became popular at one\ntime then kind of ran out of favor for\n\n323\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.113\na little while.\n\n324\n00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:04.513\nBut now it seems to be back in as\ndefinitely a tour de force anymore,\n\n325\n00:18:04.513 --> 00:18:08.183\nsomething that we're seeing a lot\nmore of is Honeynets and Honeypots.\n\n326\n00:18:08.183 --> 00:18:09.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan, so Honeypots and Honeynets,\n\n327\n00:18:09.866 --> 00:18:12.456\nso again this is not only of the few\nout there searching for honey.\n\n328\n00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:13.396\nWhat is this?\n\n329\n00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:16.812\nWell, I want you to think about\na situation where maybe you've got\n\n330\n00:18:16.812 --> 00:18:17.550\na web server.\n\n331\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.800\nLike, let's take my diagram where\nI had our DMZ setup, right?\n\n332\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.970\nMaybe I got a web server and\nthis is a production based server but\n\n333\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.310\nfor whatever reason,\nI'm given public access.\n\n334\n00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.590\nAnd something's happening.\n\n335\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.560\nSomebody is attacking it.\n\n336\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.290\nSomebody might be hacking it.\n\n337\n00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.880\nImagine a way that I could take\na resource like this web server, and\n\n338\n00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.450\nI could put it in its own\nmaybe second network, right?\n\n339\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:46.980\nAn isolated network, and it becomes not so\nmuch a production-based resource,\n\n340\n00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:53.290\nbut an identical copy that I can make\nlook like it's the production resource.\n\n341\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.975\nAnd that's what Honeypots allow us to do.\n\n342\n00:18:55.975 --> 00:18:58.090\nHoneypot is a single resource,\n\n343\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:03.452\nright, that looks enticing to other\npeople, hackers typically, right?\n\n344\n00:19:03.452 --> 00:19:08.910\nThe Honeynet on the other hand is an exact\nreplica of your production network,\n\n345\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.290\nand what we use it for is for\nthe purposes of gathering information.\n\n346\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.370\nYou might think of your Honeynet\nas a dummy network, right?\n\n347\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.180\nIt looks like those valuable resources\nthat all hackers want access to.\n\n348\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.270\nThey wanna find out what do you got.\n\n349\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:28.460\nWell, maybe as administrators, we wanna\nknow what technologies are they using.\n\n350\n00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.560\nIf they are attacking that web\nserver that's out in the DMZ,\n\n351\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.130\nhow are they doing it?\n\n352\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.860\nI need to know how they're doing it so\nI know how to stop the exploit.\n\n353\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:43.430\nIs it happening because maybe I didn't\nuse my server hardening techniques right?\n\n354\n00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.830\nDo I have a service open?\n\n355\n00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.270\nThat for whatever reason shouldn't\nbe open, well, I don't know.\n\n356\n00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.900\nImagine, again, being able to create\n\n357\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.230\nan entire network where you could\nwatch what people are doing.\n\n358\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.270\nYou could audit it,\npull log management, right?\n\n359\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.880\nPull the logs out and\nfind out what's going on.\n\n360\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.810\nCuz it's really hard.\n\n361\n00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.980\nGood hackers worth their salt,\nyou're not gonna find them.\n\n362\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.260\nThey're gonna cover their tracks.\n\n363\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.670\nThe worst case, best case scenario,\nyou might get a log cleared.\n\n364\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.590\nAnd you can see that\nthe logs were cleared.\n\n365\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.130\nIt's not really gonna help you.\n\n366\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.860\nSo imagine having a dummy\nnetwork where you could\n\n367\n00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.430\nactively track what they're doing.\n\n368\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.500\nAnd according to the hacker,\n\n369\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.570\nmaybe the hacker just thinks, yeah,\nthey don't know what I'm doing.\n\n370\n00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.500\nI'm gonna put in a couple of back doors,\nand then we realize that the reason\n\n371\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.830\nthe web server keeps getting attacked is\nbecause it got hit with a backdoor attack.\n\n372\n00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.360\nNow, we're thinking we're\nhardening the server,\n\n373\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.700\nwhen in fact, we really can't do much,\nbecause the person can just get in anyway.\n\n374\n00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.095\nSo, the Honeypot and the Honeynet.\n\n375\n00:20:38.095 --> 00:20:43.370\nHoneypot is just a single resource,\nlike the web server that is a replica of\n\n376\n00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.830\na production machine,\nbut it's not production.\n\n377\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.630\nIf I lose it, I'm okay, right?\n\n378\n00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.720\nThe Honeynet is an entire dummy network,\nright?\n\n379\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.545\nNow along that very same\nline too is what you have,\n\n380\n00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:58.254\nwe talk about things like test labs,\nright?.\n\n381\n00:20:58.254 --> 00:21:01.267\nWe, if you've been watching our episodes,\nwhich I'm sure you have,\n\n382\n00:21:01.267 --> 00:21:04.886\nyou'll probably know that we've got a lot\nof virtual machines in the background that\n\n383\n00:21:04.886 --> 00:21:05.691\nwe're running for\n\n384\n00:21:05.691 --> 00:21:09.078\ntest labs to make sure that we can perform\nthe techniques that we wanna show you.\n\n385\n00:21:09.078 --> 00:21:13.701\nThat help reinforce concepts and\nmake you successful on the exam, right?\n\n386\n00:21:13.701 --> 00:21:17.442\nWell, those lab or\ntest networks are perfect for\n\n387\n00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:21.000\nus cuz we can bring up the infrastructure,\nand\n\n388\n00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.394\nif we make configuration\nchanges that aren't the best.\n\n389\n00:21:25.394 --> 00:21:27.860\nWell, we didn't bring down\nthe production network.\n\n390\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.740\nThat's one of the great things\nabout utilizing things like\n\n391\n00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.780\nvirtual environments, right?\n\n392\n00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:37.190\nNow, it doesn't have to be a virtual\nenvironment, but it gets kind of expensive\n\n393\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.180\nif you start doing a test lab and\nyou're using physical machines.\n\n394\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.650\nSo do keep that in mind, all right?\n\n395\n00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.117\nThey call out test labs\nmore often than not today.\n\n396\n00:21:47.117 --> 00:21:51.419\nThat's gonna be achieved through\nyour virtualization technology.\n\n397\n00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:54.900\nSo take advantage of it.\n\n398\n00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.370\nIf we've got an exploit that's happening\nbecause this piece of software.\n\n399\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:01.799\nI don't wanna release that bug into the\nwild out there on the production network\n\n400\n00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:05.280\nand it starts spreading itself across\nthe network, bringing systems offline,\n\n401\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.424\nmaybe I wanna isolate it.\n\n402\n00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:10.255\nMaybe my virtual lab doesn't even have\na network connection, my testing lab.\n\n403\n00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:13.842\nAnd then I can put that bug there\ninside of that virtualized network.\n\n404\n00:22:13.842 --> 00:22:17.474\nAnd I can see how it works,\nI can see what's going on, and\n\n405\n00:22:17.474 --> 00:22:21.430\nsee if there's maybe a point\nthat I can remedy the situation.\n\n406\n00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.766\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat we have here too are, for instance,\n\n407\n00:22:25.766 --> 00:22:27.247\nload balancers, right?\n\n408\n00:22:27.247 --> 00:22:30.427\nNow load balancers when it\ncomes to network segmentation,\n\n409\n00:22:30.427 --> 00:22:33.360\nI want you to think about\nwhat clients rely on, right?\n\n410\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.640\nOur major network architecture if you will\ntoday, is the client-server model, right?\n\n411\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.240\nClients ask for resources,\nservers respond back with those resources.\n\n412\n00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:50.040\nNow, what if you had a network load\nbalancer that could see that information?\n\n413\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.870\nIt could screen it as it comes in and\nknow that, hey,\n\n414\n00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.340\nthat information's\nsupposed to go to the DMZ.\n\n415\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.240\nI see VPN communications here,\nlet me show you.\n\n416\n00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.460\nLet me go ahead and take all of your VPN\ninformation, and I'll just go ahead and\n\n417\n00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.560\ndirect that where it needs to be, right?\n\n418\n00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.840\nHow about outbound, things like this,\nmaybe DNS requests, right?\n\n419\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.530\nDNS, I sent a DNS request to a DNS server.\n\n420\n00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.810\nMaybe I've got, again, for compliance\nreasons or a security policy in place that\n\n421\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:20.890\nsays no, you don't get outbound\nrecursion of any DNS server, right?\n\n422\n00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.280\nYou can use the internal DNS servers but\nthat's all you can use, right?\n\n423\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.240\nWell, we can actually\nisolate resources down\n\n424\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.060\nthe services that different\nclients are requesting\n\n425\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.016\nwith load balancers directing them\nin different locations, right?\n\n426\n00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.590\nOne of the, it's a cheap man's\nload balancer if you will, and\n\n427\n00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:43.530\none of the ways we do this is things like\nround-robinning in your DNS request.\n\n428\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.740\nIf you got four or\nfive DNS servers in your network and\n\n429\n00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.150\nyou don't wanna just be continually\nhitting one single DNS server.\n\n430\n00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.933\nNow that's not necessarily about security,\nthat's more about the second side of that,\n\n431\n00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.789\nand that's the performance side, right?\n\n432\n00:23:55.789 --> 00:24:00.433\nSo load balancing is another\nthing that we can do.\n\n433\n00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:01.325\nHow about this?\n\n434\n00:24:01.325 --> 00:24:02.919\nWe've talked about this before.\n\n435\n00:24:02.919 --> 00:24:04.465\nSegmentation.\n\n436\n00:24:04.465 --> 00:24:07.585\nHow about isolating broadcast domains,\nright?\n\n437\n00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:11.491\nSo for instance, we talked a little\nbit about broadcast domains in another\n\n438\n00:24:11.491 --> 00:24:14.910\nepisode, but what if I happen to\nhave a series of servers, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.000\nNow, they're not attached here,\n\n440\n00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.330\nmaybe I've got a server here that's\ngot sensitive information on it.\n\n441\n00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.360\nWell, if it's in this broadcast domain and\n\n442\n00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.220\nit sends a broadcast communication,\nguess what?\n\n443\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.050\nEverybody in that network is gonna get it.\n\n444\n00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.810\nBut, since routers isolate\nbroadcast communications and\n\n445\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.630\nthey don't pass them across their\ninterface, I could say okay,\n\n446\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.150\nwell then this first broadcast domain,\nthat's where I'm gonna put server one.\n\n447\n00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.562\nAnd I'm not going to put a server\nin broadcast domain two, right?\n\n448\n00:24:43.562 --> 00:24:46.110\nSo now I've got two subnets.\n\n449\n00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.850\nAll right now, let's be careful with this.\n\n450\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.594\nYou know when we talk about the subnets,\n\n451\n00:24:49.594 --> 00:24:51.656\nremember that's a layer\nthree segmentation.\n\n452\n00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:54.418\nThat's a logical segmentation\nthat I do with IP address.\n\n453\n00:24:54.418 --> 00:24:59.052\nBut we also have ways, and a really\ncommon way to do this is at Layer two,\n\n454\n00:24:59.052 --> 00:25:04.481\nif we wanna separate communications we can\ndo this at the switching layer, right?\n\n455\n00:25:04.481 --> 00:25:08.895\nLayer two of the OSI model, and\nwe can implement things like VLANs, right?\n\n456\n00:25:08.895 --> 00:25:12.933\nMaybe I have a couple of servers, again,\nthat I don't want communicating with any\n\n457\n00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:15.730\nof the other computers that\nare attached to this switch.\n\n458\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.070\nMaybe I don't want them hearing any\nof the broadcast communication.\n\n459\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.860\nWell I can put them in their own VLAN,\nhelps with performance too because\n\n460\n00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.670\nthe broadcast communication is isolated\nto just that virtual local area network.\n\n461\n00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.801\nAnd then we can assist in security\nby adding ACLs on our router, right?\n\n462\n00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:39.994\nWe can basically make rules that\nsay can VLAN 10 talk to VLAN 20?\n\n463\n00:25:39.994 --> 00:25:42.960\nI'm not sure,\nmaybe your security policy says no.\n\n464\n00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.650\nWell, that's the good thing\nabout implementing VLANs.\n\n465\n00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:48.800\nIf you want VLANs to communicate amongst\neach other now you have to take it out of\n\n466\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.340\nlayer two and\nyou gotta go back up to layer three.\n\n467\n00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.180\nSo VLANs are another way\nthat you can isolate.\n\n468\n00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.500\nReally, all you're doing is taking a\nphysical switch and logically dividing it\n\n469\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.480\ninto multiple switches, but if you\nunderstand the switching concept here,\n\n470\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.840\nthen what you can see is you essentially\nget these virtualized local networks,\n\n471\n00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.280\nin which they can't\ncommunicate amongst each other.\n\n472\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.000\nSo that's really security and performance.\n\n473\n00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.610\nSo remember, layer three.\n\n474\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.640\nWe can isolate broadcast traffic\nby doing subnets, right?\n\n475\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.417\nWhen it comes to isolating and\n\n476\n00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:21.337\nsegmenting networks at layer two,\nwe can do this through VLANs.\n\n477\n00:26:21.337 --> 00:26:23.330\nI have to mention this one.\n\n478\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.820\nSome of you guys that maybe\nhave been in networking for\n\n479\n00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.140\na while will probably laugh at this one.\n\n480\n00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.630\nBut we've got to mention it,\nbecause the theory is still sound.\n\n481\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.640\nIf you have hubs in your network,\nreplace them with switches.\n\n482\n00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.150\nI know some of you are probably saying,\n\n483\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.790\nwell we should have done that about 30\nyears ago and you're probably right.\n\n484\n00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.310\nYou should have done that, but\n\n485\n00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.970\nagain remember, that leads to\nadditional contention on your networks.\n\n486\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.560\nThe other thing that we can do\nwith performance optimization,\n\n487\n00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.790\nwe've already talked subnets and\nVLANs for broadcast traffic.\n\n488\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.210\nImplementing things like quality of\nservice and class of service right?\n\n489\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.000\nIf I know that I have real time traffic\nthat needs to make it is going to be just\n\n490\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.150\ncommunicating all in this\none subset of computers and\n\n491\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.340\nit doesn't go anywhere else, well why\ndon't I just put them on a VLAN and\n\n492\n00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.920\nI can implement at layer three I\ncan implement quality of service.\n\n493\n00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.830\nSo there are other things that\nyou can do there, as well.\n\n494\n00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.440\nAll right Dan,\nI think that's just about got it.\n\n495\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.510\nJust remember that the importance for\n\n496\n00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:21.710\nnetwork segmentation largely\nis security and performance.\n\n497\n00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:25.858\nIn the fact that you can isolate\ntraffic to a specific set of computers.\n\n498\n00:27:25.858 --> 00:27:28.295\nAgain add ASLs.\n\n499\n00:27:28.295 --> 00:27:30.931\nIt can also further control\nwho can communicate and\n\n500\n00:27:30.931 --> 00:27:32.900\nwhat communications can take place.\n\n501\n00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.720\nBut, really when it comes down to\nit it's going to be performance.\n\n502\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.800\nIt's gonna be security.\n\n503\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes thanks for\n\n504\n00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:43.230\nenlightening us to the many myriad of\nreasons, which usually equals the two.\n\n505\n00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.370\nI guess there is compliance as well,\nsomeone's regulating you.\n\n506\n00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.950\nYou must have this separate from\nthis because it It's the law,\n\n507\n00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.900\nthat does happen as well.\n\n508\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.970\nBut the two big heavy hitters,\nsecurity and performance with the little\n\n509\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.450\nred headed step child of compliance,\ndon't forget that one.\n\n510\n00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.930\nThat being said, thanks again Wes for\ndropping by and enlightening us.\n\n511\n00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.230\nWe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n512\n00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.450\nBut it looks like it's about that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n513\n00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.070\nBid you a fond farewell.\n\n514\n00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.430\nSo signing off from ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n515\n00:28:10.430 -->

greetings everyone,\n\n7\n00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:15.751\nand welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n8\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.607\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n9\n00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:22.100\nin today's episode we are moving on with\nmore on our Network+ series for CompTIA.\n\n10\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.810\nAnd of course, joining us in\nthe studio is the man, the myth,\n\n11\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.940\nthe legend,\nthe guy that drives this train so\n\n12\n00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.600\nthat we might impart knowledge into our\nlittle tiny brains, and pass an exam,\n\n13\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.405\nbecome network technicians,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n14\n00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:34.115\nWes, welcome sir.\n\n15\n00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:34.795\nHow's it going today?\n\n16\n00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:35.635\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n17\n00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.365\nWell let's hope we can keep this\ntrain on the tracks for sure.\n\n18\n00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:39.255\nThanks for having me, thanks.\n\n19\n00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.309\n&gt;&gt; That's a good idea.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly, that's right,\n\n20\n00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.554\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n21\n00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:46.190\nWe're back with installing and\napplying patches and updates, and some of\n\n22\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.960\nyou guys might already ber familiar with\nthis if you are coming ou t of the A+ and\n\n23\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510\nyou are moving into the NET+, but\n\n24\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.010\nit is something we need to\nworry here in NET+ as well.\n\n25\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.810\nSo we gonna talk about those very topics.\n\n26\n00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.850\nWe'll talk about, the installation and\nthe applying of patches, and\n\n27\n00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.730\nwhy it really important to maintain\nconsistency with this, and I will tell\n\n28\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.770\nyou one thing that they really dont\ncall out is a patch management system.\n\n29\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.170\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nI'll start right there because really,\n\n30\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.350\nif you're doing this in some kind of\ncorporate environment guys you really\n\n31\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.060\nhave to understand that you're not going\nto be just grabbing a network device and\n\n32\n00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.280\nsaying hey I'm gonna apply an update.\n\n33\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.010\nOr going over to your Apache Server\nthat's running your website and\n\n34\n00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.590\nsay you know what,\nthere's quite a few updates.\n\n35\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.890\nI've seen them, I've read about them, and\n\n36\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.300\nthen you're going to go\napply them to your machines.\n\n37\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.280\nWe have a little more, a little bit\nbetter method to the madness when it\n\n38\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.440\ncomes to applying patches, and that's\nthrough a patch management system, and\n\n39\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.030\na patch management system, for instance,\nand Dan and I were talking about before\n\n40\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.180\nwe started this episode about Windows\npatch management system, WSUS, right.\n\n41\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.940\nWindows Server Update Service,\nif I could remember that acronym right.\n\n42\n00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.760\nBut even that, that's the system\nthat allows us to do it but\n\n43\n00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760\nwe do have to have some checks and\nbalances, cuz remember when it comes to\n\n44\n00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.420\napplying patches to your systems\nyou wanna maintain system up time.\n\n45\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.350\nCuz we say, hey,\n\n46\n00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.780\napply patches to your system to keep\nthe security vulnerabilities at bay,\n\n47\n00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.640\nto deploy new functionality when\nit's things like firmware and stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.400\nBut if you don't apply them appropriate\nand document what you're doing,\n\n49\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.330\nyou can actually be doing yourself\na little bit more harm than good.\n\n50\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.040\nIf you happen to apply a patch that\nbrings the whole system down and\n\n51\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.350\nGod forbid it's a network or\na production based system, and\n\n52\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.130\nit brings a good portion\nof your network down.\n\n53\n00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.870\nSo it's certainly something that\nyou wanna employ or implement, and\n\n54\n00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.760\nthat's a good patch management system, and\n\n55\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.590\nit includes some kind of,\nit could be some kind of advisory panel.\n\n56\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.760\nIt might not go under change management\nthat has an official CAB, right,\n\n57\n00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.790\na change advisory board.\n\n58\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.090\nBut you're gonna have some kind of\nprobably upper-level technicians that\n\n59\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.270\nknow the systems very well,\nand the ins and\n\n60\n00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.630\nouts, and they've researched these patches\nbefore they apply them to the systems.\n\n61\n00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.970\nWe typically, if you are going to\nbe applying any kind of patch,\n\n62\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.270\nremember document your information,\nremember backups are key.\n\n63\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.170\nTaking backups of your system,\nconfiguration backups, and\n\n64\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.150\nthen applying the patches, and you might\neven want to do this where, if you can,\n\n65\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.510\ndo it into a test environment so you\ndon't bring down your production network.\n\n66\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.740\nSo that being said let's go ahead and\nwe'll tackle the first one.\n\n67\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.260\nThey talk about firm ware updates.\n\n68\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.200\nNow firmware, if you aren't\nfamiliar with what firmware is,\n\n69\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.940\nkind of a step back to A+,\nremember your firmware is really what\n\n70\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.160\ntells our hardware what to\ndo at boot time, right.\n\n71\n00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.880\nIt is that kinda like that abstract\nlayer between the hardware and whatever\n\n72\n00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.240\noperating system's running on the device\nthat really gets our hardware up and\n\n73\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.480\nrunning and stabilized for\nthe operating system to take over.\n\n74\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.520\nKeep in mind that it is important to keep\nyour firmware on the latest firmware\n\n75\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.630\nedition for whatever the device\nit is that you're supporting,\n\n76\n00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.730\nbecause of the fact that it closes off.\n\n77\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.730\nA lot of times it closes off things like\nsecurity vulnerabilities that could lead\n\n78\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.740\nto some kind of exploit of the system,\nand it could improve functionality flaws,\n\n79\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.360\nmaybe bugs if you will, bug fixes as\nwell as even extending functionality.\n\n80\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.730\nI know even from a basic stand point I\nupgraded one of the home routers of my\n\n81\n00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.270\nnetwork and for whatever reason Dan,\nprior didn't support FTP.\n\n82\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.090\nAll of a sudden I got an FTP server\nafter I did a firmware update.\n\n83\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.540\nSo it was like here's your\nbrand new firmware update and\n\n84\n00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.778\nyour added functionality.\n\n85\n00:04:14.778 --> 00:04:17.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always the cool part of\ngetting firmware updates and typically why\n\n86\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.200\nyou want to stay on top of those things,\nbecause as functionality increases for\n\n87\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.500\nthe devices that you have, it's basically\nlike, it can be like sometimes,\n\n88\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.300\nlike buying a new piece of equipment,\nand as long as the equipment's physical\n\n89\n00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.810\ncomponents are still quality that's really\nnice for you cause it's a double bonus.\n\n90\n00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.540\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n91\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.140\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntalk about that process,\n\n92\n00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.810\nwhile we're talking about something\nlike maybe your home routers,\n\n93\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.060\nyour devices understand that we're gonna\nshow an older Linksys device here.\n\n94\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.740\nKeep in mind for the most part it's\ngonna follow the same parameters.\n\n95\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.770\nIt's gonna follow the same few steps.\n\n96\n00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.890\nSo you just might have to make\nslight modifications when you do\n\n97\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.080\na firmware update.\n\n98\n00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.780\nSo, if we could let's go ahead and\nwe'll look at my system here,\n\n99\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.980\nI've actually logged into the web\ninterface of a little Linksys router here,\n\n100\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.140\nit's under the podium here, and\nthe first thing that I'm gonna wanna do\n\n101\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.850\nis I'm gonna want to check\nthe current firmware.\n\n102\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.380\nNow, this is an older system here and\nearlier it was on 1.0.0.3 and\n\n103\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.100\nI've actually gone ahead and\n\n104\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.160\ndone the firmware update on it,\nand one of the things\n\n105\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.322\nthat's kinda interesting is I can't\nroll back the firmware updates on these.\n\n106\n00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:23.440\nSee Linksys use to keep\nold archive firmware so\n\n107\n00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.120\nthat if you wanted to reinstall\noriginal firmware for whatever reason,\n\n108\n00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.980\nsomething went wrong, you could do that.\n\n109\n00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.650\nYou could do what's known as a downgrade.\n\n110\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.330\nMaybe I upgrade a firmware version, and\n\n111\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.990\nsomething goes wrong or doesn't give\nme the functionality that I want.\n\n112\n00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.450\nWell, I can always go back a firmware and\ndo what's known as a downgrade too.\n\n113\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.600\nSo the good thing is, it doesn't matter\nwhat firmware edition you are on\n\n114\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.060\non this device,\nthe steps are still gonna be the same.\n\n115\n00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.210\nSo in this one, what you do if you do\na firmware update is you're gonna go\n\n116\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.300\nto administration here at the top.\n\n117\n00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.470\n&gt;&gt; And this is peculiar for\nwhatever device you're using, right?\n\n118\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.690\n&gt;&gt; It really is and, in fact,\n\n119\n00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.640\nlet me go a step farther and\nkind of build off of what Dan's question.\n\n120\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.570\nYou would actually want to go to\nsomething like this, for instance,\n\n121\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.890\nI'm on Linksys website produce support\nsite here, and they talk about upgrading\n\n122\n00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.370\nthe Linksys firmware using the classic\nweb interface setup and everything.\n\n123\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.390\nSo if you need to get information, and\n\n124\n00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.330\nthey show you here what your driver,\nthe current version of your driver.\n\n125\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.560\nSo this is pretty common to Linksys, but\n\n126\n00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.720\nthe most part it would be not too much\ndifference across your other devices.\n\n127\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.120\nJust make sure you go to the\nmanufacturer's website, and then follow\n\n128\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.320\ntheir recommendations on how they want\nyou to implement an update like this.\n\n129\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.350\nThey might have a series of steps\nthat you have to go through.\n\n130\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.230\nWhether it is updating the firmware and\nthen doing a factory reset and\n\n131\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.150\nthen restoring from configuration\nbackup might be the process.\n\n132\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.330\nIn here it's really simple,\nit's download the firmware,\n\n133\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.630\nyou upload the file, and you wait for\nthing to reboot, and we'll see that here.\n\n134\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.920\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\n\n135\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.630\nin the upper right-hand corner here,\nyou'll see there's a firmware upgrade.\n\n136\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.080\nNow I've gone ahead and\nI've already uploaded the file before, or\n\n137\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.500\ndownloaded the file, I should say,\nso that we can implement it here.\n\n138\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.330\nI'm going to go ahead and choose the file.\n\n139\n00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:20.940\nAlright, now this is a BIN file here that\nwe're gonna use and you can see kind of\n\n140\n00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.030\nin the naming convention, again the naming\nconvention's gonna be unique to whatever\n\n141\n00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.540\nthe device is that you had,\nkind of like the question Dan asked.\n\n142\n00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.660\nNotice it says FW here, it's a little\ncode word for them for firmware.\n\n143\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.957\nI can see E2000,\nI can see the version of the firmware.\n\n144\n00:07:35.957 --> 00:07:43.479\nNot 1.0, or excuse me yeah, 1.0.06.00,\n\n145\n00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.968\nthis is 1.0.06.001.\n\n146\n00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:51.088\nBoy, get all that in there, and\nI can see that this is the US and\n\n147\n00:07:51.088 --> 00:07:54.512\nKeep in mind that language,\nobviously the language interface that\n\n148\n00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:58.176\nyou're dealing with, with the web\npage here that we're working with,\n\n149\n00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:01.899\nis gonna have to be whatever is regional\nor local to your language as well,\n\n150\n00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.480\nif you're in other locations,\nother than here in the United States.\n\n151\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.620\nAll right, and\nI can also see the date here as well.\n\n152\n00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.380\nNow again that file format is just\nunique to this firmware package,\n\n153\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.630\nit could be different on your device and\nmost likely is going to be.\n\n154\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.680\nAnd we're gonna choose open here,\nall right?\n\n155\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.650\nNow, the next I'll tell you is that\nwhen it comes to a firmware update,\n\n156\n00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.700\nyou don't want a risk if you Losing power.\n\n157\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.350\nYou don't want the risk of any kind\nof interruption on a firmware update.\n\n158\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.260\nIt's not really advisable to do a firmware\n\n159\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.790\nupdate in the middle of a lightning storm,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:43.750\nWe can lose power, anything that'll\ncause a kernel power failure could\n\n161\n00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.220\npermanently brick the device.\n\n162\n00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.540\nThat bricking of the device just\nis A little jargon there for\n\n163\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.865\njust basically meaning now you've\ngot a pretty fancy paper weight.\n\n164\n00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:53.970\n[LAUGH] And\nit's not gonna do anything more than that.\n\n165\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.660\nSo, be very careful when you implement\nthese, I remember one tech telling\n\n166\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.690\nme that he tried to do a firmware update\nin the middle of a lightning storm and\n\n167\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.350\nlearned very, very early in his career\nthat he should never do that again.\n\n168\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.680\nSo, if there's a risk of losing power,\nyou shouldn't be starting the upgrade.\n\n169\n00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.230\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll start the upgrade process.\n\n170\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.670\nAnd it'll take a second here and you\nnotice that it lets you know, it says hey,\n\n171\n00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.850\nthis shouldn't be interrupted.\n\n172\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.150\nAll right, and it talks about it\nmay take a few minutes to finish.\n\n173\n00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.920\nNow, on of the things\nthat you also wanna do,\n\n174\n00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.570\nis run a configuration backup prior\nto doing your firmware update.\n\n175\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.240\nOne of the other files that was in\nthat list that I have is actually\n\n176\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.550\na configuration backup.\n\n177\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.330\nAgain that's important for\na couple of reasons.\n\n178\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.280\nIt's one, what happens if you\nyou do your firmware upgrade and\n\n179\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.620\nthen when your router reboots, or\nthe device that you're doing the firmware\n\n180\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.200\nupdate reboots, and\nall of your configurations are lost?\n\n181\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.460\nNow, for a lot of us, at home networks,\nDan I'm not sure about you, but I know.\n\n182\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.250\nFor a lot of us in home\nnetworks its not too bad.\n\n183\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.610\nIt's gonna be a pain for\nme because I've got about five or\n\n184\n00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.200\nsix poor forwarding rules\nthat I need to reassign.\n\n185\n00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.420\nBut if you're talking about\na massive device that has ACL's and\n\n186\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.180\nI know you've been around\nthings like IP tables and\n\n187\n00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.380\ncan talk about some nightmares with\nACL's and having to rebuild them.\n\n188\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.250\nYou might have 100 access\ncontrol list rules, and\n\n189\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.090\nyou might not have been on\nthe ones that set them.\n\n190\n00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.550\nBut it might be your job to put it\nback the way they were prior to doing\n\n191\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.450\nthe upgrade.\n\n192\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.555\nSo that's why it's a good thing to\nhave your configuration Backup file\n\n193\n00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:31.325\nready to go.\n\n194\n00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:36.315\nJust in case if you do the upgrade and\nit happens to blank slate your settings.\n\n195\n00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:39.015\nThat's okay, just grab your\nconfiguration file and you restore it,\n\n196\n00:10:39.015 --> 00:10:42.285\nit applies all those settings\nback to your device here.\n\n197\n00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:45.695\nNow, whether this device here is\none of those that's gonna do that,\n\n198\n00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:47.065\nwe'll just have to wait until.\n\n199\n00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:49.345\nIt looks like our upgrade\nhas been successful.\n\n200\n00:10:49.345 --> 00:10:53.760\nNow kind of looking at the lights here,\nnow that's another thing to keep in mind,\n\n201\n00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.290\nis that your device is most\nlikely going to reboot right.\n\n202\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:02.570\nNow when it reboots be careful because it\nmight have to reboot a couple of times.\n\n203\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.210\nBut what you should see is after one or\ntwo reboots it should start to get status\n\n204\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.790\nlight indicators, link status light\nindicators on your device and\n\n205\n00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.350\nyou should be able to turn around, and\nconnect right back to the web interface.\n\n206\n00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.165\nSo for me,\nit should be just as simple as patience.\n\n207\n00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:24.447\n[LAUGH] All right, and we'll go ahead and\nlet's get logged back in here.\n\n208\n00:11:26.922 --> 00:11:30.572\nI have seen where on this web interface\nit caches the credentials and\n\n209\n00:11:30.572 --> 00:11:32.760\nthen it doesn't like to let you back in.\n\n210\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.410\nSo I might have to [LAUGH], there we go.\n\n211\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.620\nAll right, so now we're logged back in.\n\n212\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.200\nAll right,\neverything looks good here so far.\n\n213\n00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.590\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nlook at Application &amp; Gaming here.\n\n214\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.470\nNow the good thing about this\nright here is that you'll notice\n\n215\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.640\nThat all of my Port Forwarding rules,\nthey've stayed behind.\n\n216\n00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.720\nAll right.\nAnd that's a good thing,\n\n217\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.060\nbut let's say we're gonna live\na little dangerously here.\n\n218\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.800\nAll right I didn't show you how to\nback up the configuration here.\n\n219\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.520\nLet me go and show you how to do that.\n\n220\n00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.860\nI've already got a backup file, but\nit is good to just kind of know.\n\n221\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.530\nNotice it was that quick,\njust a quick little file here.\n\n222\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.376\n&gt;&gt; This is just like a text file or\nsomething.\n\n223\n00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:16.340\n&gt;&gt; It really is, it's a CFG file and\nthat's all it's doing.\n\n224\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.330\nIt's probably some XML format for\nall I know,\n\n225\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.470\na lot of configurations seem to be in XML,\nat least in Windows.\n\n226\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.670\nAnd we'll go ahead,\nwe'll do a restore factory defaults here,\n\n227\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.090\nand we'll give it a second here.\n\n228\n00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.126\nAll right, and it's gonna say your\nconfiguration changes have been, set,\n\n229\n00:12:33.126 --> 00:12:34.490\nplease click Continue.\n\n230\n00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.990\nAnd we'll give it a second,\nand what we wanna see is that,\n\n231\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.530\ndid the back up of the configuration file,\ndid it really work for us?\n\n232\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.930\nIs it going to allow us\nto take a clean slate.\n\n233\n00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:52.890\nThis Linksys device that doesn't have\na single bit of configuration now\n\n234\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.230\nhopefully done to it, and\napply the configuration file and\n\n235\n00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.360\nbring back those port\nforwarding rules here.\n\n236\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.570\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n237\n00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:06.630\nAnd it looks like it has applied\nour factory defaults here.\n\n238\n00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.820\nLet's see if we can, get back in\nfact it's telling me right away,\n\n239\n00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.610\nit says I notice that this isn't secure.\n\n240\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.370\nIt's letting me know right away that hey\nsomething's wrong here and that tells me\n\n241\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.640\nthat it's set to the defaults here,\nwe go to application and gaming.\n\n242\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.420\nDan does it look like I have\nany port forwarding rules left?\n\n243\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.423\n&gt;&gt; There is at least zero.\n\n244\n00:13:25.423 --> 00:13:29.820\n&gt;&gt; Zero that's right we're\ntopping it off at zero here.\n\n245\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.820\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's see what the backup configuration,\n\n246\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.650\nour configuration backup.\n\n247\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.180\nIf we restore those configurations,\nwe choose the file.\n\n248\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.120\nWe'll go ahead and\nmake sure we don't use the firmware file,\n\n249\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.590\nthat'd be the wrong file, right?\n\n250\n00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.170\nAnd we go ahead and we start to restore.\n\n251\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.320\nNow again, it's taking that file,\nand it's looking at the settings.\n\n252\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.690\nAnd then it's going to\nimport those settings.\n\n253\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.990\nHopefully what we're gonna see are all\nthose port forwarding rules come back.\n\n254\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.430\nNow if we don't there is a chance that\nwhen I save that configuration file that\n\n255\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.290\nthe configuration file itself,\nthe config file,\n\n256\n00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:07.230\nit's a little CFG file,\nthat it has problem, right?\n\n257\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.050\nIt's corrupted of some sort so\nthat's why it, you know,\n\n258\n00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.050\none of the things that when it comes\nconfiguration files might not be too bad\n\n259\n00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.990\nof an idea to do is maybe run\nlike a little hashing algorithm.\n\n260\n00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.712\nSo just so you can keep track and\nmake sure that they stay that\n\n261\n00:14:21.712 --> 00:14:25.940\nthey stay, maintain their integrity,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.260\nSo, again, I think what we're\ngonna do here real quick is,\n\n263\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.410\nwe will use the magic of TV to\nlet this one restore itself.\n\n264\n00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.060\nAnd we'll come back, and we'll see if\nthe configuration back-up restored our\n\n265\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.880\nport forwarding rules appropriately.\n\n266\n00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.190\nNow that didn't take too long but\nwe're back now so we'll go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.790\nwe'll get logged back in.\n\n268\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.900\nI will tell you that as some of\nyou might see that I am logging in\n\n269\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.560\nwith the default username and\npassword cuz we did the factory reset, so\n\n270\n00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.180\nI do have to go back in here and\nmake some minor changes.\n\n271\n00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.020\nI know some of you guys out there that\nknow how to configure your home routers\n\n272\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.370\nare saying hey,\nyou're logging in with admin,\n\n273\n00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.900\nadmin, well let me find your network and\nI'll log in too.\n\n274\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.470\nSo, we do still have to change\nthe security functionality but\n\n275\n00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.640\nfor the most part, what I'm looking\nat are the application and gaming.\n\n276\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.680\nAnd if we see, Dan it does kind of look\nlike we're back up and running, right?\n\n277\n00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.880\nThat configuration file.\n\n278\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.291\n&gt;&gt; Definitely more than\nzero configurations.\n\n279\n00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.950\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, and\nthat's what we want.\n\n280\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.450\nBetter than zero, not quite the best but\nbetter than nothing.\n\n281\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.080\nSo it did what we wanted it to do, right,\n\n282\n00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.980\nthe configuration file, it worked for\nus, we've got the back up.\n\n283\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.040\nNow if for\nsome reason that this firmware update\n\n284\n00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.920\ndidn't do me the justice\nthat I wanted it to do.\n\n285\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.780\nIf I have the older firmware file,\nI could do a downgrade.\n\n286\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.694\nI can apply that and\nbasically go back A firmware addition.\n\n287\n00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:48.990\nAgain, for the most part,\nnot a lot of reason to do that,\n\n288\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.328\ndoesn't mean it won't happen though,\n\n289\n00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:56.436\nbecause there are some times when upgrades\nDon't really upgrade for whatever reason.\n\n290\n00:15:56.436 --> 00:16:03.800\nDo not, do as I say not as I do and lose\naccess to your earlier firmware platform.\n\n291\n00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.730\nIt is a good idea that if you buy\none of these devices, go ahead and\n\n292\n00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.950\ndownload the firmware, and\n\n293\n00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.775\nsave the file cuz you just never\nknow if you're gonna need it again.\n\n294\n00:16:13.025 --> 00:16:15.255\nAll right, so that's our firmware updates.\n\n295\n00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:18.865\nThe next thing that we gotta\nlook at are driver updates.\n\n296\n00:16:18.865 --> 00:16:20.725\nAnd when we talk about driver updates,\n\n297\n00:16:20.725 --> 00:16:23.385\na lot times what we're talking\nabout is our operating system.\n\n298\n00:16:23.385 --> 00:16:27.660\nAnd I got a Windows machine screen\nover here, and I've actually got our\n\n299\n00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.100\nupdates kinda set up here, but we wanna\ntalk about the driver updates beforehand.\n\n300\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.920\nSee driver updates, you know when we\ntalk about drivers in general, here on\n\n301\n00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.650\nWindows we typically manage this through\na component known as device manager.\n\n302\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.190\nHow do you manage the drivers on your\nsystems really is contingent on well,\n\n303\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.330\nwhat system do you have?\n\n304\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.750\nSo, for instance,\nhere if I need to do driver updates,\n\n305\n00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.520\nI can come to Device Manager.\n\n306\n00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.140\nI can find the specific device that it is\nthat I need to do the driver update on.\n\n307\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.080\nLet's see, maybe, Keyboard,\nI have to do an update on,\n\n308\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.680\nI can always right click on it.\n\n309\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.990\nYou can see that it can update the driver\nsoftware as well as get some information\n\n310\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.770\nabout the driver.\n\n311\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.390\nNow I will say just like firmware,\nwe need to be aware\n\n312\n00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.160\nof what the version number is because\nwhen you're gonna do a driver update,\n\n313\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.680\nyou need to know does\nthe driver even need an update.\n\n314\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.484\nWell, how do I find that information out?\n\n315\n00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:23.930\nWell you can find that out just by\nif you're in device manager here,\n\n316\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.650\njust right click on the device and\nchoose properties.\n\n317\n00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.870\nAnd then from the properties dialog box,\nyou can go to the driver tab and\n\n318\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.460\nyou can just choose\nthe driver version here, and\n\n319\n00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.259\nthat will tell you whether you're\nrunning the current version or not.\n\n320\n00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.260\nBy correlating that with,\n\n321\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.450\nor cross referencing that with\nthe manufacturer's web site.\n\n322\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.970\nSo that is important.\n\n323\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:48.320\nIf you wanna do a more automated approach,\nwhere you don't wanna do individual\n\n324\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.250\ndrivers you can always,\nmy heads kinda covering up but\n\n325\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.680\nin Windows 10 here, you got this\nlittle Action Center icon here.\n\n326\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.239\nAnd I can bring up the Action Center and\ngo to All Settings.\n\n327\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.340\nThen in all settings,\nI can go to updates and\n\n328\n00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.590\nsecurity, and\nyou can see Windows Update here as well.\n\n329\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.450\nAnd I can also look at things like,\nfor instance, the versioning.\n\n330\n00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.320\nBecause in Windows, there are times.\n\n331\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.760\nThis is kind of interesting,\nit's a newer thing in Windows.\n\n332\n00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.646\nIt used to be that what you would do\nIs if you have different versions of\n\n333\n00:18:17.646 --> 00:18:21.934\nan operating system, usually what they\nwould do is they would go through one\n\n334\n00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:25.965\nmajor operating system change,\nlike say Windows Vista to Windows 7.\n\n335\n00:18:25.965 --> 00:18:28.605\nAnd then it would go through\nlike these Half Life builds,\n\n336\n00:18:28.605 --> 00:18:31.850\ndepending on the longevity,\nthe life span of the operating system and\n\n337\n00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.500\nyou would get things like service packs.\n\n338\n00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.590\nAnd service packs are a little\nbit more then updates, right.\n\n339\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.860\nService packs mean I didn't quite\nneed a new operating system,\n\n340\n00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.350\nbut it was a little bit more then\njust what we have in a basic update.\n\n341\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.210\nSo those could be like for\ninstance like minor revisions.\n\n342\n00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.390\nI know in Lennox they\nhave major builds and\n\n343\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.450\nminor builds that come out\nevery six months or so.\n\n344\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.230\nAnd if you need to find out information\nabout any of the updates that you're going\n\n345\n00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.730\nto do like for instance here in Windows.\n\n346\n00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:05.700\nI can pick anyone of this out and I could\nread that information here as well.\n\n347\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.700\nThat's one way that you could\ndo this here in Windows.\n\n348\n00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.670\nthere are other ways you can update your\ndrivers and other operating systems,\n\n349\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.260\nlike for instance if you're like, I've got\na CentOS machine somewhere around here.\n\n350\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.590\nAnd if you wanna do\nan update here in CentOS,\n\n351\n00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:25.050\nyou can do it with the yum command.\n\n352\n00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:30.540\nWe can do yum and then update.\n\n353\n00:19:32.376 --> 00:19:35.619\nAnd what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nreach out to those repositories and\n\n354\n00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:38.720\nit's gonna grab the information and\nit's gonna update the system.\n\n355\n00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.400\nNow one of the things that Dan and I were\ntalking about I kinda liked I wish Windows\n\n356\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.780\nwould do it this way because, when you\nupdate your Linux machines Like this,\n\n357\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.040\nwhat ends up happening is you end\nup basically updating everything.\n\n358\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.290\nWhen you update a Windows machine, a lot\nof times what you end up having to do is\n\n359\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:00.840\nyou have to update the operating system.\n\n360\n00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.090\nYou have to update, what else,\nthe software individually.\n\n361\n00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.480\nSo it's a very, very I don't know,\nit's a disjointed process.\n\n362\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.720\nHere in the Linux operating system,\nit's nice,\n\n363\n00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.700\nbecause they have commands that not only\nallow you to, all through one, update.\n\n364\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.770\nAllow you to update your drivers,\nyour operating systems,\n\n365\n00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.940\nsoftware packages, if you will.\n\n366\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.310\nAnd it's just a really nice functionality\nnow this isn't something unique to Lynx or\n\n367\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.780\nWindows when it comes to updating all your\noperating systems are going to update.\n\n368\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.670\nJust depends on how it happens, like for\ninstance our Max that we are running here.\n\n369\n00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.740\nWe go to the app store\nwhen an update comes out.\n\n370\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.580\nThat's where we end up handling them.\n\n371\n00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.770\nInside some Mac world so\n\n372\n00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.290\nyou can see that you can apply\ndifferent updates to your systems.\n\n373\n00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.280\nAnd it's just gonna be\na different process.\n\n374\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.360\nHowever, underneath,\nwhen we think about it conceptually wise,\n\n375\n00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.380\nit's really the same thing.\n\n376\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.120\nIt's just applying those\npatches to the systems.\n\n377\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.910\nSo, let's see here,\nmajor and minor updates.\n\n378\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.120\nYep, Linux, again,\nis one of those ones that does major and\n\n379\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.890\nminor builds if you will.\n\n380\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.370\nWindows just started this with different\nversioning of their operating systems.\n\n381\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.820\nIn fact, I can kinda show you that here\nif you go to up to Microsoft's website,\n\n382\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.640\nif you type in their search engine or\nsearch field here.\n\n383\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.490\nWindows 10 release information,\nyou'll start to see that we have\n\n384\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.000\ndifferent versions and different versions\noffer different features as well, and\n\n385\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.249\nthat's something to keep in mind.\n\n386\n00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.275\nFor instance, this 1607,\nthat is the version number,\n\n387\n00:21:30.275 --> 00:21:34.260\nyhat's commonly called the anniversary\nupdate, and there were a lot of additional\n\n388\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:40.740\nfeatures that were brought into Windows\nwhen you went from 1511 to 1607.\n\n389\n00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.460\nYou can also see tha the OS\nbuilds are different.\n\n390\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.480\nAnd if I need to find that information\nI can find the information inside of\n\n391\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.790\na Windows machine relatively easy by\njust dropping down to a command prompt.\n\n392\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:03.360\nAnd typing ver and that will show me what\nthe internal version number is as well.\n\n393\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.220\nAll right, if you need to find\nout what features are available.\n\n394\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.000\nWhat is it that these offer for\n\n395\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.608\ninstance I can find out what the knowledge\nbased references are on these.\n\n396\n00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:15.760\nSo, maybe I'm not sure exactly\nwhat these different builds and\n\n397\n00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.440\nversion numbers actually\ngive me as far as features.\n\n398\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.110\nWell, one of the great things is they give\n\n399\n00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.712\nyou things like your knowledge-based\narticles so I can go out and I can read.\n\n400\n00:22:24.712 --> 00:22:28.790\nAll right, well what is this feature, what\nis it doing for me, what is it giving me?\n\n401\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.810\nThat maybe I need to know well here is\nall the information right you can see\n\n402\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.880\nwe talked about improve features\nright app-V they talk about finger\n\n403\n00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.860\nprint authentication so adds more\nsecurity as well so do keep that in mind.\n\n404\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.360\nIf you have any like questions,\n\n405\n00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.460\nif you don't know what these\ninternal versioning numbers are.\n\n406\n00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.630\nAgain, you don't have to have\neverything committed to memory,\n\n407\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.770\nuse your search engine,\ngo to the manufacturer's website.\n\n408\n00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.570\nAgain, one of the last things I'll say\nthough, when it comes to updating your\n\n409\n00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:04.090\nsystems just remember that when it comes\nto patching your system, do your patches.\n\n410\n00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.370\nRemember the security vulnerabilities can\nhelp harden the system if you patch them.\n\n411\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.240\nIf you don't patch them, those security\nvulnerabilities never go away.\n\n412\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.710\nSo the other thing is, too,\nremember configuration backups.\n\n413\n00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.000\nRemember that if you're on a server or\nsome kind of operating system where you\n\n414\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.600\ncould apply a regular full backup,\ndo a full backup.\n\n415\n00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.570\nSome then if things go wrong,\nif you apply an update,\n\n416\n00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.050\nif you apply a firmware update or a patch\nto a system and something goes wrong.\n\n417\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.230\nWell worse case scenario you have\nto reinstall the operating system,\n\n418\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.910\nstart over.\n\n419\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.387\nBut then you can back up, you can restore,\nstore from the backup and\n\n420\n00:23:37.387 --> 00:23:39.587\nyou're at least maybe a few steps behind.\n\n421\n00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:43.893\nBut at least you don't have to start over\nfrom scratch because, it's a lot better to\n\n422\n00:23:43.893 --> 00:23:48.018\nhave those backups on hand to be able to\nrestore your machines prior to the patch,\n\n423\n00:23:48.018 --> 00:23:51.009\nthen start over than the do the update,\neverything fail.\n\n424\n00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:52.532\nAnd now you're starting from scratch and\n\n425\n00:23:52.532 --> 00:23:54.371\nyou could potentially lose\na lot of information.\n\n426\n00:23:54.371 --> 00:23:57.410\nWes, does all this security updating and\npatching and\n\n427\n00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.331\nthings of that nature,\nmaybe even drivers as well.\n\n428\n00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:04.350\nOr we've talked about\nmaybe a Linksys router,\n\n429\n00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.510\naccess point, then we kind of\njumped into operating systems.\n\n430\n00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.530\nWhat about things like Cisco equipment?\n\n431\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.850\nThey're a big company,\nthey're large enterprise level equipment,\n\n432\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.970\ndo we have to apply this to\nthat kind of thing as well?\n\n433\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, I would.\n\n434\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.890\nAnd I would follow whatever Cisco's\nrecommendation is for them too.\n\n435\n00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.760\nBecause again, with those bigger\nnetworking devices like that,\n\n436\n00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.950\nagain, their steps are gonna be whatever\nit is specific to that manufacturer.\n\n437\n00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.430\nAnd they'll probably have some kind\nof manufacturer's recommendation\n\n438\n00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.397\non how you wanna back those devices up,\ndo the firmware,\n\n439\n00:24:35.397 --> 00:24:39.018\ndo you wanna do firm updates\nduring business hours.\n\n440\n00:24:39.018 --> 00:24:43.080\nDo you wanna do it during off hours,\npeak hours versus off hours.\n\n441\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.580\nI would always follow their documentation.\n\n442\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.740\nGoes with things like Juniper if\nyour on a Juniper device as well.\n\n443\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.840\nAnd again, just remember, planning,\nplanning, planning, testing and\n\n444\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.040\ndocumentation.\n\n445\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.380\nAnd then backups as well can\n\n446\n00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.880\ndefinitely save you a lot of\nheadache in the long run.\n\n447\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.589\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nWell, if patching and\n\n448\n00:25:01.589 --> 00:25:06.295\nupdating sounds like a large scale job,\nwell, you're absolutely right, cuz it is.\n\n449\n00:25:06.295 --> 00:25:08.360\nIt's huge.\n\n450\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.720\nIt's part of a network technician\nwe're going to be dealing with.\n\n451\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.885\nNetwork nodes,\nthings like desktops and laptops,\n\n452\n00:25:14.885 --> 00:25:19.860\nPDAs, smartphones I guess is what\nthey are nowadays, no more PDAs.\n\n453\n00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.730\nAnd they all need updating and\nthen of course,\n\n454\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.120\nall of our network equipment is going to\nrequire some sort of updating as well.\n\n455\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.980\nSo you've got to get\nyourself on a good schedule,\n\n456\n00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.240\nfigure out what that is like Wes talked\nabout peak hours versus off hours.\n\n457\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.270\nThis is almost invariably going to\nbe happening during off hours stuff.\n\n458\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.500\nJust because if you reboot\nsomebody's machine,\n\n459\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.570\nwhich typically these things take\nduring the actual operating hours.\n\n460\n00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.150\nThey might get a little upset.\n\n461\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.250\nAnd if you can say you've\ndone that accidentally and\n\n462\n00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.250\nangered a bunch of people,\nraise your hand.\n\n463\n00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.320\nHey, there we go, right there.\n\n464\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:48.850\nYeah, I've done that.\n\n465\n00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:52.280\nDon't do that, it gets people mad\nat you and you don't want that.\n\n466\n00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.000\nWes, thanks so much for explaining that,\nwe do need to take our patch management\n\n467\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.340\nvery seriously is something\nwe need to write down.\n\n468\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.410\nFigure out a good procedure for and\nthen follow that thing to a tee.\n\n469\n00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.380\nAnd make sure that we're revising\nthat as we go through things.\n\n470\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.480\nJust to make sure that we are working\nwell within operational parameters and\n\n471\n00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.540\nat the most efficiency as well.\n\n472\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.810\nWes, thanks for stopping by today.\n\n473\n00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.660\nWe

everyone, welcome to ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:15.055\nThank you for joining us.\n\n8\n00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:16.404\nI'm your show host, Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:18.330\nAnd we got a great show for you today.\n\n10\n00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140\nThat's right, we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA's Net+.\n\n11\n00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160\nAnd joining us in the studio is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.520\nRonnie, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.690\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.780\nThanks for having me back in the studio\nas we take a look at this topic that\n\n15\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.090\nwe are jumping into.\n\n16\n00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.330\nWhich, of course, is about switching.\n\n17\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.730\nSo when we start taking a look\nat this idea of switching,\n\n18\n00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.810\nwe have to begin with some basics.\n\n19\n00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.979\nSo it might have been a little bit of time\nsince you saw anything about a switch.\n\n20\n00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.431\nSo that's where we're gonna start off is\ntalking about the basic functionality of\n\n21\n00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:50.380\na switch.\n\n22\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.090\nSo Wes,\n\n23\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.450\ndo you possibly remember just the very\nbasic functionality of what a switch does?\n\n24\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.950\n&gt;&gt; The first one I think about is\nforwarding traffic between our nodes.\n\n25\n00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.114\nThat's one that comes to the mind.\n\n26\n00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:06.256\nBut it's not the only thing that a switch\ncan do, not just forwarding, right?\n\n27\n00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:08.576\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\nwhen you started taking a look at it,\n\n28\n00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:11.030\nremember that a switch\nreally does three things.\n\n29\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.960\nIt forwards data from one port to another.\n\n30\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.550\nOr it floods data out of\nevery other port except for\n\n31\n00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.360\nthe one it came in on, or it filters data.\n\n32\n00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.466\nLet me show you what I'm talking\nabout right here on my screen.\n\n33\n00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.082\nAs this way,\n\n34\n00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.330\nwe'll get into what we need to do when we\nstart talking about configuring switches.\n\n35\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.551\nWhich is something a little bit different.\n\n36\n00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.979\nSo just as a reminder.\n\n37\n00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.905\nRemember that at the very beginning,\n\n38\n00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:34.940\nwhenever you actually do\nhave a switch on hand here.\n\n39\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.516\nSo we'll just take this switch here.\n\n40\n00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:40.510\nAnd I've got four different\nports that I am connected to.\n\n41\n00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.530\nWhen you plug devices in that have MAC\naddresses, this switch, as soon as one\n\n42\n00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.454\nof these devices start sending data in, it\nputs it into a MAC address table for us.\n\n43\n00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:53.820\nIt says, hey, on port number 1,\nI see what your MAC address is.\n\n44\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.760\nAnd it stores it for us and\nallows us to be able to see that.\n\n45\n00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.830\nAnd then every other device that's plugged\ninto the switch will do the same thing.\n\n46\n00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.990\nThe more the devices that\nare plugged into these ports,\n\n47\n00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.200\nthe more that this table\nis gonna end up populating.\n\n48\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.970\nSo, for example, on this one, which is\nessentially a five port hub in reality.\n\n49\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.120\nI have four of those ports\nwhich have devices plugged in.\n\n50\n00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.500\nAnd they have now communicated their\nMAC addresses into the switch.\n\n51\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.343\nWell, the reason why this is important\nis because now, if we take, for\n\n52\n00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:29.430\nan example, PC1 needs to send data to PC2.\n\n53\n00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730\nSo it goes in on this cable.\n\n54\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.990\nWell, what happens is that the switch\ntakes a look now at not only the source,\n\n55\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.860\nbut really now the destination.\n\n56\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.050\nAnd it says, hey,\nwhere is that MAC address lined up?\n\n57\n00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd then it takes a look\nat the MAC address itself.\n\n58\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.440\nAnd then it goes and examines the table.\n\n59\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280\nAnd it knows, hey,\nthat's actually right here.\n\n60\n00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.850\nAnd that is supposed to go out port 4.\n\n61\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.370\nIt's where it's supposed to go out.\n\n62\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.380\nSo then it now knows that to send it,\nit actually sends it out to port 4.\n\n63\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.007\nAnd notice that ports number 2 and 3,\n\n64\n00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:04.540\nwe don't get any traffic\nat all on those ports.\n\n65\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.180\nSo, on 2 and 3, we're not actually\ninterfering with anything.\n\n66\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.130\nSo that's the idea of forwarding.\n\n67\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.090\nWell, what is this idea of flooding?\n\n68\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.670\nIt can happen in two scenarios.\n\n69\n00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.470\nAnd remember,\nthis is just a brief reminder here.\n\n70\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.450\nPC1 can send out a broadcast.\n\n71\n00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.170\nSo if you actually remember\nthe idea of a broadcast here.\n\n72\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.321\nThis is when PC1 says,\nhey, I need to broadcast.\n\n73\n00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.600\nAnd a broadcast is not\nlimited by the switch.\n\n74\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.980\nSo that means that when data\ncomes in on port number 1,\n\n75\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.216\nit's gonna go out every\nother port at the same time.\n\n76\n00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.880\nBut it's not gonna come\nback on port number 1.\n\n77\n00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.590\nSo we can do that intentionally.\n\n78\n00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.110\nAnd inside of that table, listed in there\nis actually a static entry that gives us\n\n79\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.820\nthe actual broadcast MAC address of\nall Fs that's actually in there.\n\n80\n00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.240\nAnd goes, that's send to all Fs,\n\n81\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.640\nwhich means send it out every other\nport except for the one it came on.\n\n82\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.636\nIt can do that.\n\n83\n00:04:00.636 --> 00:04:03.964\nThe other condition that we may\nactually have a broadcast in.\n\n84\n00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:08.949\nAnd I'm not sure if Wes remembers\nthat this may happen here,\n\n85\n00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.347\nis what if PC1 one, though,\nsent information, but\n\n86\n00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:17.580\nit's not to any of these\nMAC addresses here?\n\n87\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.840\nWell, if it's not in any of\nthese MAC addresses, well,\n\n88\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.360\nwhat does the switch do with it?\n\n89\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.770\nThere's two possibilities here.\n\n90\n00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.956\nIt could just drop it.\n\n91\n00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:30.062\nBut the default behavior for\nwhat is called an unknown unicast.\n\n92\n00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:36.620\nIf it says, I'm sending it to one\nwith all Bs in the MAC address here.\n\n93\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.580\nAnd it goes, wait a minute.\n\n94\n00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.590\nNobody in the MAC address table,\nthe switch says, nobody has that.\n\n95\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.080\nWell, what does the switch do?\n\n96\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.556\nBy default, its behavior says, whoever's\nactually sending that information\n\n97\n00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:50.830\nprobably knows more than\nI do about the network.\n\n98\n00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.830\nSo let me do this.\n\n99\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.410\nJust in case that device hasn't\nsent me its MAC address yet.\n\n100\n00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.434\nLet me go ahead and\nalso flood it out every other port,\n\n101\n00:04:58.434 --> 00:05:01.269\nexcept for the one it came in on,\nand that's key.\n\n102\n00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.271\n&gt;&gt; And so Ronnie, it's like in good faith.\n\n103\n00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.489\nI don't know what you're talking about,\nthe switches say, but\n\n104\n00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:06.950\nyou must know what you're talking about.\n\n105\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.470\nSo in good faith,\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n106\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.590\nsend this out in the purposes\nof maybe hoping to discover it.\n\n107\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really the whole idea.\n\n108\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.990\nThe switch doesn't ever want to\nprevent a device from not getting it.\n\n109\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.870\nEven if it doesn't know about it.\n\n110\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.852\nSo you have two conditions in\nwhich the switch will flood.\n\n111\n00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:27.750\nWhich is broadcast, a true broadcast,\nor what we call an unknown unicast.\n\n112\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.372\nAnd then lastly, though,\nis what we call filtering.\n\n113\n00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:35.590\nNow, that is preventing data from\nactually leaving a single port.\n\n114\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.500\nSo let's say that PC1 sends it out.\n\n115\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.620\nBut it actually is destined for\na MAC address.\n\n116\n00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.838\nBut let's say that the other device is\nalso right here off of port number 1.\n\n117\n00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:47.460\nAnd you might be asking,\nwhen the heck would that happen?\n\n118\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.280\nWell, it's not supposed to.\n\n119\n00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.140\nBut every once in a while, you might\nfind a device which plugs into a hub.\n\n120\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.240\nAnd then you have, let's say,\nhere I'm trying to make an example.\n\n121\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.480\nLet's say that we have an imaginary\nPC3 that's plugged into the hub.\n\n122\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.687\nAnd that hub is plugged\ninto port number 1.\n\n123\n00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:07.010\nPC1 and PC3 are plugged into the hub.\n\n124\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.050\nWell, it still means that\nPC3 will get the data.\n\n125\n00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.620\nBecause it's on that same\nsegment of the network.\n\n126\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.240\nBut when it goes into the switch,\nremember that a switch will forward data\n\n127\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.950\nout any other port except for\nthe one it came in on.\n\n128\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.160\nSo when now it sees\nthe MAC address table and\n\n129\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.900\nsees port number 1 has two MAC addresses.\n\n130\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.605\nIt says, wait a minute,\nthat says I'm supposed to take it and\n\n131\n00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.252\nthen send it back out\nthe way that it came in.\n\n132\n00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:34.902\nNo way, I'm not doing that.\n\n133\n00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:36.010\nSo what does it do?\n\n134\n00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.890\nIt simply drops the traffic at that point.\n\n135\n00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.130\nNow the reason why I wanted to focus in\non that is because when we start talking\n\n136\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.840\nabout configuring and some of the things\nwe're gonna be doing later on in this\n\n137\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.655\nepisode or a couple of episodes,\ndepending on how much I talk.\n\n138\n00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:50.435\nIt's really what it comes down to.\n\n139\n00:06:50.435 --> 00:06:55.570\nIs that really if you don't\nunderstand the default behavior.\n\n140\n00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.190\nThen setting it up or understanding how\nit works is not gonna help you out.\n\n141\n00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.540\nSo I can tell you, this is what\nwe're gonna do to prevent that.\n\n142\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.450\nBut you're gonna say, well,\nwhat am I really preventing?\n\n143\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.950\nUnderstanding the basic functionality\nat this point is really\n\n144\n00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.960\nkey to understanding how we can figure the\nrest of everything else that we need to.\n\n145\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.330\nSo that is why I wanted to spend just\na few minutes in talking about that.\n\n146\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.965\nNow, before we get all the way into\nthat particular aspect of configuring,\n\n147\n00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:29.560\nand it's not too long from now,\nwe do also need to mention\n\n148\n00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.160\na couple of different types of\nswitches in very generic terms.\n\n149\n00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.890\nThere is what we call an unmanaged switch.\n\n150\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.910\nAnd there is what we\ncall a managed switch.\n\n151\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.150\nNow, Wes,\nI'm gonna throw a curve ball at you.\n\n152\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.026\nWhat do you think the difference is\nbetween the term unmanaged and managed\n\n153\n00:07:47.026 --> 00:07:50.758\nthen when we start taking a look at-\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was gonna go basically and say,\n\n154\n00:07:50.758 --> 00:07:52.230\none's managed and one's not.\n\n155\n00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.074\nI think configuration versus\nnot able to configurate.\n\n156\n00:07:56.074 --> 00:07:59.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it,\nit's exactly the way it sounds.\n\n157\n00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.455\nUnmanaged means what?\n\n158\n00:08:01.455 --> 00:08:04.144\nYou can't do anything to really affect\n\n159\n00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:07.860\nwhat the default behavior\nthat switch is gonna do.\n\n160\n00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.210\nThere's nothing that you can do.\n\n161\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.250\nYou can't change it, you can't modify it,\nyou can't do anything,\n\n162\n00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.000\nthat switch is designed to function that\nway all day long for it's entire lifetime.\n\n163\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.920\nAnd there are no configuration\nchanges that you can do.\n\n164\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.070\nAnd it's not that those behaviors are bad,\nit's not that they're necessarily good.\n\n165\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.710\nBut the problem is, sometimes,\ninside of a larger network,\n\n166\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.950\ninside of a complex network,\nit can also cause problems.\n\n167\n00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.900\nThe very fact that the broadcasting\nhappens in the way that it does,\n\n168\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.850\nmeans that Wes, if you're plugged\ninto an unmanaged switch and\n\n169\n00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.780\ngo, well I'm gonna send secret\ntraffic out to this guy.\n\n170\n00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.000\nAnd it goes, I can't find that Mac\naddress inside of the Mac address table,\n\n171\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.910\nwhere does it go Wes?\n\n172\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.340\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna go to everybody.\n\n173\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.775\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and is that what we want for\nour super secret data?\n\n174\n00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:59.545\n&gt;&gt; No, unfortunately cuz if I remember\nwhat broadcast are, one to everybody.\n\n175\n00:08:59.545 --> 00:09:02.425\nThat means everybody's listening\nwhether they process the data.\n\n176\n00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:06.145\nSo if I just happen to be the hacker come\nlately I can listen to that information,\n\n177\n00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.285\neven if you don't want me to be able to.\n\n178\n00:09:08.285 --> 00:09:10.955\n&gt;&gt; So an unmanaged switch has\nit's location and it's place,\n\n179\n00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:12.230\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n180\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.020\nMost of the time inside of a single home\nnetwork, that's probably more than likely\n\n181\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.410\nwhere you'll find what we\ncall an unmanaged switch.\n\n182\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.240\nUsually, when you start\nto take a look at it, and\n\n183\n00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.420\nlet me kinda show you\nan example of one here.\n\n184\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.720\nSo it normally is kind of like this,\nwhere it's fairly small.\n\n185\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.180\nThis one's a relatively old one,\n\n186\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.050\nand you'll see here on the back,\nthis one has, eight ports.\n\n187\n00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.340\nSo I should be able to count by\nlooking directly in the camera, but\n\n188\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.070\nI just I couldn't believe myself\nthat this was eight ports.\n\n189\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.810\nUsually, they're like four or five,\nbut now, this is an eight-port switch.\n\n190\n00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.700\nAnd that means, between those eight ports,\nit does those three basic functionalities.\n\n191\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.130\nBut there is nothing else\nthat I can do with this.\n\n192\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.970\nI plug in network and it just works.\n\n193\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.150\nAnd that's the way we like things.\n\n194\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.940\nBut a lot of times,\nit's not all that we need.\n\n195\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.180\n&gt;&gt; So, for simplicity's sake, this is\nsomething I can just throw on my network.\n\n196\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.820\nI don't have to really know a lot about\nthe inner workings of the switch.\n\n197\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.500\nI don't want to say plug and\nplay cuz that's an actual technology.\n\n198\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.820\nBut maybe I'll phrase the word plug and\ngo.\n\n199\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.970\nWe can just plug it in, turn it on,\nand hopefully it's doing what we want.\n\n200\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.730\nHowever, we do lose some of\nthe flexibility of control over\n\n201\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.050\nthe device itself.\n\n202\n00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.100\n&gt;&gt; It really, yeah, when it comes down to\nit, when you need basic functionality,\n\n203\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.690\nit's a fairly relatively, I should say,\nrelatively cheap solution.\n\n204\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.630\nBut there are no, there's nothing\nelse you can do to manage that.\n\n205\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.230\nYou can't limit the traffic,\nyou can't do anything else.\n\n206\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.450\nBut there are other switches out.\n\n207\n00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.850\nNow once we start talking\nabout those other switches,\n\n208\n00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.120\nthe price point changes incredibly, right?\n\n209\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.760\nAnd that means that when we\ntalk about a managed switch,\n\n210\n00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.000\nyou can actually get into\nthe switch itself and\n\n211\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.500\nconfigure it to behave the way that\nyou want it to behave instead.\n\n212\n00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.300\nAnd we're gonna show some\nof that configuration today\n\n213\n00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.350\non a managed switch because as you\nbecome that networking professional,\n\n214\n00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.325\nright, the chances of you\nworking on an unmanaged switch,\n\n215\n00:11:06.325 --> 00:11:09.460\nnil, okay, is what it comes down to.\n\n216\n00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.750\nNow I say that, right?\n\n217\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.010\nIf you're installing this for somebody's\nhome network, chances are relatively high.\n\n218\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.860\nBut overall, though,\nwhen it comes down to you understanding\n\n219\n00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.770\nwhat we're doing here today, you're going\nto see some of these configurations,\n\n220\n00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:25.321\nyou're going to see these types of\ndevices, especially in a business-like or\n\n221\n00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:27.390\na corporate-like environment.\n\n222\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.810\nThese are the devices that\nreally do power the connectivity\n\n223\n00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.750\nbetween everything that we\nhave inside of a network.\n\n224\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.440\nSo let's show you an example of,\nof course, a manage switch here and\n\n225\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.480\nwe are going to take a look at this and\nactually,\n\n226\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.850\nwe're gonna actually need to use\na different camera to help us out here.\n\n227\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.870\nSo Wes, you are taller and\nstronger than I am.\n\n228\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.592\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna get you to pick\n\n229\n00:11:50.592 --> 00:11:52.667\nthis up right away here as we take a look.\n\n230\n00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:55.343\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I'm missing on this one, bud.\n\n231\n00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:58.300\nYou said that other one\nwas an 8 port switch.\n\n232\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And well, I only see one port on this.\n\n233\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.340\nHelp me out, what's going on here?\n\n234\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a couple of different\nthings that we need to point out as we\n\n235\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.700\nstart to manage things and\nof course it's fairly simple.\n\n236\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.200\nNotice the size comparison and\nthe difference here.\n\n237\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.690\nI'm trying to see where I'd\nfind the actual power plug so\n\n238\n00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.940\nthat we can match it up just a little bit.\n\n239\n00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.890\nSo notice that, hey look,\nthat's a full three prong power supply.\n\n240\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.280\nLook at that little tiny plug here, that's\nfor the power when you start doing it.\n\n241\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.320\nNow, the other thing that we have back\nhere on this manage which is was call\n\n242\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.380\na console port.\n\n243\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.180\nNow that's a particularly very much\nport that we need to know about and\n\n244\n00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.270\nwe're gonna get plugged in to it so\nthat you can see what happens.\n\n245\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:41.183\nBut this allows me to plug directly\ninto the switch to be able to\n\n246\n00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:42.980\nmanage it if I need to.\n\n247\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.550\nNow in these I don't really need\nany extra configuration except for\n\n248\n00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.910\na little bit on my desktop to make sure\nthat I can see the data going across it.\n\n249\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.000\nI need a special type of cable\nthat will allow me to do so.\n\n250\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.920\nBut that's what this one is also for.\n\n251\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.510\nSo we'll plug in that and\n\n252\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.200\nwe'll show you how we actually use\nthe cable to plug into that as well.\n\n253\n00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.550\nOver here on the, on this side,\non your right hand side of the screen.\n\n254\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.050\nLet me see if I can move\nthat down a little bit more.\n\n255\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.290\nPut this thing down so I don't do that.\n\n256\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.590\nThis here is actually\ndesigned to be expandable.\n\n257\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.690\nNow what I mean by that is,\nI can buy another switch like this,\n\n258\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.396\nput it on top and have a special\ncable that goes between them.\n\n259\n00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:22.740\nAnd so this actually allows me to go hey,\nif I face the limitations whether\n\n260\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.890\nthe number of ports I have on this,\nI can actually add another one in and\n\n261\n00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.900\nit now continue to add up and\ncontinue to grow as a new tool.\n\n262\n00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.760\nSo it's very scalable.\n\n263\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.320\nNow what we talked about in terms of port\nnumbers is what is called port density.\n\n264\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.770\nPort density is very important.\n\n265\n00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:44.240\nI just showed you an 8 port switch here,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.203\nSo let's go ahead and flip that\nthing over so that we can see this.\n\n267\n00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:52.550\nAnd now, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n268\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.540\n&gt;&gt; Undo that.\n\n269\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.726\nNow you can see this has got, Wes,\n\n270\n00:13:55.726 --> 00:13:59.894\nI think it's got a few more than\nwhat we're taking a look at here.\n\n271\n00:13:59.894 --> 00:14:01.829\n&gt;&gt; Is that 16, 32, 48?\n\n272\n00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:02.853\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\n\n273\n00:14:02.853 --> 00:14:07.940\n48 ports that you have on\nthis particular switch.\n\n274\n00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.960\nNow that, means, do I actually\nhave to use every one of those?\n\n275\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.100\nNo, if I wanted to use one or\ntwo, perfectly fine.\n\n276\n00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.885\nIt's a bit more expensive, these things\ncan be in the thousands of dollar ranges.\n\n277\n00:14:19.885 --> 00:14:21.510\nWhereas the other one,\nthat I held up here,\n\n278\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.700\n50 to 60 bucks maybe,\ntoday not even that much.\n\n279\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:31.940\nBut overall though, you have that and\nthese will take regular networking cables.\n\n280\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:37.160\nThat you talked about already\nwhen you take a look at the cat5,\n\n281\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.770\n5e, cat6 cables with the RJ45 jacks,\nthey'll take those right away.\n\n282\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.230\nNow over here there\nare four special ports.\n\n283\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:50.630\nAnd these require those SFP, small form\npluggables, to be able to plugin here.\n\n284\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.220\nAnd if you do that you can use\nfiber optic connections instead.\n\n285\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.800\nSo, normally these are what we call uplink\nports, as well, where you can instead,\n\n286\n00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.910\nalso, logically connect these this way\ninstead of using that port on the back,\n\n287\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.870\nif we choose to.\n\n288\n00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.320\nOr you can just use them\nas ports if you want to.\n\n289\n00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.580\nBut overall though,\nthat's kind of what you see.\n\n290\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.540\nNow, when it comes down to it,\n\n291\n00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.440\nthis is basically a computer,\nis what it really is.\n\n292\n00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.910\nBut it has some specialness\nto it in terms of a switch.\n\n293\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.100\nThe switch itself is designed where\na lot of the switching activity, so\n\n294\n00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.500\nthose basic features that we're talking\nabout, is handled not in software but\n\n295\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.700\nactually in hardware.\n\n296\n00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.530\nSo it's what we call an ASIC, an\napplication specific integrated circuit.\n\n297\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.650\nThat the hardware itself knows and\nthat means it can switch it much faster.\n\n298\n00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.090\nInstead of having to send all the way\nup through layer 7 to do everything.\n\n299\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:43.550\nIt can go ahead and go, hey look,\nI can just go to that port and\n\n300\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.610\nit knows exactly what to do\nwith the information it gets\n\n301\n00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.330\ndepending on the configuration as well,\nokay?\n\n302\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.486\nSo these things require a bit more\npower than that little eight port but\n\n303\n00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:57.233\nhere we can actually get into it and\nbe able to manage it as well.\n\n304\n00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:02.443\nNow depending on the feature or\nthe switch itself.\n\n305\n00:16:02.443 --> 00:16:03.546\nSo like this one,\n\n306\n00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:08.410\nyou actually end up seeing where it\nsays Cisco 3560 series and it says POE.\n\n307\n00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.580\nI know it's tiny, but it says POE and\nit says 48 portshere.\n\n308\n00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.310\nThis one can provide some\ndifferent additional functionality\n\n309\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.570\nthat any port switch is not going to do.\n\n310\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.800\nWe'll be talking about POE a little\nbit later on in our show, as well.\n\n311\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.770\nBut this is also something else, too,\nin which it's not only a switch, but\n\n312\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.650\nI know just from this number itself,\ntoo, that this is a switch and\n\n313\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.470\nrouter combination, which you might have\nalso gone over the term previously in\n\n314\n00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.590\nnetwork plus,\nthat we call it a multi layer switch.\n\n315\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.370\nIt can do the layer two information, which\nis what it is primarily designed to do,\n\n316\n00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.820\nbut it can also do layer\nthree information as well.\n\n317\n00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:48.540\nSo that way we can also have a routing\ncomponent added in without having to\n\n318\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.720\nactually purchase another router,\nto stack on top of this, if we wanted to.\n\n319\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.060\nSo it gives us that ability to have\neverything in this one device.\n\n320\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.820\nAnd these are more common\nin the networking world,\n\n321\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.120\nespecially in corporate environments,\n\n322\n00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.030\nthan just the layer two devices that\nare strictly only layer two anymore.\n\n323\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.500\nNow I'm not gonna say that you don't find\nthose environments that are still out\n\n324\n00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:15.280\nthere, but this is probably more\ncommon than it ever was not common.\n\n325\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.360\nSo this is probably what\nyou'll actually end up seeing.\n\n326\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.910\nAll right, so\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna go ahead and\n\n327\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.630\nbegin this process of powering it on.\n\n328\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.210\nNow before we do that,\n\n329\n00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.960\nI also need to point out\na special cable right here, okay.\n\n330\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:35.810\nSo remember that when we start to talk\nabout managing switches or so, okay.\n\n331\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.110\nThere's a couple of things going on\nthat we have to be able to do and\n\n332\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.230\nbe able to understand here.\n\n333\n00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.150\nAnd what it comes down to,\nof course, is this ability to say,\n\n334\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.260\nall right, here is a switch.\n\n335\n00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.350\nNow, Wes, right out of the box,\n\n336\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.910\nCisco, you can buy one of these\nfrom Cisco right out of the box.\n\n337\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.680\nAnd what do you think?\n\n338\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.790\nDo you think that you could just\nplug it in and it's ready to go or\n\n339\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.520\ndo you think that there\nhas to be a lot of set up?\n\n340\n00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.510\n&gt;&gt; Well I know you've told me\nin the past that the switches,\n\n341\n00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.410\nthey do come out of the box and\nyou plug them in, they're ready to run.\n\n342\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.760\nBut some configuration has to be done,\nright?\n\n343\n00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.390\nI mean you need to tailor\nmake these to your network.\n\n344\n00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.360\nSo if we have to tailor\nthese to our networks,\n\n345\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.870\nwhat is it that we have to\ndo to to get them ready?\n\n346\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwell there's a couple of things, right?\n\n347\n00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.860\nSo right out of the box,\n\n348\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.500\nif you wanted to if you go,\nI'm never gonna learn anything about them.\n\n349\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.400\nI want them to function.\n\n350\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.960\nIt will function just like that\nunmanaged switch, right out of the box.\n\n351\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.900\nYou don't have to do anything.\n\n352\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.540\nAll you have to do is provide power,\nstart plugging your devices in, and\n\n353\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.770\nit will work.\n\n354\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.190\nBut that's not what you want to do, okay.\n\n355\n00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.122\nAnd the reason you don't want to do that\nis because it's just like what we talked\n\n356\n00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:43.290\nabout Wes, if I start doing that and\nwe start sending data to an unknown\n\n357\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.030\nMAC address, it's gonna broadcast\nit out every single port.\n\n358\n00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.120\nThat's not what we wanna do.\n\n359\n00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.518\nWe want to be able to manage\nthis a little bit better.\n\n360\n00:18:50.518 --> 00:18:52.655\nAlso because it's another\ndevice on our network,\n\n361\n00:18:52.655 --> 00:18:56.220\nit now becomes an end\npoint into our network.\n\n362\n00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.980\nSo somebody that may know a little bit\nmore about switches, more than you do,\n\n363\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.540\nmay go hey,\nI wonder if that switch is protected?\n\n364\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:09.190\nAnd they plug a cable right in there and\nevery single port is turned on by default.\n\n365\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.900\nAnd now, they get maybe an IP\naddress on the network.\n\n366\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.890\nThey now actually start going,\nI wonder if I can get into that switch?\n\n367\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.030\nAnd because you haven't set it up,\nguess what?\n\n368\n00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.800\nIt's open, it's wide, and\n\n369\n00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.480\nnow they can actually configure\nit the way they want to.\n\n370\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.140\nSo normally when you buy one of\nthose switches it comes with this\n\n371\n00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.892\nlight blue part here.\n\n372\n00:19:26.892 --> 00:19:30.313\nI went ahead and put it together because\nI didn't wanna wait too long, but\n\n373\n00:19:30.313 --> 00:19:32.035\nit comes with this light blue cable.\n\n374\n00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:36.595\nThis light blue cable is what\nwe call a console cable, and\n\n375\n00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:40.016\nit has an RJ45 connector on this end, and\n\n376\n00:19:40.016 --> 00:19:44.784\non this end it's just a regular\nRS232 port on this side.\n\n377\n00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:47.230\nNow this is a special type of cable.\n\n378\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.500\nYou've learned about\nstraight through cables.\n\n379\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.210\nYou learned about crossover cables.\n\n380\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.160\nThis is technically a roll\nover cable instead.\n\n381\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.215\nAnd so that actually means what pin number\none through eight on one end of this\n\n382\n00:19:59.215 --> 00:20:02.910\nis actually gonna be eight through one\non the other end when it comes out.So it\n\n383\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:08.040\nactually completely rolls the entire cable\nover inside of what you're seeing here.\n\n384\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.350\nAnd normally, when you do buying new\npieces of Cisco equipment that have that,\n\n385\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.820\nit'll be something similar to this.\n\n386\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.490\nNow today, this is really old,\nand this is how you know.\n\n387\n00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:21.930\nThis RS232 connection,\nmost laptops today don't have one anymore.\n\n388\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.560\nBut when I got started\nevery laptop had one.\n\n389\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.800\nAnd you're probably saying, well Ronnie,\nyou don't tend to let go of things.\n\n390\n00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.410\nIt's true, I don't let go of things.\n\n391\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.560\nBut today the new ones are USB or mini USB\nones, you name it, they're all out there.\n\n392\n00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.760\nThey're different when it comes\ndown to whatever you need.\n\n393\n00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.340\nSo once you have that, well,\nhow do you get connected then,\n\n394\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.040\nif you don't have RS232s?\n\n395\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.580\nWell, you might also need this\nother one which is a converter.\n\n396\n00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.782\nThis converts the RS232 to USB on this\nend, you just need to make sure you\n\n397\n00:20:51.782 --> 00:20:55.466\ndownload and install the appropriate\ndrivers for your machine.\n\n398\n00:20:55.466 --> 00:21:00.640\nAnd once you do that, all we do is we're\ngonna go ahead and plug that cable in.\n\n399\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.540\nSo Wes is plugging that in\nto the console port and\n\n400\n00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.920\nthen I'm gonna plug this\nin to my laptop here.\n\n401\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.650\nAnd now we're gonna turn the actual\nlaptop on is what we're going to do.\n\n402\n00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.810\nHopefully I didn't drop everything.\n\n403\n00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.660\nAnd we will go ahead and do that.\n\n404\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.030\nGo ahead and plug that thing in.\n\n405\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.993\nAnd let me see if I can get to a desktop,\nso\n\n406\n00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:28.030\nthat we can take a look\nat what's going on.\n\n407\n00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.560\nSo, here it is on my machine,\nyou're taking a look, I'm on a MacBook.\n\n408\n00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.720\nAnd I'm simply gonna open\nup a terminal program.\n\n409\n00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.950\nNow, if you were inside of\na Windows computer here it goes,\n\n410\n00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.020\nit's actually initializing, and\nyou're seeing everything that's going on.\n\n411\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.810\nSo, automatically, when it first turns on,\n\n412\n00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.060\nit's just sending it across that cable,\nit knows it's connected.\n\n413\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.141\nBut if you're inside\nof a Windows computer,\n\n414\n00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:53.220\nthere's not a default terminal\nprogram that's inside of there.\n\n415\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.050\nMy recommendation is that you go and\nyou look for a program called Putty.\n\n416\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.920\nAnd I've probably covered Putty\nbefore inside of the Network+ Series.\n\n417\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.510\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n418\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.540\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nnow let me harken back to the A+ days,\n\n419\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.500\nis that what's going on here,\nyou mentioned earlier that\n\n420\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.540\nthis is essentially is nothing more\nthan a very powerful computer.\n\n421\n00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.060\nIs it going through some kind of\nlike BIOS POST type process and\n\n422\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.170\nthen checking the internal memory,\njust really like any computer does?\n\n423\n00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.940\nIs that what we're saying?\n\n424\n00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're booting up\na computer is what you're doing.\n\n425\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.340\nNow, this is a very specialized computer.\n\n426\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.460\nIt's not designed for you to do gaming on,\nit's not designed for\n\n427\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.080\nyou to type in Notepad or\na word processor.\n\n428\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.570\nIts only design in the operating system is\nto do the functionality that we need to\n\n429\n00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.040\ndo, which is switching and\nmanaging switching is what's going on.\n\n430\n00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.760\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at what\nelse we're seeing here on the screen\n\n431\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.600\nas it continues to scroll up.\n\n432\n00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.280\nSo notice there's those same words,\nand you talk about A+ days, look,\n\n433\n00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.660\nit says POST right here.\n\n434\n00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.110\nIt's going through,\nit's telling us whether or\n\n435\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.290\nnot everything is actually up and running\nand doing everything that we need because\n\n436\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:05.590\nit's very essential that these devices\nare powered on, and they work perfectly.\n\n437\n00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.310\nNow when I say that, why?\n\n438\n00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.950\nWhy is it so important?\n\n439\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.210\nWell just like you probably today\nrarely reboot your computer,\n\n440\n00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.840\nunless something goes wrong, or\n\n441\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.240\nunless there's an update whatever requires\nit to be rebooted, switches the majority\n\n442\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.550\nof the time is once they're set up the\nright way, you don't ever turn them off.\n\n443\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.760\nI mean never.\n\n444\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.170\nYou're not rebooting them on purpose,\n\n445\n00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.440\nyou're not trying to do that, but\nusually you kind of leave them on\n\n446\n00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.550\nunless you're upgrading the iOS\nat times that that come out.\n\n447\n00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.686\n&gt;&gt; I've seen a couple of things kind\nof scroll by real fast in POST there.\n\n448\n00:23:38.686 --> 00:23:41.259\nIt said a POST ASIC, is that back to\nthat application specific integrated\n\n449\n00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:43.260\ncontroller, is that that\nacronym we're seeing there?\n\n450\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.277\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; And the other thing I would say is I\n\n451\n00:23:45.277 --> 00:23:46.320\nalso see a CAM test.\n\n452\n00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.392\nIs that that content accessible or\naddressable memory,\n\n453\n00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:51.240\nthe acronym that we see there?\n\n454\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.547\n&gt;&gt; Yep, the content addressable memory is\nwhat we call the CAM table, and that's\n\n455\n00:23:55.547 --> 00:24:00.065\nwhere theMAC address to the port number\nbindings normally are also kept together.\n\n456\n00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:02.657\nSo there is a MAC address table,\nthere's a cam table.\n\n457\n00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:06.180\nIt's all together, normally I just\nrefer to it as being the MAC address\n\n458\n00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.190\ntable because that's all it really is.\n\n459\n00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.390\nIt really is just taking that but\n\n460\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.260\ntechnically it's called the cam is\nwhat we're actually talking about.\n\n461\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.100\nBut we're also seeing\nsome other information.\n\n462\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.820\nSo notice it tells us what\nwe have on this switch.\n\n463\n00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.930\n48 ports here.\n\n464\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.680\nNotice that there's 48\nfast ethernet ports.\n\n465\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.740\nThat means they are 100 megabit ports.\n\n466\n00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.742\nThe gigabit ports of course means,\nwell a gigabit or\n\n467\n00:24:29.742 --> 00:24:32.480\n1000 megabits instead of 100 megabit.\n\n468\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.260\nI might have said 1000 up here.\n\n469\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.980\nI never know.\nSometimes I don't know exactly what I'm\n\n470\n00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.990\ntalking about.\n\n471\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.970\nAlso of course,\n\n472\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.020\nthe actual model number of this device\nas well as some other information.\n\n473\n00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.600\nNow you may wonder like,\nwhat is all this information about?\n\n474\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.320\nIf something goes wrong,\nyou have the actual numbers that you need\n\n475\n00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.530\nif the parts need replacing\nyou can do that too.\n\n476\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.440\nYou can bring all that up.\n\n477\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.310\nAnd then we also see what we\nwill call the iOS version number\n\n478\n00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.460\nas well as the image that's on it.\n\n479\n00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.120\nAnd the features that are on\nit is what you're seeing.\n\n480\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.990\nNow we're not so worried about that right\nhere in the show that we're doing right\n\n481\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.672\naway, but what we're trying to get to is\nright here at the very beginning, and\n\n482\n00:25:10.672 --> 00:25:13.490\nlet me see if I an scroll that up.\n\n483\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.780\nI'll try and get to a few lines.\n\n484\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.640\nI just want you to see that.\n\n485\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.700\nAt this point, what you're\nseeing there where it says, hey,\n\n486\n00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.720\nwould you like to enter\nthe initial configuration?\n\n487\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.870\nAnd if you know nothing about the switch,\nthis is where you would go through that.\n\n488\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.210\nBut the very fact is there is a few things\nthat you wanna set up before you put\n\n489\n00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.460\nthis device functional inside of\nthe network so that is prepared.\n\n490\n00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.250\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna walk you through\n\n491\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.180\nis right here is to be able to do that.\n\n492\n00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.490\nSo let's just get started at this point.\n\n493\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.420\nNotice the default name is switch,\n\n494\n00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.460\nI want to configure something like\na hostname that will change this up.\n\n495\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.910\nSo I'm just gonna type in enable\nfirst which is what gives me and\n\n496\n00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.970\nyou'll notice the prompt will change.\n\n497\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.320\nAnd we need to get in this cause\nthis is where our privilege mode is.\n\n498\n00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.884\nAnd then for me to start configuring it,\nI get in to what is called the configure.\n\n499\n00:26:00.322 --> 00:26:02.946\nTerminal and\nnotice again the prompt has changed and\n\n500\n00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:05.520\nI'm just gonna assign a host name.\n\n501\n00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.420\nSo when I assign a host name,\nI'm gonna call it switch one, and\n\n502\n00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.770\nthat's what we'll actually get ready\nto go there on switch number one.\n\n503\n00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:17.320\nThe other thing that we want to do, you\nalways wanna at least assign a host name.\n\n504\n00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.120\nWhen you work with multiple switches,\nthis is how you separate them or\n\n505\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.600\nidentify each of them.\n\n506\n00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.780\nSo this is very clear\nat the very beginning.\n\n507\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.403\nThe other thing that you also want to\ndo is that once we get this setup,\n\n508\n00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:33.628\nyou may want to set a couple of\nthings up so that you're no longer\n\n509\n00:26:33.628 --> 00:26:38.279\nhaving to stand there with this\nconsole cable and get everything in.\n\n510\n00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:40.947\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, in one of the previous\nepisodes, we were in,\n\n511\n00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:42.810\nwe talked about naming conventions.\n\n512\n00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.740\nAnd I wonder does it apply to\nyour redistribution points\n\n513\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.860\nlike your switches here.\n\n514\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.640\nWhen you pick a name do you pick\nsomething that's easily identifiable.\n\n515\n00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.220\nWe were kind of joking around in that\nepisode that you don't wanna name it\n\n516\n00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.890\nOptimus Prime because we don't actually\nknow what the functionality is.\n\n517\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.820\nDoes that apply to switches and\nrouters and firewalls?\n\n518\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.830\n&gt;&gt; And normally, right?\n\n519\n00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:04.460\nIt's no strict rule on whatever you wanna\nname it, but overall though if you're\n\n520\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.670\napplying this to a branch office,\nyou wanna be able to know that when you're\n\n521\n00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.130\nlogged in to a screen that looks like\nmine, that you're on that branch office\n\n522\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.200\nswitch one or branch two or main office\nheadquarters, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n523\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.880\nSo everybody does it\na little bit different but\n\n524\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.140\nthat's how it actually goes, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.265\nNow, the other thing that we want to do is\nwe wanna configure access into the switch,\n\n526\n00:27:27.265 --> 00:27:29.735\nokay, and\nthat requires a couple of things.\n\n527\n00:27:29.735 --> 00:27:34.015\nAnd, of course, is a password\nbecause when we start to connect in,\n\n528\n00:27:34.015 --> 00:27:38.030\nunless we're gonna be connecting with\nthis console cable which is very annoying\n\n529\n00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.200\ncuz these things are normally\nkept in a very loud environment.\n\n530\n00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.910\nSo I wanna get out of that\nroom as quickly as I can.\n\n531\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.920\nSo what I want to do is I want to be able\nto plug this thing in, I wanna go and\n\n532\n00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.720\nsit at my office chair and\nbe able to connect from there.\n\n533\n00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.240\nAnd the way that we do that is right here.\n\n534\n00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.430\nWe're configuring what we call, of course,\na virtual tunnel or a virtual terminal,\n\n535\n00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.830\nis what we're configuring.\n\n536\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.010\nI wanna make sure I say\nthe right term here.\n\n537\n00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.800\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you how to do that as well.\n\n538\n00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.125\nSo once we get to this point, okay,\nonce we get to this particular point,\n\n539\n00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:16.959\nit allows us then to go in, and\nwhat we have to do is we have to do line.\n\n540\n00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:23.802\nVty, 0 through 15.\n\n541\n00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:25.570\nNow, you might say what the heck is that?\n\n542\n00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.530\nThat's called a virtual teletype line.\n\n543\n00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.320\nAnd that's saying I'm allowing for virtual\nconnections to be made across the network.\n\n544\n00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.290\nOkay, so when I do something like this,\n\n545\n00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:39.330\nI need to set up a couple of\nthings to make this work.\n\n546\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.580\nFirst, once I got that,\nit really is turned on.\n\n547\n00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.090\nBut the next thing I need to do is,\nI need to tell it to log in, so\n\n548\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.350\nwhere am I actually\ngonna tell it to log in?\n\n549\n00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.630\nWell, at this point,\nI can just set log in.\n\n550\n00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.460\nAnd now you'll see where it says hey, I'm\nsetting this up, but you need a password.\n\n551\n00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.150\nSo the great thing is it reminds\nme of what password I need.\n\n552\n00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.110\nSo if I type in exit, now I can go and\nset in a password if I want to.\n\n553\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.200\nSo I can type in enable secret, which\nmeans a hidden password, and I'm gonna\n\n554\n00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.780\ndo Cisco123, cuz I know I can remember\nthat as what I can actually remember.\n\n555\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.520\nNow once we have that done, there's only a\ncouple of other things that we need to do.\n\n556\n00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.820\nWe need to set an IP address on\nthe switch, so that's for management.\n\n557\n00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.388\nNow, the way to do that is\na little bit strange here.\n\n558\n00:29:29.388 --> 00:29:34.576\nIf I wanna manage this remotely,\nis I need to do an interface.\n\n559\n00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:38.180\nCommand, vlan one.\n\n560\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.910\nNow this particular command,\nI'm just setting up, like I said,\n\n561\n00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.460\nan IP address, and I'm gonna do this one.\n\n562\n00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.018\nI'm gonna call it .20, let's do 19 here.\n\n563\n00:29:48.018 --> 00:29:51.850\nAnd then I have to type\nin the subnet mask.\n\n564\n00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.540\nSo I gave an IP address and a subnet mask.\n\n565\n00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:01.180\nAnd virtual interfaces on Sysco switches,\nat least, are turned off by default.\n\n566\n00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:07.520\nSo now I can actually go ahead and say a\nno shutdown, which now enables me to say,\n\n567\n00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.280\nif I am connected on the same\nnetwork as this thing,\n\n568\n00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.550\nokay, then what I can do is I can go now,\n\n569\n00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:21.330\nset this up inside of my server closet,\nor my networking closet.\n\n570\n00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:27.600\nPlug a cable into it, and I can connect\nto this device using this IP address,\n\n571\n00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.480\nby using, well, some of my SSH, or\nI can use something like telnet.\n\n572\n00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.720\nAnd we'll actually take a look\nat doing something like that.\n\n573\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.640\nBut at this point, Wes,\nI think I've run out of time.\n\n574\n00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've definitely come\nto the end of this episode, but\n\n575\n00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.080\nit's all great information.\n\n576\n00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.190\nA lot more great information to come,\nbut like we said,\n\n577\n00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.200\nI think we've run out of\ntime in this episode.\n\n578\n00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.670\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake this time to wrap this one up.\n\n579\n00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.130\nRonnie, thank you so much for being here.\n\n580\n00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.600\nWe look forward to additional content,\nand we appreciate you the viewer.\n\n581\n00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.090\nSigning out for ITProTV,\nI've been your

00:00:12.090\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.356\nHello everyone, welcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and\n\n5\n00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:17.160\nwe got a great show for you today.\n\n6\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.258\nWe're continuing through our\nseries in CompTIA's Net+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:21.810\nThat's right, Network+ N10-006.\n\n8\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.650\nAnd joining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.230\na part two on configuring a switch\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.520\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.300\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great today as we continue\non taking a look at some of the different\n\n12\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.620\nconfigurations we need to understand as a\nnetworking professional when it comes down\n\n13\n00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.670\nto switches.\n\n14\n00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.510\nNow, were focusing in on Cisco Equivalent\n1 it's because that's the equipment that\n\n15\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.860\nwe have here and it's the easiest one for\nme to get a hold of.\n\n16\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.930\nBut more than likely in a lot of\nprofessional environment you'll see Cisco\n\n17\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.280\nswitches probably proliferate\nthat environment fairly well.\n\n18\n00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.960\nNow are there other types\nof switches out there?\n\n19\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.723\nYou better believe it, there's plenty of\nother companies out there but this will at\n\n20\n00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:01.390\nleast get you a conceptual understanding\nof some of the things that you need to do.\n\n21\n00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.229\nAnd so in the earlier episode\nwhen we first started talking at\n\n22\n00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.342\nconfiguring a switch,\n\n23\n00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:09.430\nit kinda lead you through some of the\ndifferent things that you have to know.\n\n24\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.080\nDifference between an managed and\nan unmanaged which makes sense.\n\n25\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.390\nHow a switch basically functions and\nthen we started in on a configuration.\n\n26\n00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.970\nBefore we put a switch\ninto action on a network,\n\n27\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.600\nthere are some things we definitely need\nto configure and that's what we're in\n\n28\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.190\nthe middle of and that's what we're\ngonna be picking up on right now.\n\n29\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.610\nSo let's go back to my screen as we\npick up on configuring a switch.\n\n30\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.660\nAnd here is a switch that\nwe've been configuring.\n\n31\n00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.590\nWe're gonna change this up in just\na little bit, and I'll tell you why.\n\n32\n00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.234\nBut for right now,\nwe had really just added in,\n\n33\n00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:42.680\nlet's say right here on the oops, let me\nsee if I can scroll in a little bit more.\n\n34\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.980\nOn the SW1, which is called a host name.\n\n35\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.343\nThat's at least a minimal basic\nconfiguration that you want on that\n\n36\n00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:49.960\nswitch.\n\n37\n00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130\nTo help identify, that switch in your\nnetwork, as you plug devices in.\n\n38\n00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.710\nFrom that point there.\n\n39\n00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.510\nOnce you have that,\nyou now wanna go ahead, and\n\n40\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.800\nstart setting up just a few\nother things to help you out.\n\n41\n00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.180\nWhen you start plugging these things in,\nyour gonna need a console cable.\n\n42\n00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.120\nWhich is also something else we\nshowed you, get that plugged in, and\n\n43\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.160\nthen you'll need a connection program\nthat will allow you to plug in and\n\n44\n00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.420\nget access to it, if you were\ntrying to do this over the network.\n\n45\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.060\nBut, for me, the console cable allows me\nto plug my laptop directly into it, and\n\n46\n00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.820\nas long as I have, where it can output\ninto a terminal I am ready to go,\n\n47\n00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.790\nand that's pretty much just about it.\n\n48\n00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.140\nNow if you're not sure, right?\n\n49\n00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.480\nIf you're in Windows you wanna go and\nfind a program called PuTTY that will help\n\n50\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.860\nyou to terminal into the, into the switch\nitself, and you'll be able to run that,\n\n51\n00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.230\nand we'll show you an example\nof that in just a little bit.\n\n52\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.840\nBut here, I'm just using a MacBook.\n\n53\n00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.250\nI just opened up my Terminal.\n\n54\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.230\nAnd I was able to connect in as well.\n\n55\n00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.540\nAnd we'll talk about some of the features\nyou need to do to make that connection.\n\n56\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.540\nBut overall though,\nthis is what it leads you to.\n\n57\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.249\nSo when I, yesterday I said,\nin the previous episode then,\n\n58\n00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:01.000\nwhen we took a look, one of the things\nthat I said you had to set was.\n\n59\n00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.540\nA way that we can protect the switch.\n\n60\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.770\nAnd the way that we can do so\nis just simple passwords.\n\n61\n00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.690\nSo I set up a password and\nit's asking me for that password now.\n\n62\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.570\nAnd now I am inside of that switch.\n\n63\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.500\nAnd you can tell a lot of\ntimes the mode that you're in\n\n64\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.820\nby the little symbol\nthat follows the name.\n\n65\n00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.090\nSo you actually see that these are two\ndifferent symbols that are following\n\n66\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.550\nanother pattern.\n\n67\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.746\nThis is technically called user mode, and\n\n68\n00:03:27.746 --> 00:03:30.620\nnow we are in what we call\nprivileged mode at this point.\n\n69\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.235\nIf I go ahead and do a configure terminal,\n\n70\n00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:37.290\nthis gives me what's called\na global configuration terminal.\n\n71\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.646\nAnd that means I can now configure the\nswitch make it respond the way that I want\n\n72\n00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:44.594\nto, make it do some of\nthe things that I wanna do, and\n\n73\n00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:47.408\nnotice again what follows\nthe name has changed and\n\n74\n00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:51.280\nthose are some of the different\nmodes that you also end up seeing.\n\n75\n00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.209\nSo this is where we were able to configure\nthat idea of the password for enable.\n\n76\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.064\nWe also ended up taking a look at that\nidea of being able to configure this\n\n77\n00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:02.849\nnot from a noisy room perchance,\n\n78\n00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.580\nby having that console cable always\non me when I need to connect to it.\n\n79\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.283\nBut if I wanna be able to manage this,\nlet's say, from the network itself,\n\n80\n00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:14.310\nI need to configure an IP\naddress on this switch.\n\n81\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.985\nSo here for example, if I wanna do that,\n\n82\n00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:22.080\nI have to configure what's called\na management VLAN IP address.\n\n83\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.350\nAnd the basic management VLAN IP is a\nvirtual interface called interface vlan 1.\n\n84\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.490\nNow I've abbreviated it and that's cuz\nthat's the way that I'm used to doing it.\n\n85\n00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.670\nBut literally we typed\nout interface VLAN 1.\n\n86\n00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.352\nIt's here I can just set an IP address and\nthen I can do 192.168.16.7 and\n\n87\n00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:44.752\nI'm just picking these numbers\nout because I know they're gonna\n\n88\n00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:49.010\nmatch up with something I'm gonna\nbe doing just a few minutes.\n\n89\n00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.559\nAnd from that point I'm now set\nan IP address on that interface and\n\n90\n00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:58.435\nthen I have to turn it on, and the way\nthat we do that is not shut it down by\n\n91\n00:04:58.435 --> 00:05:01.850\nno shut down, and\nthat now means it's enabled.\n\n92\n00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.378\nOnce that's enabled,\nI can now say if I'm on another network\n\n93\n00:05:06.378 --> 00:05:09.861\ndevice in the same network\nas this device is on,\n\n94\n00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:16.180\nit means I can now telnet into this device\nif I've got everything else set up.\n\n95\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.808\nSo it's here that we have to set what we\ncall the virtual connection types here.\n\n96\n00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:25.860\nAnd the way that you do that\nis you go to line vty for\n\n97\n00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.650\nvirtual teletype and on the switch,\nthere are 15 of them, or 16 of them.\n\n98\n00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.090\n0 and 15, one through 15.\n\n99\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.990\nAnd when you do that, you'll see this.\n\n100\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.319\nNow you don't have a password set up,\nyou'll see it kinda list 15 line saying,\n\n101\n00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.650\nhey you can turn this on.\n\n102\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.990\nBut nobody's gonna connect\nuntil you set up a password.\n\n103\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.370\nAnd the way that you make that happen\nis you go login, and then there it is.\n\n104\n00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.150\nNotice it's saying you\nhaven't set any passwords.\n\n105\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.340\nNotice it's looking at 16 lines here.\n\n106\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.622\nAnd I just type in password cisco123.\n\n107\n00:06:00.622 --> 00:06:03.417\nAnd now you go, okay,\nwhat difference does that really make?\n\n108\n00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:06.540\nWell, doesn't really make\na ton of difference yet.\n\n109\n00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.252\nBut if I tried to telnet in,\nnow I will have the ability to say, hey,\n\n110\n00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:14.740\ngive me a password before we do this,\nokay.\n\n111\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.550\nSo this is where it's very important, and\n\n112\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.140\nwe'll show you that the result\nof this in just a moment.\n\n113\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.104\nWe're gonna switch over to\nsome different lab equipment,\n\n114\n00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.410\nand we'll tell you why as we do so.\n\n115\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.613\nBut overall though, for\n\n116\n00:06:27.613 --> 00:06:31.735\nthis point We're going to leave the basic\nconfiguration right here and we'll pick it\n\n117\n00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:35.900\nup in just a moment cuz we have another\ntopic that we wanna make sure we address.\n\n118\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.700\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and one of the things,\nRonnie, that I think about, for instance,\n\n119\n00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.240\nare things like in band and\nout of band management, right.\n\n120\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.617\nOne of the things I also notice is\nthat we have, like on our servers,\n\n121\n00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:48.291\nwe have things like the LILO boards,\nright, lights on, lights off, and\n\n122\n00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.426\nit means that I can\nactually get in there and\n\n123\n00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:53.430\nI can configure the device if\nI'm not in the same location.\n\n124\n00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.380\nBut even more so, I can access things\nlike BIOS for our server as well.\n\n125\n00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.590\nWe also need that with\nour networking devices.\n\n126\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.429\nCuz like Ronnie's shown and explained\nhere We're not always in the location of\n\n127\n00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:07.095\nthe actual physical location of the\nnetwork device so we can do things like,\n\n128\n00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:09.820\nyou know, for instance,\nin band management, right?\n\n129\n00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.353\nIn band management we're setting up SSH\naccess, we're configuring our certificate,\n\n130\n00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:18.610\nthe terminal access that\nyou just showed us as well.\n\n131\n00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.168\nSo also things like for\ninstance auto ban management,\n\n132\n00:07:21.168 --> 00:07:25.390\nthe auto ban managements where we have to\nhave access to that console port as well.\n\n133\n00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.680\nRonnie so what are we looking at next sir?\n\n134\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.345\n&gt;&gt; When I always start talking about that\nidea people might be wondering why do we\n\n135\n00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:37.100\nneed this right, what is the big deal\nbetween in ban and out of ban management?\n\n136\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.318\nWell it depends on security\nmore than anything else.\n\n137\n00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:43.380\nIf you wanna make sure that\nyour particular management of\n\n138\n00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.844\nthat VLAN happens without it being on the\nsame network as all your data that's flown\n\n139\n00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:52.019\nthrough your devices, you're gonna\nchoose out of band management, okay.\n\n140\n00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:56.883\nIf you don't mind that your management\ntraffic is on the same wires as all\n\n141\n00:07:56.883 --> 00:08:01.207\nof your data Well then,\nyou can actually pick inbound manager.\n\n142\n00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:05.185\nIt's all about management style, but also\nit depends on security policy inside your\n\n143\n00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:07.850\norganization which one you're\ngoing to end up picking.\n\n144\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.840\nSo, Wes gave us a good summary and\n\n145\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.070\ndescription of what\nthe differences are there.\n\n146\n00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.570\nYou want to make sure\nyou remember that for\n\n147\n00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.010\nthe exam as you continue to prepare for\nthis.\n\n148\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.490\nBut we want to continue on,\n\n149\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.600\nand we want to take a look then\nat what we're switching on to.\n\n150\n00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.540\nSo let me show the different switch\nthat we're going to right now.\n\n151\n00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.085\nSo on my screen,\nyou're actually seeing this.\n\n152\n00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:32.550\nNow, you might wondering why, Ronnie,\nwhy in the world did you switch this over?\n\n153\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.570\nBecause I know something.\n\n154\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.550\nNot everybody at home is sitting\non a Cisco switch, okay?\n\n155\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.520\nOne, they're expensive.\n\n156\n00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.060\nAnd two, not everybody wants to have\none of these in the house cuz they're\n\n157\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.370\nrelatively loud and you don't really\nneed one unless you really need one.\n\n158\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.580\nSo most of aren't gonna spend a couple\nof hundred dollars on a used one.\n\n159\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.260\nMaybe 300 to 400 on a layer three switch,\nwe're not gonna do that.\n\n160\n00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.590\nBut the great thing is,\nif you have a subscription ITProTV,\n\n161\n00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.380\nyou can get access to practice labs\nas part of every single subscription.\n\n162\n00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.608\nI just went down to the Cisco CCNA labs\nand I just pulled up the first one.\n\n163\n00:09:08.608 --> 00:09:12.850\nAnd I gained access to a whole\ntopology of different switches.\n\n164\n00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.440\nAnd the reason why I wanted\nto show you that is because\n\n165\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.530\nthat means you have access to this.\n\n166\n00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.800\nAnd this is not virtualized equipment,\nit's not simulated.\n\n167\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.870\nThis is real live Cisco equipment that\neverybody that has a subscription\n\n168\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.460\nto IT Pro TV can gain access to,\nand so we're gonna carry on here.\n\n169\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.946\nNow, I want to show the initial part of it\nbecause definitely we need to understand\n\n170\n00:09:32.946 --> 00:09:35.371\nthat console K1 physically\nunderstanding that, hey,\n\n171\n00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:37.303\nthere is times you're\ngonna have to do this.\n\n172\n00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:41.470\nThe configuration that was\n99% of everything else.\n\n173\n00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.990\nSo at this point, we're actually at the\nsame exact location that we were before,\n\n174\n00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.500\nand the only difference is that you\nhave to type out the commands under here\n\n175\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.890\ninstead is what you'll have to do.\n\n176\n00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.070\nNow, this one is not as forgiving and\nyou don't get to use some of\n\n177\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.200\nthe neat kind of short cut features such\nas the up arrow and stuff like that.\n\n178\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.480\nBut overall, though,\nit will allow you to do this.\n\n179\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.590\nSo it's actually kind of neat.\n\n180\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.790\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, one of the things I know that\nwe need is we need access control, right?\n\n181\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.410\nThat's gonna be very, very important.\n\n182\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.080\nI know that inside of things\nlike active directory,\n\n183\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.600\nright, we can do identity management,\nauthorization, access.\n\n184\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.160\nWe could do things like logging.\n\n185\n00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.080\nIt's that something that we can do inside\nof one of these switches as well if we\n\n186\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.120\nneed that functionality?\n\n187\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.940\n&gt;&gt; You sure can, So, not only can we,\nof course, set passwords like we did,\n\n188\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.070\nwe can also set it up to go to\nanother management instead.\n\n189\n00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.890\nSo instead of your switch having\nto hold a database onto its own,\n\n190\n00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.250\nwhich it can do, and I'll show you that\nin a moment, we can then tell it and\n\n191\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.500\npoint it to some place else if we want to.\n\n192\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.390\nSo, let's take a look at my switch and\nshow you what I'm talk about, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.443\nSo, currently, the only password\nthat I have on here if you\n\n194\n00:10:45.443 --> 00:10:48.391\nplug in a console cable,\nthis is what you're gonna get.\n\n195\n00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:52.890\nYou're gonna gain access to the name of\nthat switch, and add this command here.\n\n196\n00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.330\nNow, notice about press Enter, no big dea.\n\n197\n00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.590\nBut if I try to get into privilege mode,\nit says I need a password.\n\n198\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.470\nNow, that password protection\nis very basic, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.380\nNow, as long as you come\nup with a complex password,\n\n200\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.350\nit does take people time to guess.\n\n201\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.440\nBut notice, after awhile it expires, too.\n\n202\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.780\nSo here, all I have to do is make sure\nthat I type in the right password.\n\n203\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.990\nOops, I have to type it in here.\n\n204\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.520\nAnd you'll see,\nI made a very complex password, cisco123.\n\n205\n00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.230\nAnd notice, my privilege prompt changed\nand now I'm back inside of the switch.\n\n206\n00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.900\nNow, once I have this ready to go,\nif I wanted to say,\n\n207\n00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.970\nhey, look, I want to change this\nto a newer form of authentication,\n\n208\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.990\nI wanna do user name and password.\n\n209\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.440\nThis is what we call the new\nmodel of authentication here.\n\n210\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.070\nWell, we can do that as well.\n\n211\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.740\nTo set that up on this switch,\nI go into my global configuration mode and\n\n212\n00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.370\nI type in user name, and I can now do,\nI'll pick Wes for an example.\n\n213\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.630\nWes, and then we'll set up his password,\n\n214\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.720\nand we'll just use the same one cuz\nI'm not gonna remember two passwords.\n\n215\n00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.310\nThere's no way that's gonna be\npossible for my brain to do that.\n\n216\n00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.168\nAnd now that I've set it up this way,\n\n217\n00:12:04.168 --> 00:12:08.786\nI go back into that line vty 0 through 15.\n\n218\n00:12:08.786 --> 00:12:12.801\nAnd instead, I tell it now that\nI've set up that username and\n\n219\n00:12:12.801 --> 00:12:17.447\npassword on this switch, I tell it\ninstead it's gonna be a login using\n\n220\n00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:22.500\nthe local username password database,\nis what I tell it to do.\n\n221\n00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.590\nNow, once I have that set, notice the\ndifference here just from this command.\n\n222\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.680\nSo if I go and exit out of this device\ncompletely, now when we come back in and\n\n223\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.910\nI type in enable, I should still be able\nto get in with Cisco123, which is fine.\n\n224\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.250\nSo now I'm actually in.\n\n225\n00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:45.330\nBut what if Wes was actually on His\nown computer inside of this network?\n\n226\n00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:50.080\nLet me zoom out a little bit so that we\ncan get established and connected there.\n\n227\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.610\nTry and get it to full screen so\nthat we can see it a little bit better.\n\n228\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.580\nSo from here, if you were doing\nthis from across the network.\n\n229\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:03.240\nWes is now sitting in his office on\nhis nice Windows 7 desktop, right?\n\n230\n00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.264\nAnd he'll click on PuTTY.\n\n231\n00:13:05.264 --> 00:13:06.415\nWell, maybe.\n\n232\n00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:15.420\nAnd in his PuTTY configuration he\ncan select telnet now 192 168.\n\n233\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.540\nAnd this is 16.7,\nthe one that we had set up earlier.\n\n234\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.810\nSo make sure you see that.\n\n235\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.000\nWe type that in.\n\n236\n00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.659\nI verify it says telnet here.\n\n237\n00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.270\nI click open.\n\n238\n00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.488\nAnd notice right away what it gives me.\n\n239\n00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:34.970\nOops, at least I think,\ncome on give me a second.\n\n240\n00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.100\nThere we go.\n\n241\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.170\nTrying to zoom in.\n\n242\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.940\nNotice it says username first.\n\n243\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:46.083\nSo if i try to type in,\nlet me see if I can click in there.\n\n244\n00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:49.270\nWes.\nAnd then the password cisco123.\n\n245\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.520\nNow I'm accessing into the switch itself.\n\n246\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.810\nI do the enable, and\nI do the other password, and\n\n247\n00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:02.770\nnow we are actually inside of that switch\nagain from across the network, okay?\n\n248\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.540\nNow, the only limitation here, Wes,\n\n249\n00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.820\nis that I am actually telling\nthe switch to look where?\n\n250\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.130\nOn itself, for\nthat username password, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.570\nNow, we can redirect that\ninside of the switch itself.\n\n252\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.420\nNow, we're just gonna show\nyou the configuration.\n\n253\n00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:23.130\nWe didn't set up the other side in terms\nof doing the entire radius and everything.\n\n254\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.440\nBut Wes is right.\n\n255\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.240\nWhat we now do instead,\nif we wanted to is, is if we go look,\n\n256\n00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.610\nI already have Active Directory up and\nrunning, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.370\nI already have something\nthat I can do this against.\n\n258\n00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.432\nWell, you can set up a radius server,\n\n259\n00:14:37.432 --> 00:14:39.789\nwhich requires a little\nbit of setup to do.\n\n260\n00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:42.572\nAnd then from that point,\nnow the switch will go and\n\n261\n00:14:42.572 --> 00:14:46.663\ncheck that server instead of just\na local username and password database.\n\n262\n00:14:46.663 --> 00:14:52.319\nAnd the way that that begins is by\ngetting into the global configuration.\n\n263\n00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:56.010\nAnd once were in the global configuration,\n\n264\n00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.810\nwe have to tell it to switch\nto a triple A new model.\n\n265\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.460\nNow that new model authentication says\nI'm not just accepting passwords anymore.\n\n266\n00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.100\nI need a user name and\nI also need a password at this point.\n\n267\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.240\nSo I'm now telling it that\nthis is what it's gonna do.\n\n268\n00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.380\nWell, Ronnie didn't you just do that?\n\n269\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.940\nWell, to a point, right?\n\n270\n00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.010\nI did it for just telling that.\n\n271\n00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.110\nNow, you probably not gonna do that for\njust telling.\n\n272\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.220\nBut yes,\nit can function on newer switches,\n\n273\n00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.880\nyou don't have to set up anything else.\n\n274\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.820\nBut you can just simply do that and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n275\n00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.750\nBut the problem is right now, and\n\n276\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.040\nwhen I do this it's only\ngoing to check one place.\n\n277\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.020\nAnd that is going to be that local\nusername and password database.\n\n278\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.015\nSo instead,\nyou do triple a authentication.\n\n279\n00:15:42.077 --> 00:15:45.360\nAnd then you tell it where\nit's going to log in.\n\n280\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.363\nSo I can set up this idea of\nwhat I call a default group.\n\n281\n00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:54.397\nAnd then,\nin this group depending on the order,\n\n282\n00:15:54.397 --> 00:15:57.143\nif I want to set up radius,\nI type in radius.\n\n283\n00:15:57.143 --> 00:16:01.679\nAnd then I'm gonna type in local\nNow this is actually saying that\n\n284\n00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:06.551\nif radius doesn't respond,\nthen it's going to fail over to local to\n\n285\n00:16:06.551 --> 00:16:11.310\nallow me to get access in as\nlong as I have a local database.\n\n286\n00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.033\nBut if radius rejects it,\nit's not gonna let me in.\n\n287\n00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:17.618\nSo, in other words, if I don't have\nanything configured in radius to make it\n\n288\n00:16:17.618 --> 00:16:19.120\nwork, it's not going to work.\n\n289\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.060\nThat's just pretty much\nthe way that it's going to go.\n\n290\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.737\nNow once we have that,\nwe go ahead and do that.\n\n291\n00:16:24.737 --> 00:16:29.463\nAnd then we can set up the radius\nserver by simply typing in\n\n292\n00:16:29.463 --> 00:16:33.123\nwhere our radius server location would be.\n\n293\n00:16:33.123 --> 00:16:37.820\nThat would be 192.168.10,\nactually it's 16.10.\n\n294\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.152\nAnd that's the machine that\nI was just talking about.\n\n295\n00:16:39.152 --> 00:16:43.500\nNow I don't have the radius server,\noops, let me see.\n\n296\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.971\nRadius server,\nI may have to actually do a question\n\n297\n00:16:49.971 --> 00:16:53.984\nmark here to see what I was missing here.\n\n298\n00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:03.800\nIt's probably because it's\nalready set somewhere.\n\n299\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.390\nI was trying to see where I actually\nmissed a particular service.\n\n300\n00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.130\nBut normally you could actually do,\n\n301\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.210\nI think this host is the one\nword that I need here.\n\n302\n00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.027\nRadius, Cuz I forget everything,\nhost, and so\n\n303\n00:17:18.027 --> 00:17:24.609\nwe're telling it where it should find\nthe radius server 192.168.16.10.\n\n304\n00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.309\nOf course it took it twice,\nwhy wouldn't it?\n\n305\n00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:32.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Host\n\n306\n00:17:32.572 --> 00:17:38.500\n192.168.16.10, maybe the ninth\ntime will be a charm there.\n\n307\n00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.780\nSo there we go, it actually does do that.\n\n308\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.250\nAnd because I'm running the latest version\nof the IOS on this thing, it's balking at\n\n309\n00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:50.330\nme saying hey, look this particular line,\nit's gonna be deprecated soon.\n\n310\n00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.930\nBut this will work in the meantime.\n\n311\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.950\nSo this is how we tell it that\nwhen it now receives that prompt.\n\n312\n00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.627\nThat it's gonna go and\ncheck a radius server first.\n\n313\n00:17:59.627 --> 00:18:02.231\nAnd then, if it doesn't find\nthe radius server, it'll go and\n\n314\n00:18:02.231 --> 00:18:04.570\ncheck the local username\npassword database.\n\n315\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.780\nSo that is how we can set it up\nto point to another location for\n\n316\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.220\nauthentication we need to.\n\n317\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.180\n&gt;&gt; Very good, so, Ronnie,\n\n318\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.510\nyou've got it to where I can manage it\nfrom the network that I'm on, right?\n\n319\n00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.950\nYou've showed us that we can\nplug in the consoled cable,\n\n320\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.920\nyou've got your authentication working.\n\n321\n00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.110\nWhat if I'm on another network?\n\n322\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.240\nHow would we manage it then?q\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now this is actually\n\n323\n00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.357\na little bit tricky at the very\nbeginning if you're doing this.\n\n324\n00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:31.740\nSo, somebody says,\nlook I know that I can use Telnet or\n\n325\n00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.140\nSSH it again,\nnow let me put a caviat on this, right?\n\n326\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.454\nNobody should ever use Telnet to connect\ninto the switch even from your network.\n\n327\n00:18:39.454 --> 00:18:41.952\nWe do it for testing purposes and\nlab environments,\n\n328\n00:18:41.952 --> 00:18:44.190\nprobably the easiest thing to do.\n\n329\n00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.740\nBut in reality,\nwe're not gonna worry about it too much.\n\n330\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.710\nAnd you're never gonna do this.\n\n331\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.180\nSo let me make sure I say that\nbefore somebody emails me and goes,\n\n332\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.660\nRonnie, you know you\nshould never use Telnet.\n\n333\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.610\nI understand, but overall though\nwe just wanted to set that up.\n\n334\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.080\nNow if you are connecting\nin from another network.\n\n335\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.700\nLet's say that you're actually in\nanother building on the same campus.\n\n336\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.370\nBut you still need to get into\nthe switch to be able to do this.\n\n337\n00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.160\nWell, at that point,\n\n338\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.920\nthat means that you have to understand\na little bit about routing.\n\n339\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.296\nFor every device that is going to try and\nconnect in from another network.\n\n340\n00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:18.673\nThat means it can connect in to this\nswitch and needs to know the IP address.\n\n341\n00:19:18.673 --> 00:19:20.824\nWhich means it's going to be\non a different network from\n\n342\n00:19:20.824 --> 00:19:22.340\nthe one that I'm on.\n\n343\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.661\nAnd then, when it actually gets the\ninformation over here, that connection.\n\n344\n00:19:25.661 --> 00:19:30.710\nWhat we also have to have is a pathway\nto get it back to where I'm going.\n\n345\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.050\nSo how do I do that,\nhow do I make the switch do that?\n\n346\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.355\nWhere it says hey,\nI need to reply to this other computer.\n\n347\n00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:41.060\nWhich is on, let's say, 172.16.10.120.\n\n348\n00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.392\nWell, If any other device on\nyour network would do this.\n\n349\n00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:47.932\nThe way that it would normally do\nis take a look at the computer and\n\n350\n00:19:47.932 --> 00:19:49.920\ngo, it doesn't belong to this network.\n\n351\n00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.200\nIt sends it out where, Wes?\n\n352\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.480\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking the default gateway?\n\n353\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.800\n&gt;&gt; It sends it out the default gateway.\n\n354\n00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.670\nAnd so that's the same thing here is\nthat we need to set a default gateway\n\n355\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.960\non this switch.\n\n356\n00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.870\nSo we can do that,\nlet's go and take a look here.\n\n357\n00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.260\nSo on the switch that needs to be\ncontrolled by another network,\n\n358\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.120\nfrom another network,\nnot by another network, I should say.\n\n359\n00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.220\nThen that's all we have to do.\n\n360\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:14.161\nNow, remember that means you have\nan IP address on this switch on\n\n361\n00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:17.465\nthe interface VLAN 1 for the management.\n\n362\n00:20:17.465 --> 00:20:21.393\nAnd then all you have to do is get out to\nthis global configuration prompt here.\n\n363\n00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:25.546\nAnd do IP default-gateway, and\n\n364\n00:20:25.546 --> 00:20:33.010\nthen you simply type in the IP\naddress of your gateway.\n\n365\n00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:37.500\nSo, now as a Telnet or\nan SSH connection comes in to the switch\n\n366\n00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.310\nthrough whatever router\nit actually came through.\n\n367\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.090\nIt lands at that connection on that\nswitch and then it says, hey, for\n\n368\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.570\nme to return this reply.\n\n369\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.150\nI don't have a route to get there.\n\n370\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.440\nIt goes through what?\n\n371\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.390\nIts default gateway, and\n\n372\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:54.540\non your router, it should be able to get\nback to whoever sent the initial command.\n\n373\n00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.780\nSo that default gateway on a switch\nis actually very important for\n\n374\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.500\nus if we're going to do some\ntype of management with this.\n\n375\n00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.920\nSo just kind of remember that there's\na lot of pieces involved here.\n\n376\n00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.450\nBut for\nus it's checking the simple things, right?\n\n377\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.860\nSo those types of scenarios\nare always gonna happen.\n\n378\n00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.720\nYou can't get access to the switch from\nanother network, default gateway, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.980\nYou can't manage the switch\non your same network,\n\n380\n00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.660\nyou're trying to do it from\nyour desktop computer.\n\n381\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.320\nWell you need to make sure that you set\nup the access for it by giving it an IP\n\n382\n00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.420\naddress and setting up, of course,\nthose virtual lines or terminals.\n\n383\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.100\nSo that you can gain access in.\n\n384\n00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.690\nSo that's where it begins.\n\n385\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie, in the first part of this\nepisode you gave us a great visual of\n\n386\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.880\ninspection of an unmanaged switch and\na managed switch.\n\n387\n00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.636\nAnd one of the things I noticed\non the faceplate of this switch,\n\n388\n00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:42.465\na little marker on the side that said POE.\n\n389\n00:21:42.465 --> 00:21:46.650\nI've seen that before as far as\nadvertised on the devices themselves.\n\n390\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.670\nWhat is that doing for\nus when it comes to the switch?\n\n391\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.730\nWhat is this POE they speak of.?\n\n392\n00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.980\n&gt;&gt; POE is what they call\npower over Ethernet.\n\n393\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.030\nNow, if you've had any small device.\n\n394\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.670\nA good one that you'll end up seeing\nin a corporate environment or\n\n395\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.210\nbusiness environment is\nwhat we call VOIP phones.\n\n396\n00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.840\nThey normally come, of course,\nyou plug it in and it will work and\n\n397\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.400\njust about ready to go.\n\n398\n00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.470\nBut they also normally come with the power\nadapter, or what people call wall warts.\n\n399\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.930\nFirst time I heard that I was like,\nwhat the heck is the wall wart?\n\n400\n00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.410\nI don't know, but everybody knew\nwhat they were talking about.\n\n401\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.020\nI didn't know what it was.\n\n402\n00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:26.260\nBut that's supplying what extra power to\nthat phone to get it up and working, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.360\nWell, if your switch doesn't\nsupply any power to the phone,\n\n404\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.450\nthe only way to supply power to\nthe phone is by that wall wart.\n\n405\n00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.577\nPOE, power over Ethernet\nmeans that instead,\n\n406\n00:22:35.577 --> 00:22:38.632\nwe can just plug the wire\ninto that VOIP phone.\n\n407\n00:22:38.632 --> 00:22:43.384\nAnd it supplies, not only the network and\nthe telephone connections that we need to,\n\n408\n00:22:43.384 --> 00:22:48.700\nbut it also supplies the additional power\nneeded for that phone to operate and work.\n\n409\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.548\nSo that's what you actually\nend up talking about.\n\n410\n00:22:50.548 --> 00:22:52.340\n&gt;&gt; I think, Ronnie,\nyou just solved a mystery for me,\n\n411\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.370\nand help me out on this one.\n\n412\n00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.268\nI've seen wireless access points\nthat are in the middle of nowhere.\n\n413\n00:22:56.268 --> 00:22:58.850\nThere isn't an outlet anywhere,\nbut I've also seen\n\n414\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.580\nIP cams that are on the side of a brick\nwall and there isn't a outlet anywhere.\n\n415\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.640\nIs that what they most\nlikely might be doing?\n\n416\n00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.370\nAre they supplying power to these\ndevices over the Ethernet cables that\n\n417\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.130\nare plugged into them?\n\n418\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.560\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nthey're pretty much doing that.\n\n419\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.590\nNow the key to making that work\nare a couple of elements, right?\n\n420\n00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.670\nThe switch has to have power going to it.\n\n421\n00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.000\nIf it doesn't,\nthere are ways to kind of get around it.\n\n422\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.830\nI know that that sounds weird.\n\n423\n00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.650\nBut there are ways,\nto kind of get around it.\n\n424\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:28.520\nThose devices, have also come up with\nwhat they call, power injectors, too.\n\n425\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:32.460\nNow you might go,\nwhat the heck is a power injector?.\n\n426\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.224\nWell it's the device that can plug into\na wall outlet, it's got a wall wart.\n\n427\n00:23:36.224 --> 00:23:40.390\nBut then you actually plug that\ninline to the network cable.\n\n428\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.040\nSo you now actually have two cables\nrunning to whatever device it is.\n\n429\n00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.403\nWhether it's a wireless access point,\nor an IP camera, or a VOIP phone.\n\n430\n00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:50.208\nIt just gives you one wire to worry about.\n\n431\n00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:52.568\nAnd then you generally plug that\ninjector in somewhere else.\n\n432\n00:23:52.568 --> 00:23:55.279\nBut overall though, the switch itself,\n\n433\n00:23:55.279 --> 00:24:00.398\nif it supplies POE It will actually end\nup being able to power those devices up.\n\n434\n00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:01.768\nAnd we should be good with it.\n\n435\n00:24:01.768 --> 00:24:03.882\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nas far as the physical media goes,\n\n436\n00:24:03.882 --> 00:24:05.780\nis that just your standard Cat cables?\n\n437\n00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.360\nAre there nothing really\nspecial about those Cat cables?\n\n438\n00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.810\n&gt;&gt; Well, you normally need at least\nCat5E if you're going to do this.\n\n439\n00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.003\nOr it just pretty much is\none of those requirements.\n\n440\n00:24:17.003 --> 00:24:19.732\nNow, and that's kind of one that hopefully\n\n441\n00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:23.217\njust about everybody today\nis running at least Cat5e.\n\n442\n00:24:23.217 --> 00:24:27.030\nNow I'm not gonna say that you are or\naren't, but hopefully you are.\n\n443\n00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:32.027\nBut it does require that, and\nthe great thing is this particular type of\n\n444\n00:24:32.027 --> 00:24:37.038\nPOE has kinda really stabilized into\ntwo standards that are out there.\n\n445\n00:24:37.038 --> 00:24:46.424\nThe ieee802.3af and .at.\n\n446\n00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:49.590\nSo remember those\nparticular standards there.\n\n447\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.740\nThe first one, the .af, is a very popular\none and it's kind of the standard now.\n\n448\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.040\nIt can supply up to about 15 volts.\n\n449\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.930\nI think,15.4 watts, not volts, watts.\n\n450\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.436\nLet me make sure I make that\nclear distinction there.\n\n451\n00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:08.266\nSo most of the devices that you\nhave that only need up to 15 watts,\n\n452\n00:25:08.266 --> 00:25:10.438\nthis is one that will do that.\n\n453\n00:25:10.438 --> 00:25:13.491\nBut what about those devices that\nneed a little bit more power?\n\n454\n00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.727\nAnd there are plenty of them out there.\n\n455\n00:25:15.727 --> 00:25:21.808\nThen you have the AT,\nwhich provides all up to 25.5 watts,\n\n456\n00:25:21.808 --> 00:25:24.803\nso pretty much almost double.\n\n457\n00:25:24.803 --> 00:25:27.275\nI'm not gonna say it's exactly double but\n\n458\n00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:30.770\nalmost double the amount\nof power that you have.\n\n459\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:37.174\nSo as long as most devices have kinda\nsaid, look, we're AF or AT standard,\n\n460\n00:25:37.174 --> 00:25:42.396\nmost of the power over ethernet\nsupply by switches will work.\n\n461\n00:25:42.396 --> 00:25:47.781\nYou will still run into some proprietary\ndevices that will require their\n\n462\n00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:53.443\nown way of doing the power over ethernet,\nusing their own power injectors.\n\n463\n00:25:53.443 --> 00:25:57.802\nAnd we have certain devices like\nthat inside of the ITPro.TV studios.\n\n464\n00:25:57.802 --> 00:26:01.666\nAnd I said, look, don't supply power or\nethernet through your switch.\n\n465\n00:26:01.666 --> 00:26:05.586\nSo you can go into the switch and\ndisable the power over ethernet and\n\n466\n00:26:05.586 --> 00:26:07.688\nthat way you're not supplying it.\n\n467\n00:26:07.688 --> 00:26:09.857\nAnd then you only supply\nit through what they want.\n\n468\n00:26:09.857 --> 00:26:13.481\nBut you won't find a lot of those devices\nunless you're just really looking for\n\n469\n00:26:13.481 --> 00:26:14.517\nsomething specific.\n\n470\n00:26:14.517 --> 00:26:17.374\nAnd they tell you right on the box,\ndo not do this or\n\n471\n00:26:17.374 --> 00:26:19.726\nyou will fry the device, then you know.\n\n472\n00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:20.844\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n473\n00:26:20.844 --> 00:26:24.918\nwith some of the wattage numbers that you\ngave us, am I to assume that maybe that\n\n474\n00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:28.965\nis a kinda divided through all 48 or\nhowever many ports are on the switches.\n\n475\n00:26:28.965 --> 00:26:32.873\nIs that the total wattage that's\ndivided between all ports or can you?\n\n476\n00:26:32.873 --> 00:26:36.155\nOr do you have some type of configuration\nif you need more wattage on one port you\n\n477\n00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:38.070\ncan do that and it lessens it on others?\n\n478\n00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.760\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of a weird way\nin which the switch works.\n\n479\n00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.350\nUsually the switch is told, this how much\npower you have period overall, okay?\n\n480\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.890\nAnd then they divide that up\ndepending on the port density,\n\n481\n00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.260\nthe number of ports on that device.\n\n482\n00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.024\nSo that's normally what you end up\nseeing where it can do certain amounts.\n\n483\n00:26:56.024 --> 00:26:57.637\nSo they're following those standards.\n\n484\n00:26:57.637 --> 00:27:01.739\nThe max that you should be able to push\nout through that one is gonna be that\n\n485\n00:27:01.739 --> 00:27:02.759\n25.5 watts.\n\n486\n00:27:02.759 --> 00:27:06.980\nBut you might have the ability,\nif you also needed to at times,\n\n487\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.019\nmaybe to be able to push\nout a little bit more.\n\n488\n00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:13.267\nIt always ranges a little\nbit differently and\n\n489\n00:27:13.267 --> 00:27:17.978\nkinda runs just a hair more or\nhair less, whatever you want to do.\n\n490\n00:27:17.978 --> 00:27:21.204\nSo, just kinda realize that usually\nit's the entire switch that's given,\n\n491\n00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:24.591\nit'll supply 900 watts of power and\nyou divide the power however you want to.\n\n492\n00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:29.574\nBut once you plug in everything and\nyou go, crud, I'm at 1,000 watts, well,\n\n493\n00:27:29.574 --> 00:27:31.568\nyou're gonna notice something.\n\n494\n00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:33.557\nNot every device is gonna get powered.\n\n495\n00:27:33.557 --> 00:27:35.774\nSo it's usually by the entire switch.\n\n496\n00:27:35.774 --> 00:27:37.166\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's a lot of great information, Ronnie.\n\n497\n00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:38.342\nKeep in mind what Ronnie said.\n\n498\n00:27:38.342 --> 00:27:41.035\nPay attention to those standards,\npay attention to the configuration, or\n\n499\n00:27:41.035 --> 00:27:42.561\nyou might not get\nthe power that you would.\n\n500\n00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:46.480\nNow, speaking of running out, it does\nlook like we're running out of time here.\n\n501\n00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.590\nBut Ronnie, I see our list here, and\n\n502\n00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.730\nI know we've got more to come when\nit comes to configuring a switch.\n\n503\n00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.100\nBut it looks like we're gonna\nhave to go into a part three.\n\n504\n00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.208\nSo, Ronnie, what do you say we go\nahead and we'll wrap this one up here.\n\n505\n00:27:55.208 --> 00:27:57.829\nWe'll leave them with a cliffhanger\nthen we'll bring it back for part three.\n\n506\n00:27:57.829 --> 00:27:58.713\nDoes that sound good?\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n507\n00:27:58.713 --> 00:28:02.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, signing out for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n508\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n509\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.463\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

00:00:08.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.092\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Hello to the viewers out there,\nthank you for joining ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.560\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and in today's\nepisode, we've got a great show for\n\n7\n00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.090\nyou in store, we are gonna be\ngoing through CompTia's net plus.\n\n8\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.510\nThat's right N10 006 and\njoining us back in the studios for\n\n9\n00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.450\na part three on the configuration of a\nswitch is none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.330\nRonnie how you doing sir?\n\n11\n00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.824\n&gt;&gt; I am doing great today.\n\n12\n00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:35.671\nReady to get started taking a look\nat configuring a switch and\n\n13\n00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.680\nthat is what we are actually going\nto do pretty much begin to do.\n\n14\n00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.334\nBut now a little bit more advanced details\nis what we're starting to take a look at.\n\n15\n00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:47.291\nEverything that we normally do\non the switch up in this point,\n\n16\n00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.900\nwe do on a single switch.\n\n17\n00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.730\nAnd in most environments, a small office\nor maybe even a single office environment,\n\n18\n00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.510\nwhere you have 3 or 4,\nmaybe 15 people, no big deal.\n\n19\n00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.830\nThat's what happens.\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.490\nBut what happens when you now start to\nwork in an environment where there's\n\n21\n00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.140\nmultiple switches?\n\n22\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.520\nAnd you start actually working\nbetween multiple LANs inside of your\n\n23\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.290\ncompany as well.\n\n24\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.175\nSo, for example,\nyou might have a marketing department, and\n\n25\n00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.487\nyou might have a sales team.\n\n26\n00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:20.260\nYou might have other\ndepartments that are out there.\n\n27\n00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.980\nAnd now you have multiple switches\nthat you're dealing with this,\n\n28\n00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.550\nmultiple subnets that\nyou're also dealing with.\n\n29\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.070\nThat is the type of configuration\nthat we need to begin to deal with\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850\nat least to show you some of the things\nthat you're gonna end up seeing.\n\n31\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.870\nSo there's a lot for us to actually\ncover as we get started here.\n\n32\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.781\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie you can have, for instance,\n\n33\n00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:42.656\nI know there's sometimes when you could\nhave, like you said, multiple switches,\n\n34\n00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.116\nand obviously we break up our switches\ninto logical divisions like VLANS.\n\n35\n00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:48.320\nWe've talked about them in past episodes.\n\n36\n00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.140\nI know there are certain scenarios there,\n\n37\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.335\nwhere a switch might need to pass\nsimultaneous traffic over a single port.\n\n38\n00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:56.825\nBut we've got the division, right?\n\n39\n00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:01.035\nSo how is it that a switch\ncan allow communications\n\n40\n00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:05.125\nover a single port when it could\npotentially go to multiple VLANs?\n\n41\n00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.395\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we're actually\nstarting to take a look at,\n\n42\n00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.385\nis if we have a single switch, and\n\n43\n00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:14.160\nwe are actually using that switch to\nservice multiple different subnets.\n\n44\n00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.340\nWell, there's two technologies\nthat are gonna be involved.\n\n45\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.730\nOne is VLANs and we haven't gotten to\nthat one yet but we'll get into that.\n\n46\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.800\nBut it's simple,\nI can essentially take my switch and\n\n47\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.410\nsubdivide it up into smaller\nmultiple switches if I want to.\n\n48\n00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.300\nBut when I do so, they are treated\nas if they're separate switches,\n\n49\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.190\nthat there is no connection\nin between them.\n\n50\n00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.380\nThey're gonna be treated as if they're\nisolated, okay, so we can do that.\n\n51\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.010\nBut the other thing that we need to\ndo is now that we've isolated them,\n\n52\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.440\nevery single port inside that VLAN is\nnot gonna communicate with another VLAN.\n\n53\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.981\nAnd for me to just connect a single port\non this particular switch to another\n\n54\n00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:53.737\nswitch as well and I need to pass traffic\nback and forth between them if there's\n\n55\n00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:58.949\nactually VLANs on both of them that they\nshare, well, it normally doesn't happen.\n\n56\n00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.620\nAnd that's because each port's\nonly designed to carry one VLAN.\n\n57\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.780\nBut you can configure a switch\nport to do what we call trunking\n\n58\n00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.640\nthat will help us out.\n\n59\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.630\nAnd trunking just says, look,\nI don't care what the VLAN is.\n\n60\n00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.480\nI'm gonna allow traffic\nto pass through it.\n\n61\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.200\nAnd that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at configuring.\n\n62\n00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.541\nSo let me kind of show you an example\nof what we're talking about.\n\n63\n00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:20.710\nAnd I've got a diagram up to kind\nof help us out just a little.\n\n64\n00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.228\nWe're gonna be using this diagram to help\nus out on a couple of other things too.\n\n65\n00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:28.440\nSo let's take for an example that each of\nthese two devices over here on the right\n\n66\n00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.145\nare actually in two separate VLANs here.\n\n67\n00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:37.050\nI've gotta pick my poison here as\nfar as a drawing tool and utility.\n\n68\n00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.290\nLet me do that and\nbump up the size a little bit.\n\n69\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.100\nSo this is a new feature on\nour new toy that we have.\n\n70\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.620\nWe've been using this software for years,\n\n71\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.090\nbut let's say that this one actually is in\none particular VLAN, and then this other\n\n72\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.780\ndevice over here is in another VLAN,\nokay, is what we're actually seeing.\n\n73\n00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.310\nNow when we have that, and PC1 wants\nto communicate with only one of these.\n\n74\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.070\nNormally the way that this happens is that\nas long as the link's in between them,\n\n75\n00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.490\nthey're on that same V-LAN no big deal.\n\n76\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.130\nBut if there are multiple VLAN's\nacross all these switches\n\n77\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.180\nthe only way to do that is\nby trunking them together.\n\n78\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.850\nSo we can create what we call a trunk\nbetween Switch B and Switch A up here.\n\n79\n00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.492\nThat'll allow it to pass through\nall of the VLAN traffic and\n\n80\n00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.930\nthen in-between Switch a and\nSwitch c to allow it to pass through, and\n\n81\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.990\nthen also of course the other way too.\n\n82\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.550\nSo you can do that.\n\n83\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.950\nSo we're just gonna configure a simple\ntrunk to show you how that's done.\n\n84\n00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.780\nIf you're having a problem communicating\nbetween the same or multiple VLANs on one\n\n85\n00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.660\nswitch, such as Switch b, and multiple\nVLANs over on another switch, check and\n\n86\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.320\nmake sure that both sides\nof the connections here and\n\n87\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.440\nover here, that they are going\nto be what we call trunking.\n\n88\n00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.019\nAnd there's a couple of\ndifferent types here,\n\n89\n00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:56.928\nI've gotta switch back to my\nlab over here to do this.\n\n90\n00:04:56.928 --> 00:05:02.082\nWhen you start to actually talk about\nthe idea of trunking, so here I'm gonna\n\n91\n00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:08.450\nmake a trunk between my switch that I'm\non, which is gonna be NY Access one here.\n\n92\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.740\nAnd between one called NYCORE1\nis what I'm going to do.\n\n93\n00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.303\nSo if I select this one,\nI need to go into the enable.\n\n94\n00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:22.360\nLet's see if it actually\nallows me to type in there.\n\n95\n00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.400\nIt's asking for a user name so\nI'm gonna type it in as Wes.\n\n96\n00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.512\nCisco one, two, three and then enable.\n\n97\n00:05:35.512 --> 00:05:36.056\nCisco one, two, three.\n\n98\n00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:40.007\nAnd now that I'm in here logged\nin as Wes to be able to do this,\n\n99\n00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:43.572\nI now need to go into my\nglobal configuration mode, and\n\n100\n00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:46.615\nonce I'm in here I can\nnow pick the interface.\n\n101\n00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:52.325\nThis is gonna be fastethernet,\n\n102\n00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.319\nall as one word.\n\n103\n00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.130\n0/24 I gotta be able to read.\n\n104\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.800\nI have my little diagram but it's tiny.\n\n105\n00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:07.910\n0/24 and I need to configure this as\na particular trunk to make it work.\n\n106\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.460\nNow if I do something like this and\n\n107\n00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.425\nI'm configuring this as a trunk,\nI just need to do switch port and mode,\n\n108\n00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:19.130\nor actually there's a couple\nof ways that this can happen.\n\n109\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.140\nSo let's try it first.\n\n110\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.880\nJust switch port and mode trunk.\n\n111\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.380\nSo switch port mode trunk and\nthat initializes it and\n\n112\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.260\nsays hey, you're about to do this,\nit kind of carries on for a moment here.\n\n113\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.566\nAnd if I want to set what's called\nan encapsulation type as well.\n\n114\n00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.689\nLet's just switch port.\n\n115\n00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:45.310\nEncapsulation.1Q, oops, if I can spell it.\n\n116\n00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.850\nNow here it may actually not like it\nat all, due to the very fact that\n\n117\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.330\nsome of these newer switches say look,\nthere's only one encapsulation method.\n\n118\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.500\nOn older switches there might have been\ntwo, so you had to manually set these up.\n\n119\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.320\nThere was one called ISL,\nwhich is the inner switch linking.\n\n120\n00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.720\nAnd then there's one called .1Q trunking\nwhich is another encapsulation method.\n\n121\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.515\nThat technically is not\nencapsulation method,\n\n122\n00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:13.840\nit is a tagging method\nis what it's called.\n\n123\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.000\nSo this allows for us to this on one end.\n\n124\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.030\nAnd then over on NYCORE1 over here.\n\n125\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.910\nThat's when I haven't setup anything on,\nbut I need to go into the proper link\n\n126\n00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.052\non this side, which\n\n127\n00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:37.900\nis gonna be interface\nfast ethernet 1/0/22.\n\n128\n00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.797\nAnd I would do the same thing here.\n\n129\n00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:44.041\nSwitch port, mode trunk and\nnow it says hey,\n\n130\n00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:50.856\nthis interface encapsulation auto,\nit cannot be configured as trunk,\n\n131\n00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:56.456\nso saying I need to do a switch port,\ntrunk encapsulation.\n\n132\n00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:04.410\nDot One in queue, there we go.\n\n133\n00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.989\nSo this side,\na little bit of an older switch,\n\n134\n00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:09.517\nnotice that it would\nactually support both.\n\n135\n00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:13.364\nUnless I do that, then I could\ndo the switchport or a trunk and\n\n136\n00:08:13.364 --> 00:08:15.560\nnow it accepts the command.\n\n137\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.970\nSo we saw where one switch said,\n\n138\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.970\nhey, I'm newer, I only accept one\nmethod which is the .1 queue tagging.\n\n139\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.475\nThe other side said,\nI'll accept two different methods,\n\n140\n00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:28.973\nso it required me to set it up and to\nmanually configure it for that trunking.\n\n141\n00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:30.340\nSo you may have to play around with that.\n\n142\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.815\nNow we're not showing you this so\n\n143\n00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:34.630\nthat you can understand all\nthe details to it right now.\n\n144\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.530\nBut if you do wanna learn that make sure\nyou check out the Cisco CCNA shows and\n\n145\n00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.720\nyou'll learn more about it than\nyou ever thought that you could.\n\n146\n00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.530\nSo just kind of realize that that's\nwhat you'll actually end up getting.\n\n147\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.840\nBut that's the basics of what we call\ntrunking that we're actually establishing.\n\n148\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.800\nAnd the key point to take away from\nthis is that if you're running\n\n149\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.920\nmultiple VLANs on multiple switches,\nand they need to communicate, and\n\n150\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.408\nthey're not communicating,\nyou need to implement trunking.\n\n151\n00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:03.350\nWhether it's 802.1Q or ISIL,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n152\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.460\nToday 802.1Q is kind of the method\nthat we're talking about.\n\n153\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.590\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I know from time to time there\nmight be a reason that maybe you need to\n\n154\n00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.700\nsee the traffic that is on\na specific port, whether it be for\n\n155\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.940\ndiagnostic purposes,\nmaybe security auditing purposes.\n\n156\n00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.030\nIs there a way that if I got\ntraffic going in the one port,\n\n157\n00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.020\nI can plug into another port and be able\nto actually see that traffic that's going\n\n158\n00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.150\non that first port that\nmight be in question?\n\n159\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you can do things like\nthat on the switch as well,\n\n160\n00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.710\nlet me see if I can show you an example\nback to my diagram over here,\n\n161\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.140\nsee which way I have to go and\nyeah we'll do that.\n\n162\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.950\nSo, on this particular diagram, we can\ndo exactly what Wes was talking about.\n\n163\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.460\nLet's see if I can not drop\neverything on my here.\n\n164\n00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.740\nOver here on left hand side,\n\n165\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.830\nthis is what we call port mirroring\nif this is what you're talking about.\n\n166\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.010\nSo let's take for example,\nthat this entire network is gateway,\n\n167\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.580\nis pretty much out over\nhere off of this router.\n\n168\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.700\nAnd I wanna capture all the traffic\ngoing to every single vLAN,\n\n169\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.440\neverything that's actually out there.\n\n170\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.460\nWell I can do that.\n\n171\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.180\nAnd the way I do that is, by implementing\nwhat is called port mirroring here, okay.\n\n172\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.370\nI say what the source port is,\nwhich is gonna be this port here.\n\n173\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.520\nAnd then I tell it to send a copy\nof all that traffic to this port.\n\n174\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.490\nIn which my device that\nI'm monitoring with and\n\n175\n00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.830\nthe software that I'm monitoring\nwith is on this device over here.\n\n176\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.340\nSo as regular traffic goes through,\nit will actually duplicate and\n\n177\n00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.520\nmake another copy of that traffic, and\nsend a copy of it to this one port.\n\n178\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.980\nNow you will have issues with this\ndepending on the speed of your network.\n\n179\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.790\nSo for example, this interface\nright here is a gigabit interface,\n\n180\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.050\nwhich can happen and\nif this one is a 100 megabit interface,\n\n181\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.985\nwell if you send more than 100\nmegabits of traffic through here,\n\n182\n00:10:50.985 --> 00:10:53.960\nyou're gonna drop packets,\nyou're gonna lose something.\n\n183\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.450\nIt's just the way to go.\n\n184\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.120\nSo the better way to do this if you have\nthe chance and opportunity of course, make\n\n185\n00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.600\nsure it's a gig port, but also that you\nuse something that we call a network tap.\n\n186\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.920\nThat essentially works\nexactly like a phone tap.\n\n187\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.060\nThat's where there's a physical\nconnection into that wire right there,\n\n188\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.930\nwhere it sends a copy of it off to you,\nand you don't lose any degradation, or\n\n189\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.520\nhave to actually worry about the idea of\noversubscribing that particular port.\n\n190\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.860\nSo you can do this, it is\na configuration that is out there but\n\n191\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.870\nit's a bit complex to make it work.\n\n192\n00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.870\nAnd that's why instead of me typing\nit out, I just went ahead and\n\n193\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.340\njust tried to show you\nthe elements of this as well.\n\n194\n00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.010\nSo inside of a Cisco switch,\n\n195\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.970\nyou just tell it what port you want\nto monitor your session number.\n\n196\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.829\nThat number can be\nanything that you want to.\n\n197\n00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:42.138\nAnd the source port, so\nlet's say that this is port number 10, and\n\n198\n00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:45.160\nthen you tell it where's\nthat traffic gonna be sent?\n\n199\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.080\nAnd notice it's not difficult.\n\n200\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.820\nMost of the commands that we've typed in,\nnotice we're only like two, three,\n\n201\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.780\nfour words max on a Cisco switch.\n\n202\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.430\nBut you can kind of see here,\nwhere I said send a copy over to this one,\n\n203\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.070\nand that's all it's gonna do.\n\n204\n00:11:58.070 --> 00:11:59.570\nIt's gonna duplicate that.\n\n205\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.490\nBut it does take a little\nbit of CPU cycles, so\n\n206\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.030\nyour switch performance may suffer\nif you have a ton of traffic\n\n207\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.100\ngoing through whatever ports that\nyou're monitoring to do this.\n\n208\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.860\nSo that is a big part, something that you\ndefinitely need to take a look at as well.\n\n209\n00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.020\nNow, when you start to do this,\nyou're probably going to have software on\n\n210\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.100\nthis machine that will also\nallow you to see that traffic.\n\n211\n00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.020\nSo if you ever run something like\nWireshark you can do this as well,\n\n212\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.820\nto be able to capture that information.\n\n213\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.820\nOr you have another network monitoring\ntool that can help you do that and\n\n214\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.770\ndo analysis,\nyou'll use that tool as well, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:42.010\nAll right, we also wanna talk a little\nbit about what we call port bonding,\n\n216\n00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.640\nfor a moment.\n\n217\n00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.340\nLet me see if I can find the right one,\nhere we go, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.170\nSo let's talk about this\nidea of port bonding.\n\n219\n00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.210\nNow, I've just mentioned where\na gigabit connection right\n\n220\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.730\nsending traffic into a hundred megabit.\n\n221\n00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.140\nIt can be done and\nyou don't tend to drop a lot.\n\n222\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.320\nBut if you really send\nthe gigabit to 100 megabits,\n\n223\n00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.890\nit's gonna drop some traffic\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n224\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.460\nSo how can we fix stuff\nlike that if we need to?\n\n225\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.290\nWell, let's take a look at my\ndiagram here on the screen.\n\n226\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.750\nWe can instead use what\nwe call Redundant Links.\n\n227\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.040\nSo instead of having a single\nconnection between switches,\n\n228\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.910\nlet's set up two multiple connections.\n\n229\n00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.530\nThen I can configure them\nto be treated as one.\n\n230\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:28.070\nSo that now instead of actually having a\nsinge 100 megabit connection between these\n\n231\n00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:33.260\nswitches, I can take two of these ports,\nbond them together,\n\n232\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.050\nsoftware like, in other words,\nwith a configuration.\n\n233\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:42.830\nAnd make that essentially into one big\n200 megabit connection if I wanted to.\n\n234\n00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.800\nNow you can do this up to\neight different connections.\n\n235\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:50.320\nSo it just depends on your connection and\nhow many ports you're willing to lose.\n\n236\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.560\nBut you can actually have something like\nthis done and that's what it's doing,\n\n237\n00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.170\nit's actually bonding together.\n\n238\n00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.460\nBy doing this, you get two advantages.\n\n239\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.830\nOne, you get the idea of\naggregating the bandwidth, okay.\n\n240\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:07.170\nSo instead of one, you get 200 MB, which\nis good, the other one is fail-over, okay.\n\n241\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:12.320\nEven though these are two separate\nconnections, if one of these links fails,\n\n242\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.110\nthe other one's still up and active.\n\n243\n00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.080\nSo you get fail-over protection,\nyou get double the bandwidth here.\n\n244\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.399\nSo if all of a sudden, that one port\ngoes down You can plug into another\n\n245\n00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.635\nPort from that connection again and\n\n246\n00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:28.905\nnow you have up and running while\nyou troubleshoot the port is down.\n\n247\n00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:32.314\nIt really is a great configuration\nto think about and the make and\n\n248\n00:14:32.314 --> 00:14:35.418\nI'm going to show you how to\nset up one of these tight here.\n\n249\n00:14:35.418 --> 00:14:40.001\nSo the great thing is I have already\ngot this to a point set up for\n\n250\n00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:42.041\nus to be able to take a look.\n\n251\n00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:47.858\nNow over on NYCORE2,\nI've already set it up on that side.\n\n252\n00:14:47.858 --> 00:14:54.640\nSo on NYCORE1, we'll kind of come over\nhere and get this one ready to go as well.\n\n253\n00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.880\nSo I'm ready in the configuration,\nI'm gonna go back out to the global\n\n254\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.040\nconfiguration and do what is called\nan interface range command for\n\n255\n00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:11.910\nfast ethernet 1/0/23 /24 and\n\n256\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:17.760\nthat will allow me to configure both\nof those interfaces at the same time.\n\n257\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:24.049\nOnce I do that, I do my switchport,\n\n258\n00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:29.300\ntrunk encapsulation.1Q.\n\n259\n00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:35.680\nAnd then I do my switchport\nto change it into a trunk,\n\n260\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.320\nmode trunk and I will also do this other\n\n261\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.404\nthing which is switchport nonegotiate.\n\n262\n00:15:47.757 --> 00:15:52.726\nThat's because there's something\ncalled dynamic trunking protocol,\n\n263\n00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:54.336\ndon't worry about it.\n\n264\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:58.332\nBut it's something that we always do just\nto make sure that we're not trunking in\n\n265\n00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.170\nany way or mode.\n\n266\n00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.897\nAnd I create what's\ncalled a channel group.\n\n267\n00:16:03.897 --> 00:16:12.760\nTen mode and I tell it to put it into\nactive, Is what I do there, okay?\n\n268\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.860\nNow what's happening here, right,\nis that it's saying take those two ports,\n\n269\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.660\ngroup them together and\nthen make them actively trunk here.\n\n270\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.830\nNow there's a couple of different\ntechnologies that are involved in this.\n\n271\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.290\nLet me see if I can, no, I didn't\nactually put it on the slide there.\n\n272\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.329\nThere's one that we call LACP,\nwhich is link aggregation protocol.\n\n273\n00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:37.058\nAnd then there's one that's called PAGP\nas well, [ort aggregation protocol.\n\n274\n00:16:37.058 --> 00:16:39.192\nThe Cisco one is the port\naggregation protocol,\n\n275\n00:16:39.192 --> 00:16:41.320\nwhich is its proprietary version.\n\n276\n00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.120\nWorks great, but you have to be\non all Cisco switches, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.530\nIf you are running different switches,\n\n278\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.240\nyou can use LACP between\nthose different switches.\n\n279\n00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.420\nSo this is more of an open\nstandard way of doing this.\n\n280\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.060\nSo if everything is up and running,\n\n281\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.021\nall I need to do here is I need to exit,\nget out of that.\n\n282\n00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:04.247\nAnd then type in a show etherchannel,\n\n283\n00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:12.320\ncuz that's what the technology is\npretty much based around, summary.\n\n284\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.360\nAnd what you'll end up seeing\nare a couple of different things, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.450\nOne is, here's the summarized\ninformation down here at the bottom.\n\n286\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.440\nWhich you might go, hey,\nis this good or not?\n\n287\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.220\nWell, notice the Group 10, that was\njust a number that I assigned to it.\n\n288\n00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.426\nAnd it now actually sees both of those\ninterfaces as port channel number ten.\n\n289\n00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:35.590\nAnd it has this SU, okay?\n\n290\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.300\nThe capital S means here that\nit is a layer two connection,\n\n291\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.800\nwhich is what we want.\n\n292\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.960\nAnd the other one is this U,\nwhich tells it is in use.\n\n293\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960\nAnd that means what?\n\n294\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.720\nThat it is active and it is ready to go.\n\n295\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.930\nIt is aggregating the bandwidth\ntogether for this.\n\n296\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.780\nAnd then it tells you the protocol, and\n\n297\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.670\nthen you also have these capital Ps\nover here showing you what's linked.\n\n298\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.910\nYou might go, hey,\nis this actually working?\n\n299\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:06.137\nWell, yes, it's P for bundled in\nthe port channel, the capital P.\n\n300\n00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:08.090\nSo everything is now up.\n\n301\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:12.276\nThe more that I add in here, up to eight,\nyou'll actually see it also end up adding\n\n302\n00:18:12.276 --> 00:18:16.117\nin all those ports in here, and\nwe'll be able to actually have that going.\n\n303\n00:18:16.117 --> 00:18:20.939\nSo, if you are having to do this between\nmultiple switches because either\n\n304\n00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:24.516\nit's too slow in between or\nyou need both the bandwidth\n\n305\n00:18:24.516 --> 00:18:29.300\nto be faster in between those switches,\nas well as the failover.\n\n306\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.411\nThe idea of using LACP is\nsomething that's easily done and\n\n307\n00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:34.642\nsomething that we actually think about.\n\n308\n00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:39.175\nTechnically, on the CompTIA objectives,\nthey call it port bonding,\n\n309\n00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:41.870\nis what they actually call it here.\n\n310\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.840\nAnd so you may hear those terms.\n\n311\n00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.430\nPort bonding, link aggregation,\nthey all mean the same thing.\n\n312\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.400\nBut make sure you actually kind\nof see that as well, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.092\nSo that's one of the other technologies\nthat we also have to at least be aware of\n\n314\n00:18:57.092 --> 00:18:59.096\nthat we can do with our switches.\n\n315\n00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:02.807\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, in other episodes, I've\ntalked about things like, for instance,\n\n316\n00:19:02.807 --> 00:19:04.080\nthe auto-negotiation.\n\n317\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.023\nA lot of times that happens when\na device is plugged into a switch and\n\n318\n00:19:07.023 --> 00:19:08.402\nit boots up for the first time.\n\n319\n00:19:08.402 --> 00:19:10.884\nI know the switch and\nthe device communicate.\n\n320\n00:19:10.884 --> 00:19:15.209\nAnd they kinda auto-negotiate their\nspeed settings we're showing you,\n\n321\n00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:17.140\nthe duplexing configurations.\n\n322\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.250\nNow we've also mentioned, too,\nthat that's not always the case, but\n\n323\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.180\nwe've really only seen\nit on the client side.\n\n324\n00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.840\nCan you show us a little bit about what we\nmight need to think about when it comes to\n\n325\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.560\nthe switch side of things like speed and\nduplexing?\n\n326\n00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.970\n&gt;&gt; Now this is kinda the simplest\nthing in the world for\n\n327\n00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.580\nthose that are experienced in it.\n\n328\n00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.366\nWhen you're new, you're not sure whether\nor not you should set it or not.\n\n329\n00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:37.013\nMost of us just leave it alone, okay,\n\n330\n00:19:37.013 --> 00:19:39.780\nbecause it's easier to\nleave alone cuz it works.\n\n331\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.780\nSo, here's what the skinny is when it\ncomes down to real world environments.\n\n332\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.050\nIf you're just connecting laptops into it,\nwhich most of are, or desktop machines,\n\n333\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.918\nyou don't have to worry about the port or\nthe speed or the duplex, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:56.930\nIt will auto-negotiate and will do\nwhatever it need to do, which is fine.\n\n335\n00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.003\nThe time that you worry about speed and\nduplexing is when you connect them\n\n336\n00:20:01.003 --> 00:20:04.629\ntogether with things like other switches,\nokay, or routers.\n\n337\n00:20:04.629 --> 00:20:07.734\nAnd you wanna make sure that\nyou're hard-setting those so\n\n338\n00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:12.320\nthat there is no guessing whether or\nnot it's actually working correctly.\n\n339\n00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.213\nSo as much autoconfiguration stuff\nthat's done on switches and routers,\n\n340\n00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:19.115\nyou'll see people that have been at for\na years saying,\n\n341\n00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:22.224\nI don't want auto-negotiation for\njust about anything.\n\n342\n00:20:22.224 --> 00:20:26.160\nBecause it means now you're guessing\nwhether or not it actually is working.\n\n343\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.382\nAnd sometimes it will work,\nsometimes it wont.\n\n344\n00:20:28.382 --> 00:20:31.730\nYou hardset it by controlling\nit by setting the speed.\n\n345\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.130\nBy setting duplex,\n\n346\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.440\nyou're not guessing whether\nthe other side is set up correctly.\n\n347\n00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.330\nYou're actually telling it,\nthis is what it's at and now you know.\n\n348\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.520\nSo if you are trunking between\ntwo different switches,\n\n349\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.640\nyou're going to go ahead and\nset the speed and the duplex.\n\n350\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.468\nAnd that way you know that there's\nno auto-negotiation that's\n\n351\n00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:52.774\ncausing anything that fails in place.\n\n352\n00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:55.720\nAll right, now the great thing is that\nyou can actually do this very quickly.\n\n353\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.630\nSo let's go to our switch here.\n\n354\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.923\nAnd I'm just going to pick up\non this switch that I'm on here.\n\n355\n00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:05.297\nAnd I'm just gonna pick,\nI know it's weird, a random port number,\n\n356\n00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:07.284\nwhich is pretty not the greatest thing.\n\n357\n00:21:07.284 --> 00:21:08.647\nOo, maybe I can't do it.\n\n358\n00:21:08.647 --> 00:21:10.594\nShow IP INT brief.\n\n359\n00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:18.987\nLet me find a port that's\nactually available.\n\n360\n00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:20.033\nOkay, there we go.\n\n361\n00:21:20.033 --> 00:21:21.772\nIt's cuz they're all three digits,\nthat's why.\n\n362\n00:21:25.654 --> 00:21:27.577\nAll right, so INT FA, so\n\n363\n00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:33.172\nI'm abbreviating again cuz now I'm\nstarting to get there, all right.\n\n364\n00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:36.649\nNow if I wanna set speed,\nI type in, well, speed, and\n\n365\n00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:39.860\nthen I'm gonna do a question mark.\n\n366\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.290\nSo notice how I can force it to do ten\nmegabits, a hundred megabits, or auto.\n\n367\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.106\nAuto is fine in most cases.\n\n368\n00:21:46.106 --> 00:21:50.250\nIf I use port number ten to do trunking,\n\n369\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.283\nI would instead set\nthe speed to one-hundred.\n\n370\n00:21:55.283 --> 00:21:56.700\nAnd the same thing with duplexing.\n\n371\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.490\nSo if I know I'm actually going\nto be setting the duplex, well,\n\n372\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.520\nnotice it has auto,\nwhich is what's on by default.\n\n373\n00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.940\nI can do full or half.\n\n374\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.200\nNow you might go,\nwhen the heck would I ever set it to half?\n\n375\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.880\nWe normally wouldn't,\nnot in today's environment.\n\n376\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.031\nBut if you had a hub plugged into it\nthat's probably the only time that you\n\n377\n00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:18.567\nwould actually set it\nto half if you need to.\n\n378\n00:22:18.567 --> 00:22:22.647\nBut usually full is the one that you want\nas you're actually doing something like\n\n379\n00:22:22.647 --> 00:22:23.549\nthis for a trunk.\n\n380\n00:22:26.966 --> 00:22:32.620\nAnd then if I type in a do show run\nto show us the entire running config.\n\n381\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.510\nAnd let me see if I can get\ndown to port number ten.\n\n382\n00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.990\nYou can now see where that particular\ninformation is now plugged in for\n\n383\n00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.590\nonly that one port and\nit only affects that one port as well.\n\n384\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:49.197\nSo that's the only time that we would ever\nreally consider needing to set speed or\n\n385\n00:22:49.197 --> 00:22:49.860\nduplex.\n\n386\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.355\nUnless there is some requirement\nby that end-point device to do so,\n\n387\n00:22:54.355 --> 00:22:56.670\nmost of them are not gonna do that.\n\n388\n00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.723\nBut usually that's where\nyou would set that up.\n\n389\n00:22:59.723 --> 00:23:01.946\n&gt;&gt; I know from time to time, Ronnie, and\n\n390\n00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:06.395\nyou've kind of given us an example in\nthe earlier portions of this episode,\n\n391\n00:23:06.395 --> 00:23:10.580\nthat you might need to assign an IP\naddress to the switch and the device.\n\n392\n00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.590\nCan you show us a little bit about how\nwe might accomplish a task like that?\n\n393\n00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:15.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now this is something\nthat's a little bit strange.\n\n394\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.440\nSo earlier, we talked about\nsetting a management IP address,\n\n395\n00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.040\nright, where we could connect in.\n\n396\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.790\nBut that's not exactly what this\nparticular objective is calling on,\n\n397\n00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.160\nwhich is weird, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.670\nSo let me show you something,\nWes, on this switch here.\n\n399\n00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:35.760\nSo let's go back and now I'm gonna pick on\nanother one, 1/0/9, so the next one down.\n\n400\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.870\nNow earlier when I did the interface and\n\n401\n00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:48.230\nthe fast ethernet, interface VLAN 1,\nI was able to set an IP address.\n\n402\n00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.192\nYou saw that.\n\n403\n00:23:49.192 --> 00:23:51.269\nWe kinda watched it together\nin an earlier episode here.\n\n404\n00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:57.071\nBut this time, though, what happens\nif I try and set an IP address here,\n\n405\n00:23:57.071 --> 00:24:05.164\n192.168.0.256 here Notice\nit goes I can't do that.\n\n406\n00:24:05.164 --> 00:24:08.230\nBut I don't allow that to happen.\n\n407\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:14.060\nWell, the reason why this makes sense\nis because this is a layer 2 device and\n\n408\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.600\nIP addresses are set where?\n\n409\n00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.540\n&gt;&gt; That's on layer 3.\n\n410\n00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.510\n&gt;&gt; Layer 3.\n\n411\n00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.060\nSo you're saying, okay.\n\n412\n00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.880\nSo why would I ever do this?\n\n413\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.140\nWell, remember,\nI think it was in the first episode.\n\n414\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.750\nI talked about there's layer 2 switches.\n\n415\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.590\nThere's layer 3 switches\nthat are out there as well.\n\n416\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.388\nAnd if you wanted to,\nyou could change one of these switches\n\n417\n00:24:34.388 --> 00:24:39.510\ninto an actual routed port.\n\n418\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.810\nSo that way you can put an IP address on\none of these if it's a layer 3 switch.\n\n419\n00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.080\nNow, if there's not a layer 3 switch,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n420\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.050\nSo how do you do that?\n\n421\n00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:53.158\nWell, the way you do that is simply\nby typing in no switchport, okay?\n\n422\n00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:56.764\nAnd if it takes it,\nnow look at what happens here?\n\n423\n00:24:56.764 --> 00:25:00.345\nNow I'll do an IP address,\n\n424\n00:25:00.345 --> 00:25:04.430\n172.16.10.56.\n\n425\n00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.980\nWith the Subnet Mask and\nnow notice there it is.\n\n426\n00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:10.573\nI was able to add an IP address\ndirectly into that interface.\n\n427\n00:25:10.573 --> 00:25:13.140\nSo if you're taking a layer 2 switch and\n\n428\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.820\ngo, I still need to do\nrouting off of one of these.\n\n429\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.360\nWell than you can do this.\n\n430\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.720\nAnd it will actually allow you do to it.\n\n431\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.880\n&gt;&gt; So Ronny do I understand that right the\nreason it didn't take it the first time\n\n432\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.260\nis because the port itself was just off?\n\n433\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.332\nIs that what that was?\n\n434\n00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:28.919\n&gt;&gt; On and off,\nit was working as a switch port, okay?\n\n435\n00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:34.296\nAnd remember switches are layer 2, so by\ndoing no switch port we said it can now do\n\n436\n00:25:34.296 --> 00:25:40.780\nrouting as well as switching, but it only\nworks if the device has a layer 3 switch.\n\n437\n00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.603\nIf it's not a layer 3 switch or\n\n438\n00:25:42.603 --> 00:25:45.695\na multilayer switch it's\nnot going to work, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:50.790\nAll right, so this brings us of course to\na couple of different technologies here.\n\n440\n00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.090\nBut we wanna talk about\nthis idea of VLANs.\n\n441\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.970\nAnd we haven't even gotten into it and\nwe've mentioned it already twice.\n\n442\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.580\nBut I wanna show you just this\nidea right away as well, okay.\n\n443\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.641\nCuz this is what normally happens.\n\n444\n00:26:02.641 --> 00:26:07.303\nIn a working environment, somebody says,\nall right, Wes, I need you go ahead and\n\n445\n00:26:07.303 --> 00:26:11.985\nassign port numbers nine and ten, actually\nwe're gonna use seven and eight here.\n\n446\n00:26:11.985 --> 00:26:17.370\nSeven and eight into VLAN 20, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:17.885\nWhatever VLAN 20 is.\n\n448\n00:26:17.885 --> 00:26:19.580\nI don't even know what it is?\n\n449\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.358\nBut I need you to do that.\n\n450\n00:26:20.358 --> 00:26:22.750\nWell, could you?\n\n451\n00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.440\nWell, it's possible you could.\n\n452\n00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.387\nBut it's possible you, you don't know how?\n\n453\n00:26:26.387 --> 00:26:28.710\nSo that's what we're gonna\ntake a look at and do.\n\n454\n00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.759\nSo if it is two of them, I would just,\n\n455\n00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:38.251\ndo interface range and\nthen FA for fast ethernet,\n\n456\n00:26:38.251 --> 00:26:44.555\na shortened version of it zero/ 8,\nor 7 and then- 8.\n\n457\n00:26:44.555 --> 00:26:47.590\nThat way I'm actually\ngonna configure both.\n\n458\n00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.420\nThen I need to assign them to a VLAN.\n\n459\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.090\nWell, the only ports that you can\nassign into a VLAN is an access port.\n\n460\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:27:00.020\nSo I say switchport mode access and\n\n461\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.890\nthen switchport access.\n\n462\n00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:04.853\nAnd we'll put it in vlan 20.\n\n463\n00:27:04.853 --> 00:27:09.060\nAnd now, notice it tells me\nthat vlan 20 doesn't exist.\n\n464\n00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.270\nSo it's creating it so I can do that and\nput that into those VLANs there.\n\n465\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:20.600\nAnd now if I do something else,\nwhich is vlan 20, I can give it a name.\n\n466\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:26.080\nAnd we'll call it We'll call it Wes,\njust as an example there.\n\n467\n00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.850\nType in a do show VLAN brief.\n\n468\n00:27:31.536 --> 00:27:34.650\nAnd now when we do, or\nwe didn't take the name right now.\n\n469\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.145\nNotice that it actually did put\nthose two ports in the VLAN 20.\n\n470\n00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:40.067\nI don't know why it\ndidn't take the name yet,\n\n471\n00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:43.100\nmaybe I have to kind of exit\nout of it before I do that.\n\n472\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.040\nLet's see what happens here.\n\n473\n00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.190\nOr I'm going too fast,\nwhich would be amazing.\n\n474\n00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:55.280\nThere it goes, yep.\n\n475\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.700\nI was just,\nI was faster than the switch, Wes.\n\n476\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.630\nThat never happens, nevertheless.\n\n477\n00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:01.500\nSo I was faster than the switch.\n\n478\n00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.940\nSo there you see it change\nthe name of the VLAN.\n\n479\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.870\nI gave it an assignment.\n\n480\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.690\nI put two of these in there.\n\n481\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.230\nSo it's not very difficult\nif somebody says, hey,\n\n482\n00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.270\ncan you assign these ports to a VLAN?\n\n483\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.050\nVery simple command, right?\n\n484\n00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.310\nFind out what interface it is,\nget into that interface.\n\n485\n00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.690\nMake sure it's an access port.\n\n486\n00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.510\nSwitch port mode access.\n\n487\n00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.040\nAnd then from that point, switchboard,\naccess, and then the VLAN number\n\n488\n00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.440\nwith the word VLAN in front of it and\nyou're off and you're ready to go.\n\n489\n00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.500\n&gt;&gt; Rolley not only are you\nfaster than the switch now,\n\n490\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.230\nhelp me out with tome of this magic that\nyou're doing here in the background.\n\n491\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.980\nAre you literally taking us by\nassigning an IP address and\n\n492\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.780\nthen turning around and\nconfiguring a VLAN?\n\n493\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.860\nAre you moving us through the layers\nof the OSI model when it comes to\n\n494\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.630\nconfiguring this switch at the IP address,\nwe're on layer 3.\n\n495\n00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.260\nWe come back to VLANs, we've moved down a\nflight of stairs and we have a side model.\n\n496\n00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.730\n&gt;&gt; We're back at layer 2 technology again.\n\n497\n00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.840\nAnd we need to talk about\nthe idea of what a VLAN is now.\n\n498\n00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.634\nAnd even though in this initial\nconfiguration, I go, well,\n\n499\n00:28:57.634 --> 00:29:00.070\nhe hadn't talked about VLANs yet,\nwe're going to.\n\n500\n00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.367\nBut at least we've shown you some\ninitial configuration that if you become\n\n501\n00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:06.245\na networking professional,\nthese commands that we showed you,\n\n502\n00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:08.721\nthey're not the most difficult\ncommands in the world.\n\n503\n00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:11.700\nBut they should at least\nshow you what can be done.\n\n504\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.340\nAnd it's worth reviewing because\nit may be when I say all right,\n\n505\n00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.320\njust Kind of see if you can\nget this done and you do it.\n\n506\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.970\nAnd there's a little bit of time that\nwe still have to take to do that.\n\n507\n00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:24.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie that's one of\nthe things that I was thinking about,\n\n508\n00:29:24.147 --> 00:29:26.579\ncuz I know there's a lot that you have\nto explain when it comes to VLANs.\n\n509\n00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:28.495\nI know you've got a lot in store for\nus, but\n\n510\n00:29:28.495 --> 00:29:31.490\none of the things we're running\nshort on is the time on that clock.\n\n511\n00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.590\nSo how about this, Ronnie?\n\n512\n00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.535\nWe're gonna go into a part four here.\n\n513\n00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:35.570\nWe're gonna make this a short\nSteven King novel here.\n\n514\n00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:39.570\nWe'll come back in a part four and\ngive you a chance to explain VLANs.\n\n515\n00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.349\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n516\n00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:43.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace to wrap this one up.\n\n517\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.387\nWe've hoped you enjoyed signing up for\nITProTV.\n\n518\n00:29:45.387 --> 00:29:46.537\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n519\n00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:47.960\n&gt;&gt; I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n520\n00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.183\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n521\n00:29:49.183 -->

us.\n\n6\n00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.776\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan and\nin today's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:20.735\nwe're continuing through\nour series in Network+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:22.865\nThat's right, N10-006.\n\n9\n00:00:22.865 --> 00:00:25.160\nAnd we've got a lot of great information.\n\n10\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.380\nComing back with a part four is\nnone other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.770\nRonnie, how are you doing sir?\n\n12\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.170\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine today.\n\n13\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.920\nReady to get started and take a look at\nmore configuring a switch technology.\n\n14\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.010\nStuff that we really just have to\nat least have a basic grasp on.\n\n15\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.950\nAs we start entering into the world\nof networking professionally,\n\n16\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.050\nyou need to understand, of course,\nthe basic functionality of a switch.\n\n17\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440\nAnd we've gone over a lot of\nmaterial in taking a look at some of\n\n18\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.630\nthe configurations as we get started.\n\n19\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.400\nBut we're about to start\non a pretty big topic.\n\n20\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.600\nAnd actually we're gonna\nend on a big topic as well.\n\n21\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.412\nSo we've got a lot to cover here.\n\n22\n00:00:57.412 --> 00:01:00.740\nWell, Ronnie, there's a lot\nof networking pros out there.\n\n23\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.490\nThey throw out a lot of terms, so\n\n24\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.600\nI wanna make sure that I\nunderstand this concept of a VLAN.\n\n25\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.210\nSo can you provide me with\nsome kind of scenario in which\n\n26\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.900\nI might even use one of these\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n27\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.270\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nwhen it comes down to the concept of VLAN,\n\n28\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.540\nyou're gonna hear that term everywhere.\n\n29\n00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.070\nJust about every networking conversation.\n\n30\n00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.710\nYou can ask Wes.\n\n31\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.110\nEvery networking conversation\ntalks about using VLANs,\n\n32\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.610\nand every book that you end up\nreading talks about the idea of VLANs.\n\n33\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.930\nWell, what in the world\nis the idea of a VLAN?\n\n34\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.595\nA VLAN is technology that really\nallows us to take let's say for\n\n35\n00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:38.391\nan example a switch and\nsubdivide it up logically.\n\n36\n00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.213\nIn other words,\n\n37\n00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:43.660\nchop it into switches that we really need\neven though it's one physical switch.\n\n38\n00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.340\nSo you take a look at episode one if\nyou didn't happen to catch it and\n\n39\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.788\nyou jumped right into this one.\n\n40\n00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:49.910\nAnd you're going,\nI'm still wondering where the VLAN is,\n\n41\n00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.260\nwell we showed you an example\nof a 48 port switch.\n\n42\n00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.980\nNow, I'm not saying you can't\nuse all 48 ports cuz there\n\n43\n00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.380\nis definitely organizations that do so.\n\n44\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.730\nBut even for a small organization and\nthey buy that 48 port switch.\n\n45\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.290\nThey may not use all of them but even if\nthey do, more than likely not every single\n\n46\n00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.510\none of those ports is gonna be used for\nthe same exact network.\n\n47\n00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.590\nSo what we can do instead is that we\ncan set up what we'll call virtual\n\n48\n00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.150\nlocal area networks which\nis what VLAN stands for.\n\n49\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.310\nAnd we can essentially subdivide it and\nsay, hey,\n\n50\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.073\nthese six ports are gonna be in VLAN 1,\nokay, or VLAN 10.\n\n51\n00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:29.125\nThese seven over here\nare gonna be in VLAN 20.\n\n52\n00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:33.350\nWhatever it might be,\nyou can actually logically divide it up.\n\n53\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.850\nAnd when you start doing that,\n\n54\n00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.430\nit allows you again to take\none physical switch then.\n\n55\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.920\nAnd be able to treat it as if\nit's multiple switches, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.520\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n57\n00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.905\nNow, there's a flip side to this as well,\nWes.\n\n58\n00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:53.730\nWhen you actually start to put\nmultiple switches on the same network.\n\n59\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.100\nVLANs are not just limited\nto a single switch.\n\n60\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.550\nAnd what that means is if I add in\nan additional switch into my network,\n\n61\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.530\nwell now what if I said I didn't want all\nof those devices to be on one switch.\n\n62\n00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.936\nBut now I' wanna move some of\nthem to another switch here.\n\n63\n00:03:09.936 --> 00:03:13.300\nWell, what I'd have to do is not only\nphysically unplug those ports and\n\n64\n00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.600\nplug them in, but I would also then\n\n65\n00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.130\nmaybe have to change some of the\nreconfiguration to make everything work.\n\n66\n00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.500\nBut I can actually spread VLANs\nacross multiple switches.\n\n67\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.340\nLet me show you an example of what I'm\ntalking about right here on my screen.\n\n68\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.790\nI've got a diagram kind of set up for\nus so that we can do some of this and\n\n69\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.860\nto take a look.\n\n70\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.450\nSo let's take this top switch, and talk\nabout the idea of a single switch here.\n\n71\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.810\nSo on this one, I have a,\nlet's see, 24 port switch.\n\n72\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.530\nOkay, fairly common.\n\n73\n00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.260\nBut what I can do, if I wanted to,\nis I can say, hey.\n\n74\n00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.360\nThese four ports right here.\n\n75\n00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.670\nThey are gonna be in one VLAN.\n\n76\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.720\nI've got to kind of switch back and\nforth a little bit.\n\n77\n00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.960\nSo testing out some new software to help,\nit faded out completely?\n\n78\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.367\nI didn't mean to do that.\n\n79\n00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.763\nI didn't want it to fade at all, I just\nwanted to do what I said I was gonna do.\n\n80\n00:04:04.763 --> 00:04:06.672\nSo this is not gonna\nlet me save it between,\n\n81\n00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:08.830\nit may not let me save\nit in between swipes.\n\n82\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.750\nIt's still fading out.\n\n83\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.290\nLet me uncheck that, there we go.\n\n84\n00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.408\nLets try it again okay [LAUGH].\n\n85\n00:04:13.408 --> 00:04:16.600\nSo here let's put these four ports, and\n\n86\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.270\nI can say that those four ports are acting\nas if they're on their own switch.\n\n87\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.390\nSo that can be, again,\nwhatever VLAN that we want it to.\n\n88\n00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.961\nThen I can pick another color,\nand I can even say these ports,\n\n89\n00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:34.761\nright here, along with,\nthese ports are also on another VLAN.\n\n90\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.370\nAnd I can do the same thing with well,\nindividual ports if I want to.\n\n91\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.410\nSo notice that all of these ports that I'm\nactually assigning different colors to,\n\n92\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.160\nthey're representing a VLAN,\nis what they're actually doing.\n\n93\n00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.310\nNow when we do something like this,\nit worked perfectly fine.\n\n94\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.990\nIt now actually sees inside of\nthat switch really three separate,\n\n95\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.010\nI'm trying to count colors here,\nthree separate VLANs on this switch.\n\n96\n00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.850\nAnd for us to be able to communicate\nbetween them we can't do so directly.\n\n97\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.640\nWe would need to go through a layer\nthree device like a router to do so.\n\n98\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.830\nAnd that would have to be\ntrunked to this switch.\n\n99\n00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.603\nBut we're not really getting\ninto that right now.\n\n100\n00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:20.930\nWhat we wanna do, so that way we can\nseparate this out so in that way,\n\n101\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.740\nwe can more efficiently use that 24 port,\n\n102\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.570\n40 port switch and not have to worry about\nall these other ports that are out there.\n\n103\n00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.656\nSo now, they will act as if they're\nactually on their individual switch.\n\n104\n00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:39.280\nNow if we go ahead and\nwe can do something like this as well.\n\n105\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.984\nWhere I can say,\nhey VLANs can be spread across this way.\n\n106\n00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:52.613\nAnd I can't do that for\neveryone where I've.\n\n107\n00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.892\nOr we can do stuff like this where\nthe VLANs actually go across\n\n108\n00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:01.730\nmultiple switches.\n\n109\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.095\nAnd now when it goes\nacross multiple switches,\n\n110\n00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:09.170\nthey're also gonna be treated as if\nthey're actually on the same switch.\n\n111\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.270\nSo that way the device that's\nplugged in up here is also going\n\n112\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.180\nto be able to directly talk to devices\nthat are also plugged in down here.\n\n113\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.760\nAnd that's really a nice\naspect of what things,\n\n114\n00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.590\nlook at the size of that, that cursor.\n\n115\n00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.460\nSo there you go.\n\n116\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.180\nSo hopefully you can see that Wes,\nI don't know if you can.\n\n117\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.400\nThe cursor was a little\nsmall at this point.\n\n118\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.610\nBut you can see that\nthat's what we can do.\n\n119\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.640\nSo VLAN technology into itself and\n\n120\n00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.660\nactually configuring is not\nvery difficult overall.\n\n121\n00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.070\nBut understanding the concept\nbehind it is key, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.900\nSo that is what we're trying to do.\n\n123\n00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.670\nBy default, every switch in IS,\nand you can see it over here.\n\n124\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.400\nEvery single port by default\nwhen you pull it out of the box.\n\n125\n00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.840\nEvery port is in VLAN1 is what\nyou actually end up seeing there.\n\n126\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.440\nSo that is kinda the basics\nwhen you start to take a look.\n\n127\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.610\nIf I come over here and\n\n128\n00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.890\nlet's see the switch I have not really\nmessed with is right here over on NYCORE2.\n\n129\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.620\nLet me kind of show you\nsomething if I can get into it.\n\n130\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.790\nIs I type in a do show.\n\n131\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.070\nOops, not do show, show vlan brief.\n\n132\n00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.560\nAnd as I do so,\n\n133\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.050\nyou can see that this particular switch,\nI've done nothing else to it.\n\n134\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.920\nEvery single port is natively\ninside of the default VLAN\n\n135\n00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.610\nwhich is also what's called VLAN1.\n\n136\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.630\nOkay, so every switch that you\ntend to buy this managed switch.\n\n137\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.215\nIt goes ahead and it puts them ahead and\n\n138\n00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:40.760\nit puts them into a VLAN regardless of\nwhether or not you're using them or not.\n\n139\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.620\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, does this go back to\nthe first part where you said that with\n\n140\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.800\na managed switch, it comes out of the box.\n\n141\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.760\nI could plug it right in.\n\n142\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.530\nIt goes up and it starts running.\n\n143\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.253\nBut we're still gonna have to do\nsome configuration to tailor make\n\n144\n00:07:52.253 --> 00:07:54.846\nthe individual configuration\nof the switch,\n\n145\n00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:57.454\nin order to meet the needs\nwithin our network.\n\n146\n00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:59.099\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's right.\n\n147\n00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:02.476\nSo if you don't wanna configure it,\nyou can use it just like it is And\n\n148\n00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:06.347\nthen like we said, it will act as the\nbasic functionality of any switch here.\n\n149\n00:08:06.347 --> 00:08:09.110\nAnd that's because they're\nall along the same VLAN.\n\n150\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.590\nBut if I were to take one of those ports,\nand if we take a look at my screen again.\n\n151\n00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.750\nIf I were to take one of those ports and\nput them down here into VLAN 5, or 6.\n\n152\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.710\nNow, let's take a look at\nthe screen again, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.430\nIf I were to take one of these ports and\nput them down into VLAN 5 or\n\n154\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.590\n6 here, well,\nthen that would be isolated off.\n\n155\n00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.560\nAnd they would no longer\nbe able to communicate\n\n156\n00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.160\nwith these other ports directly.\n\n157\n00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.630\nThis is where you would need\nthat router to come in.\n\n158\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.950\nOr if you a layer three switch you can\nconfigure to make it be able to do that.\n\n159\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.308\nSo that's the scenario in\nwhich we tend to use VLANs and\n\n160\n00:08:44.308 --> 00:08:47.964\nis if we know that we're gonna\nhave multiple departments.\n\n161\n00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:50.618\nAnd we want to isolate them or\nseparate them out so\n\n162\n00:08:50.618 --> 00:08:55.088\nthey don't have direct communication with\neach other and then the way that we also\n\n163\n00:08:55.088 --> 00:08:59.620\ndo that of course is that we assign\nindividual ports Into that VLAN as well.\n\n164\n00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, I know that we have\nstressed this over, you and I,\n\n165\n00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.600\non many different courses.\n\n166\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.320\nI know this isn't a security episode.\n\n167\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.590\nBut with default configurations we always\nsay harden the system to make sure that\n\n168\n00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.880\nyou secure it a little bit more.\n\n169\n00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.996\nCould this be a security concern if a\ndefault VLAN isn't configured accordingly?\n\n170\n00:09:13.996 --> 00:09:17.776\nCould I just walk in if I have physical\naccess to your switch, plug in and\n\n171\n00:09:17.776 --> 00:09:22.320\npotentially start seeing traffic\nthat's going across all those ports?\n\n172\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.150\n&gt;&gt; Yes and no, at the same time right,\nso you won't see every bit of traffic,\n\n173\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.080\nyou'll see broadcast traffic.\n\n174\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.300\nBecause remember that default\nbehavior of a switch right?\n\n175\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.500\nIt forwards data only to\nthe other port that it's going to.\n\n176\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:41.480\nSo if you just plug in let's say to\nexample for port 20 here, is this one,\n\n177\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.570\nwell, you're only gonna get data\ngoing to or leaving from that port.\n\n178\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.210\nSo if ports one and two are communicating\nwith each other you're not going to.\n\n179\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.610\nBut if ports one and\ntwo start broadcasting then the broadcast\n\n180\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.260\nfrom port one will go out across\nall those particular ports too.\n\n181\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.636\nSo we'll actually end up seeing\nthat as being an issue at times.\n\n182\n00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:07.020\nNow, the other thing that we also want\nto mention is you'll hear the terms,\n\n183\n00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.210\nnot only default VLAN, but\nnative VLAN, as well, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.350\nSo, as we took a look just right\nthere on the screen where we saw\n\n185\n00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.280\neverything as being in the default VLAN.\n\n186\n00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.453\nI wanna talk about the term\nnative VLAN too, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:23.453 --> 00:10:28.026\nIn today, okay, as of the recording\nof this episode, really,\n\n188\n00:10:28.026 --> 00:10:32.940\nthe type of data that we're doing today,\nand the way that we separate\n\n189\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.045\nall things out is really going to be\nwhat we call tagged traffic, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:38.045 --> 00:10:41.139\nAnd that means,\non the trunking aspect of it, so\n\n191\n00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:45.215\nthat we can send data across\nswitches without having to actually\n\n192\n00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:50.580\nput a connection between every single\nVLAN and connecting to another switch.\n\n193\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.330\nWe can use one link instead,\nwe're gonna do trunking.\n\n194\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.120\nSo the type of tagging that we\nhave today is what we call .1q.\n\n195\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.895\nSo if you're in VLAN 5,\n\n196\n00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:03.880\nall your traffic as it leaves this tag\nwith VLAN 5 or on the other switch\n\n197\n00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.800\nit notes is only to forwarded out to\nthe VLAN 5 over on the other side.\n\n198\n00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.600\nThat's what it's designed\nto do on a trunk.\n\n199\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.260\nSo that is actually key for\n\n200\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.240\nus because that particular traffic\nis always gonna be tagged.\n\n201\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.550\nBut inside of .1Q.\n\n202\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.330\nThe default VLAN, and the native VLAN,\n\n203\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.610\nthey kind of share this,\nit's called a Native VLAN.\n\n204\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.760\nThe Native VLAN is actually\nuntagged traffic, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.370\nSo, there isn't a tag\nwith the Native VLAN.\n\n206\n00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.668\nBy default, that is VLAN 1.\n\n207\n00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:44.170\nNow, you have to be careful here because\nthis is where it trips people up too.\n\n208\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.680\nIs VLAN1 then always\ngonna be the native VLAN?\n\n209\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.480\nNot necessarily.\n\n210\n00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.100\nYou can then go into the switch and\n\n211\n00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.310\nsay what VLAN you want to\nassign as the native VLAN.\n\n212\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.580\nSo that way you don't\nhave to worry about this.\n\n213\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.040\nSo if you wanna leave it as VLAN 1 you\ncan, even though that's not necessarily\n\n214\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.610\nalways the best behavior in terms of\nsecurity, but you can if you want to.\n\n215\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.440\nBut a lot of times what ends up happening\nin a real environment is that you\n\n216\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.756\nmove the native VLAN off\nto another VLAN number.\n\n217\n00:12:17.756 --> 00:12:23.089\nAnd that way, all traffic will\nbe tagged with a VLAN number,\n\n218\n00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:27.030\ninstead as it goes across your switch.\n\n219\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.230\nUsually, we use the native VLAN for things\nlike management more than anything else.\n\n220\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.480\nBut you don't have to.\n\n221\n00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.870\nYou can use it for anything that\nyou want to, or not use it at all,\n\n222\n00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.930\nwhich is probably what I would recommend.\n\n223\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.354\nAnd that way you don't have to\nworry about the idea of whether or\n\n224\n00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:41.750\nnot my traffic's gonna be in\nthe correct VLANs or not as well.\n\n225\n00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.177\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie I know that there is this\nterm out here that I have heard once in\n\n226\n00:12:46.177 --> 00:12:46.806\na while.\n\n227\n00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:50.465\nVTP the Virtual Trunking Protocol\ndon't really know much about it.\n\n228\n00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:54.474\nWhy is it something that I might need to\nconsider inside of my networks if I am\n\n229\n00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:55.747\nconfiguring a switch,\n\n230\n00:12:55.747 --> 00:12:59.350\nif I'm in the midst of using these\nvirtual local area networks?\n\n231\n00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:04.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the reason why we\nneed virtual trunking protocol is, and\n\n232\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.300\nlet's take for an example, that Wes, that\n\n233\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.100\nwe're managing a network that's actually\nincluding four different buildings.\n\n234\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.090\nBut those buildings are a mile apart,\nokay?\n\n235\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.600\nAnd you have a switch in\neach one of those buildings.\n\n236\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.140\nWell if you have something like that and\nso, Wes, we go ahead and say, all right,\n\n237\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.590\nwe want to make sure that there's\na general shared VLAN for, let's say,\n\n238\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.570\nthe management of each one\nof those buildings, okay?\n\n239\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.570\nWe want them all to be\non one VLAN together.\n\n240\n00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.240\nWell, the way that we would\ndo that is simple, Wes.\n\n241\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.910\nI would tell you, all right, go and\n\n242\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.416\nconfigure VLAN 14 just\na random number here.\n\n243\n00:13:42.416 --> 00:13:47.180\nWe'll call it management and we need to\nconfigure that so that everybody in those\n\n244\n00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:53.580\nparticular ports that we want from each\none of those four are actually in VLAN 14.\n\n245\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.350\nThe only way that you can do that right\nnow is that you'll drive a mile to\n\n246\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.670\nthe west of, you know, building.\n\n247\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.977\nAnd then to the north of building and\nthen to the east building and\n\n248\n00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:07.481\nthen come back to south building,\njust to configure one VLAN port.\n\n249\n00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.275\n&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot\nof sneaker net going on.\n\n250\n00:14:09.275 --> 00:14:12.570\nJust have to, I mean, the whole purpose\nof networking is communication and\n\n251\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.505\nsharing resources.\n\n252\n00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:15.780\nNow I gotta tie on the kicks and\ngo walking around.\n\n253\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.475\nDoesn't seem like it's a too\nefficient administration.\n\n254\n00:14:18.475 --> 00:14:21.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nin terms of switch management right,\n\n255\n00:14:21.415 --> 00:14:25.685\neverything that we've shown you is pretty\nmuch managed each device at a time, okay?\n\n256\n00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:27.785\nSo even if you have four switches,\nand you're doing that,\n\n257\n00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:31.620\nand they're all in the same building It's\nstill four different times to do so.\n\n258\n00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.026\nWhat you can do instead is enable,\nwhat we'll call VTP,\n\n259\n00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:35.642\nwhich is Virtual Trunking Protocol.\n\n260\n00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:40.810\nVTP allows me to centralized the okay.\n\n261\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.872\nAnd what I mean by that is\nthat we can configure it\n\n262\n00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:48.483\nto where if I want to create a VLAN and\nhave it appear on all four of those.\n\n263\n00:14:48.483 --> 00:14:53.064\nI can take what we call the VTP server,\nconfigure it there, and\n\n264\n00:14:53.064 --> 00:14:57.220\nthen it will appear on all\nthe other ones all around okay?\n\n265\n00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.728\nSo that's something we can do.\n\n266\n00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:01.360\nLet's go ahead and take a look at how\nthat might end up functioning here,\n\n267\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.370\nand we'll see if we can make this work.\n\n268\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.170\nNow there is some limitations\ninside this lab environment.\n\n269\n00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.200\nThey preconfigured these switches.\n\n270\n00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.460\nSo you might not be able to do all of it.\n\n271\n00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.590\nBut we'll try and\ndo the majority of it here.\n\n272\n00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.430\nSo let me see if I can do this.\n\n273\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.730\nWell, let's see if I can actually type,\nhow's that?\n\n274\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:19.540\nThat would actually help.\n\n275\n00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:25.172\nWes, this is what I get for\nsetting up a password here.\n\n276\n00:15:25.172 --> 00:15:27.044\n[LAUGH] You have to type\nit in all the time.\n\n277\n00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:34.391\nAll right, so now that I am back into\nthe switch, if I want to configure a vtp,\n\n278\n00:15:34.391 --> 00:15:37.500\nit's actually two simple commands here.\n\n279\n00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.097\nSo it'd be, vtp domain, make sure i'm\n\n280\n00:15:42.097 --> 00:15:46.839\nsaying this, spelling this right here.\n\n281\n00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:53.440\nvtp domain,\nall right I think it's just domain.\n\n282\n00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.839\nAnd we'll just call it itprotv.\n\n283\n00:15:57.763 --> 00:16:00.287\nOkay, so\nnotice it's changed it to this name.\n\n284\n00:16:00.287 --> 00:16:04.500\nAnd then to make sure it's\na little bit secure, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.737\nI'm going to do vtp password,\nI will make it cisco123.\n\n286\n00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:13.525\nAll right.\nNow that I have that set up, there's only\n\n287\n00:16:13.525 --> 00:16:17.330\na couple of other configurations I\nneed to do and that is whether or\n\n288\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.430\nnot this mode here, vtp mode,\nI'm going to make this one the server.\n\n289\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.570\nAll right, so the good thing is\nit tells me it's ready to serve.\n\n290\n00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.122\nBy default,\nevery one's a server when you bring it up.\n\n291\n00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:31.582\nThen I can go to NYCORE1.\n\n292\n00:16:31.582 --> 00:16:34.993\nActually, before I do that,\nI'll have to set trunking here.\n\n293\n00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:36.526\nSo let me do that too.\n\n294\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.256\nI want to just get these\nconfigured if I can get into it.\n\n295\n00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:47.991\nVTP domain ITPro.TV, all right,\nnow all this is case sensitive,\n\n296\n00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:53.220\nI do want you to know,\nyou type in all capital like ITPro.TV,\n\n297\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.858\nis kind of thing that's being different.\n\n298\n00:16:56.858 --> 00:16:58.291\nNotice it already took it on.\n\n299\n00:16:58.291 --> 00:17:04.051\nSo when they're connected together,\nit already said,\n\n300\n00:17:04.051 --> 00:17:08.827\nI already see that,\nvtp password, cisco123.\n\n301\n00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.539\nAnd there we go, we set it for that.\n\n302\n00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:13.603\nThis time,\nI'm going to change the mode, vtp Mode.\n\n303\n00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:15.215\nI'm going to call this one the client.\n\n304\n00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:22.000\nAnd so let's say that I don't want anybody\nto go to configure VLANs on NYCORE1.\n\n305\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.165\nAnd then over on core two, the same thing.\n\n306\n00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:31.542\nVTP domain, ITProTV, and\n\n307\n00:17:31.542 --> 00:17:37.380\nnotice this one didn't\nactually configure itself yet.\n\n308\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.688\nIt went from null to ITProTV.\n\n309\n00:17:40.688 --> 00:17:46.955\nAnd then vtp password cisco123.\n\n310\n00:17:46.955 --> 00:17:49.460\nSo now, they're all pretty much the same.\n\n311\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.380\nNow, the key here is,\nsee it's called Virtual Trunking Protocol?\n\n312\n00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.948\nIt means you have to enable the trunk\nlinks between those three switches.\n\n313\n00:17:57.948 --> 00:18:03.163\nSo the great thing, I'll say the great\nthing is, I already have, I think I do.\n\n314\n00:18:03.163 --> 00:18:05.160\nI think I've already set, there it goes.\n\n315\n00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.490\nI want to make sure that I\ngot this one right here.\n\n316\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.020\nSo I need to just,\nit won't let me copy it that way, right.\n\n317\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.104\nI forgot, this line doesn't allow me\nto just copy and paste it in there.\n\n318\n00:18:14.104 --> 00:18:15.803\nOn real switches,\nyou'd be able to do that.\n\n319\n00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:20.721\nSo on NYCORE1, I need to make sure that\n\n320\n00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:24.754\nI configure this rightly here.\n\n321\n00:18:24.754 --> 00:18:30.816\nSo this is going to be interface,\n\n322\n00:18:30.816 --> 00:18:34.284\nFA1/0/22.\n\n323\n00:18:34.284 --> 00:18:37.759\nAnd then switch port.\n\n324\n00:18:37.759 --> 00:18:40.578\nMode Trunk.\n\n325\n00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:45.213\nIt says okay,\nyou can't do that one without this\n\n326\n00:18:45.213 --> 00:18:49.519\nswitchport to trunk encapsilation dot1q.\n\n327\n00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:52.156\nAnd this side, I have to spell it right.\n\n328\n00:18:55.554 --> 00:18:59.039\nTrunk encapsilation dot1q.\n\n329\n00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:05.218\nAnd then switch port load truck,\nswitch port no negotiate.\n\n330\n00:19:05.218 --> 00:19:07.097\nOops.\n\n331\n00:19:07.097 --> 00:19:12.260\nNo negotiate.\n\n332\n00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.501\nHere, that should actually do it, and\n\n333\n00:19:15.501 --> 00:19:20.128\nthen over on NYCORE1,\nlet me do the other side as well.\n\n334\n00:19:20.128 --> 00:19:24.922\nSo I've got to actually\ndo the link between, And\n\n335\n00:19:24.922 --> 00:19:30.435\n[INAUDIBLE] and this one may not\ndo the way that I want it to,\n\n336\n00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:38.997\nSwitchport trunk encap dot1q.\n\n337\n00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:44.940\nSwitchport mode trunk.\n\n338\n00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.660\nSo I have to set up all of the trunking\nbetween these devices is what I have to be\n\n339\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.253\nable to do.\n\n340\n00:19:49.253 --> 00:19:52.991\nSo I come to NYCORE1, the same thing.\n\n341\n00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:56.317\nMake sure I get that all the way in there.\n\n342\n00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:59.945\nInterface 1/0/24.\n\n343\n00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:05.286\nSwitchport.\n\n344\n00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:08.839\nTrunk encapsulation.1q,\n\n345\n00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:13.532\ntelling it I'm going to do a trunking.\n\n346\n00:20:13.532 --> 00:20:15.178\nPort mode trunk.\n\n347\n00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:22.018\nPort, no negotiate, and\n\n348\n00:20:22.018 --> 00:20:27.220\nthen the same thing all the way\nback down to my original.\n\n349\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.550\nSo you can see why this becomes\na little bit of a headache and\n\n350\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.165\nwhy people always want to do this fast.\n\n351\n00:20:34.165 --> 00:20:41.559\nSwitch port trunk encap dot1q.\n\n352\n00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:46.141\nSwitch port, so lot of [LAUGH] repetition.\n\n353\n00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:53.295\nNo, I don't want that.\n\n354\n00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:54.500\nNo negotiation.\n\n355\n00:20:58.656 --> 00:21:00.413\nNo negotiation.\n\n356\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.710\nAnd then back down to my access port.\n\n357\n00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.828\nThat pretty much mirrors\na triangle that I showed you.\n\n358\n00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:10.412\nSo we'll see that, and\nthen lastly, the last two here,\n\n359\n00:21:10.412 --> 00:21:13.860\nI should be able to use\nan interface range for this one.\n\n360\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.194\nInterface range.\n\n361\n00:21:16.194 --> 00:21:21.848\nI've got a 0/24 to 23 and 24.\n\n362\n00:21:25.802 --> 00:21:30.280\nSwitchport mode trunk,\nand it took it right away.\n\n363\n00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.460\nSo now all of these devices\nare trunked together.\n\n364\n00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.850\nWe have them ready to go,\nwe have our VTP domain.\n\n365\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.430\nSo if I go to NYCORE2 here,\n\n366\n00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:45.660\nlet me go ahead and say I want\nthis to also be vtp mode client.\n\n367\n00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:53.020\nSo the only place that I should be able\nto to create VLANs from is NYACCESS.\n\n368\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.998\nSo if Wes is actually right there at\nthe end and or at the headquarters, and\n\n369\n00:21:57.998 --> 00:22:02.971\nhe wants to be the one to create VLANs,\nhe should only have to do it here, so\n\n370\n00:22:02.971 --> 00:22:04.932\nlet's go ahead and do this.\n\n371\n00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:10.402\nSo he can do VLAN and let's do 100 here.\n\n372\n00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:12.818\nAnd we'll call it management, name.\n\n373\n00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.397\nManagement.\n\n374\n00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:20.261\nDo show VLAN brief.\n\n375\n00:22:22.793 --> 00:22:23.463\nOops.\n\n376\n00:22:23.463 --> 00:22:27.460\nDo show, if I can spell, VLAN brief.\n\n377\n00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.620\nGive it a moment, well maybe not.\n\n378\n00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.395\nIt doesn't like me in\nthis mode when I do that.\n\n379\n00:22:36.395 --> 00:22:40.771\nShow VLAN brief.\n\n380\n00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:43.190\nThere we go.\n\n381\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.750\nSo here's the one that we created,\nlet's say that was created.\n\n382\n00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.026\nNow, if I go over to NYCORE1,\n\n383\n00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:53.328\nunless my trunking didn't\nset up correctly, do, nope.\n\n384\n00:23:01.108 --> 00:23:02.150\nShow VLAN brief.\n\n385\n00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.530\nNotice that the management\nalso showed up there.\n\n386\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.860\nI didn't configure that, but\nthere's the one that showed up, okay?\n\n387\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.820\nSo that's what we have is that\nwe can do something like that.\n\n388\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.160\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, am I understanding this right?\n\n389\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.090\nYou configured that on one switch, and\n\n390\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.790\nthen VLAN trunking protocol took\nthat configuration, and it updated.\n\n391\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.820\nAnd it told the other\nswitch what was going on.\n\n392\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.330\nSo that other switch says,\nwell, thank you.\n\n393\n00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.440\nI don't know if it's polite like that, but\n\n394\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.500\nconfigured itself based on what the VLAN\ntrunking protocol was telling it.\n\n395\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.950\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\nnow that I'm on NYCORE1, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.488\nIf I try now to do as VLAN configuration,\nso let's do that.\n\n397\n00:23:38.488 --> 00:23:43.790\nVLAN 101, notice what it says.\n\n398\n00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.730\nVTP is not allowed in CLIENT mode.\n\n399\n00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.150\nSo I can control the access.\n\n400\n00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.380\nAnd this is why you want to use VTP if\nyou're actually going to be doing this.\n\n401\n00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.110\nNow, just when I say that,\n\n402\n00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.020\nthis is a technology that on the actual\nCCNA exam, it disappeared for a time.\n\n403\n00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.880\nAnd now it's back again.\n\n404\n00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.520\nSo in other words, they said,\nnobody's really using it, so why keep it?\n\n405\n00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.280\nBut then, in the latest iteration of it,\nthey brought it back.\n\n406\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.010\nSo you've got to realize,\nit's more important than you think.\n\n407\n00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.840\nSo there's a lot more details behind, but\nthat's just to show you the power and\n\n408\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.490\nthe use of VTP as being part of what\nwe actually want to understand here.\n\n409\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.510\nAnd why we want to do it as well.\n\n410\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:24.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, Ronnie, and that seems\nlike a very, very useful protocol.\n\n411\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.570\nWould you say that it also helps\nensure things like consistency in your\n\n412\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.400\nconfiguration, so\nIf I can configure it one place,\n\n413\n00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.260\nI don't have to do it three times,\nfour times, five times.\n\n414\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.270\nI don't have to worry about\nfactoring in the keyboard,\n\n415\n00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.750\nyou guys have seen the way I type, so\nit allows or helps you to ensure that\n\n416\n00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.840\nconsistency in the configuration\nacross all your managed switch.\n\n417\n00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.800\n&gt;&gt; It can, but\n\n418\n00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.280\nit can also be a double edged sword too,\nbecause of the way that it works.\n\n419\n00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.770\nSo we didn't discuss all\nthose details behind that.\n\n420\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.394\nBut at the same time,\nyou've got to realize,\n\n421\n00:24:53.394 --> 00:24:55.970\nit's a simple technology to set up.\n\n422\n00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.580\nIt's a harder one to manage\nwhen something goes wrong.\n\n423\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.040\nAnd that's something that we definitely\naren't going to get into in this show, but\n\n424\n00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.480\nif you want to learn more\ndetails about this or\n\n425\n00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.220\nanything else that we've been doing or\npast several episodes.\n\n426\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.460\nIt looks like we're going to have at least\none more, Wes, because of my talking, but\n\n427\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.790\nwhen it comes down to it, right, what\nyou'll end up seeing here is this, right?\n\n428\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.210\nIs that you'll see that\nthere's a ton more.\n\n429\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.460\nWe've barely scratched the surface\nof everything that I've shown you\n\n430\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.580\nin a very quick manner.\n\n431\n00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.900\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, you did a great job for\nthe Network+ level.\n\n432\n00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.070\nWe hope that you guys understand a little\nbit more about things like your default,\n\n433\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.180\nand your native VLANs, and\nlike Ronnie showed us with VTP,\n\n434\n00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.580\nhowever, I know we've\ngot more to talk about.\n\n435\n00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.950\nBut what we don't have more\nof is time on that clock.\n\n436\n00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.480\nSo, how about this Ronnie,\nwe're going to one more part?\n\n437\n00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.210\nI know you've got some additional topics.\n\n438\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.490\nWe'll come back and we'll do another part.\n\n439\n00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:47.080\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n440\n00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace to wrap it up here.\n\n441\n00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.010\nThanks for joining us.\n\n442\n00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.500\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n443\n00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.240\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n444\n00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.516\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n445\n00:25:54.516 --> 00:26:00.514\n[MUSIC]\n\n446\n00:26:00.514 --> 00:26:03.390\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

00:00:07.289\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:11.799\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Hello everyone out there, welcome to\nITProTV, we're glad you're joining us.\n\n6\n00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.448\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:21.890\nAnd in today's episode, we are continuing\nthrough our series in CompTIA's Network+.\n\n8\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.710\nThat's right,\n\n9\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.520\nN10006, and we're actually in\nconfiguration of a switch in a part five.\n\n10\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.768\nAnd joining us again is none\nother than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:29.768 --> 00:00:30.730\nRonnie, how you doing, sir?\n\n12\n00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.050\n&gt;&gt; I am doing fine, even though\nthis mini series has gone on for\n\n13\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.580\nas long as Harry Potter has.\n\n14\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.695\nI think we're okay.\n\n15\n00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:41.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we are taking a look then\n\n16\n00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.570\ntoday really at a final couple\nof technologies on switching.\n\n17\n00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.054\nI know you're probably saying,\nRonnie, are you joking?\n\n18\n00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.325\nNo, I'm not there's a lot that could\ngo on, on just the idea of a switch.\n\n19\n00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:55.030\nAnd I really do recommend this,\nif you're saying man that looks cool,\n\n20\n00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090\nlooks a little bit more intimidating.\n\n21\n00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.969\nI wanna get a better foot hold and\nunderstanding on take a look at this CCENT\n\n22\n00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.348\nshows, take a look at the Cisco\nrouting of switching shows, and\n\n23\n00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:07.101\nthat will give you a more\nin-depth background cuz we\n\n24\n00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:10.444\nreally have kind of blazed through\nthis at a lightening speed.\n\n25\n00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:13.871\nTo the point where even if you watch\nit a couple of times, the only way for\n\n26\n00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:15.820\nyou to really do it is to get in there.\n\n27\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.141\nUse that practice labs that we have and\njust try and\n\n28\n00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.024\ndo some of these commands like\nI've been showing you as well.\n\n29\n00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:27.922\nAll right, so today, Wes we\nare getting into the dreaded acronym\n\n30\n00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:34.860\ncity again STP what in the word\ndo you think STP stands for Wes?\n\n31\n00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Well my first thought is motor oil,\nsome kind of engine product.\n\n32\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.791\nBut since Richard Petty the King is\nnot here, I think we're talking about\n\n33\n00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.996\na protocol that helps to ensure that we\ncan stop things like forwarding loops and\n\n34\n00:01:45.996 --> 00:01:47.753\nthings like broadcast ORMS, and\n\n35\n00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.601\nthat's none other than\nthe spanning tree protocol.\n\n36\n00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:53.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, actually you\nbring up a great point here okay.\n\n37\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.440\nSo Wes, it's, thinking of that right.\n\n38\n00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.450\nForwarding loops and\nwhat else did you day?\n\n39\n00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.209\n&gt;&gt; Broadcast storms.\n\n40\n00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.960\n&gt;&gt; Broadcast storms and\nstuff like that, that is correct.\n\n41\n00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.597\nBut when do you experience those types\nof things like forwarding loops and\n\n42\n00:02:06.597 --> 00:02:07.635\nBroadcast storm?\n\n43\n00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:08.725\nWhen do you experience them?\n\n44\n00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:14.531\n&gt;&gt; Well, one of the things I'm thinking of\nis when you have multiple ports together.\n\n45\n00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.224\nMore than one switch together and\na port goes or\n\n46\n00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:19.745\na broadcast communication goes out.\n\n47\n00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:22.193\nOne switch sees it and\nsays well I gotta broadcast it.\n\n48\n00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:24.615\nThe next one switch sees it and\nsays well I gotta broadcast it too.\n\n49\n00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:27.040\nAnd before we know it,\nour networks are crippling.\n\n50\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.868\n&gt;&gt; You are absolutely right,\nbut the key term there, okay,\n\n51\n00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.670\nis when you have multiple switches okay.\n\n52\n00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.020\nNormally you don't even have to even worry\nabout spantree protocol if you're only\n\n53\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.320\nworking with one switch, okay.\n\n54\n00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.736\nNow I'm not saying you can't, but what\nI'm saying is if you're working with one\n\n55\n00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:46.580\nswitch you normally do not have to\nworry about spanning tree protocol.\n\n56\n00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.462\nIt is when you configure the idea\nof multiple switches together and\n\n57\n00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.960\nyou end up with something\na little bit strange.\n\n58\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.160\nLet me show you what\nI'm talking about here.\n\n59\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.566\nSo here on my screen,\nhere is a possible configuration.\n\n60\n00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:03.204\nLet me make it blank here\nat the beginning, right?\n\n61\n00:03:03.204 --> 00:03:06.130\nIs that we configure these\nthree switches together.\n\n62\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.530\nNow, why would we ever configure three\nswitches together in this manner?\n\n63\n00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.470\nOkay, well I want to not\nonly be able to allow for\n\n64\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.990\ntraffic that may go off of any device\non any of these three switches.\n\n65\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.646\nSo I want them regardless of where\nthe traffic originates, where it ends,\n\n66\n00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:23.512\nI want to be able to get access to that.\n\n67\n00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:26.465\nBut if I only have a single\nlink between them,\n\n68\n00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:31.380\nthat means if that link goes out like\nright here, I still can't get to it.\n\n69\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.678\nBut if I configure multiple\nlinks between them,\n\n70\n00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:38.951\nif this link right here between\nSwitch A and Switch B goes down?\n\n71\n00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.220\nGuess what, I can still get over\nto Switch A by going across where?\n\n72\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.691\nFrom switch B all the way over to\nswitch C and then up here to switch A.\n\n73\n00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.925\nSo when we start to\nconfigure switches together,\n\n74\n00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:54.321\nnotice what you're actually starting\nto see here when you do this.\n\n75\n00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:59.596\nOf course, I can't find,\nI was trying to look for that.\n\n76\n00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:01.240\nThat's what I was trying to look for.\n\n77\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.970\nI was like, where is my color palette?\n\n78\n00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.820\nI'm losing my mind here.\n\n79\n00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.032\nOkay, so normally when we see this,\nlook at what ends up happening here and\n\n80\n00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:15.277\nwhat I've essentially created was kind\nof a weird donut is what I created.\n\n81\n00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:18.420\nBut it's supposed to be a loop,\nis what you end up seeing.\n\n82\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.736\nSo you can see something like that\nwhere you've got this configuration.\n\n83\n00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:24.910\nNow why is something like this bad?\n\n84\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.090\nThat's actually a good question.\n\n85\n00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.652\nThe way that switches function is\ndifferent than the way a router functions.\n\n86\n00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:33.219\nA router gets into a loop, and\n\n87\n00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.669\nI'm pretty sure you covered this\nin another network plus shows,\n\n88\n00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.940\nwhen a router gets into a loop with\ndistance vector protocol what happens?\n\n89\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.790\n&gt;&gt; Well a lot of times\nit's misinformation.\n\n90\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.320\nIt's one router says, hey,\nI know where this route is.\n\n91\n00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.141\nIt loses connection but\nit's broadcast that to the neighbor.\n\n92\n00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:54.502\nSo the neighbor says, well I know how to\nget to that route too, but unfortunately,\n\n93\n00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:56.950\nit learned it from the router\nthat no longer can get there, so\n\n94\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.320\nnow we have some misinformation\nin the routing table.\n\n95\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.950\n&gt;&gt; And not only misinformation,\nbut there's protocol,\n\n96\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.490\nthat we're gonna stop it.\n\n97\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.806\nSpanning tree, poison reverse,\nyou name it, not spanning tree,\n\n98\n00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:11.200\nsplit horizons, I'm talking about spanning\ntree and there I am I mention that.\n\n99\n00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.930\nSo in routing you have split horizon,\nyou have poison reverse, you have that.\n\n100\n00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.890\nThose are technologies that\nessentially say after a while like,\n\n101\n00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.610\nlook let's just stop trying this.\n\n102\n00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.030\nThis is looping forever and\never we're just gonna stop this.\n\n103\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.164\nSo they'll stop it a little bit early,\nright.\n\n104\n00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:32.160\nSwitches though, their default behavior\ndoesn't allow them to stop it.\n\n105\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.814\nSo if a switching loop ends up happening,\nit goes on forever.\n\n106\n00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:41.370\nForever, not, after a while, it'll stop.\n\n107\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.955\nIt goes on forever, and\nit just continues to multiply.\n\n108\n00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:48.840\nSo let me give you an example of how\nsomething like this can end up happening.\n\n109\n00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.354\nAnd mentioning the idea of a broadcast\nstorm is actually probably the best way to\n\n110\n00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:53.780\nthink about doing this, okay?\n\n111\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.725\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n112\n00:05:56.725 --> 00:06:02.820\n[COUGH] So on PC1, let's say that\nit wants to reach this server 01,\n\n113\n00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.200\nbut server 01, the switch has not yet\nlearned its MAC address, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.650\nNow, if we take that into\nconsideration when we do that,\n\n115\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.620\nwell what has to happen on PC1.\n\n116\n00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.820\nIt begins by what?\n\n117\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.460\nSaying hey, I need figure out\nhow to get to that switch, so\n\n118\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.980\nit begins to broadcast that out.\n\n119\n00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.150\nAnd the inner yellow line here that\nyou see is what, saying send it out,\n\n120\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.460\nwhat, every other port.\n\n121\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.450\nBut what, the one that it came in on.\n\n122\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.100\nSo I've taken out all those other\nports except for the connection there.\n\n123\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.980\nSo when it does that and\n\n124\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.570\nit sends it that way that means\nit's gonna go out to switch A.\n\n125\n00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.952\nIt's gonna go out to switch C over here.\n\n126\n00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:45.371\nAnd then what is switch A going to\ndo if it doesn't know about it?\n\n127\n00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:50.990\nWell, it too is gonna say,\nhey I've got an unknown unicast.\n\n128\n00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.574\nAn unknown unicast says what?\n\n129\n00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:54.290\nI need to send this out.\n\n130\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.770\nEvery other port that it doesn't know how\nto, and except for the one it came in on.\n\n131\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.770\nSo it may not come back over here yet.\n\n132\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.120\nSo it actually sends it out port\nnumber two and comes this way onto C,\n\n133\n00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.555\nand the same thing from B.\n\n134\n00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:10.080\nAnd actually sends it out to C,\nand it says, all right.\n\n135\n00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.820\nI'm not sending it out this way.\n\n136\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.124\nBut notice that it can\nthen send up this way too.\n\n137\n00:07:15.124 --> 00:07:16.276\nSo it sends out here,\n\n138\n00:07:16.276 --> 00:07:21.100\nit sends out to this port, it sends to one\nconnected over here to this PC as well.\n\n139\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.205\nYou actually get all that traffic\ncoming back and doing that.\n\n140\n00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:28.510\nAnd now you have this first end of\nthe loop and you'll see it right there.\n\n141\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.310\nOn this guy right here.\n\n142\n00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.330\nHe's actually gonna go back into switch A,\nswitch A is gonna get that same\n\n143\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.190\nbroadcast and say, we still haven't\nheard where that's actually going.\n\n144\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.940\nSo let me do what?\n\n145\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.820\nLet me send it out this side.\n\n146\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.420\nSo now it's actually\ngonna send out this side.\n\n147\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.700\nAnd this guy who's getting it,\n\n148\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.100\nhe's gonna send it back out to PC1 and\nback out to switch B again.\n\n149\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.338\nAnd it's gonna continue to loop around.\n\n150\n00:07:53.338 --> 00:07:56.859\nAnd the broadcast itself will continue\nto happen that way forever and ever.\n\n151\n00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:02.772\nNow, when server 1 here responds and\nsends its MAC address in here.\n\n152\n00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:04.333\nThe MAC address will be sent where?\n\n153\n00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.553\nSwitch A, it will get stored on switch C,\n\n154\n00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:12.060\nand then it will actually\nreceive it on switch B.\n\n155\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.200\nThat SRV1, you're supposed to go up\nport number two to get to SRV1over here.\n\n156\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.930\nSwitch A will send that\nsame MAC address and say,\n\n157\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.079\nno, you can get to SRV1 off\nof port number one here.\n\n158\n00:08:25.332 --> 00:08:26.400\nNow PC1,\n\n159\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.020\nwhen it gets down it says, where am I\nsupposed to send it to get it over there?\n\n160\n00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.970\nSo how am I supposed to get\ntraffic as I send it back in?\n\n161\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.960\nIt says I can go switch A or\nI can go switch B, which is true.\n\n162\n00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.800\nSo it might say let me load\nbalance this and send out what?\n\n163\n00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.190\nBoth these ways here.\n\n164\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.370\nSo, that too can actually get a little\nbit more compromising as time and\n\n165\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.920\ntime goes on.\n\n166\n00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.280\nSo, what is spanning tree about?\n\n167\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.370\nSpanning tree essentially says this, okay,\nthat what we need to do here is simple.\n\n168\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.815\nWe need to be able to provide for a single\npath through, however complex this\n\n169\n00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:09.783\nnetwork may get, however many switches you\nget, we need to be able to block a port.\n\n170\n00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:13.266\nSo that there's only one\npath that gets through.\n\n171\n00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.877\nSo if I do that, let's take for\nan example, that I go ahead and\n\n172\n00:09:16.877 --> 00:09:19.590\nI shut off this particular path.\n\n173\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:27.100\nNotice that that means that there's only\none path over to SRV1, okay, logically.\n\n174\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.288\nNow that doesn't mean that it's broken,\nit just means that path is now shut down.\n\n175\n00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:35.280\nNow, this is what happens\nwith spanning tree.\n\n176\n00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.080\nIt makes sure that every single\nconnection in that particular,\n\n177\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.240\nenvironment that we have\neverything connected,\n\n178\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.660\nthat there's only one possible\npath to that destination.\n\n179\n00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.500\nAnd it does it through a selection\nof elections that end up happening.\n\n180\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.860\nAnd it goes through this kind of value\nsystem that has to actually say,\n\n181\n00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.430\nmy path is better than yours.\n\n182\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.550\nThere's a lot of complexity\ninside of this thing.\n\n183\n00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.120\nBut once it decides it, it's really good.\n\n184\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.550\nNow, there's also something\nelse that can happen too.\n\n185\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.050\nLet me take away my drawing here for\n\n186\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:13.800\na moment and let me come back up here\nwith the red x here for a moment.\n\n187\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.912\nSo if we block off that path,\nright, and now all of a sudden,\n\n188\n00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:22.739\nthis path goes down and\nit stays down, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:27.570\nThe switches will recalculate spanning\ntree and go, this side's down.\n\n190\n00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.459\nThis guy was only blocking.\n\n191\n00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:29.464\nAnd do what?\n\n192\n00:10:29.464 --> 00:10:30.624\nUnblock it, so\n\n193\n00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:37.320\nthen there is only gonna be one path while\nthis guy is actually continually down.\n\n194\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.140\nSo it knows how to actually readjust and\ndo everything that we need it to do so\n\n195\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.410\nwe can still get a good\nconnection all the way through.\n\n196\n00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.780\nNow when it does something like this,\n\n197\n00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.640\nright, it is actually one of the things\nthat I said at the very beginning.\n\n198\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.110\nYou have to understand that very basic\nfunctionality in how a switch works\n\n199\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.020\nbefore this makes sense.\n\n200\n00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.240\nTrying to read about spanning tree and\nnot understanding how the switch works,\n\n201\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.500\nit makes no sense at all\nthat it can do that, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.346\nSo that's kind of the basic\nlayout of how this works.\n\n203\n00:11:09.346 --> 00:11:16.070\nNow this is not the fastest technology in\nthe world, okay, when it comes down to it.\n\n204\n00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.870\nBut it is a technology that\nworks very well, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.650\nSo in this situation here,\n\n206\n00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.760\nright, when you start to take\na look at what it does, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.528\nLet me uncheck the fade there, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:35.447\nIt takes a look at these three switches.\n\n209\n00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:38.012\nEverything that's in this topology, and\n\n210\n00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:42.180\nit has to decide on who is gonna\nbe the king of the network, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.560\nThat's the easiest way.\n\n212\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.723\nNow, that's not technically\nthe right term.\n\n213\n00:11:45.723 --> 00:11:47.803\nIt's called a root bridge,\nbut we'll call it the king.\n\n214\n00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:49.345\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can call it the king too.\n\n215\n00:11:49.345 --> 00:11:51.597\nSo I'm thinking here it's\ncalled a tree topology, right?\n\n216\n00:11:51.597 --> 00:11:53.465\nA spanning tree topology and\nwhat's the tree have?\n\n217\n00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.269\nIt's got an apex and\nit's got something at the top, right?\n\n218\n00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:59.135\nSo it's a single one at\nthe top at any tree.\n\n219\n00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.311\nLike, for instance, DNS has a logical\ntree topology with a root end at the top.\n\n220\n00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:04.443\nSo when you're talking\nabout something like that,\n\n221\n00:12:04.443 --> 00:12:07.270\nsomething's gotta be in charge\nof the rest of the hierarchy.\n\n222\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.260\n&gt;&gt; Right, and this actually is\nthe one that says this, right?\n\n223\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.220\nThat hey, this is what's gonna\nhappen as being the King.\n\n224\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.620\nAll traffic has to flow through me,\nand that's what it's doing.\n\n225\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.160\nIt's saying that I am the only one, okay,\nthat all traffic has to go through.\n\n226\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.270\nThat means all the other switches in this\ntopology, whether it's 3, whether it's 6,\n\n227\n00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.690\nwhether it's 25, I'm the one that every\nbit of traffic has to go through.\n\n228\n00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.670\nNow that means that all the other 24,\nor 5, or\n\n229\n00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.910\nwhatever it is, one of those is gonna\nhave ports that are turned off,\n\n230\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.398\nor multiple ones will have\nports that are turned off.\n\n231\n00:12:41.398 --> 00:12:44.690\nSo that it can't get into a loop\nsomewhere is what will end up happening.\n\n232\n00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.040\nSo let's take for an example that\nthis is what's gonna happen.\n\n233\n00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.330\nLet's go back to our diagram here.\n\n234\n00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.640\nIt will make an election and\n\n235\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.090\nthe way it does it is based on what\nwe call some different IDs here.\n\n236\n00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.490\nBut for us, it comes down to\nthe lowest Mac address value.\n\n237\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.293\nSo when you take a look at all these, I\nmade them simple so that we can see them.\n\n238\n00:13:02.293 --> 00:13:06.972\nThis one up here is all As, and\nthen this one down here is all Bs, and\n\n239\n00:13:06.972 --> 00:13:09.110\nthis one over here is all Cs.\n\n240\n00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.300\nSo it makes simple.\n\n241\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.880\nSo this guy right here is gonna\nbe the one that ends up saying,\n\n242\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.800\nall the traffic's gonna go through me.\n\n243\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.850\nAnd what that means then,\noops, let me get that back.\n\n244\n00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:27.070\nMan, I've kind of zoomed in too badly.\n\n245\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.570\nThere we go.\n\n246\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.986\nWhat that means, is that these\nports will always remain open so\n\n247\n00:13:33.986 --> 00:13:38.488\nthat it will always forward\ntraffic to them, okay?\n\n248\n00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:41.365\nNow, the election is still going on.\n\n249\n00:13:41.365 --> 00:13:44.253\nOnce this guy declares\nhimself as being king,\n\n250\n00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:48.694\nthe other guy right here will compare\na match and go, hey, if I do this,\n\n251\n00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:53.840\nI used to announce myself as being\nking at the beginning of the election.\n\n252\n00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.710\nBut I notice something.\n\n253\n00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.860\nHe's got a better value than I do.\n\n254\n00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.340\nHe'll also report out to Switch C,\nwho's king.\n\n255\n00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:06.280\nSo even if switch C says, I'm king, switch\nB will now go, no, it really is switch A.\n\n256\n00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.150\nSwitch B and\nC will then start announcing that switch\n\n257\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.480\nA is king to all the rest of\nthe topology that's out there as well.\n\n258\n00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.190\nAnd it will also declare that.\n\n259\n00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.690\nNow when it does so, it will also say,\nlook, I'm directly connected here.\n\n260\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.283\nAnd this particular port will\nbecome what's called a root port,\n\n261\n00:14:23.283 --> 00:14:27.054\nwhich will also end up forwarding traffic,\nas well.\n\n262\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.095\nSo, that means that these\nports are gonna be open, so\n\n263\n00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:36.860\nI can actually forward traffic along.\n\n264\n00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.270\nNow the other thing that's left\nhere in this topology, right,\n\n265\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.790\nis this link in between.\n\n266\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:49.630\nThis link in between, one of these two\nports is gonna go into a blocking state,\n\n267\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.460\nokay, and that will prevent the loop.\n\n268\n00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.967\nSo this is what is called\nthat last non-blocking or\n\n269\n00:14:55.967 --> 00:14:58.460\nnon-designated port here, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.050\nSo between these two guys,\nthey will also then take a look, and\n\n271\n00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.530\nthe way it does it is by\nsomething that's called cost.\n\n272\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.890\nAnd we're not getting into that, but\nthe lowest cost ends up winning.\n\n273\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.457\nAnd when it go,\nthey're all equal in-between these, well,\n\n274\n00:15:11.457 --> 00:15:15.852\nwhat it will do is it will also come back\ndown to that lowest MAC address again.\n\n275\n00:15:15.852 --> 00:15:20.619\nSo this guy will end up forwarding,\noops, that's a terrible F.\n\n276\n00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.850\n[LAUGH] That's the worst.\n\n277\n00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.570\nAll right, so\nthat guy will end up forwarding.\n\n278\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:33.170\nWhile this guy will go ahead and\nblock, okay?\n\n279\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.370\nSo that's just a very simple example.\n\n280\n00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:41.570\nAnd if we have that then, that now means\nthat while the switch is functioning,\n\n281\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:47.500\nthere's only that one path that will allow\ntraffic to go all the way through, okay?\n\n282\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.655\nSo that's kind of the basic,\nfundamental understanding of this.\n\n283\n00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:55.969\nBut it doesn't happen immediately,\nit doesn't happen instantaneously.\n\n284\n00:15:55.969 --> 00:15:59.604\nSo what happens here is that there's\na couple of different technologies,\n\n285\n00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:01.865\nthe original spanning\ntree protocol itself.\n\n286\n00:16:01.865 --> 00:16:05.848\nIs designed to go through, of course,\nwhat's called blocking, and\n\n287\n00:16:05.848 --> 00:16:08.100\nthen listening and learning.\n\n288\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:13.460\nAnd then from that point, it goes through\neither blocking or forwarding again, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:18.269\nIt can take anywhere between 30 to 50\nseconds for every port involved in this,\n\n290\n00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.739\nbefore it comes back up.\n\n291\n00:16:19.739 --> 00:16:22.651\nWhen you plug a Cisco switch in for\nthe first time and\n\n292\n00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:26.376\nyou put the power on every port\ngoes into a little amber state, and\n\n293\n00:16:26.376 --> 00:16:29.590\nyou can see a little light\nthat comes on and it's amber.\n\n294\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.667\nAnd that's the initial spanning tree that\nturns on, cuz it says you're plugging\n\n295\n00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:39.685\nme in, I now have to check and see whether\nI'm actually the king of this network.\n\n296\n00:16:39.685 --> 00:16:42.540\nSo what it does is initially,\nit quiets itself down, and\n\n297\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.210\nit blocks everything that's coming in\nuntil it's settled and ready to go.\n\n298\n00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.760\nSo at that point, what it does then\nis once it's done blocking, and\n\n299\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:55.740\nit's got okay, I think I'm ready, it opens\nthat port up, and it begins to listen for\n\n300\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.748\nwhat we'll call BPD use.\n\n301\n00:16:57.748 --> 00:17:00.828\nOkay, and you probably talked about\nthat in the OSI model as well.\n\n302\n00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:05.156\nIn this one though,\nBPD use Is talking about the bridge\n\n303\n00:17:05.156 --> 00:17:08.556\nprotocol data units it was talking about.\n\n304\n00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:13.800\nAnd that is what switches send out\nto say they are out and then can.\n\n305\n00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.710\nSo it will list in for those then it will\ncompare itself with it's own bridge Id and\n\n306\n00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.480\nwhen it does that once\neverything is done it\n\n307\n00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:27.400\nwill then allow what it say I'm either\nthe king Or the other guys to king, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.000\nSo, it will listen.\n\n309\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.020\nSo if it listens and\n\n310\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.520\nnobody else declares itself as king,\nthen it will declare itself as king.\n\n311\n00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.200\nOkay?\n\n312\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.652\nBut it will learn whoever the king is.\n\n313\n00:17:36.652 --> 00:17:40.453\nOnce it learns who the king is, then it\nwill go through and find out whether it's\n\n314\n00:17:40.453 --> 00:17:44.790\na root port or whether it's actually one\nof those other ports that are out there.\n\n315\n00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.030\nAnd decide whether it's gonna be\nblocking and forwarding again.\n\n316\n00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.950\nNow the problem that is 30 to 50 seconds.\n\n317\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.570\nIt doesn't seem very long to you and me.\n\n318\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.210\nActually, for me talking,\ndoesn't seem long at all.\n\n319\n00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.690\nBut the very fact is, it's an eternity\nin terns of switches coming up and down.\n\n320\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.530\nSo, there are many different protocols\nthat have come out afterwards\n\n321\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.550\nthat were supposed to be\nimprovements on this.\n\n322\n00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.291\nCisco's proprietary version\nof this is now what's called\n\n323\n00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:11.821\nRapid Spanning Tree Protocol,\nwhich is 802.1W.\n\n324\n00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:18.020\nThe original one's 802.1D, and\nthis one is actually 802.1W.\n\n325\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.010\nRapid Tree Spanning Protocol\nbrings this decision making time\n\n326\n00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.680\ndown beneath ten seconds.\n\n327\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.990\nWhen I say beneath ten seconds,\nit usually happens almost instantaneously.\n\n328\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.250\nThe reason why is it says look,\nthis is what I'm gonna do.\n\n329\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.150\nIf I see a BPDU we'll go through\nthe listening and learning.\n\n330\n00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.377\nBut there are devices that you plug\nin like laptops, like computers, and\n\n331\n00:18:39.377 --> 00:18:41.845\nother devices that don't send out BPDUs.\n\n332\n00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:44.639\nIf I don't sense that,\nI'm just gonna put it into blocking or\n\n333\n00:18:44.639 --> 00:18:48.500\nI'm gonna put it into forwarding and\ndon't even worry about it.\n\n334\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.820\nSo it can actually get very,\nvery fast at this point.\n\n335\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.252\nThere are so\nmany different varieties of this.\n\n336\n00:18:55.252 --> 00:19:00.080\nThere's per VLAN spanning tree, there's\nRapid per VLAN spanning tree you name it.\n\n337\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.780\nThere's tons of these\ndifferent technologies.\n\n338\n00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.220\nThe ones that they specifically\ncall out of the exam here\n\n339\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.440\nis gonna be 802.1d which\nis the original one and\n\n340\n00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.680\nthen of course the 1w which is\ngonna be the rapid spanning tree.\n\n341\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.850\nMost of the time today you'll\nactually see that pervy land rapid\n\n342\n00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.690\nspanning tree instead.\n\n343\n00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.534\nAll right so let's go ahead and take\na look at how this information shows up on\n\n344\n00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:26.695\nthe switch if I can actually find\nmy switch here, there we go, and\n\n345\n00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:29.290\nwe'll get this showing up here, okay.\n\n346\n00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.230\nSo here I am, I'm on my NYACCESS1, that's\nthe one connected to my network here.\n\n347\n00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.143\nAnd then we'll type in NES and\nthe password, cisco123.\n\n348\n00:19:42.104 --> 00:19:44.320\nGet in there And then do a show.\n\n349\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.370\nSpanning tree.\n\n350\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.350\nAnd this is what we're looking for\nbetween the switches.\n\n351\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:56.542\nNow, because the native one for\nCisco switches is per-VLAN spanning tree,\n\n352\n00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.295\nthis is what you're gonna see.\n\n353\n00:19:58.295 --> 00:20:04.020\nIs, it will actually run spanning tree for\neach VLAN that's actually on the switch.\n\n354\n00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.480\nSo it doesn't actually take a look at the\nentire switch even though you can do it.\n\n355\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.048\nTakes a look at per switch here, so here's\nsomething that's called the root ID, and\n\n356\n00:20:12.048 --> 00:20:15.094\nthis is how you can actually\ntell if this is the king here,\n\n357\n00:20:15.094 --> 00:20:17.456\nthere's a couple of ways\nthat you can do it.\n\n358\n00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:21.440\nOne is if the root ID and\nthe bridge ID match.\n\n359\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.880\nOkay, and usually, that's the way\nthat you actually can tell it.\n\n360\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.430\nAnd then also,\n\n361\n00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:29.110\nit tells you, usually it says this\nis the root, it's also what it says.\n\n362\n00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.322\nBut let's go to NYCORE1 and see what\nhappens when I run that same command.\n\n363\n00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:51.397\nSo now, here on this one you can see where\nthis one doesn't actually match as well,\n\n364\n00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:55.730\nand then let me go to\nNYCORE2 onto the same thing.\n\n365\n00:21:03.824 --> 00:21:08.517\nYou'll see again this one\ndoesn't match either here.\n\n366\n00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.760\nSo you actually see those\nnumbers as being different.\n\n367\n00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.290\nSo I come back here, and there's\nonly three switches in my topology,\n\n368\n00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.460\nas far as I know.\n\n369\n00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.698\nI'm trying to make sure here.\n\n370\n00:21:15.698 --> 00:21:18.600\nBut on this newer one which is,\nthere it is.\n\n371\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.860\nI was gonna say I was looking for,\nI was, right there in front of me.\n\n372\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.153\nThat you should be able to see that if you\nwant to figure out which one's actually\n\n373\n00:21:26.153 --> 00:21:29.618\nthe king, it announces itself like this\nand that's how you can actually see that.\n\n374\n00:21:29.618 --> 00:21:31.518\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie we had a good\nquestion in the chat room,\n\n375\n00:21:31.518 --> 00:21:33.360\nmaybe you can help us out with this one.\n\n376\n00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.000\nThe question was if you're using\nsomething like spanning tree or\n\n377\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.120\nyou're using something\nlike rapid spanning tree.\n\n378\n00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.810\nCan you use a combination, or\ndo you have to use one or the other?\n\n379\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:42.460\nDo they work together?\n\n380\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah they're not necessarily\ncompatible, and that's the key here right.\n\n381\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.120\nSo most, just about anybody today,\nif you're running regular 802.1d,\n\n382\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.074\nyou probably need to upgrade.\n\n383\n00:21:52.074 --> 00:21:55.843\n[LAUGH] You really do,\nit's such an old protocol and\n\n384\n00:21:55.843 --> 00:21:58.230\nit is really slow in comparison.\n\n385\n00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.767\nSo like I said, by default on, inside of\nCisco switches, it is running what they\n\n386\n00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:07.239\ncall per VLAN spanning tree, and that is\nkinda the minimum and usually most of us\n\n387\n00:22:07.239 --> 00:22:11.848\ndont know worry about faster than that,\nbut overall though that's probably what\n\n388\n00:22:11.848 --> 00:22:15.855\nyou'll see, but they are not directly\ncompatible Cisco went ahead and\n\n389\n00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:19.794\napproved on it,ll at least that's\nwhat they thought that they did.\n\n390\n00:22:19.794 --> 00:22:23.260\nBut it is, its really much faster\ntoday than the original one.\n\n391\n00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.899\nSo you normally do\n\n392\n00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:26.507\nwanna to make sure that you're running\nthe same one between all of them.\n\n393\n00:22:26.507 --> 00:22:32.020\nRunning different one, it's not that it\ncan't work but you'll end up seeing that\n\n394\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.990\nbecause there are the different different\nconversions and the time that it takes.\n\n395\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.238\nIs not gonna work as\nwell as you wanted it to.\n\n396\n00:22:40.238 --> 00:22:43.270\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie whats kinda interesting\nas you were talking about being the king\n\n397\n00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.050\nthere, but\nwe go through an election process, so\n\n398\n00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.220\nit's a Democratic monarchy for sure.\n\n399\n00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.172\nNow one of the things that I can see is\nthat we are coming to the end of this\n\n400\n00:22:51.172 --> 00:22:54.726\nepisode Ronnie, but before we do, do you\nhave any final words that Maybe you'd like\n\n401\n00:22:54.726 --> 00:22:57.930\nto tell the viewers wh en it comes to\na consideration of using spanning tree,\n\n402\n00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.058\neven if it's just use it.\n\n403\n00:22:59.058 --> 00:23:01.900\n&gt;&gt; The good thing is this.\n\n404\n00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.410\nNotice I didn't have to\nconfigure anything, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.560\nThat's primarily the key.\n\n406\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.723\nUnless you're changing the default\nbehavior of switches, say,\n\n407\n00:23:10.723 --> 00:23:15.629\nmost of them are gonna run whatever\nspanning tree protocol that it's designed\n\n408\n00:23:15.629 --> 00:23:16.840\nto run by default.\n\n409\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.783\nNow if you wanna change it up,\njust like somebody in out chat room said,\n\n410\n00:23:19.783 --> 00:23:22.400\nhey I don't wanna run rapid spanning tree,\ncan you change it?\n\n411\n00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.060\nYes.\n\n412\n00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.760\nA lot of times you just have\nto go into the switch and\n\n413\n00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.808\nsee which ones it will support.\n\n414\n00:23:27.808 --> 00:23:32.155\nNow if you're running different multiple\nvendors of switches, to do this, make sure\n\n415\n00:23:32.155 --> 00:23:36.218\nyou pick one that's common between them or\nit's really not going to work at all.\n\n416\n00:23:36.218 --> 00:23:41.150\nAnd switching loops are kind of as bad\nas it really gets inside of a switch.\n\n417\n00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.310\nIt can really bring\ndown the entire switch.\n\n418\n00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:47.207\nIt can bring down your entire\nnetwork rapidly when it does it.\n\n419\n00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:49.850\nNow it might take a little\nbit of time to build.\n\n420\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.830\nBut when it brings it down, I mean,\nit successfully brings down the entire\n\n421\n00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:58.280\nnetwork very quickly once it hits that\nkind of apex point, or a criticality.\n\n422\n00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.335\nAnd I mean, that is just like,\nokay, that's done.\n\n423\n00:24:01.335 --> 00:24:05.303\nAnd the entire switch reboots, or\nit actually just freezes, and it's very\n\n424\n00:24:05.303 --> 00:24:09.700\ndifficult to recover from, except for\nremoving what be causing the loop.\n\n425\n00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:15.134\nAnd in a really, in an environment where\nthere's ten, 15 switches, good luck\n\n426\n00:24:15.134 --> 00:24:20.357\nat trying to figure out which particular\none is causing the loop at that point.\n\n427\n00:24:20.357 --> 00:24:23.260\nWhich means you'll probably just have\nto unplug every single thing from\n\n428\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.240\nthat switch.\n\n429\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.880\nAnd then plug it back in\nonce you figure it out here.\n\n430\n00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.480\nBut you're still gonna\nhave a loop going on.\n\n431\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.260\nSo you gotta actually\nbe very careful here.\n\n432\n00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.720\nLeave Spanning Tree running\nis pretty much what I'd say.\n\n433\n00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.115\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, we've gone through a lot\nof the different characteristics and\n\n434\n00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:39.517\nattributes when it comes\nto configuring a switch.\n\n435\n00:24:39.517 --> 00:24:41.652\nRonnie, we do appreciate you for\n\n436\n00:24:41.652 -->

00:00:11.814\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:13.714\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.860\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.980\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.120\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing on with more on our\n\n8\n00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.660\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.810\nAnd of course Joining us back in\nthe studio, the man, the myth, the legend,\n\n10\n00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.500\nyou know him as Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.630\nWes, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.270\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.080\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, it's going great and\n\n14\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.400\nI appreciate you having\nme back here at ITProTV.\n\n15\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.220\nThat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.160\nWe are continuing through\nNet+ just like Dan said and\n\n17\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.450\nwe're gonna be looking at well,\nWAN infrastructure today, and\n\n18\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.790\nmore specifically, the objective that\nwe're talking about here guys, cause well,\n\n19\n00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.040\nwe are here talking about the in\nN10-006 certification exam.\n\n20\n00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.380\nSo, this one's going to be install and\nconfigure, wireless LAN infrastructure,\n\n21\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.020\nand implement appropriate technologies,\nand\n\n22\n00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.400\nsupport of wireless capable devices,\nand a partridge in a pear tree.\n\n23\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.222\n&gt;&gt; Did you get,\nlike a breath in that sentence?\n\n24\n00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:02.417\nBecause it's a little lengthy [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n25\n00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:06.020\nWell CompTIA likes to be very,\nvery descriptive on their objectives.\n\n26\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.040\n&gt;&gt; I don't think you could tweet that.\n\n27\n00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.407\n&gt;&gt; Masters thesis,right, right there\nin the title so we went ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:10.407 --> 00:01:12.393\nwe shortened it to WAN infrastructure.\n\n29\n00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:16.516\n[LAUGH] That's what we gonna be looking at\ntoday guys and I will just go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:20.460\ndive right in and let's see what\nobjectives we will be discussing today.\n\n31\n00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390\nOne of the first things they talk\nabout our SOHO wireless routers or\n\n32\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.960\nwireless devices and the reason I\ncall it a wireless device is because\n\n33\n00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.950\na lot of times when we talk about\nhome routers or even small office,\n\n34\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.020\nhome office based routers, they're gonna\nbe doing more than just routing right?\n\n35\n00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.640\nThey're gonna be multi\nfunctioning devices.\n\n36\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.830\nA lot of times, they're going\nto be switching as well for us,\n\n37\n00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.980\nas well as the 802.11\ntechnologies that we talk about.\n\n38\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.150\nAnd then finally,\nrouting traffic up onto our ISP's network.\n\n39\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.270\nA lot of things that they're doing.\n\n40\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.020\nHowever, keep in mind that they do have\nsome restrictive functionalities when\n\n41\n00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.310\nit comes to comparison to\nenterprise level technologies.\n\n42\n00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.750\nDepends on what kind of\nfunctionality you need.\n\n43\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.510\nIf you need security built into them,\nyou can get some offerings like that.\n\n44\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.410\nIf you need VPN technologies.\n\n45\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.240\nYou have to keep in mind\nthat a small office,\n\n46\n00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500\na SOHO based router, while it might\nsupport things like VPN functionality,\n\n47\n00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.270\nand maybe even if it's got layer three or\nlayer two technology in it,\n\n48\n00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.860\nmaybe you can even do some VLAN\nsegmenting if you need to but for\n\n49\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.980\nthe most part you're going to have\na little bit less functionality.\n\n50\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.540\nYeah, it might support VLAN technologies,\nor even VPN communications,\n\n51\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.620\nbut it might not scale up to\na lot of simultaneous users so\n\n52\n00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.560\ndefinitely keep that in mind, as the\ndensity of your network is going to tell\n\n53\n00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.530\nwhether that device cuts the mustard or\nnot.\n\n54\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.170\nSo they talk about device density too.\n\n55\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.400\nI want you guys to think about device\ndensity as being how many devices do I\n\n56\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.240\nhave on that network, and\nhow many devices have to send and\n\n57\n00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.670\nreceive traffic along that network\nis going to dictate what type\n\n58\n00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.700\ninfrastructure we have to put into place,\nright?\n\n59\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.410\nIt's gonna be a little bit different of an\ninfrastructure if we're just talking about\n\n60\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.450\nmy home network, or even a small business.\n\n61\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.350\nSay if we're talking about for\ninstance like auditoriums, right.\n\n62\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.030\nAuditorium as we start having\nthe support hundreds and hundreds and\n\n63\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.440\nnot thousands of people for\ntaking about convention centers and\n\n64\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.310\nhotel meeting rooms are one of the things\nthat happens is device density goes up.\n\n65\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.440\nThe metric usually means that\nperformance starts to go down.\n\n66\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.330\nSo you gotta kinda weigh the pros and\ncons here.\n\n67\n00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.120\nHow many devices are you\ngonna be supporting versus\n\n68\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.910\nwhat is the overall cost of the device?\n\n69\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.420\n&gt;&gt; And, Wes, that comes from the fact\nthat you're sharing the bandwidth\n\n70\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.970\nof the device, right?\n\n71\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.520\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n72\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120\n&gt;&gt; So\nthose SOHO devices are probably not so\n\n73\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.880\nmuch meant to be connected to\nlarger scale type of bandwidths.\n\n74\n00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.330\nThis is going to be your DSLs, your\ncable modems, kind of things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.680\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, it's not something\nthat's gonna scale up a lot.\n\n76\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.800\nAnd usually what happens,\nif you need a larger scale like that,\n\n77\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.740\nyou start coupling things like\nmultiple access points together.\n\n78\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.400\nSo pay attention to the device, right?\n\n79\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.740\nPay attention to the specifications.\n\n80\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.390\nA lot of times vendors are really\ngood about telling you\n\n81\n00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.740\nwhat your maximum would\nbe that it's supports.\n\n82\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.940\nSo, for instance, if you needed a VPN\ncommunication from your small office to\n\n83\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.780\nanother location, maybe your\nsmall office isn't a home office.\n\n84\n00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.420\nMaybe it's just a small, very,\nvery small business, and\n\n85\n00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.610\nyou need to VPN back over\nto your home network.\n\n86\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.180\nWell, that might be fine if\nit's only a single connection.\n\n87\n00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.290\nBut when you start multiplying\nthose connections, again,\n\n88\n00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.790\nthe device itself can start to\nget a little bit more of a strain\n\n89\n00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.920\nas it starts to increase\nthe workload on that single device.\n\n90\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.050\nNow the other thing,\nwhat's kinda interesting,\n\n91\n00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.830\nthey call out something known as roaming.\n\n92\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.120\nNow when we talk about roaming,\n\n93\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.190\nroaming is the same concept that you think\nof in your cellular data communications.\n\n94\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.150\nBut keep in mind that when we talk about\ncellular data communications, we're\n\n95\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.010\ntypically talking about some kinda peering\nor partner agreement between Between two\n\n96\n00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.400\ncarriers that says, hey, once I leave my\nradio towers, my provider's radio towers,\n\n97\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.670\nI can hop off and start piggybacking off\nanother cellular provider's radio towers.\n\n98\n00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget the crazy hidden charges.\n\n99\n00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.395\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:57.365\n&gt;&gt; And don't forget the fine print.\n\n101\n00:04:57.365 --> 00:04:58.415\nThat's right.\n\n102\n00:04:58.415 --> 00:04:59.175\nThat's roaming, right.\n\n103\n00:04:59.175 --> 00:04:59.945\nWe know that as roaming.\n\n104\n00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.885\nSo I want you to take that same\nconcept that we've talked about,\n\n105\n00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.805\nlike in our GSM and\nour CDMA based networks, and\n\n106\n00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:10.110\ntake that over here into the Wireless\nlocal area network implementations, right?\n\n107\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.360\nWhen we talk about roaming here,\nwhat we're talking about\n\n108\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.030\nis moving between access points\nthat a lot of times are really,\n\n109\n00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.900\nthey're configured as a solid\nlarger network, right?\n\n110\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.400\nThey're all these individual access points\nare collectively meshed together and\n\n111\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.900\nthey're servicing a larger network, such\nas an auditorium, such as one of those\n\n112\n00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.100\nhotel conference rooms that might\nhave to scale up fairly large.\n\n113\n00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.360\nIn fact, let's kinda show you here so,\nif you look at wireless roaming.\n\n114\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.590\nI've got a little diagram here,\nnothing very spectacular here.\n\n115\n00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.980\nBut when I'm on this network again,\nthe whole network,\n\n116\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.410\nit's one giant network, right?\n\n117\n00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.340\nWhere we've got access points basically\nservicing one larger network.\n\n118\n00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.850\nAnd what happens is as I start leave\n\n119\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.400\nthe range of this single\naccess point here, right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.130\nI end up getting the ability\nto join the other network.\n\n121\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.670\nLet me get that back there.\n\n122\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.410\nAll right, ooh, we'll make random\nlines here, too, all right?\n\n123\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.530\nAnd as I leave this access point, what's\ngonna happen with roaming is that we\n\n124\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.290\nstart to come into the range of\nthe second access point here, right.\n\n125\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.470\nWell what is that process?\n\n126\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.060\nLet's talk a little bit\nabout that process.\n\n127\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.430\nSee when it comes to roaming,\n\n128\n00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.220\nroaming as far as the access points\nconsidered is a very simplistic process.\n\n129\n00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.600\nIt just means you're no\nlonger being managed by me.\n\n130\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.050\nI'm letting you go and another\naccess point is going to manage you.\n\n131\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.880\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n132\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.850\nBut the interesting thing about WiFi\nroaming is it's actually client driven.\n\n133\n00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.100\nIt's not access point driven.\n\n134\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.630\nTo the access point, you leave\nthe network, I couldn't care less.\n\n135\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.420\nBut the wireless client on the other hand\ndoes have a little bit more that they have\n\n136\n00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.390\nto go through, and that's something\nknown as the association process.\n\n137\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.540\nSee, when our wireless client leaves,\nwe're gonna kinda do this backwards here.\n\n138\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.750\nWhen the wireless client,\nleaves the range of the access point here,\n\n139\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.850\naccess point 2, what's kinda\ninteresting is there is built into\n\n140\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.610\nthe wireless client that we don't really\nsee, there's something known as an RSSI.\n\n141\n00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.880\nAnd that is the,\nlet me see if I can remember what RSSI,\n\n142\n00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.230\nreceived signal strength indicator,\nI had to write that one down.\n\n143\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.490\nAnd basically what this is saying, Dan,\nis something like an access point.\n\n144\n00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.520\nIt's giving you a signal and\nthe device says hey,\n\n145\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.340\nI've got a certain threshold set,\nI've got certain values set, that says\n\n146\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.240\nIf I drop below the signal strength\nindicator, I'm gonna, all bets are off.\n\n147\n00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.820\nThis access point isn't giving\nme the service I need, and\n\n148\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.680\nI'm gonna have to start\ndiscovering another access point.\n\n149\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.760\nNow, when it discovers a new access point,\ninteresting thing is,\n\n150\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.720\nit's no different than what we talk about\nwhen we talk about wireless local area\n\n151\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.080\nnetwork architecture, right.\n\n152\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.890\nAny time you join a wireless network or\nwireless client does,\n\n153\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.410\nwhat they do is they send this\nstation STA to AP probe, right.\n\n154\n00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.260\nIt's how we build the wireless networks,\nright?\n\n155\n00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.191\nOn our phones and stuff?\n\n156\n00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.750\nWhile our device is sitting there going,\n\n157\n00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.853\nconstantly saying hey anybody\nout there got a network?\n\n158\n00:07:55.853 --> 00:07:57.541\nAnybody out there got a network?\n\n159\n00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:01.292\nAnd we take that information, I say we,\nthe client device Does, and it stores that\n\n160\n00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:04.575\nand then it builds, basically,\na list of the available access points.\n\n161\n00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:08.610\nWell, essentially, that's what's going on\nhere,but it's just a little bit different,\n\n162\n00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.330\ncuz we've already authenticated\nto the network, all right.\n\n163\n00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.070\nBut now you have to re-authenticate\nto the next access point.\n\n164\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:20.730\nSo the scanning part is when again,\nthat RSI, if you will,\n\n165\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.950\nthat strength indicator says, okay,\nI give up on access point two.\n\n166\n00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.660\nSo, what does it do?\n\n167\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.340\nIt starts sending out those stations to AP\nprobes, says, hey, anybody else out there?\n\n168\n00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.930\nAnd we'll say that access\npoint one in our example says,\n\n169\n00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.260\nyeah, I'm over here you can\ncome talk to me, right?\n\n170\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.160\nYou're coming into the range of\nits ability to deliver you signal.\n\n171\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.220\nSo then you go through\nan authentication process.\n\n172\n00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.180\nAnd this is the same process\nthat I would if I was gonna join\n\n173\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.220\nDan's wireless network at his house,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.620\nGonna send a request for\nauthentication and we're gonna wait.\n\n175\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.600\nAnd it's either gonna be accepted or\nrejected.\n\n176\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.210\nOnce it's accepted,\nthen we go into the reassociation request.\n\n177\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.520\nThat's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n178\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.530\nHey, access point one,\nI need to rejoin the network, right?\n\n179\n00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.240\nI've already proved to you who I am,\nyou know you can trust me and\n\n180\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.020\nI've authenticated.\n\n181\n00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.430\nNow can I re-associate with\nyou as the access point?\n\n182\n00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.780\nWaits for the success or the rejection.\n\n183\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.590\nWe're gonna say that it's\nsuccessful in this case.\n\n184\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.610\nAnd then the last one here is really\nIt's more of a three step process.\n\n185\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.770\nI went ahead and\nput that one up there because,\n\n186\n00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.290\nwhat's interesting is, once the\nreassociation process happens with AP1,\n\n187\n00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.015\nbelieve it or\nnot the wireless client is nice.\n\n188\n00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:27.660\nIt says, hey, you know,\naccess point two, it's been nice,\n\n189\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.800\nwe've had good times together, but let me\ngo ahead, and we're gonna cut it off here.\n\n190\n00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.715\nAnd it actually sends back to\nAP2 a disassociaton signal.\n\n191\n00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:39.080\nIt says,\nhey I'm no longer being managed by you,\n\n192\n00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.590\nI'm being managed by somebody else.\n\n193\n00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.984\nAll right,\nnow I do wanna make mention that,\n\n194\n00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:48.861\nthat receive signal strength indicator,\n\n195\n00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:54.150\nunderstand that, it's not something\nthat you can actually see, right?\n\n196\n00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.940\nI could put a wireless spectrum\nanalyzer out there on the network,\n\n197\n00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.850\nif I'm doing like a site\nsurvey with the heat map, and\n\n198\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.030\nI can detect signal strength,\nright, measured in decimals.\n\n199\n00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.890\nThis isn't something that you can see,\nas far as that RSSI,\n\n200\n00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.740\nthat indicator inside of the Client.\n\n201\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.160\nIt's something that the client does, and\n\n202\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.960\naccording to however the manufacturer's\nimplemented on the network adapter,\n\n203\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.890\nit sets that value,\nthat value is already internally set.\n\n204\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.730\nSo I do wanna keep mention of that.\n\n205\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.890\nAll right, next thing that they call\nout is something known a VLAN pooling.\n\n206\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.790\nLet's talk a little bit about VLANs and\nwhat VLANs are.\n\n207\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:33.060\nA virtual local area network really is,\nit's a way to take one switch and\n\n208\n00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.930\nlogically divide it up into more switches,\nis what it boils down to.\n\n209\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:40.080\nBut I want you to think about a wireless\ncommunication, and a wireless technology.\n\n210\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.080\nHere we're sitting at layer two\njust like your switches are.\n\n211\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.010\nWouldn't it be nice if we had\nA massive amount of wireless access\n\n212\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.160\npoints all servicing a single network.\n\n213\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.710\nTo be able to logically divide\nthose wireless local area networks\n\n214\n00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.470\ninto their own divisions.\n\n215\n00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.350\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat VLAN pooling is.\n\n216\n00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.400\nIf you take a look at my diagram here.\n\n217\n00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.920\nVLAN pooling is kind of like what\nwe do on our switches when we just\n\n218\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.980\ncreate VLANs, right?\n\n219\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.640\nNow what we're Saying as we have\na series of access points, right?\n\n220\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.710\nAnd all these access points are configured\nto serve as a single network.\n\n221\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.690\nBut what we would like to do, is we\nwould like to logically divide these up.\n\n222\n00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.250\nSo, let me give you a scenario\nwhere this might come in handy.\n\n223\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.790\nMaybe we've got guests,\nmaybe we've got teachers and\n\n224\n00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.310\nmaybe we've got students, right?\n\n225\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.398\nAll in the same network, right?\n\n226\n00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:29.410\nThey're joining the same wireless network,\nbut wouldn't it be nice if we can say,\n\n227\n00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:35.050\nokay, we're gonna create a VLAN 10, and\nthose, regardless of where you connect to,\n\n228\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.140\nif we can identify you as a student\ndevice, right, and how they set up and\n\n229\n00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.190\nhow the connect with dictate how it's\nconfigured, we'll put you on VLAN 10.\n\n230\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.240\nBut if you're a teacher, and you connect\nto the wireless network, right, we're\n\n231\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.690\ngonna put you in VLAN 20 and only you can\ntalk to devices that are also in VLAN 20.\n\n232\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.980\nAnd then, finally,\nsame thing with VLAN 30.\n\n233\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.180\nSo imagine taking one larger\nwireless network, and\n\n234\n00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:08.130\nlogically dividing it up to their own\nindividual virtual local area networks.\n\n235\n00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.630\nSo even though it looks,\n[LAUGH] The diagram looks all convoluted.\n\n236\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.230\nIf you take everything out,\nwhat are we left with?\n\n237\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.780\nWell, we're left with three\ndistinct wireless networks, right?\n\n238\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.580\nWe've got a series of computers that\nare grouped together in VLAN 10,\n\n239\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.230\nVLAN 20 and VLAN 30.\n\n240\n00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.930\nAnd this allows us to implement\nthings like, access control lists so\n\n241\n00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.880\nwe can further control security.\n\n242\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.170\nBecause then once you have your\nVLAN pools in place, in order for\n\n243\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.710\nthese VLANS to communicate\nbetween each other,\n\n244\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.430\nnow we're gonna have to add\nlayer three routing technology.\n\n245\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.410\nSo it's also a way to completely\nsegregate that information.\n\n246\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.130\nIncluding things like\nthe broadcast communication.\n\n247\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.570\nSo VLAN pool or VLAN pooling, you'll hear\nthe terms used synonymously, they're\n\n248\n00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.200\ninterchangeable, is the fact that I can\ntake multiple wireless access points,\n\n249\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200\nservicing a larger wireless network, and\n\n250\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.870\ndivide that network up into smaller\nlogical groupings of computers in order.\n\n251\n00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.610\nWell we could implement security\nACLs to further the security.\n\n252\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.890\nWe can say, you know what, I don't\nwant VLAN 10 talking to VLAN 20, so\n\n253\n00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.960\nI don't even add layer three routing.\n\n254\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.820\nSo you can divide it up a little bit\nmore logically, based on your needs.\n\n255\n00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.650\nAll right, so VLAN pooling,\ndo keep that in mind, what it is.\n\n256\n00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.890\nIt might show up on the exam.\n\n257\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.500\nThey might give give you a scenario,\nin which you might need to say, well,\n\n258\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.800\nwe're gonna use the LAN pooling.\n\n259\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.300\nAgain, it's a way to divide up your\n\n260\n00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.080\nwireless local area networks\ninto logical divisions.\n\n261\n00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.680\nAll right, so the next thing that we're\ngonna talk about is, well, we're never shy\n\n262\n00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.680\nof any acronyms here at ITProTV, and\ncertainly not on a CompTIA exam.\n\n263\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.090\nAnd the next one is something\nknown as LWAPP, all right?\n\n264\n00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.430\nI don't even know if I, LWAPP?\n\n265\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.400\n&gt;&gt; LWAPP.\n&gt;&gt; LWAPP, yeah, so that's a great one.\n\n266\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.000\nSo what does that mean?\n\n267\n00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.490\nThat is the lightweight access\npoint protocol, all right?\n\n268\n00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.070\nSo what does that mean?\n\n269\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.430\nLet's take all the jargon out of it guys.\n\n270\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.120\nIf I want to centrally manage\nmultiple wireless access points.\n\n271\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.550\nI can configure them,\nif they're LWAP compliant,\n\n272\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.760\nto basically communicate with\na wireless LAN controller, like for\n\n273\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.270\ninstance maybe a Cisco WLC\nWireless LAN Controller, right?\n\n274\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.050\nOr Wireless Network Controller.\n\n275\n00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:26.130\nAnd they report into the wireless\ncontroller and then, from that controller,\n\n276\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.500\nwe can essentially manage\nall the wireless devices,\n\n277\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.200\nwireless Access points on our network.\n\n278\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.330\nI've got to be careful with that one.\n\n279\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.240\nSo if we look here,\nI've actually got a little diagram, right?\n\n280\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.120\nIf you've got a series of wireless APs,\n\n281\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.960\nand they're all going to be servicing the\nsame network, what we can configure them\n\n282\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.210\nto communicate with the wireless\ncontroller and over the LWAPP.\n\n283\n00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.570\nI gotta be careful with that,\n\n284\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:53.160\nLWAPP protocol, what we could do is we\ncould send out configuration commands.\n\n285\n00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.360\nWe can control these access\npoints that then turn and\n\n286\n00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.460\ngive access to our wireless devices.\n\n287\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.873\nAnd I did mention device density.\n\n288\n00:14:59.873 --> 00:15:02.870\nI might wanna mention the other thing\nabout device density while we're here,\n\n289\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.976\nbecause it is something to take into\nconsideration today, especially with\n\n290\n00:15:07.976 --> 00:15:13.325\nthe prevalence of things like,\nI almost said HTTP, high definition video.\n\n291\n00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:15.360\nSo, audio, video,\n\n292\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.440\na lot bigger files, Blu-ray video\nthat we're streaming media out.\n\n293\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.911\nRemember that you have to keep in mind,\nthe device itself,\n\n294\n00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:27.440\nyour connectivity device might not be\nable to service the network's performance\n\n295\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.170\nadequately, so\nyou do have to pay attention to that.\n\n296\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.760\nLittle note to myself to make\nsure that we talked about that.\n\n297\n00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:42.656\nOkay, so that has us pretty much with what\nour lightweight access point protocol is.\n\n298\n00:15:42.656 --> 00:15:46.855\nKeep in mind that it's a way to\nmanage your wireless access points,\n\n299\n00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:51.364\nwhen you have a bunch of them all\nconfigured to service a single network.\n\n300\n00:15:51.364 --> 00:15:54.682\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, we've been talking a lot,\nbasically, about layer two,\n\n301\n00:15:54.682 --> 00:15:56.721\ninside of wireless access Access points.\n\n302\n00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:00.247\nAnd I know there are also\nwireless bridges.\n\n303\n00:16:00.247 --> 00:16:02.565\nIn traditional networking a bridge and\na switch,\n\n304\n00:16:02.565 --> 00:16:06.360\nreally not a whole lot of difference\ngoing on there other than port density.\n\n305\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.260\nIs that the same kind of idea\nhere when we go into wireless?\n\n306\n00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.780\n&gt;&gt; It's absolutely the same, yeah.\n\n307\n00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.520\nSo the concept that Dan's talking\nabout with regular bridges,\n\n308\n00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.880\njust now we got a wireless bridge.\n\n309\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.210\nSo when we think about a bridge,\nright, Dan,\n\n310\n00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.340\nyou've already mentioned it, pretty much.\n\n311\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.890\nWhat we do is we've got one segment\nthat we now bridge together, and\n\n312\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.530\nwe can now talk to that segment.\n\n313\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.950\nWe got a bridge in the middle of it,\nthink what a bridge allows you to do.\n\n314\n00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.580\nI want you to think\nabout a wireless bridge.\n\n315\n00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.626\nBut I want you to be\ncareful with this one.\n\n316\n00:16:30.626 --> 00:16:33.255\nCuz at first thought,\nyou might think, well,\n\n317\n00:16:33.255 --> 00:16:36.037\nif a bridge bridges two\nwired networks together.\n\n318\n00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:39.210\nDoesn't a wireless bridge\nbridge two wireless networks?\n\n319\n00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.413\nAnd you'd be wrong.\n\n320\n00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:43.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Let's just understand that here\n\n321\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.050\nI've actually got a diagram here.\n\n322\n00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:51.110\nA wireless bridge is actually one that\nbridges together two wired networks.\n\n323\n00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.756\nSo for instance maybe one side,\nnetwork A, my wired network.\n\n324\n00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:58.311\nThis is where we're communicating\nwith our ISP and the internet, right?\n\n325\n00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:02.318\nWell maybe this network, wired network\nhere doesn't have the ability to have some\n\n326\n00:17:02.318 --> 00:17:04.450\nkind of gateway off of\ntheir local network.\n\n327\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.207\nWell if I put a wireless\nbridge here in the middle,\n\n328\n00:17:07.207 --> 00:17:10.174\nthen what I can do is I'm\nbridging the wired network.\n\n329\n00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:16.074\nEssentially allowing these clients\non wired network B to communicate.\n\n330\n00:17:16.074 --> 00:17:19.219\nThrough the wireless bridge into\nthis wired network, essentially,\n\n331\n00:17:19.219 --> 00:17:20.186\nout to the Internet.\n\n332\n00:17:20.186 --> 00:17:23.136\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that these access\npoints aren't acting as standard\n\n333\n00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:23.836\naccess points.\n\n334\n00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:26.140\nWhere people are connecting to it and\nyou've got a bunch of clients.\n\n335\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.260\nIt's just specifically for the purpose\nof taking two wired LAN segments and\n\n336\n00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.680\nconnecting them via wireless.\n\n337\n00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.800\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.\n\n338\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.290\nThey're not really doing your typical what\nwe would think of AP management mode.\n\n339\n00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.440\nWhere they're managing all\nthe communications on the network.\n\n340\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.590\nThat's exactly what they're doing.\n\n341\n00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:47.000\nThey're allowing two wired networks that\notherwise wouldn't be able to communicate.\n\n342\n00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.158\nWe're bridging the gap between two of\nthem and allowing them to communicate.\n\n343\n00:17:50.158 --> 00:17:54.107\n&gt;&gt; Very cool, now you said another\nterm just a few minutes ago.\n\n344\n00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:56.268\nYou were talking about heat maps.\n\n345\n00:17:56.268 --> 00:17:57.820\nAnd that's an interesting thing.\n\n346\n00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.190\nBecause you think heat maps,\nyou think, well, we're looking for\n\n347\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.970\nthermal density of something.\n\n348\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.510\nAnd that's not necessarily the case here.\n\n349\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right because we pick up signal.\n\n350\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.260\nWe have devices out there,\nwireless site surveyors if you will,\n\n351\n00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.740\nwireless spectrum analyzers.\n\n352\n00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.440\nAnd what they do is they pick up\nthe frequency and they generate,\n\n353\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.020\nbasically, I think about\nthe movie Predator, right?\n\n354\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; A heat signature, right?\n\n355\n00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.540\nThe way you think about thermal\ninfrared type signature.\n\n356\n00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.330\nNow what are they doing\nwhen we look at heat maps?\n\n357\n00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.840\nWell, I want you to think about I go to\nan area, in fact, let's take ITProTV.\n\n358\n00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.970\nWe're right in the middle of a commercial\nindustrial type park if you will.\n\n359\n00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.120\nWe're called Tower Technology Park and\n\n360\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.290\naround us there are several\nwireless access points.\n\n361\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.810\nIn fact,\nwe also have things like obstacles,\n\n362\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.250\nwe've got electrical grids that\nare running around, right.\n\n363\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.019\nAnd we need to figure out where do we set\nour wireless access points to ensure that\n\n364\n00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:53.771\nwe're gonna get the best coverage?\n\n365\n00:18:53.771 --> 00:18:54.999\nWell, we do a site survey.\n\n366\n00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:58.981\nAnd the site survey shows us things\nlike electromagnetic interference.\n\n367\n00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:02.901\nThings like radio frequencies,\nradio frequency interference if you will.\n\n368\n00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:05.604\nAnd it draws out this infrared type map.\n\n369\n00:19:05.604 --> 00:19:09.601\nThat we can utilize in order to give us\nan idea of where we're gonna place our\n\n370\n00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:11.319\nantennas, our access points.\n\n371\n00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:14.409\nAnd how we're gonna point the antennas\nto make sure that we're getting\n\n372\n00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:16.171\nthe most coverage within our building.\n\n373\n00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.771\nAnd that we're avoiding\nthings like those hot spots.\n\n374\n00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:24.002\nIt might be electrically generated\ninterference that could be\n\n375\n00:19:24.002 --> 00:19:25.529\ncausing the problem.\n\n376\n00:19:25.529 --> 00:19:29.234\nIt might be radio, RFI, right,\nradio frequency interference.\n\n377\n00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:33.778\nSo the heat maps are a way that we can\nkind of gauge where we're gonna place our\n\n378\n00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:34.784\naccess points.\n\n379\n00:19:34.784 --> 00:19:37.560\nWhen we are setting up a wireless network.\n\n380\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.155\nAll right, so,\nnext thing that we look at are,\n\n381\n00:19:42.155 --> 00:19:45.308\n[LAUGH] they call out frequencies and\nchannels.\n\n382\n00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:48.402\nGuys, I'm gonna kind of do these together\ncuz they kind of run hand in hand, right?\n\n383\n00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:54.990\nIf we've got a frequency that we operate\nin, or a frequency spectrum if you will.\n\n384\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.929\nThen divided up within that larger\nspectrum are individual channels.\n\n385\n00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:01.141\nAnd we do need to take a look at that.\n\n386\n00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:05.365\nBecause when we talk about wireless\ncommunications we're typically talking\n\n387\n00:20:05.365 --> 00:20:07.160\nabout two different spectrums.\n\n388\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.222\nAnd we'll start out here\nwith the 2.4 GHz spectrum,\n\n389\n00:20:10.222 --> 00:20:14.339\nthis is what's known as the industrial,\nscientifical and medical band.\n\n390\n00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.480\nAnd I just want you to be able\nto pick out in a scenario.\n\n391\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.446\nIf they give you maybe a scenario where\nyou need to configure a series of\n\n392\n00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:23.632\naccess points.\n\n393\n00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:26.919\nAnd you need to make sure that\nthey're on non-overlapping channels,\n\n394\n00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:28.740\nwould you know what that means?\n\n395\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.201\nWould you know why you would do that?\n\n396\n00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:32.843\nWell, that's what we hope to\nkind of clear up right here.\n\n397\n00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:35.849\nSo here in the States, it's different\nwhen you talk about Europe, and\n\n398\n00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:37.717\nit's different when you talk about Japan.\n\n399\n00:20:37.717 --> 00:20:39.929\nBecause Japan has some\nvariations of this and\n\n400\n00:20:39.929 --> 00:20:43.152\nEurope that will not match what we\nhave here in the United States.\n\n401\n00:20:43.152 --> 00:20:47.090\nSo if you want that information\nyou can always check\n\n402\n00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.730\nout Wikipedia's got some good\ndocumentation out there.\n\n403\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.650\nBut we just want to talk about what\nthe FCC allows us here in the States\n\n404\n00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.940\nin 2.4 GHz spectrum.\n\n405\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.260\nIt is an 11 channel band.\n\n406\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.200\nI know you guys out there that\nknow this are gonna say, no Wes,\n\n407\n00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.270\nit's a 14 channel band.\n\n408\n00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.580\nYes, I understand but\n12 is only used in Europe.\n\n409\n00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.310\n13 is only used in Europe.\n\n410\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.090\nJapan is the only one that uses them all.\n\n411\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.700\nIn fact, Japan's 11B is the only\none that uses channel 14.\n\n412\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.610\nSo yes I'm aware.\n\n413\n00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:17.600\n11 channels that we use\nhere in the States, right.\n\n414\n00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.850\nThe channels are 22 megahertz apiece.\n\n415\n00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.760\nThat doesn't really matter for the exam.\n\n416\n00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.140\nI know it's a lot of little statistics but\n\n417\n00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.410\nwhat you have to know is that\nthey are spaced out in a way.\n\n418\n00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:32.160\nChannels one, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, eight, nine, ten and eleven.\n\n419\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.970\nThat we only have three channels that\ndon't overlap each other, right?\n\n420\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.517\nThey don't cause interference\nwith one another.\n\n421\n00:21:39.517 --> 00:21:44.816\nAnd that is one, six, and 11.\n\n422\n00:21:44.816 --> 00:21:47.170\nNow here's where this comes into play.\n\n423\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.930\nA lot of access points, especially\nthe home access points, default to, for\n\n424\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.200\ninstance, I believe channel\n6 is a common default.\n\n425\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.020\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\n426\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.239\nLet's say it's 1,\nlet's say it's 11, all right?\n\n427\n00:21:57.239 --> 00:22:00.737\nLet's say nobody changes their access\npoints in your neighborhood from\n\n428\n00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:02.641\nthe default, let's just say it is 6.\n\n429\n00:22:02.641 --> 00:22:04.810\nWell, that causes channel congestion,\nright?\n\n430\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:10.660\nBecause we're both operating on the same\nfrequency right down to the megahertz.\n\n431\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.630\nThat we can cause things like\ninterference and congestion.\n\n432\n00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.410\nSo, one of the things that they tell you\nis you could leave your wireless access\n\n433\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.820\npoint's configurations to auto and\nit does it for you.\n\n434\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.952\nBut does it do it appropriately?\n\n435\n00:22:23.952 --> 00:22:27.749\nWhat happens if it detects that you're on\nchannel 6 and it bumps over to channel 11.\n\n436\n00:22:27.749 --> 00:22:30.590\nAnd then somebody else's\ncomes online on channel 11?\n\n437\n00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.021\nSo, you can use your heat maps, right.\n\n438\n00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:34.986\nHeat maps show the signal's strength.\n\n439\n00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:38.474\nBut they can also show things\nlike the channels around you,\n\n440\n00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:41.140\nwhat access points\nare using what channels.\n\n441\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.312\nAnd you move your channel of your 2.4\ngigahertz network to another channel,\n\n442\n00:22:45.312 --> 00:22:47.757\noff of whatever the auto-configuration is.\n\n443\n00:22:47.757 --> 00:22:52.125\nSo, again, remember 11 channels,\nnon-overlapping channels for\n\n444\n00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:54.900\npurposes of performance, 1, 6 and 11.\n\n445\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.540\nNow they also call out,\n[LAUGH] well, the 5 GHz spectrum.\n\n446\n00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.240\nAnd you could see, Dan,\nmy 5 GHz spectrum diagram is fantastic.\n\n447\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.125\n&gt;&gt; It's an amazing work of art.\n\n448\n00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:08.338\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I understand everything about 5 GHz.\n\n449\n00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:09.812\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect, that's right.\n\n450\n00:23:09.812 --> 00:23:11.055\n[CROSSTALK] Are you ready for the exam?\n\n451\n00:23:11.055 --> 00:23:11.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, here's\n\n452\n00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.200\nwhat you should be ready for.\n\n453\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.932\nThere are a lot of channels, right.\n\n454\n00:23:14.932 --> 00:23:19.062\nAnd they don't all go in order like we\nsee in one, two, three, four, five, six,\n\n455\n00:23:19.062 --> 00:23:22.488\nseven, eight, nine, ten,\neleven in 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n456\n00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:24.289\nSo I did not write them all out here.\n\n457\n00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:27.154\nI don't think they're gonna expect\nyou to know every individual channel.\n\n458\n00:23:27.154 --> 00:23:31.238\nHowever, know in the US,\nthose channels start at 36.\n\n459\n00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:36.006\nAnd they work their way up to,\nI put 135, I'll have to double check.\n\n460\n00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:39.404\nCuz I believe that might be 165,\nin fact I'm thinking that's right.\n\n461\n00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:41.760\nI don't think 135 was right, 165.\n\n462\n00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.622\nAnd what's interesting about the five\ngigahertz spectrum is the fact that at\n\n463\n00:23:46.622 --> 00:23:50.885\nthe time of the recording of this show,\nit's relatively [INAUDIBLE]\n\n464\n00:23:50.885 --> 00:23:55.822\nBecoming more use with things like\nyour 802.11n, and then certainly,\n\n465\n00:23:55.822 --> 00:24:01.240\nyour 802.11ac devices that are out there,\ncuz they run in the 5GHz spectrum.\n\n466\n00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.346\nNow one of the good things in spectrum\nas well that built into the 802.11\n\n467\n00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:09.768\nspecification, is that each channel that\nwe use here in the United States supports\n\n468\n00:24:09.768 --> 00:24:11.150\nsomething known as DFS.\n\n469\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:14.024\nThat is the Dynamic Frequency\nSelection Technology, and\n\n470\n00:24:14.024 --> 00:24:15.673\nit's built into every channel.\n\n471\n00:24:15.673 --> 00:24:19.987\nAnd, if you are going to be\ncompliant with 5GHz spectrum,\n\n472\n00:24:19.987 --> 00:24:24.560\nit has to be built in according\nto the standard as well.\n\n473\n00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.480\nAnd DFS, Dynamic Frequency Selection,\nthis is kind of cool,\n\n474\n00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.530\nis the fact that, when we moved into\nthe 5 GHz band, a lot of radar systems,\n\n475\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.560\nincluding things like your Doppler radar\nsystems, are on that 5 GHz spectrum too.\n\n476\n00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.640\nSo they wanted a way that devices,\nthese unrestricted,\n\n477\n00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.562\nunlicensed, if you will, using band,\nthey're using the unlicensed band,\n\n478\n00:24:47.562 --> 00:24:50.760\nthat they don't interfere\nwith those radar systems.\n\n479\n00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.110\nSo what they do is they use dynamic\nfrequency selection that says,\n\n480\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.850\nif I detect a radar system using this,\n\n481\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.840\ndynamically switched to another\nfrequency or another channel.\n\n482\n00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.840\nSo, keep that in mind, and again,\nthe channels here running from 36 to 165,\n\n483\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:11.480\nI do believe 165 is the top end there\non that, and again the 5 GHz spectrum.\n\n484\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.740\nWe use larger channel widths.\n\n485\n00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.440\nYou'll see that in, for instance,\n802.11n, if you're on an A network,\n\n486\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.130\nyou're using 40 MHz channels.\n\n487\n00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.580\nIf you're doing backwards compatibility,\nit splits those channels up and\n\n488\n00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:30.180\nyou're using 20 MHz for old legacy\ndevices, 20 MHz for new legacy devices.\n\n489\n00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.270\nOr, if you're just supporting\nall new devices,N devices,\n\n490\n00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.170\nyou could aggregate those together, and\n\n491\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.040\nyou get a 40 MHz bandwidth,\npumping out a lot of information.\n\n492\n00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.670\nBut then if you move into AC, the newer\nstandards, not only do you get the 40 MHz,\n\n493\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:49.550\nbut they double that to 80 MHz, and\nthen they double that to 160 MHz.\n\n494\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.482\nSo you can see a lot of\ninformation being pumped out,\n\n495\n00:25:52.482 --> 00:25:54.690\naccording to the new standards today.\n\n496\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.370\nAll right, Dan, so a couple other\nthings that they call out here too,\n\n497\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.850\nthat we want to kinda be aware of,\nsignal strength.\n\n498\n00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:09.030\nActually, I tell you what, we're gonna go\nand, let's do something known as good put.\n\n499\n00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.100\nThis is kinda interesting.\n\n500\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.960\nI look [LAUGH] at this technology.\n\n501\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.080\nWe always think of bandwidth, and\nwe think of through put, if you will.\n\n502\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.010\nLet's go ahead, and let's start\nby demystifying what those mean.\n\n503\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.390\nI got a little bit of a diagram here.\n\n504\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.350\nLet's say I use a wireless\nnetwork analyzer or\n\n505\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:32.310\njust a network analyzer in general, and\nI learned that my bandwidth, I know that,\n\n506\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.300\naccording to standards, I've set my\nnetwork up for a gigabit standard, right?\n\n507\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.490\nThat's what I said, I got gigabit nics,\nI got gigabit speed cables,\n\n508\n00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.855\nI got gigabit devices.\n\n509\n00:26:41.855 --> 00:26:46.849\nYou gotta understand that, that's just the\ntheoretical bandwidth, if I could saturate\n\n510\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.460\nall the amount of information I could\nthrow off that network at one time.\n\n511\n00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.200\nBut that's not reality.\n\n512\n00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.420\nReality is what's actually happening,\nand that's throughput.\n\n513\n00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.320\nThroughput says, yeah, I know what the\nbandwidth is, I've got a gigabit network.\n\n514\n00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.300\nBut when I take into consideration other\nthings, like on that gigabit network,\n\n515\n00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.889\nout there on one of those lines.\n\n516\n00:27:05.889 --> 00:27:09.286\nI've got a cable that's been\npulled a little bit too far,\n\n517\n00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:13.880\nundoes some of the twists, reduces\nthe performance of the cable, all right.\n\n518\n00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.720\nWe've got, what else?\n\n519\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.495\nThat's not only thing we've got, right?\n\n520\n00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:20.410\nWe've got, maybe, some electromagnetic\ninterference somewhere within those lines.\n\n521\n00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.090\nDoesn't matter that your\ntheoretical bandwidth is a gig,\n\n522\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.350\nthose are factors that are stepping down\nthe overall top speed of your network.\n\n523\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:34.224\nUnderstand that throughput is what's\nactually happening, all right.\n\n524\n00:27:34.224 --> 00:27:39.373\nNow, that being said, that's interesting,\nokay, we'll just leave that there for now.\n\n525\n00:27:39.373 --> 00:27:43.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; EMI does cause problems, doesn't it?\n\n526\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.650\nSo that's throughput,\nthroughput says in a given second,\n\n527\n00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:51.480\nhow much data do I actually\nhave on that wire?\n\n528\n00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.070\nWell, where does goodput come in?\n\n529\n00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.610\nWell, goodput's kinda interesting.\n\n530\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:01.580\nGoodput, you'll have to ask the question,\nhow much of the data was actually useful?\n\n531\n00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.770\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n532\n00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:03.570\nWell, I want you to think,\n\n533\n00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.930\nnot every bit of that 700 Mb\nthroughput is useful data, right?\n\n534\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.930\nI have, well, what do we have?\n\n535\n00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.740\nWe've got network communications,\nwe got network control, right?\n\n536\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.560\nARP responses, we got negative\nacknowledgements, acknowledgements, right?\n\n537\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.770\nMy network adapter cares\nabout the acknowledgements.\n\n538\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.310\nBut my application, that's up on my\ndesktop, that's processing the data,\n\n539\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.580\ndoes it care about a retransmit?\n\n540\n00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.890\nThat's not good data.\n\n541\n00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:36.470\nSo with goodput,\ndon't let the term fool you.\n\n542\n00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:41.000\nWhat you're actually actually kinda doing,\nis looking inside the data.\n\n543\n00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.330\nWhat is the actual data, right?\n\n544\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.100\nI know the bandwidth overall is 700 Mb,\nbut that doesn't\n\n545\n00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.940\nmean that's what I'm actually processing,\nup there at the application layer.\n\n546\n00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:57.200\nSo if I take out retransmits,\nif I take out network communication and\n\n547\n00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.040\ncontrol information, and\nI'm left with just the application data,\n\n548\n00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.080\nwell that's essentially what goodput is.\n\n549\n00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.670\nGoodput says, I don't care\nwhat the throughput is, right?\n\n550\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.820\nThat's all the data.\n\n551\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.070\nAll I care about is what is\nthe application layer data,\n\n552\n00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.110\nthat was delivered to\nthe application itself, right?\n\n553\n00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:22.210\nAnd you could see that goodput could be\nseveral megabits lower than what your\n\n554\n00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.420\nthroughput is, so they do call that out.\n\n555\n00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.050\nIt's not a real good way\nto measure goodput, right?\n\n556\n00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.360\nIf it's throughput, I could put some\nkind of network analyzer on it, right?\n\n557\n00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.270\nI can put a cable certifier on it, and\nI could test information like that.\n\n558\n00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.760\nWhen you use goodput, it's almost\nalways gonna be some kind of software,\n\n559\n00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:44.070\nthat does trending analysis over time,\nand says, okay well, your through\n\n560\n00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:48.170\nputs in 700 Mb, but we know that web\napplication server, man, it's crawling.\n\n561\n00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.690\n&gt;&gt; This is definitely one of the things\nthat would trick me up on an exam,\n\n562\n00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.110\nbecause I would think, goodput,\nif it's anything that was good data,\n\n563\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.230\nwell, retransmits are good because\nwithout them, I didn't transmit anything.\n\n564\n00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.460\nI get garbled nests at the end\nof the thing, right so,\n\n565\n00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:00.990\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n566\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.190\n&gt;&gt; It would totally jack me up.\n\n567\n00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.070\nYou have to keep in mind on what\nthey mean when they say goodput,\n\n568\n00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.410\nnot what you might interpret it as.\n\n569\n00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.040\n&gt;&gt; That is a great point Dan.\n\n570\n00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.020\nI had to do the same thing.\n\n571\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.450\nStep out and put my blinders on,\nif you will,\n\n572\n00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:18.150\nfrom the perspective of the application\nthat's waiting on the data, right?\n\n573\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.610\nI need my pizza, that's what I want.\n\n574\n00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.810\nI don't care what road the guy,\nhe didn't have to tell me,\n\n575\n00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.310\nI went down this road,\nI took a right, I passed the guy,\n\n576\n00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.660\nthe old guy in the rocking chair\nwith the dogs sitting next to it,\n\n577\n00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.240\nI don't care about all that-\n&gt;&gt; I'm driving a Honda Civic,\n\n578\n00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:32.950\nit's black, yeah.\n\n579\n00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.355\n&gt;&gt; You're driving a Honda Civic,\nit's been tricked out, right?\n\n580\n00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:36.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't care about that,\n\n581\n00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:37.961\nI want my pizza, right?\n\n582\n00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.150\n[LAUGH] Well,\nthe application just wants its data,\n\n583\n00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:41.560\nit doesn't care about all the other stuff.\n\n584\n00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.230\nAnd that's essentially what goodput is for\nus.\n\n585\n00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.730\nAll right, Dan, I know we're\nrunning a little bit short on time.\n\n586\n00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:53.950\nI do have a few more things, but I don't\nknow that I can put it in this episode,\n\n587\n00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.120\nso we might have to go into a part two.\n\n588\n00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that sounds perfect, right?\n\n589\n00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.670\nBecause sometimes that happens.\n\n590\n00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.870\nAnd you know we love our part\ntwos around here at ITProTV.\n\n591\n00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.150\nHopefully you do, and\nyou'll watch that one as well.\n\n592\n00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.640\nWes, a lot of great information in this\nepisode though, so we appreciate that.\n\n593\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.310\nWe do appreciate our viewers for\nwatching, but\n\n594\n00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.580\nit does look like it's about that time for\nus to sign off.\n\n595\n00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.110\nSo, signing off, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n596\n00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.750\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n597\n00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.268\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n598\n00:31:19.268 --> 00:31:25.151\n[MUSIC]\n\n599\n00:31:25.151 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:12.175\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:12.964\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n6\n00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:16.670\nGreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.845\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.385\nAnd in today's episode we are continuing\non with more on our Network+ series\n\n9\n00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.430\nfrom CompTIA.\n\n10\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.560\nAnd of course, joining us back\nin the studio yet again for\n\n11\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.960\na part two on Wireless Infrastructure\nis our good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.630\nWes, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.010\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, what have been\ngoing even better if I would have managed\n\n14\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.695\nto not talk so much in the first episode.\n\n15\n00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:38.316\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Lot of info there.\n\n16\n00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:42.294\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've got a couple more topics\nthat we have to discuss when it comes to\n\n17\n00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:46.410\nconfiguring and implementing wireless\nlocal area network infrastructure.\n\n18\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.230\nAnd we didn't manage to put\nthose in the first part,\n\n19\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.830\nso that is why we\nare back with a part two.\n\n20\n00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.680\nKeep in mind some of the stuff that\nwe talked about in the first part.\n\n21\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.580\nIf you're just joining us, definitely\ngo back and check out the first part.\n\n22\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.030\nWe talked about wireless access points,\ndevice density, roaming, VLAN pooling.\n\n23\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.128\nWe even talked about the lightweight\nwireless access point protocol.\n\n24\n00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:11.027\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n25\n00:01:11.027 --> 00:01:14.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Protocol, protocol, point protocol\n\n26\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.830\nwhere we can control the configurations\nof a multitude of access points\n\n27\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.900\non our network from a single location,\nchannels and all kinds of good things.\n\n28\n00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.020\nIf any of that sounds foreign to you,\ngo back and\n\n29\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.880\ncheck that episode out, and then come\nback and you can round it off here.\n\n30\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.100\nSome of the things that\nwe're going to talk about,\n\n31\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.840\none of the first things that we got\nto talk about are topology types.\n\n32\n00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.620\nProbably it would had been a great thing\nto start out with the different topologies\n\n33\n00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100\nthat we have in wireless local\narea network implementation, but\n\n34\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330\nwe can talk about them for sure here.\n\n35\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.530\nSo let's go ahead, I've got a little\ndiagram here, and one of the things that\n\n36\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.480\nthey talk about is a couple\ndifferent types of these topologies.\n\n37\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.888\nThey talk about what's known\nas infrastructure mode,\n\n38\n00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.867\nmesh mode, ad hoc mode.\n\n39\n00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:06.039\nWell, mesh mode, we've kinda talked\nabout this in other topologies,\n\n40\n00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.960\nwhere we're talking about\ndifferent network implementations.\n\n41\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.980\nAnd a mesh topology is typically where you\nhave this redundant type of configuration.\n\n42\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840\nWhere whatever the device is that's\nbasically participating in the mesh\n\n43\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.220\nnetwork, has redundant connections to\nevery other device in the network.\n\n44\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.250\nIn this point what I'm talking\nabout is the connectivity devices.\n\n45\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.550\nBecause when we talk about this\ntype of wireless-based mesh,\n\n46\n00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.230\nwhat we have are a series of\naccess points that are configured.\n\n47\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.450\nAnd they have redundant connections\nto all other access points that\n\n48\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.050\nare in this wireless mesh.\n\n49\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.920\nAnd then finally,\n\n50\n00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.350\na single end point here that we\ncommunicate off of our local area network.\n\n51\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.330\nAll right, so\nthat is a form of wireless mesh network.\n\n52\n00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.510\nNow, another one that falls\nunder the wireless mesh\n\n53\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.580\ntype of topology is something\nknown as an ad hoc network.\n\n54\n00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.470\nNow, be careful with\nthis one because ad hoc\n\n55\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.630\nisn't the only implementation of a mesh\nnetwork, it's actually the opposite.\n\n56\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.610\nAd hoc is just a form of\nmesh network implementation,\n\n57\n00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.950\nit's one of the forms that you can have.\n\n58\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.340\nThis is a little bit different\nbecause what we have lack of\n\n59\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.630\nhere is any managing device, if you will.\n\n60\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.220\nThat's actually, we've talked about it\nbefore it's ad hoc is also known as\n\n61\n00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.330\nan IBSS,\nthe independent basic service set.\n\n62\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.570\nKeep in mind, this mesh network is the\nfact, that all of these laptops in this\n\n63\n00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.406\ncase have redundant connections to every\nother laptop in the ad hoc network.\n\n64\n00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:46.130\nNow what happens is they work together,\nwhere there isn't a single device,\n\n65\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.510\nlike infrastructure modes,\nwhere you have a single access point and\n\n66\n00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.480\nall of the devices communicate through\nthe access point to one another.\n\n67\n00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.060\nWell, they call it independent basic\nservice set, because when you remove\n\n68\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.500\nthe managing device, the access\npoint in this case, that's manages\n\n69\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.320\nall of the devices in infrastructure mode,\nthen what are you left with?\n\n70\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.900\nWell, you're essentially left with a\nseries of devices that can forward traffic\n\n71\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.150\non behalf of other nodes, and that's\nessentially what an ad-hoc network is.\n\n72\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.860\nI can communicate with any device,\nat any time,\n\n73\n00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.420\nif we have these network adapters\nconfigured in ad hoc mode.\n\n74\n00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.250\nAnd if we need to pass information\naround the network, then basically,\n\n75\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.520\nforwarding can happen on\nbehalf of other devices.\n\n76\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.608\nSo it's independent of\na managed infrastructure,\n\n77\n00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:35.160\neach individual device is\nmanaging its communications, and\n\n78\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.790\nalso helping to work on\nbehalf of other devices.\n\n79\n00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.650\nSo those are essentially your\ndifferent type of network topologies.\n\n80\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.080\nNow if I was to say, okay, if I was\nto take this out of here completely,\n\n81\n00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.270\nthis would be more of\nan infrastructure mode.\n\n82\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.249\nLet's take mesh completely out of here,\nand then we'll take all of these links.\n\n83\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.510\nAnd we'll just kinda get rid of those,\nas well, so they're gone.\n\n84\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.340\nAnd now what we end up having is,\na couple of lines there.\n\n85\n00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.570\nThis would be what's known as\ninfrastructure mode, right?\n\n86\n00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.510\nWhen we talk about infrastructure mode,\nwe're essentially talking about\n\n87\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.470\na single access point is\nmanaging all these devices.\n\n88\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.383\nNow, they call it infrastructure mode,\nbecause unlike ad hoc,\n\n89\n00:05:21.383 --> 00:05:25.653\nI can communicate with all three\nlaptops across each other laptop, and\n\n90\n00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:28.870\nI don't need the access point itself.\n\n91\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.520\nIt becomes infrastructure mode\nwhen you start saying, well,\n\n92\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.420\nthis access point is actually\ncontrolling all of these other devices.\n\n93\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.740\nAnd when I need to communicate, I can't\njust communicate like I can in ad hoc,\n\n94\n00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.960\nlaptop to laptop.\n\n95\n00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.738\nI actually have to send my\ninformation into the access point,\n\n96\n00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:50.340\nthen forwards it over to the other\ndevices within the network.\n\n97\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.630\nSo those are your three network types.\n\n98\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.470\nKeep in mind, we have something is known\nas your ad hoc mode, they call out mesh.\n\n99\n00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.110\nDon't let that confuse you on the exam,\nbecause maybe some of you have heard\n\n100\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.970\nof ad hoc being the wireless mesh network,\nand you're right.\n\n101\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.850\nThat's just semantics, I think,\nis what we're dealing with there.\n\n102\n00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.070\nThe ad hoc is a form of mesh network,\nright?\n\n103\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.155\nIt forms a mesh network, but we can also\nhave wireless devices, a bunch of them,\n\n104\n00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:18.478\nwireless access points,\n\n105\n00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:21.860\nthat are configured to help all\nthe wireless devices on a network.\n\n106\n00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.562\nAnd each one of them are configured\nin a mesh network, too,\n\n107\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:26.900\nthat's still a managed infrastructure,\nright?\n\n108\n00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.786\nThat's a managed mesh infrastructure,\nunlike something like ad hoc,\n\n109\n00:06:30.786 --> 00:06:34.110\nwhere it's completely independent\nof any managing device.\n\n110\n00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.413\nAnd each individual device that joins the\nad hoc network really is the one that's\n\n111\n00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:39.562\ndoing the managing.\n\n112\n00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:45.600\nThey also talk about something\nknown as SSID broadcasts, right?\n\n113\n00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.490\nNow, when we look at SSID broadcasts.\n\n114\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.650\nLet me see if I can further destroy\nmy [LAUGH] my diagram here.\n\n115\n00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.670\nI do wanna talk about them a little bit,\n\n116\n00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.520\nbecause they're very important\nin what the SSID does for us.\n\n117\n00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.808\nNow, if you guys watched\nan earlier episode that we did,\n\n118\n00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:07.479\nwe talked about the components of wireless\nlocal area network infrastructure.\n\n119\n00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.370\nBut I do want to just recap\nhere just real quick.\n\n120\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.150\nRemember that in wireless\nlocal area networks,\n\n121\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.150\nwe have a few different characteristics,\nright?\n\n122\n00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.750\nWe have our STAs,\nremember your STAs, guys?\n\n123\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.850\nIt's just technical jargon for\na station, it means a wireless station.\n\n124\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.090\nSo my tablet, my laptop,\nthat's a station, right?\n\n125\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.430\nI'm gonna be managed by another device\non this wireless network, I'm an STA.\n\n126\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.860\nIf I'm the managing device,\nwell then I'm the AP, right?\n\n127\n00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.550\nAccess point is the managing device.\n\n128\n00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.580\nWell how do we identify that network, and\n\n129\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.580\nthe devices that are connected\nto that network?\n\n130\n00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.618\nThat's what's known as the SSID,\nthe service set identifier.\n\n131\n00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:57.827\nIt's a 32 bit alphanumeric string\nthat identifies the access point,\n\n132\n00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.320\nthe network, and all the devices\nassociated with that network, all right?\n\n133\n00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.113\nNow, they call it out specifically.\n\n134\n00:08:05.113 --> 00:08:08.827\nCuz they're talking now in\nthe context of implementing and\n\n135\n00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:11.770\nsupporting a wireless local area network.\n\n136\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.680\nSo why would we care\nabout the SSID broadcast?\n\n137\n00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.206\nWell, there's a couple of\nschools of thought on here.\n\n138\n00:08:17.206 --> 00:08:20.702\nAnd I know that depending on\nwhich way you go on this one.\n\n139\n00:08:20.702 --> 00:08:23.730\nYou might be on one side of the tracks or\nthe other.\n\n140\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:26.350\nSSID broadcast does exactly that.\n\n141\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.550\nIt broadcasts out what we\ntypically call a network name.\n\n142\n00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:34.060\nIt's how, if I was to grab my cell\nphone right now or if I was to say,\n\n143\n00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.540\nhey Dan, show your cell phone.\n\n144\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:41.710\nJust the list that you have in there of\navailable networks that your adapter sees.\n\n145\n00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.890\nIt finds those based on the SSID, right?\n\n146\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.300\nWhen wireless device\n\n147\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.060\nwants to make an association with the\nnetwork, it first has to find the network.\n\n148\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.010\nIt's first starting point is\nnoticing that SSID, what was that?\n\n149\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm just saying that broadcasting\nis basically an advertisement for\n\n150\n00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.010\nhere is the network,\nI am different from these other networks.\n\n151\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And you can tell that,\n\n152\n00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.035\nbecause my name is Wes' network and\nDan's network or whatever.\n\n153\n00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:12.445\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, like when we talk about\nthings like routers do advertisements.\n\n154\n00:09:12.445 --> 00:09:16.705\nTo let everybody know on the network\nwhat multicast groups are there.\n\n155\n00:09:16.705 --> 00:09:20.355\nWell, your access points do the same\nthing with the SSID, not multicast.\n\n156\n00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:21.985\nBut they say hey, here's the network.\n\n157\n00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.050\nAnd in a bit we're gonna say hey,\nhere's the network.\n\n158\n00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.270\nAnd periodically we're\ngonna keep doing that.\n\n159\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.224\nWell, you gotta think about it\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n160\n00:09:30.224 --> 00:09:34.460\nMaybe you don't want everybody else in\nthe world knowing where your network is.\n\n161\n00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.530\nAnd here's where\nthe debate's gonna come in.\n\n162\n00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.037\nFor security purposes they tell you that\nyou should disable an SSID broadcast for\n\n163\n00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:43.300\nsecurity.\n\n164\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.570\nThat really doesn't keep your\nnetwork from being discovered.\n\n165\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.570\nWhat it does is it basically keeps\nthe legitimate people out of your network.\n\n166\n00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.940\nBecause a hacker, they're gonna\nfind the underlying technique.\n\n167\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.580\nJust because I tell the the access point.\n\n168\n00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.750\nStop telling everybody who you are and\nI disable it.\n\n169\n00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.495\nWell, guess what?\n\n170\n00:10:02.495 --> 00:10:05.520\nEverytime I send a packet of information\nor a frame of information in and\n\n171\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.100\nout of the access point,\nthe SSID is there.\n\n172\n00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.970\nAnd anybody worth their salt in\nhacking could be in a jeeper\n\n173\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.980\ncreeper van on the outside\ndoing wireless packet capture.\n\n174\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.640\nAnd inside of that frame is the SSID.\n\n175\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.580\nSo be careful with that one, because yes,\n\n176\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.150\nthey say that it can\nstrengthen your security.\n\n177\n00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.950\nWhat it really does that I've seen is\nit keeps the legitimate people out of\n\n178\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.560\nyour network.\n\n179\n00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.150\nAnd it does nothing to stop the hackers,\n\n180\n00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.050\nbecause they can still\nfind that information.\n\n181\n00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:36.260\nBut from an exam standpoint, security,\nsecurity, security, disable it.\n\n182\n00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.760\nAll right, let's see Dan,\nwhat else do we have here?\n\n183\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.810\nWe got a couple of other things\nthat I want to talk about.\n\n184\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.920\nWe talked about the network types,\ntopologies, tell you what,\n\n185\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.630\nlet's go ahead, one thing that we\ngotta talk about are antenna types.\n\n186\n00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:55.147\nThis is something that you\nmight experience on the exam.\n\n187\n00:10:55.147 --> 00:11:00.398\nWhere maybe they're gonna ask you to\nimplement a wireless coverage area,\n\n188\n00:11:00.398 --> 00:11:06.120\na wireless network, and you need to\nknow what kind of antennaes to set up.\n\n189\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.480\nThat's what we're gonna talk about here.\n\n190\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.820\nIn fact, let's look at a documentation.\n\n191\n00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.280\nI've got a couple of different types of\nantennae or radio frequency patterns.\n\n192\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.330\nOne of the most common\nones that we have and\n\n193\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.730\neasiest to implement is\nthe omnidirectional.\n\n194\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.130\nAnd the omnidirectional,\nthis is basically an overhead view of it.\n\n195\n00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.240\nIt essentially radiates its signal.\n\n196\n00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.190\nIn more of, if we have, like a three\ndimensional view, it would be like a dome.\n\n197\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.860\nIt radiates signal in all direction.\n\n198\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.590\nHence the term omnidirectional.\n\n199\n00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.860\nYou also have what are known\nas directional antennas too.\n\n200\n00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:48.480\nNow, the direction antennas, their beam,\nif you will, their communication signal,\n\n201\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.800\nit's in a more focused, tightly confined\npattern versus the omnidirectional.\n\n202\n00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.480\nThere are some strengths and\nweaknesses with both.\n\n203\n00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.200\nAnd I don't mean it just\na figurative way for sure.\n\n204\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.350\nOne of the strengths of\nan omnidirectional is the fact that\n\n205\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.150\nwhen it comes to antennae placement.\n\n206\n00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.060\nIt's pretty forgiving when it\ncomes to where you place it.\n\n207\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.450\nHowever, since it's not directional,\n\n208\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:19.910\nit's not one of the ones that can give\na more focused, clean signal, if you will.\n\n209\n00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.810\nSo there are some drawbacks.\n\n210\n00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.834\nWhen you strengthen\nan omnidirectional signal,\n\n211\n00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:28.508\nthat doesn't mean that the signal\nquality gets any better.\n\n212\n00:12:28.508 --> 00:12:30.080\nIt just means that it gets stronger.\n\n213\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.930\nAnd it could do more damage than good.\n\n214\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.370\nIt could introduce more\ninterference as well.\n\n215\n00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Wes also with an omnidirectional which\nare probably some of the most common\n\n216\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.370\nantennas that you use.\n\n217\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.010\nAnd so you've got to worry\nabout placement as well.\n\n218\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.250\nBecause you could be pumping that\nsignal out into your parking lot.\n\n219\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.910\nAllowing people that you might\nnot want the jeeper creeper van.\n\n220\n00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As you pointed out before.\n\n221\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.850\nGaining access to your access point.\n\n222\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah in fact Dan let me show you\n\n223\n00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.080\na little demonstration here\nof what Dan's talking about.\n\n224\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.860\nLet's say that we have a building right?\n\n225\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.480\nAnd we have one of these\nthe omnidirectional type antennas.\n\n226\n00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.560\nAnd I put it right there in\nthe back of the building.\n\n227\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.990\nAnd if this is the parking lot, what if\nyou're butted up against another office?\n\n228\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.540\nWell guess what?\n\n229\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.748\nNow they potentially have\naccess to your signal.\n\n230\n00:13:13.748 --> 00:13:17.307\nSo, that might not be a good placement for\nthat type of antenna.\n\n231\n00:13:17.307 --> 00:13:22.740\nI might put an omnidirectional more\nmaybe internal to the building.\n\n232\n00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.110\nAnd that gives the center of my building\na little bit more coverage rather\n\n233\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.080\nthan putting it.\n\n234\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.910\nOr it might be, it might be something\nthat you put right here in the middle.\n\n235\n00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.810\nMaybe you want your endusers.\n\n236\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.330\nI got my endusers here.\n\n237\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.540\nI got my guests, and\nthat's gonna be my guest network.\n\n238\n00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.640\nSo I want my lobby to\nbe covered really good.\n\n239\n00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.120\nThat could be an alternative too.\n\n240\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.480\n&gt;&gt; Thanks to the site survey,\nit's really important.\n\n241\n00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.130\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n242\n00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.260\nIt really does.\n\n243\n00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.340\nSo, the next type of antenna that we have,\n\n244\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.030\nwe mentioned where the directional\nantenna was, right?\n\n245\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.600\nThere are many different kinds.\n\n246\n00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.170\nIn fact, let's see, I've got a picture\npulled up of some directional antennas.\n\n247\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.460\nYou might remember this one.\n\n248\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.230\nThe dipole antenna, right?\n\n249\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.120\nSome of you guys probably don't\nknow what we're even talking about.\n\n250\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.270\nBecause everything has gone to digital and\nwe don't see this in tennis.\n\n251\n00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.180\nBut those some of you guys that maybe\nremember adjusting your antenna to\n\n252\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.930\nactually pick and\nreceive your channels on TV.\n\n253\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.830\nThis was definitely a common one for\nthings like TV signals and stuff.\n\n254\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.311\nA parabolic dish is another\nexample of a directional antenna.\n\n255\n00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:24.848\nAnd I know at some point everybody\nprobably seen once of their life some kind\n\n256\n00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:25.936\nparabolic gist.\n\n257\n00:14:25.936 --> 00:14:27.659\nIt doesn't have to be a scale this big.\n\n258\n00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:33.705\n&gt;&gt; That's outside of my house.\n\n259\n00:14:33.705 --> 00:14:35.159\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, it doesn't have\nto be the size of Rhode Island.\n\n260\n00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:36.635\n[LAUGH] Things like Direct TV you know\nthey do satellite communications.\n\n261\n00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:41.305\nOne of our show host, poor guy actually\nhas his Internet connection satellites.\n\n262\n00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:44.955\nSo, we record these today and\nyou'll see it in ten years [LAUGH].\n\n263\n00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:47.665\nBut again, joking aside guys,\n\n264\n00:14:47.665 --> 00:14:53.070\nthese are the type of antennas that you\nmight see, as far as directional antennas.\n\n265\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.184\nThe other thing, too,\nthat's kind of, oops.\n\n266\n00:14:57.184 --> 00:14:59.180\nLet me get to the right slide there.\n\n267\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.360\nThe other thing that you might see is\nthat, for instance, omnidirectional\n\n268\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.550\nantennas, they don't have to be, but a lot\nof times they're built into the device.\n\n269\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.410\nYou could see things like for instance I\nbelieve they were called blister antennas.\n\n270\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.260\nLooked like a smoke detector and\nthey attached to the ceiling and\n\n271\n00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.570\nthey radiate the pattern down.\n\n272\n00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:20.120\nSame principle but now instead of putting\nit on the desk and having it radiate,\n\n273\n00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.610\nits signal upwards.\n\n274\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.607\nWell, we're alread,y we got\nthe ceiling there already.\n\n275\n00:15:23.607 --> 00:15:26.090\nWhy don't we just hang this\nthing from the ceiling and\n\n276\n00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.365\nhave to rain its\nomnidirectional pattern down.\n\n277\n00:15:28.365 --> 00:15:32.715\nA couple of the other things that I might\ntell you guys to watch is things like\n\n278\n00:15:32.715 --> 00:15:34.320\nantenna placement.\n\n279\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.500\nFor instance,\n\n280\n00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.650\nwhen you take a look here remember\nthat they call out signal strength.\n\n281\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.625\nAnd different types of antennas will\nhave different types of coverage ranges\n\n282\n00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:49.120\n,where their hot spot is and where a dead\nzone is, so pay attention to that.\n\n283\n00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.360\nSignal strength, by the way,\nis measured in gain and decimals.\n\n284\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.110\nIt's denoted in decimals.\n\n285\n00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.700\n&gt;&gt; Decibels.\n\n286\n00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.240\n&gt;&gt; Decibels.\n\n287\n00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.520\nDecibels, not decimals.\n\n288\n00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.708\nI'm thinking IP addresses.\n\n289\n00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:00.157\n[CROSSTALK] It's what...I've\ngot IP addresses, Decibels.\n\n290\n00:16:00.157 --> 00:16:03.596\nWas it little d, capital B,\ni, [INAUDIBLE] dBi?\n\n291\n00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.278\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n292\n00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:09.565\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I put an omnidirectional\nsignal here, right?\n\n293\n00:16:09.565 --> 00:16:14.630\nWell, what would stop me from potentially\nputting a directional signal here?\n\n294\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.260\nNothing.\n\n295\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.410\nIt's really based on how\nmuch coverage you need.\n\n296\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.227\nSo if they put you in a scenario that\nsays well the front of the building\n\n297\n00:16:21.227 --> 00:16:22.596\ndoesn't need a lot of coverage.\n\n298\n00:16:22.596 --> 00:16:27.340\nYou might have the ability to put\na directional antenna with maybe\n\n299\n00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.640\na slighter less DBI, or an omnidirectional\nwith a slighter less DBI.\n\n300\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.140\nOr maybe they say you're talking\nabout the back of the building and\n\n301\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.700\nyou only have maybe a single antenna\nthat you can use back here so\n\n302\n00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.700\nyou have to use a directional\nantenna with a lot of gain.\n\n303\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.870\nSo again pay attention to where\nthey're having you place potentially,\n\n304\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.040\nI don't know if it's gonna be here.\n\n305\n00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.420\nBut it is something they call out, is\nknowing where to place these antennas and\n\n306\n00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.320\nknowing the difference in when it\ncomes to things like signal strength.\n\n307\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.281\n&gt;&gt; That's from the heat of my lunch,\n\n308\n00:16:57.281 --> 00:16:58.582\non the back side where\nyou put that [CROSSTALK].\n\n309\n00:16:58.582 --> 00:16:59.864\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n310\n00:16:59.864 --> 00:17:00.905\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Stick it in the beam.\n\n311\n00:17:00.905 --> 00:17:01.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully,\n\n312\n00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.005\nyou have your little nuclear\nradiation badge on you for sure.\n\n313\n00:17:05.005 --> 00:17:09.450\nA couple of other things that they call\nout that we should really know about.\n\n314\n00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.981\nAnd this technology's been around for\na little bit but it's becoming\n\n315\n00:17:13.981 --> 00:17:19.074\ndefinitely more popular to talk about\nyou know the prevalence of BYO devices.\n\n316\n00:17:19.074 --> 00:17:22.854\nA lot of mobile devices on our network,\na lot of high definition,\n\n317\n00:17:22.854 --> 00:17:27.576\nvideo and we're gonna talk about something\nknown as MIMO or M U MIMO, MU-MIMO.\n\n318\n00:17:27.576 --> 00:17:28.750\n&gt;&gt; MU-MIMO?\n\n319\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.520\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n320\n00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.220\nAcronyms are getting pretty\nthick here on this episode.\n\n321\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.845\nSo, what Is MIMO.\n\n322\n00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.355\nMIMO stands for mult in multi out.\n\n323\n00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:40.635\nMU or MU MIMO, I don't even know if\nthat's the way they pronounce it,\n\n324\n00:17:40.635 --> 00:17:43.215\nthat's multi user\nmultiple in multiple out.\n\n325\n00:17:43.215 --> 00:17:44.685\nAll right.\n\n326\n00:17:44.685 --> 00:17:48.220\nLet's take all the jargon and\nall the technology completely out of it,\n\n327\n00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.710\nwhat does that mean?\n\n328\n00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.660\nMore than one antenna, to send and\nreceive signals on a wireless network.\n\n329\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.020\nCase dismissed.\n\n330\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.240\nThat's what it is guys.\n\n331\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.140\nDo not let it confuse you.\n\n332\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.480\nBecause if you think about the media\naccess method of wireless communications,\n\n333\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.180\nit's a wait in line mean of access method.\n\n334\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.390\nWe call it Carrier Sets Multiple,\n&gt;&gt; Access.\n\n335\n00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.810\n&gt;&gt; Access, yeah, Carrier Sets Multiple.\n\n336\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.740\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n337\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.990\n&gt;&gt; Kinda CDMA or CD.\n\n338\n00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.929\n&gt;&gt; CD, I can't remember.\n\n339\n00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:17.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, collision avoidance is what it is.\n\n340\n00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.080\nAnd collision avoidance,\nI can't think of the life for me,\n\n341\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.080\nthink of the acronym there.\n\n342\n00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.220\nBut it is collision avoidance,\nunlike ethernet.\n\n343\n00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.750\nWhich is collision detection, right?\n\n344\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.170\nEthernet says hey,\nwe'll detect collisions,\n\n345\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.630\njust throw it out there when it happens.\n\n346\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, Carrier Sets Multiple Access.\n\n347\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.550\n&gt;&gt; Multiple Access that's right.\n\n348\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.460\nCarriers Sets Multiple Access Collision\nAvoidance, thank you very much Dan.\n\n349\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.560\nDan helping me out with\nthe acronyms look at that.\n\n350\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.200\nAnd this is a wait in line method.\n\n351\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.220\nWe try to avoid the collisions\nby saying hey everybody I'm\n\n352\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.440\ngonna send a signal and I'm gonna wait.\n\n353\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.460\nOkay, so nobody told me they're gonna send\nthe signals, I'm going to send my signal.\n\n354\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.120\nSo think about that.\n\n355\n00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.830\nWait in line Ethernet just says hey,\njust throw the signal on the wire and\n\n356\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.050\nwe'll detect collisions.\n\n357\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.980\nAnd if they have happen we'll discard\nthe information and we'll throw it again.\n\n358\n00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.150\nWireless does not do that.\n\n359\n00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.950\nIt waits for it's turn.\n\n360\n00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.850\nWell you could think about that,\nthat's a half duplex communication.\n\n361\n00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.140\nThat means I talk.\n\n362\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.890\nYou have to listen.\n\n363\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.430\nAnd then once I'm done talking you\ntalk and then I have to listen.\n\n364\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:13.710\nWait in line.\n\n365\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.570\nWell with multiple strings,\nmultiple antennas.\n\n366\n00:19:18.975 --> 00:19:22.630\nWhat we have the ability to do is send and\nreceive at the same time.\n\n367\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.700\nThat's multiple in, multiple out,\nin fact I got a little diagram here,\n\n368\n00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.870\nif we look at, we've got multiple in.\n\n369\n00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.270\nWe've got multiple MIMO Stream.\n\n370\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.990\nAll right.\n\n371\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.120\nThey call it spacial streams because\nif we take a finite area and\n\n372\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.000\nwe chop it up into these\nindividual streams.\n\n373\n00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.420\nAnd then I send data across that spectrum.\n\n374\n00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.456\nRemember what I said.\n\n375\n00:19:41.456 --> 00:19:45.670\nMultiple transmitters, multiple receivers.\n\n376\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.880\nSo what does that mean multi-user MIMO is?\n\n377\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.560\nNot much different guys.\n\n378\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.380\nIf you look,\nI'm more antenna's today by standards.\n\n379\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.547\nBut now what we can do is we can bring\nmultiple streams to multiple users.\n\n380\n00:19:59.547 --> 00:20:04.910\nMulti-User multi-input, output,\nif I can remember the whole thing.\n\n381\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.580\nSo that is something\nthat you're seeing too.\n\n382\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.490\nAnd with the standards like 802.11AC.\n\n383\n00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.094\nThey've really opened it\nup to where the bandwidth,\n\n384\n00:20:16.094 --> 00:20:21.150\nwe can push a lot of data to a lot of\ndifferent endpoints on a single network.\n\n385\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.510\nWhere in the earlier\ndays we couldn't do this.\n\n386\n00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.190\nWe couldn't do MIMO, and think in fact I\nthink ends supported four strings of MIMO\n\n387\n00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.180\nif you will and then 802.11.\n\n388\n00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.860\nSee as a multi-user MIMO, and\nthat support eight streams.\n\n389\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.250\nAnd that literally means, eight\nconcurrent streams on that access point.\n\n390\n00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:43.240\nAnd with multi-user it just\nmeans that unlike MIMO,\n\n391\n00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.820\nwhere it was a single destination,\nmulti-user MIMO just means exactly that.\n\n392\n00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.450\nNow, we've got for instance,\nwe got two streams going to a single.\n\n393\n00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.100\nSingle user and it's smart enough.\n\n394\n00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.810\nNow there's couple of different\nways that they do this and\n\n395\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.830\nthey don't call it out in the exam.\n\n396\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.670\nTwo ways they do MIMO and multi-user MIMO,\n\n397\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.063\none is called spacial\ndivisional multi-plexing.\n\n398\n00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:05.841\nThe other way that they do this is\nthrough something known as beamforming.\n\n399\n00:21:05.841 --> 00:21:10.380\nBeamforming is smart enough that they can\nreadjust to where that beam is pointing.\n\n400\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.840\nAnd bring you exactly what you need while\nnot affecting the guy that is sitting\n\n401\n00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.358\nnext to you.\n\n402\n00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.550\nSo, beamforming again.\n\n403\n00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.720\nAdaptive antennas is another\nthing that they call them.\n\n404\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.316\nAdaptive antennas.\nSo\n\n405\n00:21:20.316 --> 00:21:23.840\na couple of different\nways they can do that.\n\n406\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.950\nAll right, Dan let's just round\nup the last little thing here.\n\n407\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.430\nCouple of things, they do call\nout these crazy 802.11 standards.\n\n408\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:39.684\n802.11, and I got to remember,\nthey're a-HT and g-HT.\n\n409\n00:21:39.684 --> 00:21:43.050\nWhat does that mean?\nYou guys want the easy version?\n\n410\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.790\nIt just means you have a device\n\n411\n00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.110\nthat is backwards compatible\nsupporting older legacy devices.\n\n412\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:55.260\nI'm supporting a and\nn basically I've got 802.11 a-HT.\n\n413\n00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:01.130\nIf I'm supporting b and g and\nn I've got an HT setup.\n\n414\n00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:06.881\nAll right so these are basically when\nyou are supporting those older 802.11\n\n415\n00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:11.972\ntechnologies on a network that does\nsupport the new technology as well.\n\n416\n00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:16.926\nAnd last but the least I'll\n\n417\n00:22:16.926 --> 00:22:22.312\nsay that one of the things that\n\n418\n00:22:22.312 --> 00:22:27.074\nwe got also talked about.\n\n419\n00:22:27.074 --> 00:22:30.983\nWireless its a cell phone why do they call\nit a cell phone if you're using it as\n\n420\n00:22:30.983 --> 00:22:32.033\na cellular device?\n\n421\n00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:33.602\nIt has a wireless adapter in it right?\n\n422\n00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:38.101\nWhen you're on the GSM and the CMDA\nnetworks you're a cellular communication.\n\n423\n00:22:38.101 --> 00:22:42.198\nWhen you're on a 802.11 base network\nyou're on a wireless communication.\n\n424\n00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:46.013\nAnd so that's why they throw that in\ntheir laptops, tablets, gaming devices,\n\n425\n00:22:46.013 --> 00:22:47.810\nlike your gaming consoles.\n\n426\n00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.788\nIf you're a gamer and\nyou're watching this, and\n\n427\n00:22:49.788 --> 00:22:53.054\nI know we got plenty of geeks like me who\nare gamers and probably are watching this.\n\n428\n00:22:53.054 --> 00:22:56.293\nYour gaming console is obviously something\nthat could be connected to your wireless\n\n429\n00:22:56.293 --> 00:22:58.400\nnetwork, as you probably already know.\n\n430\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.340\nAnd then just different media devices.\n\n431\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.612\n&gt;&gt; Roku's.\n\n432\n00:23:01.612 --> 00:23:05.496\n&gt;&gt; Right and when you say Roku the other\nthing I didn't think why didn't they put\n\n433\n00:23:05.496 --> 00:23:09.200\nin here and maybe they will\nion the next revision at IOT.\n\n434\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.240\nWireless devices my it's not a Roku.\n\n435\n00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:16.720\nBut that Roku is a specific media device,\nApple TV is another good example.\n\n436\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.740\nChromecast is another type, all of these\ndevices can use wireless communication.\n\n437\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.550\nSo go over to look Internet\nof Things as well.\n\n438\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.060\nSo it's not in here,\nit'll probably, if I had to guess,\n\n439\n00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.600\nit'll probably be in the next\nrevision of the objectives.\n\n440\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.250\nBut that's gotta keep in mind, that we got\na couple of episodes that we've talked\n\n441\n00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.430\nabout wireless local area\nnetwork communications.\n\n442\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.000\nAnd we also got an episode,\nnot this episode,\n\n443\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.730\nthat talked about the infrastructure as\nwell and what are the different devices.\n\n444\n00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.190\nSo, that's a little bit about what we need\nto know, and I think we've covered it.\n\n445\n00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.390\n&gt;&gt; All right, well Wes I know\nif you're watching out there,\n\n446\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.670\nyou feel like you're drinking from a fire\nhose when it comes to these stinking\n\n447\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.490\nwireless technologies and acronyms,\nand everything they throw at you.\n\n448\n00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:57.090\nWell you're right,\n\n449\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.785\nit's a lot of information,\njust continually go back over it.\n\n450\n00:23:59.785 --> 00:24:03.495\nReiterate to yourself because remember\nthat repetition breeds retention,\n\n451\n00:24:03.495 --> 00:24:06.025\nthat's what we like to say around here,\nit's one of our mantras.\n\n452\n00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:09.965\nWes, thanks so much for explaining every\ntopic that we need to know, or at least so\n\n453\n00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:13.935\nfar, for our Network+ exam\nas far as the wireless goes.\n\n454\n00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:16.550\nAppreciate you guys for watching, but it\nlooks like we're at the end of our show.\n\n455\n00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.145\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n456\n00:24:20.145 --> 00:24:20.955\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n457\n00:24:20.955 --> 00:24:22.180\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n458\n00:24:22.180 -->

Theories.\n\n6\n00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:16.525\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:19.615\nIn this episode we're gonna be talking\nabout something that every network has to\n\n8\n00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:22.000\nface, and that's going to be risks.\n\n9\n00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.490\nToday with us, we have Mr.\nWes Bryan to cover risk concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.790\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.200\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Cherokee, for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.990\nThat's right, we get to talk about some\nthings that are maybe not so fun, right?\n\n13\n00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.600\nThe bureaucratic side of things, and I say\nbureaucratic, we always have policies and\n\n14\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.100\nprocedures.\n\n15\n00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.970\nBut these, I tell you what,\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n16\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.510\ncan really save your company a lot\nof headache and a lot of trouble.\n\n17\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.930\nAnd, well that's risk concepts.\n\n18\n00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.160\nNow, before we start with risk concepts,\n\n19\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.070\nI want you understand is that no company\ncan actually eliminate all risk, right?\n\n20\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.520\nWhen it comes down to it really,\n\n21\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.279\nall you're really doing is\ndoing risk mitigation, right?\n\n22\n00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:59.750\nYou're bringing your risk down\nto an acceptable level, right?\n\n23\n00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.050\nWhat do we consider as acceptable?\n\n24\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.630\nWhether it comes to loss, whether it comes\nto damage, whether it comes to outage,\n\n25\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.230\nand that's really about what it is.\n\n26\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.223\nIt's about making sure that we can\nreduce that to an acceptable level for\n\n27\n00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:13.012\nthe company.\n\n28\n00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:17.347\nNow, when we dive right in here,\nagain, a Official CompTia\n\n29\n00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:21.940\nobjective here is compare and\ncontrast risk related concepts.\n\n30\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.854\nOne of the very first ones that they talk\nabout is actually a really big topic\n\n31\n00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:29.240\nper se here at the Network+ level.\n\n32\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.890\nWell I'm not sure that they want you\nto have the 1,000 foot overview.\n\n33\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.230\nI think it's more of\na 30,000 foot overview.\n\n34\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.440\nBut understand that companies, there are\nmany companies, entire organizations and\n\n35\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.960\ninstitutes that we'll mention here,\nwell one of them here in a second.\n\n36\n00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.507\nThat pretty much dedicate a large\nportion of their endeavors to\n\n37\n00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.832\nthe idea of disaster recovery.\n\n38\n00:01:49.832 --> 00:01:55.496\nIn fact, one of our other show hosts here\nis very, very experienced in disaster\n\n39\n00:01:55.496 --> 00:02:00.669\nrecovery from taking one site offline,\nbringing another site online.\n\n40\n00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.678\nAnd those are gonna be some of the topics\nthat we'll talk about as we move\n\n41\n00:02:03.678 --> 00:02:04.340\nthrough here.\n\n42\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.310\nNow talking about disaster recovery.\n\n43\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.141\nIt's gonna start out first and\nforemost really with education and\n\n44\n00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.046\nawareness and training.\n\n45\n00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:16.582\nKeep in mind that when a disaster happens,\nit's not a really good\n\n46\n00:02:16.582 --> 00:02:20.759\ntime to try to figure out then what it is\nthat you're gonna do, and try to bring\n\n47\n00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:25.493\nyour company back online, and bring the\ncontinuity to your company back to 100%.\n\n48\n00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:26.789\nSo disaster recovery,\n\n49\n00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.820\nany good disaster recovery plan is\ngonna start with efficient training.\n\n50\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.451\nSo that when something, God forbid,\nsomething like this does happen to you,\n\n51\n00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.148\nyour company or employees.\n\n52\n00:02:37.148 --> 00:02:41.270\nAnd the different groups that are part\nof the staffing know exactly what\n\n53\n00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.330\nto do in order to maintain your\nbusiness's day to day functionality.\n\n54\n00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.110\nSo disaster recovery, you might hear\nthings like disaster recovery policies.\n\n55\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.053\nWhen it comes to disaster recovery\npolicies there isn't really a one\n\n56\n00:02:57.053 --> 00:02:58.111\nsize fits all.\n\n57\n00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.889\nEvery company's a little bit different\ndepending on how they do things like asset\n\n58\n00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.500\ninventory.\n\n59\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.450\nAnd what you have inside of your company\nmight be different than say, for instance,\n\n60\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.900\nCherokee's organization\nversus my organization.\n\n61\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.350\nSo they do have things\nlike templates out there.\n\n62\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.097\nIn fact, I've got an example of one here\nthat comes from the SANS Institute here.\n\n63\n00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:19.120\nLet's see,\nSANS Institute InfoSec reading room.\n\n64\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.436\nAnd if you look here this is,\nlet's give the author credit here,\n\n65\n00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.428\nBrian C Martin here, in February 2002.\n\n66\n00:03:26.428 --> 00:03:30.364\nAnd this was basically for, again,\ndisaster recovery, plans and\n\n67\n00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:31.400\nstrategies, and\n\n68\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.190\nyou can see they go through the process\nof kinda identifying those key elements.\n\n69\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.080\nThings like for\ninstance critical application assessment.\n\n70\n00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.687\nWe need to know the criticality\nof our nodes and stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:44.489\nYou'd see things like backup procedures,\nrecovery,\n\n72\n00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.300\nimplementation, testing, and planning.\n\n73\n00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.282\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, is this something\nthat you had to purchase or\n\n74\n00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:51.232\nhow would one go about\nobtaining this information.\n\n75\n00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:54.752\n&gt;&gt; Well that's where the good old Google\ncomes in, the search engine there.\n\n76\n00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:58.059\nIf you go to SANS institute,\nlike for instance you can see that.\n\n77\n00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:01.543\nGo to the www.sans.org/readingroom and\n\n78\n00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:06.548\nunder white papers there's quite\na few different documents.\n\n79\n00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:08.930\nThey get their just a wealth of\nknowledge when it comes down to it.\n\n80\n00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.701\nAnd you'll see a lot of times they'll give\nthese little notes in here that says,\n\n81\n00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:17.348\nlike for instance, telling you\nwhat the purpose of the plan is\n\n82\n00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:22.800\nDisaster Recovery Plan designed to ensure\ncontinuity of vital business processes.\n\n83\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.990\nSo you can see that there\nare many different ones,\n\n84\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.580\nwhat you're looking for for\nyour company, you can download.\n\n85\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.390\nA lot of times, you can modify\nto suit your company's needs and\n\n86\n00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.998\nthen you can turn around and\nif you need to, implement it.\n\n87\n00:04:35.998 --> 00:04:40.219\nJust check out the SANS institute,\nthey have all kinds of different policies,\n\n88\n00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.501\nsecurity policies and\nthings like acceptable use policies.\n\n89\n00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:48.813\nAnd they're freely downloadable, and\nthey encourage you to modify them,\n\n90\n00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:53.218\nand then you can implement them\ninside of your company as well.\n\n91\n00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:56.162\nNow some of the things that\nI wanna kinda mention here.\n\n92\n00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:59.680\nI wanna mention things like redundancy,\nright.\n\n93\n00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.830\nOne of the things that we want.\n\n94\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.850\nWe talk about things in disaster recovery.\n\n95\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.210\nWe talk about site location and fail over.\n\n96\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.920\nAnd site location and fail over is gonna\nbe one of those things that are very,\n\n97\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.330\nvery important.\n\n98\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.270\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, when we're talking\nabout redundant features,\n\n99\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.730\nis there any way to categorize or\n\n100\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.530\nclassify them on basically how much\nI saturate that redundancy feature.\n\n101\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.110\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and that's a great question.\n\n102\n00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.170\nSo for instance, they categorize them a\nlot of the times in three different ways.\n\n103\n00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.190\nYou'll see things like for\ninstance what's known as a hot-site,\n\n104\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.170\nyou'll see and I guess the temperature\nis what changes the name.\n\n105\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.330\nHot site, warm site and cold site and\nreally those temperature designations and\n\n106\n00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.490\nwhat they do is they designate\nhow prepared we are.\n\n107\n00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.789\nIf we do have a disaster in one site,\n\n108\n00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.469\nhow prepared is that location to take\nover the operation in the processes\n\n109\n00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.477\nof the main site that is currently\nin the middle of a disaster.\n\n110\n00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:53.860\nSo for instance, the hot site,\na hot site is a 100% full replica, so,\n\n111\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:00.140\nif I have, you know, if I have a business\nprocess, an enterprise organization.\n\n112\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.770\nAnd we have a series of nodes.\n\n113\n00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.730\nWe have workstations, personnel staffing.\n\n114\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.220\nThe hot site is one that you could\ndo what's known as an instant\n\n115\n00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.330\nfail over, right.\n\n116\n00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.880\nMaybe milliseconds of a delay where\nit's almost maybe a hiccup in bandwidth.\n\n117\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.414\nAnd that's really all you know\nbecause a hot site has again,\n\n118\n00:06:17.414 --> 00:06:21.585\njust identical copies to the hardware,\nto the staffing that you have.\n\n119\n00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:23.740\nAnd that's why they call it the hot site.\n\n120\n00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.920\nNow, it has its benefits and\nit has its drawbacks, right?\n\n121\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.550\nThe hot site has the main benefit\nof the least amount of downtime\n\n122\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.370\nwhen it comes to doing a failover, right?\n\n123\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.206\nSomething happens to the main office,\nwe have to bring it down, or\n\n124\n00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:38.158\nthe disaster brings it down with you\nnot like we are trying to do that.\n\n125\n00:06:38.158 --> 00:06:40.100\nAnd then we fail over to the hot site.\n\n126\n00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.400\nAgain, it instantly takes\nover those processes right?\n\n127\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.660\nAnd provides the services.\n\n128\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.275\nBut the problem is,\nit's like maintaining two companies right?\n\n129\n00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:53.412\nSo, you're gonna talk about the monetary,\nthe expense side of it,\n\n130\n00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:57.168\nhot sites are usually the most expensive\nwhen it comes to maintenance and upkeep.\n\n131\n00:06:57.168 --> 00:07:00.694\n&gt;&gt; That does sound pretty expensive\nto have two separate paying the rent,\n\n132\n00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:04.823\nthe electricity to make sure that you're\nfully functional within the 24 hours.\n\n133\n00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:08.148\nBut Wes, what do you say about\nthe distance, the proximity because if you\n\n134\n00:07:08.148 --> 00:07:11.793\nthink about maybe in kind of catastrophic\nevent you wouldn't want them too close\n\n135\n00:07:11.793 --> 00:07:14.711\ntogether because they could be\naffected by that same disaster.\n\n136\n00:07:14.711 --> 00:07:17.659\nBut then you wouldn't want them so far\napart that it would take a long time for\n\n137\n00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:20.190\nyou to get back to that other location and\nup and running.\n\n138\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.917\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nSo and that's where, prior to things like\n\n139\n00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.529\nthe Cloud, I would definitely say\nthat'd be such a big concern but\n\n140\n00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:30.593\none of the great things is that we have\nthings like Cloud-based backups and\n\n141\n00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:32.070\nCloud-based storage.\n\n142\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.030\nA lot of time, we implement things in the\nCloud, so we do have the benefit that if\n\n143\n00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.360\nwe're already working in the cloud,\nthat doesn't really affect us too much.\n\n144\n00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.824\nBut it certainly can if\nwe're not using the cloud,\n\n145\n00:07:41.824 --> 00:07:45.953\nespecially if you're in a managed, heavily\nmanaged environment where you got PCI,\n\n146\n00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:47.746\nDSS compliance and stuff like that.\n\n147\n00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:52.014\nSo that's part of the disaster recovery\nplanning is to make sure you ensure that\n\n148\n00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:55.198\nthat doesn't become a problem\nwhen it comes to fail over and\n\n149\n00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:58.711\nthat's why you wanna do other\nthings you know with your hot site.\n\n150\n00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:02.209\nYou could do things like parallel testing\nwhere I could be testing Still have\n\n151\n00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.927\nservices running to one, and then try to\nrun some of those services over to the hot\n\n152\n00:08:05.927 --> 00:08:08.690\nsite, and\nsee if that ends up being a problem.\n\n153\n00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.800\nNow I'm gonna skip over, because we're\ngonna goto the polar opposite here, right,\n\n154\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.520\ntemperature wise.\n\n155\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.990\nAnd I'm gonna go to the cold site,\n\n156\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.590\nthe cold site might very well\njust be a prospected building.\n\n157\n00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.060\nMight have been some that your going\ndown the street and you're like, hey,\n\n158\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.880\nthat building right there,\nI wonder how much it would be to rent it?\n\n159\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.209\nWe could probably put our company\nin there if we ever needed to.\n\n160\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.350\nNow, with that being said, if you are,\nmaybe you are even renting the building,\n\n161\n00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.760\nit's an empty warehouse.\n\n162\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.700\nThe problem with that is, well, I guess\nthere's, again, pro's and cons, right?\n\n163\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.247\nThe benefit of it, it doesn't cost\nmuch to have an empty building,\n\n164\n00:08:37.247 --> 00:08:39.947\nif you're just renting the empty building,\nnothing's inside of it.\n\n165\n00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:44.340\nAnd even less expensive if you don't\neven have a staff that's monitoring it.\n\n166\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.690\nNow the drawback to that is, if you do end\nup needing something like the cold site,\n\n167\n00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.560\nit's gonna take the longest\nto bring on line.\n\n168\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.240\nSo again,\nyou have to weigh those pros and cons.\n\n169\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.660\nAnd then the warm site's kinda in\nthe middle, where maybe on your servers in\n\n170\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.863\nplace, your server closet's in place,\nmaybe you have some of the network,\n\n171\n00:08:59.863 --> 00:09:03.800\nyour re-distribution points are setup and\neverything.\n\n172\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.580\nBut you are gonna need a moderate\namount of work to bring it online.\n\n173\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.300\nNow the warm site again is kind of\nmedium between the road between\n\n174\n00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.140\nthe failover time.\n\n175\n00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.710\nCould take a little awhile,\ncould take a few hours,\n\n176\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.500\ncould take a day if you\nwill to bring it online.\n\n177\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.757\nBut then it's also the medium between the\ncost as well compared to the hot site and\n\n178\n00:09:22.757 --> 00:09:23.950\nthe cold site.\n\n179\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.230\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, that's great, but\nwhat about our components?\n\n180\n00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.130\nIs there a way we can categorize those or\n\n181\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.980\ndo they fall under that\nsame classification?\n\n182\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.100\n&gt;&gt; No, I would say that\nthey all run hand-in-hand.\n\n183\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.120\nWe got a lot of concepts here that are all\nsitting in the same boat all holding\n\n184\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.150\nhands, and they really run to\ncomment hand in hand with him.\n\n185\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.330\nFor instance, we also talk about\ncomponent redundancy as well.\n\n186\n00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.570\nNow component redundancy can also be in\nsomething that we're gonna talk about\n\n187\n00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.410\ncoming up here in a bit,\n\n188\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.220\nbusiness continuity, so I just happened to\nput it here in disaster recovery, right?\n\n189\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.060\nWe also have things like hot spares,\nwarm spares, and cold spares,\n\n190\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.830\nhere we go with temperature again.\n\n191\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.163\nYou better have your thermometer handy so\nyou can figure out what that component is.\n\n192\n00:10:03.163 --> 00:10:04.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, I'm just kidding.\n\n193\n00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:10.730\nThe hot spare just kinda like the hot\nspare is an identical replica,\n\n194\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.570\nso for instance,\nI know you know server really well.\n\n195\n00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.320\nSo if I have a 2016 server and\n\n196\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.370\nit's running a SQL database and\nI need a hot spare,\n\n197\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.490\nchances are I've got another SQL server\n[LAUGH] running the database 2016 server.\n\n198\n00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.620\nAnd it really could do load balancing,\nbalancing if I really need it to,\n\n199\n00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.560\nI can have an active/passive.\n\n200\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.190\nOne machine is taking\n\n201\n00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:41.070\ncare of all the service, if you will,\nproviding all the services and\n\n202\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.940\nthen if I do need to fail over,\nI can fail over instantly.\n\n203\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.440\nI say instantaneously but\nit's not really that way but\n\n204\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.400\nthere might be a little bit of a hiccup\nbut we won't be able to notice it.\n\n205\n00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.900\nNow if we're using a warm spare,\n\n206\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.850\nit could be a server that's\nsitting in the server closet.\n\n207\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.860\nMaybe it's got the operating system on it,\nmaybe it doesn't.\n\n208\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.460\nAgain, that's all how\nwarm of a spare is it?\n\n209\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.280\nBut there's gonna be some kind of\nconfiguration that needs to go on with it.\n\n210\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.290\nNow just like with the hot site and\nthe warm site, hot spares and\n\n211\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.020\ncold spares also or hot spares and\nwarm spares also have their pros and cons.\n\n212\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.550\nHot spare fast failover, right,\nalmost transparent to your end users,\n\n213\n00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.030\nat least that's the goal.\n\n214\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.350\nThe warm spare, however, not as expensive,\n\n215\n00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.070\nbecause we're not constantly maintaining\nit like we are the hot spare.\n\n216\n00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.800\nBut, again,\nit's gonna take a little bit longer,\n\n217\n00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.770\nyou might notice some kind of service down\ntime when it comes to the warm spare, and\n\n218\n00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.260\nthe cold spare could be a server.\n\n219\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.050\nMaybe it's not even purchased yet.\n\n220\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.185\nMaybe you've got Dell on speed dial if\nwe even do speed dial anymore, and you,\n\n221\n00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:43.151\nhey I need a server right now, then\nthey're gonna ship it to your company.\n\n222\n00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:45.626\nYou're gonna probably set it\noutside the server closet,\n\n223\n00:11:45.626 --> 00:11:49.170\nlet it acclimate to the environment\nbefore you put it in the server closet.\n\n224\n00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.700\nSo you got a lot of work\nyou have to go through\n\n225\n00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.400\nin order to get the cold spare online.\n\n226\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.820\nSo keep that in mind that the cold spare\nprobably gonna be the cheapest one,\n\n227\n00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.690\nif it's costing you\nanything at that point, but\n\n228\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.400\nit's gonna take the longest\nto bring back online.\n\n229\n00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.950\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n230\n00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.210\nyou have to understand how fast\nof a failover do you need?\n\n231\n00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.600\nRight, if you need If you have an SLA\nthat's giving somebody maybe 91.99%\n\n232\n00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.060\nuptime, which really\nisn't really that much\n\n233\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.120\ncomparative to other companies out there,\nthen you might need a hot spare, right?\n\n234\n00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.760\nBut if you're not under some contract to\nprovide a service under like an SLA like\n\n235\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.320\nthat where you have to have high\navailability maybe the warm spare\n\n236\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.780\nwill be good for you.\n\n237\n00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.640\nWes, that's great and\n\n238\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.940\nI wish every company did have a budget\nto be able to support these options.\n\n239\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.080\nBut, in real life land some companies\nreally just aren't able to, so\n\n240\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.470\nif I can't even afford a cold spare or\na cold site, what would be an alternative?\n\n241\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.580\n&gt;&gt; What about my data\nfrom that organization?\n\n242\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.440\n&gt;&gt; That is a great question because when\nit comes down to it when you think about\n\n243\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.000\nour business it's all about our data.\n\n244\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.804\nRight, I mean it is about the personal I'm\nnot saying you guys aren't important but\n\n245\n00:12:53.804 --> 00:12:55.777\nthe data is extremely important.\n\n246\n00:12:55.777 --> 00:12:56.939\n&gt;&gt; Grab the fire extinguishers and\n\n247\n00:12:56.939 --> 00:12:59.183\ngo you know put out the servers\ndon't worry about the people.\n\n248\n00:12:59.183 --> 00:13:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't worry about the people.\n\n249\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.357\nAnd we're joking, we're kidding,\nwe certainly don't mean it that way.\n\n250\n00:13:03.357 --> 00:13:05.457\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But the data, when it comes down to it,\n\n251\n00:13:05.457 --> 00:13:09.748\nthe data's really what's important, and\nwith the prevalence of the cloud based\n\n252\n00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:14.390\ntechnologies out there, we can store a lot\nof that information in In the cloud.\n\n253\n00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.270\nThey have companies that have\ndedicated just for backups,\n\n254\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.340\ncarbonite, I think,\nis one of them out there and\n\n255\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.190\nIron Mountain I think is another one,\nI can't think of all of them.\n\n256\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.474\nBut basically, what they do is,\nyou're gonna pay them a service, and\n\n257\n00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:29.579\nthey're gonna hold\nthe backups of you data.\n\n258\n00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:31.210\nSo that if something does happen,\n\n259\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.642\nagain we don't want anything to happen\nat least we're planning for it,\n\n260\n00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:38.240\nthat if you do need access to your data\nbecause your main cycle is offline, at\n\n261\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.379\nleast you're just a service take it away\nfrom hopefully restoring that information.\n\n262\n00:13:42.379 --> 00:13:47.248\nNow, Cherokee made mention of something\nearlier that I like to bring back in\n\n263\n00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:51.830\nthe full context is, what if it takes\na long time to get to that, right?\n\n264\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.646\nWhat if you want using Cloud storage?\n\n265\n00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:59.480\nWell, that's where it's gonna be up to you\nto decide where your backups are gonna be.\n\n266\n00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.920\nAgain, on-site backups\nversus off-site backups.\n\n267\n00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.220\nIf you are handling the physical media\nyou're gonna have to take that into\n\n268\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.510\nconsideration and\n\n269\n00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.320\nit's definitely gonna have to be a part\nof your disaster recovery policy.\n\n270\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.570\nThe other thing too that you might see\nin disaster recovery, we've got all\n\n271\n00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:19.810\ndifferent kinds of course people, you've\ngot things like your first responders.\n\n272\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.140\nAnd you have things like, for\n\n273\n00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.130\ninstance, your HR, your PR coordinators\nif you have a public facing interest.\n\n274\n00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.540\nSo also keep that in mind.\n\n275\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.230\nNow, moving into the next concept\nthis is kind of interesting because\n\n276\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.470\nThis is what's known pretty much\nas a business continuity plan.\n\n277\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.590\n&gt;&gt; So Wes,\nas we look at business continuity,\n\n278\n00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.050\nwhat are we looking at specifically?\n\n279\n00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.240\nAre we talking disaster recovery plans or\nwhat should we think about in the event.\n\n280\n00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.412\nWell, if something actually does happen,\nwhere are we gonna go from there?\n\n281\n00:14:47.412 --> 00:14:49.790\n&gt;&gt; This is the one that gets\na little confusing here and\n\n282\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.400\nthat's because well we think of DRP,\nguys get ready for alphabet soup here.\n\n283\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.710\nThe DRP, disaster recovery plan,\nwell, your business continuity plan,\n\n284\n00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.020\nyour BCP is actually a part of your DRP\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.400\n&gt;&gt; Let's step back and try that again,\n\n286\n00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:08.440\nyour business continuity plan is actually\npart of your disaster recovery plan,\n\n287\n00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.290\nit's a component, right?.\n\n288\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:16.830\nAnd it incorporates things like, if I\ncan say this right, succession planning.\n\n289\n00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.390\nRight, I call that raid zero.\n\n290\n00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.945\nIt's funny, I call that a raid one for\nmanagement.\n\n291\n00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:22.600\n[INAUDIBLE] Right?\n\n292\n00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.520\nIf you're doing a job, and\nwe don't want you to get hurt, but\n\n293\n00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.170\nwhat happens if you can't do that\njob as part of the disaster?\n\n294\n00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.690\nWell you need to have somebody in line\nstepping in line to take over that job in\n\n295\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.900\norder to perform that role.\n\n296\n00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.420\nSo that the business can\nmaintain continuity, or\n\n297\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.510\neven from a disaster recovery standpoint,\nbe brought back online.\n\n298\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.678\nSo you also have to make sure that\nyou have training personnel, and\n\n299\n00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:48.696\nnot only the training personnel, but that\nyou also have other people that case those\n\n300\n00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:50.808\npersonnel, if something happens to them.\n\n301\n00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:53.093\nSomebody can step in their place and\nmake and\n\n302\n00:15:53.093 --> 00:15:55.270\ntake over whatever the problem might be.\n\n303\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.873\nThings like service redundancy,\nthis is another thing like for\n\n304\n00:15:58.873 --> 00:16:03.211\ninstance maybe you have an autonomous\nsystem and You have route redundancy,\n\n305\n00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:06.160\none route fails,\nanother route comes back online.\n\n306\n00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.465\nIf you end up having, for instance,\ncloud-based services, right,\n\n307\n00:16:10.465 --> 00:16:14.986\nyou might end up having maybe a portion\nof your cloud-based services are in\n\n308\n00:16:14.986 --> 00:16:17.950\nthings like AWS, right,\nAmazon Web Services.\n\n309\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.980\nMaybe you have a portion of it inside\nof the Azure platform for Microsoft and\n\n310\n00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.940\nwhy are you doing that?\n\n311\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.210\nWell, AWS is a huge service and\n\n312\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.540\nthey have some great up time but again\nwhat happens if something goes off line,\n\n313\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.710\nat least you have another cloud\nprovider that you can use.\n\n314\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.565\nSo again you even have things like service\nredundancies as well and that could go\n\n315\n00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:43.385\ndown as simple things like DNS, DHCP,\nyour back up, route redundancies.\n\n316\n00:16:43.385 --> 00:16:46.205\nYou're making sure that you have\nmore than one in case one fails.\n\n317\n00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:49.355\nAgain, the other one could continue\nwhere the first one failed.\n\n318\n00:16:49.355 --> 00:16:51.705\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like diversifying\nyour portfolio but\n\n319\n00:16:51.705 --> 00:16:53.200\nfrom the network engineering side.\n\n320\n00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.775\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, absolutely,\nI mean that's exactly when I'm doing here.\n\n321\n00:16:56.775 --> 00:17:00.110\nMy portfolio is horrible,\nwe should not probably say that [LAUGH].\n\n322\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.960\nThe other thing that we have, and again,\n\n323\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.060\nkeep in mind guys, that there's\nreally no right way or wrong way.\n\n324\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.080\nThat's why I point you to SANS, because\nSANS makes some recommendations, and\n\n325\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.520\ntheir recommendations are really good,\nthey really really lay it out for you.\n\n326\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.010\nBut there's other possible groups.\n\n327\n00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.380\nI mentioned first responders and in the\ncontext of first responders, understand\n\n328\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.510\nguys that again, first responders\ncould be a little bit different here.\n\n329\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.670\nLike I've mention some,\nI make mention of some the security guard,\n\n330\n00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.420\nthat's one of your first responders right,\nthey on site.\n\n331\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.510\nAnybody who's on site, right, so on site\nstaff as well but please understand that\n\n332\n00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.220\nthis list is not a guideline,\nit's just some commonality, right.\n\n333\n00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.287\nBecause a first responder in a natural\ngas and electric company or nuclear power\n\n334\n00:17:41.287 --> 00:17:45.601\nplant might be considerably different who\nresponds to that first versus someone who\n\n335\n00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:49.755\nis like a telecommunications provider\nmight be a little bit different, right?\n\n336\n00:17:49.755 --> 00:17:54.590\nSo for instance, you can have non IT\nstaff that are first responders, right?\n\n337\n00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.429\nEMT, fire, law enforcement but\n\n338\n00:17:56.429 --> 00:17:59.920\nthen you can also have things\nlike your recovery team, right?\n\n339\n00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.490\nYour recovery team, legal team,\nlegal team might be somebody,\n\n340\n00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.466\nthey might not be the first responders but\nyou might even have things like\n\n341\n00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:10.490\nthird-party services if\nyou've contracted out, right?\n\n342\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.886\nAnd you're paying somebody as a service\nto do disaster recovery for you,\n\n343\n00:18:13.886 --> 00:18:16.252\nthey could be some of\nthe first responders as well.\n\n344\n00:18:16.252 --> 00:18:19.435\n&gt;&gt; It could even be just someone that's\nanswering tickets from the help desk\n\n345\n00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:22.667\nbecause they might be the first to say,\nhm that doesn't even seem right and\n\n346\n00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:23.973\nthen escalate it from there.\n\n347\n00:18:23.973 --> 00:18:27.838\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, if it happens to be\nyou are a public facing entity and\n\n348\n00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:30.450\na service goes down, you could be, right?\n\n349\n00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.420\nSomebody expecting a service,\nthey don't get that service and\n\n350\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.900\nthey call up your contact,\ncontact us, right?\n\n351\n00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.090\nAnd that's the help desk,\nthat's the first one that gets a call and\n\n352\n00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.430\nmaybe your help desk is outsourced.\n\n353\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.870\nMaybe it's outsourced,\nit's not even in the same location, so.\n\n354\n00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.380\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n355\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.980\n&gt;&gt; That's another great point.\n\n356\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.130\nAnd I mentioned things like\nsecurity teams, you know, and\n\n357\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.390\nagain, public, PR, HR.\n\n358\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.620\nYou might see some of these concepts\nare kind of falling in the boat together.\n\n359\n00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.610\nAgain, a lot of them\nare gonna all be components\n\n360\n00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.110\npretty much of the same process.\n\n361\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.380\nThe other thing in business continuity\nthat we need to do is things like, for\n\n362\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.450\ninstance, determine\nthe criticality of the personnel.\n\n363\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.900\nThe facilities, the computers, the systems\nif you will, operating systems, operations\n\n364\n00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.590\nthemselves and equipment determine things\nlike the maximum allowed downtime.\n\n365\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.075\nHow long can we be down before it's\nthe point of no return, right.\n\n366\n00:19:22.075 --> 00:19:25.405\nWe just, our business cannot\nbe brought back online, and\n\n367\n00:19:25.405 --> 00:19:27.185\nwe basically have to go under.\n\n368\n00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:28.835\nCertainly that's not\nwhat you want to happen,\n\n369\n00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:32.375\nand that's why your business continuity,\nyour BCP, is very, very important.\n\n370\n00:19:32.375 --> 00:19:36.845\nAnd also to minimize things like\nthe resources needed for recovery as well.\n\n371\n00:19:36.845 --> 00:19:41.635\nBecause we don't want that to be\nmore expensive than it has to be.\n\n372\n00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:44.020\nAnd I can tell you,\nif you're not planning ahead of time,\n\n373\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.390\nchances are you might be paying for\nstuff that you don't really need.\n\n374\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.600\nAnd that's why ongoing training\nin end user awareness,\n\n375\n00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.770\nend user training, if you will,\nstaff employee training.\n\n376\n00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.320\nAnnual, maybe periodic reviews, doesn't\nneed to be annually, could be quarterly,\n\n377\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.636\ncould be annually, for all you know,\ncould be bi-annually, as well.\n\n378\n00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:09.050\nSo, constantly looking at these as well,\nand go back over and\n\n379\n00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.410\nreview these processes because we know,\nand if you're watching this and if you've\n\n380\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.760\ntaken other certifications or you're going\nthrough a certification exam right now,\n\n381\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.060\nyou probably are familiar with\nhow fast technology is changing.\n\n382\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.166\nAnd if you're business is in information\ntechnology, then the only way\n\n383\n00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:29.559\nyour business stays progressive inside\nof technology is to advance with it.\n\n384\n00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:34.533\nSo, one disaster recovery policy might\nnot suit you if you don't go back and\n\n385\n00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.320\nlook at it.\n\n386\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.779\nAnd if you do go back and look at it and\ndecide that there are some changes,\n\n387\n00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:42.413\nthere are some things that maybe aren't\nrelevant to your company today, or\n\n388\n00:20:42.413 --> 00:20:46.170\nmaybe still relevant and you have to\nimplement additional technologies.\n\n389\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.636\nThat's why the review was always good.\n\n390\n00:20:47.636 --> 00:20:52.420\nAll right there Cherokee, they mention\na couple of other things here too,\n\n391\n00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.350\nwhich is all part of redundancy, so like I\nsaid this really could be lumped together.\n\n392\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:01.090\nThey talk about battery backups in UPSs,\nright, uninterruptible power supply.\n\n393\n00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.400\nSo what are they doing for us?\n\n394\n00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.940\nWhat is it that they really do?\n\n395\n00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.330\nUnderstand that a battery backup,\nor a UPS, that isn't,\n\n396\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:15.220\nhey let's keep our servers up powered\nfrom the UPS until power comes back on.\n\n397\n00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.280\nSo please understand that\nuninterruptible power supply,\n\n398\n00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.060\nwhile it will maintain a level\nof power for a little bit,\n\n399\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.070\nif you do lose power it's really only\nthere for one purpose, and that is to\n\n400\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.390\nallow your systems to perform what\nare known as graceful shutdowns, right?\n\n401\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.180\nIf I have, for instance,\na web server on the front end and\n\n402\n00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.210\nI've got a database at the back end\nthat it sends information into, I could\n\n403\n00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.402\nhave transactional logs that are in\nthe middle of writing processes and stuff,\n\n404\n00:21:40.402 --> 00:21:45.820\ndisk diode that is going on and if we lose\npower and everything shuts off instantly.\n\n405\n00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.730\nWell then we have a potential for\ndata corruption.\n\n406\n00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.940\nSo that's why the uninterruptible power\nsupply does provide a power backup, but\n\n407\n00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.930\nusually it's just long enough that all\nof those systems can perform a graceful\n\n408\n00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.510\nshut down, so\nyou don't get data corruption.\n\n409\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.950\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwell let's say it's July in Florida and\n\n410\n00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.600\nwe have another hurricane headed our way,\nright?\n\n411\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.710\nWe lose power and\nI'm able to shut those machines down.\n\n412\n00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.260\nBut like you spoke about earlier,\n\n413\n00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.980\nat what particular moment in\ntime can my business recover?\n\n414\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.260\nWhat if I'm nearing that moment in time\nand I have to make a judgement call,\n\n415\n00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.450\na decision.\n\n416\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:19.650\nShould I use generators\nas a source of power?\n\n417\n00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.520\nAnd we know that generators don't\nhave a really stable output, but\n\n418\n00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.180\nwhat's your take on that Wes?\n\n419\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.000\n&gt;&gt; You know that's interesting,\n\n420\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.990\nthat's another thing that we, as we\nhave saying here we kind of emphasizing,\n\n421\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.030\ndon't wait to make a decision\nuntil after the disaster happened.\n\n422\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.790\nBut gasoline generators,\nthey're not really good,\n\n423\n00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.310\njust because of the power\nfluctuations that they give.\n\n424\n00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.720\nAs a gasoline generator turns\non it draws a lot of amperage.\n\n425\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.660\nAnd if you guys don't realize it, I know\nyou guys are coming over from A+ already\n\n426\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.620\nknow this, and maybe this is the first\ncertification you've tried to undertake.\n\n427\n00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.230\nKeep in mind that circuitry,\nthe communication circuitry and PC's,\n\n428\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.920\nwork stations and servers, they don't do\ngood with alternating current at all,\n\n429\n00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.390\nthey don't do good with\nfrequency variations and\n\n430\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.360\nthat's why we run them\noff with direct current.\n\n431\n00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.210\nSo I would say that would be better\nto have like a diesel generator and\n\n432\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.990\nthe diesel generators, when they kick\non now, they can draw a lot of power,\n\n433\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.280\ndon't get me wrong,\nwhen they first come on.\n\n434\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.390\nBut as they start to even out,\nthey give a nice clean power.\n\n435\n00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.540\nYou could go even farther than that too,\n\n436\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.150\nmaybe you not only have things like\nyour UPSs, you should have for\n\n437\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.070\nthe graceful shutdowns like Cherokee\nmentioned, then fail over to a generator.\n\n438\n00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.904\nBut you might even have\nredundant electrical grids too,\n\n439\n00:23:31.904 --> 00:23:33.742\ndepending on how big the company is.\n\n440\n00:23:33.742 --> 00:23:38.449\nAgain, it gets very expensive, but\nif you are under SLAs that provide high\n\n441\n00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:43.004\navailability, how much is that breach\nof an SLA or the violation of an SLA\n\n442\n00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:47.808\ngoing to cost you if you're not providing\nwhat you said you should provide?\n\n443\n00:23:47.808 --> 00:23:50.364\nSo when you are in a high\navailability situation and\n\n444\n00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:53.762\nlet me now just assume that you guys\nknow what high availability is.\n\n445\n00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:56.823\nI know I keep throwing that term\nout there and I know what it means,\n\n446\n00:23:56.823 --> 00:23:57.834\nI know Cherokee's.\n\n447\n00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:00.026\nSeen it probably more times than you'd\never want to see it in your life.\n\n448\n00:24:00.026 --> 00:24:04.410\nBut high availability is just how\nclose to 100% uptime do you get?\n\n449\n00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.900\nYou typically never get 100% uptime,\n\n450\n00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.952\nnot without quite a few\nmillions of dollars budget.\n\n451\n00:24:09.952 --> 00:24:11.913\n&gt;&gt; Magic.\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH] without magic,\n\n452\n00:24:11.913 --> 00:24:12.775\na little mojo on it.\n\n453\n00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:14.729\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; About the highest availability that\n\n454\n00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:17.494\nyou'll get is about what they\ncall the five nine up time.\n\n455\n00:24:17.494 --> 00:24:22.118\nThey say it's about five seconds down or\nfive minutes down time, I believe?\n\n456\n00:24:22.118 --> 00:24:23.460\n&gt;&gt; 5.05, I think.\n\n457\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.140\n&gt;&gt; Man great with the statistics there.\n\n458\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:30.010\nSo you're talking five minutes of\ndown time in one given year, so\n\n459\n00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:34.030\nif you are under SLA, like that,\nwhich I'm not saying you won't be but\n\n460\n00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.950\nthat's pretty steep SLA.\n\n461\n00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.720\nYou could lose a lot of money,\neven things like Amazon and stuff,\n\n462\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:45.620\nthey're not giving five nines,\nI think they give a 99.95% up time.\n\n463\n00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.480\nSo, the point being is that they have to\nmake sure that if one of their systems\n\n464\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.330\ngo offline,\n\n465\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.470\nthat they have some kind of electrical\nredundancy to bring that line up, back in.\n\n466\n00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.230\nThey also got site fail overs too,\nso you can see that so\n\n467\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.370\nthat the battery backups, again keep in\nmind they're not supposed to keep your\n\n468\n00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.230\nsystems running, they're only supposed\nto shut them down gracefully.\n\n469\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.560\nRemember that you could fail over to\ndiesel generators and as well use things\n\n470\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.200\nlike redundant electrical grids depending\non the budget and the size of the company.\n\n471\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.350\nNow Cherokee that being said,\n[LAUGH] looking at this list here,\n\n472\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.570\nit looks like I have talked,\nI've got a lot more.\n\n473\n00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.530\nBut I don't think we're going to\nbe able to fit it in this episode.\n\n474\n00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do see one thing\nin the chat here, real quick.\n\n475\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.790\nSomeone says they use propane generators\nat their organization, and inverters for\n\n476\n00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.480\ntheir telephone companies,\nwhich is another great thing.\n\n477\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.850\nDon't forget about lime conditioners too,\n\n478\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.350\nif you ever want to help\nwith that output there.\n\n479\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.181\nAnd then, one other thing,\nWes, what about the.\n\n480\n00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:37.660\nPrice difference between\nbattery backups and UPSs.\n\n481\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.610\nI see that UPSs are more expensive because\nthey might offer things like inverters and\n\n482\n00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.210\nour battery backups are more for\nour desktop.\n\n483\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.180\n&gt;&gt; That is right,\nthe battery backups are for\n\n484\n00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.930\njust a home environment versus the UPS,\ncuz like you said,\n\n485\n00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.110\nyou can get UPSs that do what's known\nas line conditioning like you said.\n\n486\n00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.990\nAnd what's kind of interesting, now,\nwe're talking about really complex.\n\n487\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.880\nLike these things literally\nbring in the electricity,\n\n488\n00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.740\nthey break the electrical current\ncompletely down and then they rebuild it.\n\n489\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:10.360\nAnd the output is a nice clean sine wave,\nso very, very, they can be expensive,\n\n490\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.800\nand that's why, like Cherokee mentioned,\nI would say that you'll probably see those\n\n491\n00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.070\nin businesses versus battery backups,\nwhere it's really all you're doing.\n\n492\n00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.660\nYou're plugging in a couple of devices,\npower goes off, hopefully those are for\n\n493\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.360\ngraceful shutdown.\n\n494\n00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.110\nBut those are gonna be more for\nyour home environment.\n\n495\n00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:25.320\n&gt;&gt; We have covered a lot and\n\n496\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.600\nI think we've got a good start as to\nwhat we should do in our environment if\n\n497\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.980\nthere was a disaster, or at least how\nto start beginning to plan for one.\n\n498\n00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.550\nSo thank you so much for that, Wes,\nand thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n499\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.050\ntuning in.\n\n500\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.420\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have more Net Plus headed your way.\n\n501\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.460\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour show host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n502\n00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n503\n00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.503\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n504\n00:26:43.503 --> 00:26:50.469\n[MUSIC]\n\n505\n00:26:50.469 --> 00:26:53.526\nThank you for watching

Welcome to your Comp TIA Network+\nseries, I'm your show host,\n\n5\n00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:16.570\nCherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.740\nNow, If you've been following along,\nyou'll know this is actually a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.400\nIn the previous episode, we were looking\nat different types of risk concepts.\n\n8\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.150\nWith us today we have Mr.\nWes Bryan to continue this topic.\n\n9\n00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.740\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.870\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I appreciate you having\nme back after I talked so\n\n11\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.120\nmuch in that first episode.\n\n12\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.620\nBut that's right,\n\n13\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.660\nwe do have some additional\nconcepts that we need to look at.\n\n14\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.770\nSo that we can help you\nout with the exam and\n\n15\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.030\njust for your general knowledge as well.\n\n16\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.830\nOne of the first things\nthat we're gonna look at.\n\n17\n00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.930\nIn fact, Cherokee, in the first episode\nwe talked about business continuity.\n\n18\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.870\nAnd we talked a little bit about\na business continuity plan and\n\n19\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.350\nsome of the things that you should see.\n\n20\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.020\nBut one of the things I forgot to show\nyou, and I wanna kinda show you guys this.\n\n21\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.687\nI actually had a SANS document that\ngives you a template, if you will, and\n\n22\n00:00:58.687 --> 00:01:01.700\ndescribes business not\ncontinuity planning so\n\n23\n00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.310\nif we could take a look at my screen\nhere you can see that same thing again.\n\n24\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.095\nJust like before we said\ngo up to sans here.\n\n25\n00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:13.670\nSans.org in the reading room and\ngo up to the white papers there.\n\n26\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.750\nThey got a lot of great information here\nand you can see this is an introduction to\n\n27\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.290\nbusiness continuity planning so if you are\ndoing things like studying for this exam.\n\n28\n00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.665\nMaybe you're gonna go on a study for\n\n29\n00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.290\nSecurity+ where it'll probably\nbe covered in great more depth.\n\n30\n00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.051\nYou might want to take a look at this\ndocumentation here and at least get\n\n31\n00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:35.811\nan idea so you know a little bit more\nabout the concepts just cuz like any\n\n32\n00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:40.532\ncertification, remember you're learning a\nnew language and here at the Net+ level it\n\n33\n00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:44.724\nis no different and certainly not when\nyou move on to things like Security+.\n\n34\n00:01:44.724 --> 00:01:48.580\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, we spoke about some things\nthat we need to do preemptively,\n\n35\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.330\nbut what happens if a breach occurs or we\nsuspect there's an attack on our network?\n\n36\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.190\n&gt;&gt; When it comes to a data breach,\n\n37\n00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.320\na data breach really is a violation\nof the security policy.\n\n38\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.590\nThat's really what it comes down to it.\n\n39\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.430\nWhat do you consider a data breach?\n\n40\n00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.970\nWell, unauthorized access.\n\n41\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.580\nThat's what it boils down to.\n\n42\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.800\nSomebody has access to your data and\nyou didn't give them permission.\n\n43\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.800\nNow, I want you to keep in mind that\ndata breaches don't have to be,\n\n44\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.640\nthey don't have to be external, right?\n\n45\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.150\nThey can be intentional,\nwhich means they can be external users but\n\n46\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.080\nthey can also be internal and\nunintentional right?\n\n47\n00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.930\nSomebody could have maybe more permission.\n\n48\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.680\nMaybe if somebody set an ACL wrong and\nit certainly isn't any user's fault.\n\n49\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.370\nAnd users have a way to find\ntheir way around the systems.\n\n50\n00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.280\nThey can't figure out how to send\nan email to save their life or\n\n51\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.090\nconnect to the Internet.\n\n52\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.030\nBut when it comes to bypassing security,\n\n53\n00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.950\nthey can click their way around and\nfind it.\n\n54\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.310\nSo keep in mind that a data breach,\n\n55\n00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.960\nwhat it boils down to it's\nreally just unauthorized access.\n\n56\n00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.520\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe some kind of an attack eternally.\n\n57\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.290\nIt could be an attack from the inside.\n\n58\n00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.110\nWe talked about in other episodes,\nthings like malicious insiders.\n\n59\n00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.290\nAnd it could be that threat from within.\n\n60\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.350\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n61\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.120\nThat a data breach is.\n\n62\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.280\nThe big thing about a data breach\nis just the detection, right?\n\n63\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.220\nThe detection process is gonna be hard and\nthat's why you want to make sure you have\n\n64\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.010\ncertain checks and balances in place,\nthings like your ACLs,\n\n65\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.500\nthings like company security policies,\nacceptable use policies, that people need\n\n66\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.920\nto adhere to those policies and standards\nof the company to ensure a few things.\n\n67\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.360\nFor instance,\nwhen it comes to adherence to policies,\n\n68\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.080\nyou have to make sure that there's\na reason we have these policies, right.\n\n69\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.400\nWe make sure that we are providing some\nkind of baseline, for acceptable use\n\n70\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.060\nof things like the company's intellectual\nproperty, the Internet of you will, right.\n\n71\n00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.420\nWe don't want gambling sites.\n\n72\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.210\nPeople go on gambling sites at work and\n\n73\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.380\nthen any other site that\nyou might think of.\n\n74\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.565\n&gt;&gt; That's not fun.\n\n75\n00:03:48.565 --> 00:03:49.355\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n76\n00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:50.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm Dr.\n\n77\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.400\nKilljoy here, but you know\n&gt;&gt; It is a legality that we [LAUGH]\n\n78\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.190\ndefinitely have to keep in mind.\n\n79\n00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.110\nSo, again,\n\n80\n00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.280\njust to understand that data breaches\ndon't have to be the external attack type.\n\n81\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.870\nThey can be unintentional as well.\n\n82\n00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.980\nAnd it could be for\njust the simplicity that somebody\n\n83\n00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.060\nhad access that they shouldn't, and\nthey are one of your staff members.\n\n84\n00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.410\nSo Wes, do you have any tips to make our,\nnot make our employees, but\n\n85\n00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.180\nto help them maybe understand or\n\n86\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.670\nadhere to these policies that we're trying\nto enforce throughout our organization?\n\n87\n00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.410\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, you know Cherokee,\nI know you're very aware and\n\n88\n00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.990\nreally like policies and we talk\nabout things like in Security+, right\n\n89\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.610\nlike the CIA triads, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n90\n00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.968\nWell there really should\nbe an employee triad, too.\n\n91\n00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:36.808\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:40.370\n&gt;&gt; The employee triad is communication,\n\n93\n00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.880\ntraining and awareness.\n\n94\n00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.420\nRight, communication,\nthey need to know what it is to expect.\n\n95\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.480\nTraining, show them how to identify,\n\n96\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.270\nor how to react and\nit leads to awareness, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.880\nSo those three things are very,\nvery important.\n\n98\n00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.580\nAnd they have to be ongoing, right?\n\n99\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.270\nAnd I know we're in Network+, but\nwe're really talking about risk.\n\n100\n00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.800\nAnd risk is heavily security-centric.\n\n101\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.770\nAnd it is something that we need constant\ncommunication, constant awareness,\n\n102\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.070\nconstant education because the attacks\nthat happened back in the late 90s\n\n103\n00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.890\nare not the attacks that happen now,\nwhere they still could be but\n\n104\n00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.490\nmost of our systems are patched from\nthose types of attacks, so as we\n\n105\n00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.446\nmove into newer technologies, we have to\nconstantly be training our employees.\n\n106\n00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:28.203\nNow, Cherokee and I were talking\nabout this one before we started\n\n107\n00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:33.920\nthe episode as being part of risk\nassessment, risk management, right?\n\n108\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.180\nOne of the things that they call out\nis critical nodes, for instance, and\n\n109\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.770\nmore importantly,\nthey call it a single point of failure.\n\n110\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.640\nIf you think about when we talked\nabout our topologies, right,\n\n111\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.150\nwe talked about star topology being\nbeneficial because if a node loses access,\n\n112\n00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.850\nright, to the centralized connectivity\ndevice, that doesn't bring the whole\n\n113\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.730\nentire network down like it did in\nthe earlier days when we had Bus and\n\n114\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.920\nwe had ring topologies that weren't\nthat fault tolerant, right?\n\n115\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.570\nBut what about that central device?\n\n116\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.920\nThat connectivity device becomes\nthe single point of failure.\n\n117\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.250\nIf you have a serve that your\nwhole entire company relies on,\n\n118\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.130\nmaybe it's a web application, right maybe\nit's a learning management solution.\n\n119\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.970\nMaybe it's a CMS,\ncustomer management solution right?\n\n120\n00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.190\nWhich your whole entire\ncompany depends on it.\n\n121\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.990\nWhat happens if that\napplication goes down?\n\n122\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.520\nDoesn't necessarily have to be just\na specific connectivity device or\n\n123\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.180\nthat could be, how do you know?\n\n124\n00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.420\nWell you go through your risk assessments,\nright, and\n\n125\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.730\nthen you determine the criticality of each\nindividual node if you will or an asset.\n\n126\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.380\nLike I said, it might not be a node, it\nmight not be a connectivity device, right.\n\n127\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.348\nNow it might be a web application\nthat's running on a device, right, but\n\n128\n00:06:43.348 --> 00:06:47.710\nthe application itself if it has problems,\nyou have communication problems.\n\n129\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.190\nSo that's why it is important\nto identify these and\n\n130\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.730\nimplement things like redundancy.\n\n131\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.640\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, this really isn't something\nthat I should be doing alone.\n\n132\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.835\nI should be working with a team to\nperform my risk analysis because there,\n\n133\n00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:04.301\nI need input from other departments,\ndepartmental heads.\n\n134\n00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:07.276\nAnd I might have different\nmatrices that I must adhere to and\n\n135\n00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:11.623\nkind of like fill-in-the-blank and kind of\nlike triage these machines and actually\n\n136\n00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:16.320\nuse mathematical algorithms to determine\nokay, where should I focus my efforts?\n\n137\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and you get different\nsoftware that can also do that as well.\n\n138\n00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.970\nThat communication there like you say.\n\n139\n00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.558\nCommunication, really, like, if I can even\nsay this, inter-departmental procedures,\n\n140\n00:07:26.558 --> 00:07:30.913\nlike communicating because, for instance,\nI've seen this before where a company that\n\n141\n00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:34.801\nI used to work for, the whole entire\nserver closet just, something happened,\n\n142\n00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:38.630\nI don't know if it was the SAN that went\ndown, but something ended up going down\n\n143\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.996\nand we needed backups and the first\nthing that the network tech said,\n\n144\n00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:45.818\nhe sat down with management and said,\nokay I need to know what's important.\n\n145\n00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:49.296\nNow had we been maybe watching this\nepisode they would have figured this out\n\n146\n00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:51.015\nprior to that disaster themselves.\n\n147\n00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:54.443\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But he mentioned a really interesting\n\n148\n00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:59.025\npoint of view, he said,\nwhat I consider critical, you might not.\n\n149\n00:07:59.025 --> 00:07:59.560\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n150\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.201\n&gt;&gt; So if we sat down, like you said,\ntalking to other in the communication,\n\n151\n00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:07.316\nmanagers might say this is critical, where\na network engineer might say no that's\n\n152\n00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:11.136\ncritical, where a security team says\nyou better have the firewall in place,\n\n153\n00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:13.480\nbecause we got PCI in\ncompliance that we need.\n\n154\n00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.250\nSo again, that communication.\n\n155\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.220\nNow, SANS kinda defines this.\n\n156\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.520\nI told you, that we've been\ntalking about the SANS definition.\n\n157\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.030\nA critical component is defined\nas accomplishing the work of\n\n158\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.020\nan organization, right?\n\n159\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.470\nThat it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a node.\n\n160\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.490\nIt could be primarily\nperformed by computers.\n\n161\n00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.870\nIt can be performed manually for\njust a limited time but\n\n162\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.740\nit must be restored starting at 36\nhours and not greater than five days.\n\n163\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.070\nSo you can see that their frame of\nreference for a node that's critical.\n\n164\n00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.460\nBut I can tell you right now.\n\n165\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.340\nIf somebody like Amazon has a major\nportion of their service that goes\n\n166\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.040\noffline, they stand to lose quite\na few million dollars an hour.\n\n167\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n168\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.270\n&gt;&gt; They might not be\nable to wait five days.\n\n169\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.690\nFive days might be an RGE for the whole\nentire staff, resume generating event.\n\n170\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.490\nAt least at this point if they\ngot a printer still available,\n\n171\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.064\nthey could all print their resumes\n[LAUGH] on the way out the door.\n\n172\n00:09:06.064 --> 00:09:07.180\nSo, again,\n\n173\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.840\nwhat's critical to one company might\nnot be critical to the other company.\n\n174\n00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.372\nAll right, now I mentioned that this\nnext concept, adherence to standards and\n\n175\n00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.490\npolicies and, boy,\nthere are a bunch of them.\n\n176\n00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.380\nAll different types.\n\n177\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.900\nAgain, you can go up to\nsomething like SANS.\n\n178\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.310\nAnd why do we adhere to him, right?\n\n179\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.820\nAnd again, to help provide the consistence\nof service delivery could be what\n\n180\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.510\nsets the standard for customer service,\nfor sales practices, for staff training.\n\n181\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.930\nRight, we've talked about education,\nor communication, education, or\n\n182\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.380\ntraining if you will, in awareness.\n\n183\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.370\nWell, what sets the standard for that?\n\n184\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.360\nAnd again, these policies.\n\n185\n00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.010\nAnd in adherence to the policy, once\nyou're trained, once you're aware of it,\n\n186\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.320\nagain, can help.\n\n187\n00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.310\nThings like management responsibilities,\ndifferent companies and\n\n188\n00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.643\ndifferent department heads have different\nresponsibilities in a situation like that.\n\n189\n00:09:56.643 --> 00:10:01.580\nAcceptable use policies, right, acceptable\nuse policies things like Internet,\n\n190\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.660\nthings like your wireless networks,\ncompany data, right.\n\n191\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.500\nWith the things that we have\non our networks today like for\n\n192\n00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.560\ninstance mobile devices right, BYOD,\nbringing in your mobile device,\n\n193\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.890\nwanting to use your mobile device they\ncall it what is it, consumerization of IT.\n\n194\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.000\nI want my device, and I want it because\nI'm familiar with it, it's mine, but\n\n195\n00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.430\nI still want access to the company data.\n\n196\n00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.350\nWell, that's okay.\n\n197\n00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.100\nWhat company data can\nyou have access to and\n\n198\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.660\nwhat should remain on networks in servers,\nand never in your vehicle?\n\n199\n00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.380\nWell again, that's where your policies and\n\n200\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.870\nadherence to the policies\nbecome important.\n\n201\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.710\nThings like your business applications.\n\n202\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.100\nAre you allowed to use\nthe business applications, or\n\n203\n00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.440\nyou're allowed to install\nyour own applications?\n\n204\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.210\nI don't know.\n\n205\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.650\nAnd that's where things like\nthe policies can define whether certain\n\n206\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.680\napplications are whitelisted,\nor blacklisted.\n\n207\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and you know what,\nand maybe that particular,\n\n208\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.740\nmaybe someone brings in an iPad or\nan iPhone, or whatever kind of tablet.\n\n209\n00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.000\nAnd they pass your onboarding process.\n\n210\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.940\nSo they had an anti-malware installed,\ntheir system was up to date, but\n\n211\n00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.820\nmaybe your health policy is saying look,\nyou have to maintain these things.\n\n212\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.710\nAnd if they fall out of compliance,\nmaybe they get put on a remediation type\n\n213\n00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.380\nnetwork until they can bring the health\nof that device back up to your standards.\n\n214\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.900\n&gt;&gt; And you could see why it's so\nimportant, too,\n\n215\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.020\nbecause that's why we have things\nlike remote data removal, right?\n\n216\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.889\nRemote business data removal.\n\n217\n00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Remote wiping.\n\n218\n00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, remote wiping.\n\n219\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.300\nAnd why do they make technologies\nlike that, if it wasn't for\n\n220\n00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.420\nthe fact that the business\ndata is important?\n\n221\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.470\nAnd they want to maintain\nsome kind of control over it.\n\n222\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.042\nAnd not only does IT wanna\nmaintain some kind of control for\n\n223\n00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:33.519\nthings like security and privacy,\nright, and security compliance as well.\n\n224\n00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:37.958\nBut also to insure that things like even\nthe customer's data isn't tampered with or\n\n225\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.708\nin this case,\n\n226\n00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:43.620\nthe employee's data isn't tampered and\nbeing able to classify the difference.\n\n227\n00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.500\nNow the next two concepts\nare kind of interesting.\n\n228\n00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.000\nThe next ones they call out\nare vulnerability scanning, pen testing or\n\n229\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.960\npenetration testing.\n\n230\n00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.520\n&gt;&gt; Now this is kind of a little\nfuzzy a little here Wes,\n\n231\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.980\nwhat's the difference between the two or\n\n232\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.920\nwhat does the relationship look\nlike between those two terms?\n\n233\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.510\n&gt;&gt; That is a great one cuz a lot of\ntimes they're used synonymously and\n\n234\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.140\nI remember when I first got in the A+\nlevel, I thought they were the same.\n\n235\n00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.880\nI thought vulnerability scanning, it's\nwhat I'm doing, I'm doing pen testing.\n\n236\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.640\nAnd that is not the case.\n\n237\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.640\nAll right, understand that\nvulnerability scanning is a component\n\n238\n00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.760\nof penetration testing, but\nit's only a tool used, right.\n\n239\n00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.300\nPenetration testing is\nmuch more than just that.\n\n240\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.980\nSo, let me go ahead and what we'll do\nis we'll kinda talk about what one and\n\n241\n00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.530\nthe other are, and then we'll\nlook at some of the differences.\n\n242\n00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.590\nSo, for instance, if we look at\nvulnerability scanning, again,\n\n243\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.770\na component of pen testing.\n\n244\n00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.250\nThis is any kind of application, or\n\n245\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:36.180\nit could be a group of applications\nthat again, detect any kind of security\n\n246\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.740\nweakness within a single\nsystem like maybe a host.\n\n247\n00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.580\nOr maybe multiple systems, multiple\nhost or the entire network, right,\n\n248\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.590\nif you're doing vulnerability scanning.\n\n249\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.940\nLike for instance, NMAP, and\nyou're doing things like ping sweeps.\n\n250\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.240\nThat's doing vulnerability scanning\nacross the entire network.\n\n251\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.010\nSo it could be host based.\n\n252\n00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.730\nIt could even be network based as well.\n\n253\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.440\nWhat is it used for?\n\n254\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.768\nIt's used to establish the attack surface,\nthe attack surface of a company.\n\n255\n00:13:01.768 --> 00:13:05.560\nThe attack surface is\nhow many vulnerabilities\n\n256\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.874\ndo you have within your company, right?\n\n257\n00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:09.140\nA vulnerability is some kind of flaw,\n\n258\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.250\nsome kind of condition that\nleads you into an attack.\n\n259\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.100\nSome basic security definitions, right,\na vulnerability is not an exploit, right,\n\n260\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.250\na vulnerability is a flaw or condition\nthat leaves you open to an attack and\n\n261\n00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.110\nan exploit is a way to take\nadvantage of the vulnerability, so\n\n262\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.470\nplease keep that in mind.\n\n263\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.950\n&gt;&gt; So\nI'm kind of having a brain fart here,\n\n264\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.180\nWes, is it the Microsoft on\nsecurity baseline analyzer?\n\n265\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.900\nWhat's the acronym for that one?\n\n266\n00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.460\nAnd have it-\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n267\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.500\nMicrosoft Security Baseline Analyzer.\n\n268\n00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.140\n&gt;&gt; So that's something that's\nintegrated within the operating system.\n\n269\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.780\nBut I'm sure that there are third-party\ntools, just depending on our environments.\n\n270\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.970\nWe really don't have to be scouring and\nlooking too hard for\n\n271\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.170\nthese types of tools out there.\n\n272\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, the other one that\ncomes to mind is the vendor website,\n\n273\n00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.590\nthe best practices and stuff.\n\n274\n00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.930\nYou can go up to Cisco, and they can tell\nyou what, hey, this is what we recommend.\n\n275\n00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; As far as configurations,\n\n276\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.010\nwe know things like steering\naway from defaults, right.\n\n277\n00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.410\nSo the vulnerability scanning, it usually\nuses a database of known flaws, and\n\n278\n00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.275\nit's basically checking against\nthat database of known flaws.\n\n279\n00:14:07.275 --> 00:14:11.640\nNow, when we get into pen testing again,\npenetration testing is a broader\n\n280\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.720\ntopic that uses just vulnerability\nscanning as a single component within it.\n\n281\n00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.300\nSo for instance, pen testing cannot only\nbe like a vulnerability scan that's done\n\n282\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.780\nby a piece of software.\n\n283\n00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.840\nWe could be testing physical security,\nright?\n\n284\n00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.230\nSocial engineering attacks.\n\n285\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.520\nSocial engineering attacks, I guess,\nit's a form of vulnerability scanning,\n\n286\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.610\nbut you're using more than one avenue,\nall right?\n\n287\n00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.290\nYou do things like, for instance,\napplication layer testing, right?\n\n288\n00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.120\nApplication layer testing\nis testing websites and\n\n289\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.720\nyour applications, themselves,\nfor vulnerability.\n\n290\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.330\nDoing things like network layer testing,\nas well.\n\n291\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.860\nYour LAN communications,\nyour VLAN communications.\n\n292\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.560\nLooking at your interconnection devices,\nlike your switches and your routers and\n\n293\n00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.400\nin seeing if there's some kind\nof exploit that we can get\n\n294\n00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.940\ninto those devices as well.\n\n295\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.170\n&gt;&gt; So what I'm understanding and hearing\nfrom you Wes, it seems almost like that\n\n296\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.750\nvulnerability scanning would be\nmore of a passive technique.\n\n297\n00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.910\nWhere if you're looking at things like\nphysical security and you're breaking\n\n298\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:11.540\na lock on that door I guess it depends\non the type of contract that you enter\n\n299\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.810\nwhenever you sign that pen testing\nagreement with that organization saying,\n\n300\n00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.258\nlook, are we doing a no holds\nbarred type of test here?\n\n301\n00:15:19.258 --> 00:15:24.010\nAm I gonna be actively trying to\nmanipulate your network and things like\n\n302\n00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:28.720\nthat, so vulnerability scanning would be\nmore passive in that kind of comparison.\n\n303\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.500\n&gt;&gt; And if you, yeah and if you along that\nline too, if you look at the duration of\n\n304\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.220\ntime like a vulnerability scan\ncan be done within seconds,\n\n305\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.310\nmaybe within minutes, right?\n\n306\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.180\nA pen testing could go days,\ncould go weeks and\n\n307\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.250\ncould be an active like an on\ngoing investigation, right?\n\n308\n00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.329\nIt's not just something that we run and\nwe're done in a couple of minutes right.\n\n309\n00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:49.276\nSo for instance, vulnerability scans\ndo the identification, the ranking,\n\n310\n00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:51.310\nand reporting of the vulnerabilities,\n\n311\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.659\nwhere pen testing would do thinks\nlike identifying ways to exploit\n\n312\n00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:57.628\nthe vulnerabilities that\nthe vulnerability scan found.\n\n313\n00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:01.732\nSo give you an example, for instance,\nvulnerability scans might be run quarterly\n\n314\n00:16:01.732 --> 00:16:04.440\nafter their significant changes,\nunlike a pen test.\n\n315\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.529\nA pen test might be annually\nafter significant changes.\n\n316\n00:16:08.529 --> 00:16:12.931\nIt's usually a tool that's fairly\nautomated when it comes to vulnerability\n\n317\n00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.701\nscanning versus pen testing.\n\n318\n00:16:14.701 --> 00:16:18.942\nWhich could have multiple departments, if\nyou will, and it's a very manual process.\n\n319\n00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:22.970\nIt's not really automated, it's done\nusually over a period of days or weeks,\n\n320\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.850\nif you will.\n\n321\n00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.310\n&gt;&gt; And usually from a third-party entity,\nright?\n\n322\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.298\nWe don't want any kind of\nbias involved in our testing.\n\n323\n00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:33.004\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's right, you go back\nto the CIO, go [SOUND], we're safe.\n\n324\n00:16:33.004 --> 00:16:33.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n325\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.750\nThat's not what this guy said.\n\n326\n00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.878\n&gt;&gt; I did a great job, don't you know?\n\n327\n00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:38.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, exactly.\n\n328\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.000\nSo a couple of the other things that\nI might wanna mention just about\n\n329\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.360\npen testing in general.\n\n330\n00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.850\nAgain, I don't know if they're\ngonna call it out on the exam.\n\n331\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.500\nBut I wanna talk about box testing, right?\n\n332\n00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.830\nYou'll hear terms, for instance,\nblack box, white box and gray.\n\n333\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.544\nLet's try this again, white box,\ngray box, black box testing.\n\n334\n00:16:57.544 --> 00:17:02.508\nWhite box testing is where the attacker\npretty much has all the information\n\n335\n00:17:02.508 --> 00:17:05.043\nabout the internal infrastructure.\n\n336\n00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:09.330\nThe components within the network, if\nyou will, its design and implementation.\n\n337\n00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:12.460\nGray box testing is where you have\nsome limits acknowledged, right, so\n\n338\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.350\nit's the medium, it's half way between,\nwell, white and black, if you will.\n\n339\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.897\nBlack box testing is one that basically\nthe person, or the company, or\n\n340\n00:17:19.897 --> 00:17:21.684\nthe entity have their blinders on.\n\n341\n00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:25.948\nThey have no foreknowledge of things like\nthe structure, the internal design and\n\n342\n00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:27.941\nthe implementation of this network.\n\n343\n00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:30.050\nAnd they're really trying\nto hit it from scratch.\n\n344\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.449\nAnd there's a few different reasons\nthat you might wanna do this.\n\n345\n00:17:32.449 --> 00:17:35.715\nBlack box testing might be because hackers\non the outside of your network most\n\n346\n00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:38.293\nhopefully aren't gonna know\nanything about your network.\n\n347\n00:17:38.293 --> 00:17:40.506\nAnd they're gonna try to find\nways to get into your network.\n\n348\n00:17:40.506 --> 00:17:43.407\nAnd you might wanna see from\nthe black box testing standpoint,\n\n349\n00:17:43.407 --> 00:17:45.210\nhow far would they get?\n\n350\n00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.445\nRight, or if I know a little bit of\ninformation about your network, right.\n\n351\n00:17:48.445 --> 00:17:52.133\nI've done some OS fingerprinting,\nright, we've run some NMAP scans,\n\n352\n00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:53.331\ndone some ping sweeps.\n\n353\n00:17:53.331 --> 00:17:55.963\nWe've got a little bit of\ninformation about maybe one or\n\n354\n00:17:55.963 --> 00:17:57.755\ntwo servers that are on your network.\n\n355\n00:17:57.755 --> 00:18:01.025\nWell then there again, I know a little\nbit more about the information.\n\n356\n00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:04.388\nVersus someone like Cherokee,\nlike you were mentioning,\n\n357\n00:18:04.388 --> 00:18:08.840\nwhere there might be a biased outcome,\nif you're a white box tester, right?\n\n358\n00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.880\nI work for the company, I know the ins and\nouts of the network, and\n\n359\n00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.910\nit might be ego based.\n\n360\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.630\nWhere if I was doing white box testing,\nI'd say, yeah, we're secure.\n\n361\n00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.910\nBut then you bring the black\nbox testing in and\n\n362\n00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.200\nthey completely just\nhack into the network.\n\n363\n00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.960\nAnd then you realize, well, maybe you\ngotta relook your risk assessment and\n\n364\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.730\nthen your security posture.\n\n365\n00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.260\n&gt;&gt; White box testing does\nhave its place though.\n\n366\n00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.530\nI mean, if you think I hire Wes to\npen test my network and I fail.\n\n367\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.771\nI fail miserably and\nWes is just mocking me.\n\n368\n00:18:36.771 --> 00:18:39.174\nBut he does give me a list of suggestions,\n\n369\n00:18:39.174 --> 00:18:42.068\nthings that I can do to\nhelp remediate my network.\n\n370\n00:18:42.068 --> 00:18:44.314\nAnd then now Wes already\nhas that prior knowledge.\n\n371\n00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:47.508\nSo when he comes back to see if\nI've implemented his suggestions,\n\n372\n00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:49.626\nthat could be considered\nwhite box as well.\n\n373\n00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:53.115\nSo you can see the effectiveness\nof the different situations there.\n\n374\n00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:56.897\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it definitely has its place,\nas much as I joke around about it,\n\n375\n00:18:56.897 --> 00:18:58.425\nit definitely has its place.\n\n376\n00:18:58.425 --> 00:19:02.353\nAgain, just like that, if you're trying\nto get, I need a professional opinion.\n\n377\n00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:04.244\nWell if you need a professional opinion,\n\n378\n00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:07.900\nchances are you're not probably gonna\nget a hacker that's gonna do black box.\n\n379\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.027\nAnd you could, I'm not saying you can't.\n\n380\n00:19:10.027 --> 00:19:13.166\nBut I might have somebody that comes in\nand I want them to know a little bit about\n\n381\n00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:15.936\nthe systems and something about\nthe systems that are on my network.\n\n382\n00:19:15.936 --> 00:19:20.136\nSo they can give me their professional\nopinion on things that I can do and\n\n383\n00:19:20.136 --> 00:19:24.201\nagain in adhering, or if I can say\nadhering to those best practices.\n\n384\n00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:27.389\nAnd that's one of the great things about\nhaving things like vendor web sites.\n\n385\n00:19:27.389 --> 00:19:30.857\nYou mentioned the piece of software like\nthe Baseline Security Analyzer that can\n\n386\n00:19:30.857 --> 00:19:31.833\nanalyze your server.\n\n387\n00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:35.930\nAnd say, okay, here's some things that\nwe've seen you probably need to change.\n\n388\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.480\nDo you realize you have\nan administrator in there that\n\n389\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.600\nhas a password that never expires?\n\n390\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.757\nOr do you realize you have four\nenterprise-level administrators?\n\n391\n00:19:44.757 --> 00:19:50.153\nOr just something like that where you\nneed to take some kind of action.\n\n392\n00:19:50.153 --> 00:19:53.357\nAnd, Cherokee, when that comes down to it,\nI know that we could talk a lot\n\n393\n00:19:53.357 --> 00:19:56.892\nmore about risk concepts, but I think\nthat's pretty much all I got for this one.\n\n394\n00:19:56.892 --> 00:19:58.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, sounds good to me, Wes.\n\n395\n00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.710\nThank you so much for joining us today.\n\n396\n00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.120\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen for joining, as well.\n\n397\n00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.930\nBut stay tuned,\nwe have some more Net+ headed your way.\n\n398\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.290\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n399\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.100\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n400\n00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.670\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n401\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:16.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n402\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.044\nThank you for watching ITPRoTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.933\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.180\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.564\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:20.698\nIn this episode, we get to talk about\nnetwork vulnerabilities and threats.\n\n7\n00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:22.722\nWe're gonna be looking at\nsome really cool stuff here.\n\n8\n00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:26.020\nAnd we have Mr.\nWes Bryan in studios to lead the way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.710\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.840\nThat's right, we were talking before\nwe started up the episode and\n\n12\n00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.620\nwe actually get in to the fun stuff cuz\nwe've been shooting a couple of episodes.\n\n13\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.650\nI know timeline probably don't mean\nmuch to you guys out there where it was\n\n14\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.140\na lot of the talk about policies,\nprocedures and standards.\n\n15\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.213\nAnd now we get to get into the fun stuff,\nas long as it doesn't happen to you.\n\n16\n00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.442\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] True story.\n\n17\n00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:48.397\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n18\n00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:51.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it is good to know these things and\n\n19\n00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.340\nbe aware of them.\n\n20\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.060\nAnd again, hopefully they\ndon't happen to your systems.\n\n21\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.318\nAnd what are we talking about?\n\n22\n00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:01.610\nWell, the various network vulnerabilities\nand threats, and again, CompTIA's official\n\n23\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.890\nobjective here, compare and contrast\ncommon network vulnerabilities and\n\n24\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240\nthreats and we're gonna look at some of\nthe attacks/threats that you might have to\n\n25\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.750\nworry about inside of your networks today.\n\n26\n00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.200\nAnd some of the first ones that\nthey call out is denial of service.\n\n27\n00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.840\nAll right?\nSo what is denial of service?\n\n28\n00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.870\nI walked over and I pulled the power cord,\nand now your building's off.\n\n29\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.340\nIt's denial of service.\n\n30\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.610\nNow, we can move on.\n\n31\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.190\nJust kidding.\nThey're more sophisticated than that, but\n\n32\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.540\na physical attack, a permanent DOS,\nthat can be something that, and\n\n33\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.410\nit is on the list.\n\n34\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.600\nThey call it out, a physical DOS, so\nI'll go ahead and take care of that one.\n\n35\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.390\nI don't have any diagrams for that one.\n\n36\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.450\nThat one can be as simple as walking\nto the roof of a data center and\n\n37\n00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.190\nover the major exhaust vents,\nthrowing a blanket over them and\n\n38\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.890\nthrowing a couple bricks on that blanket.\n\n39\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.750\nWell, remember,\nthose are exhaust ports, and\n\n40\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.280\nwhat is usually coming out of those\nports but, a lot of times, hot air.\n\n41\n00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.290\nAnd if we just throw a blanket over\nthe top of them, theoretically it could\n\n42\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.000\nend up reaping havoc in the data\ncenter and certainly putting\n\n43\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.390\na strain on the environmental controls and\nmonitors that are in that system.\n\n44\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.580\nSo you can do a physical attack like\nthat where you are attacking the power,\n\n45\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.260\nyou are attacking things like the, again,\nthe environment monitoring systems.\n\n46\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.640\nOr blocking off things\nlike your cooling systems,\n\n47\n00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.050\nobstructing airflow within\nthings like server closets.\n\n48\n00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.610\nAs simple as taking a workstation and\nsliding it all the way\n\n49\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.130\nback to the edge of a desk, so\nit overheats and ends up going offline.\n\n50\n00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.250\nSo very simplistic type of attack, but\nit is one that you have to worry about,\n\n51\n00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.140\nnonetheless.\n\n52\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.800\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a really great point, Wes,\nbecause when we think about denial of\n\n53\n00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.820\nservice, we can't really get boxed\nin a certain way of thinking.\n\n54\n00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.860\nWe really have to think\noutside of the box here,\n\n55\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.890\nbecause like you've mentioned before,\nthe CIA triad, right?\n\n56\n00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.100\nAvailability being one of those three\nfundamental staples of security,\n\n57\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.380\nso what cannot be accessible, and\nthat's what we have to think about.\n\n58\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.000\nIs it the electricity, or is it a server?\n\n59\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.440\nOr is it your like a web server or\nyour email server?\n\n60\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.160\nSo we have to think in that concept.\n\n61\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.740\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's a good point to bring up, too.\n\n62\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.470\nJust a simple,\nbasic service that isn't provided, right?\n\n63\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.220\nYou say, well what service aren't you,\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n64\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.050\nWell, I want you to think of your ISP.\n\n65\n00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.500\nAll right, well, don't think too much,\nbecause you probably have\n\n66\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.250\nbad images of your ISP, but just think\nabout your Internet connection, right.\n\n67\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.290\nIf somebody hits a transformer, again not\nwishing bad on anybody but it happens.\n\n68\n00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.250\nRain storm comes along,\n\n69\n00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.010\nsomebody knocks down a transformer, power\ngoes off, your ISP no longer has power to\n\n70\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.900\nthe building which means you don't\nhave any Internet connection.\n\n71\n00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.400\nThat in its simpler form\nis a denial of service.\n\n72\n00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.930\nWe have to focus on that\nservice part of it.\n\n73\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.300\nWhat service is being provided and\nthen again what is being denied.\n\n74\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's an accidental\ntype of situation, right?\n\n75\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.480\nBut what if there's\nsomething malicious Wes?\n\n76\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.290\nWhat if someone was trying to attack us?\n\n77\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.180\n&gt;&gt; And here's where we start to get\ninto the fun things like Cherokee was\n\n78\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.720\ntalking about.\n\n79\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.280\nAnd there are different kinds, okay?\n\n80\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.800\nOne of the common ones,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n81\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.010\nmention some of these as distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks because\n\n82\n00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.890\nthey do call out in the objectives.\n\n83\n00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.230\nThey call denial of service and\n\n84\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.610\nthen they talk about what's known\nas a distributed denial of service.\n\n85\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.530\nAnd let's talk about why we would use or\nwhat a distributed\n\n86\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.760\ndenial of service attack is before\nwe talk about the types of DDOS,\n\n87\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.490\nif I can even say the acronym here.\n\n88\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.430\nAll right, distributed all right, I want\nyou to understand that denial of service,\n\n89\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.760\nif you can match the bandwidth, let's say\nthe network adapter of a server that's\n\n90\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.360\nproviding let's say authentication,\nand I can hit that server with\n\n91\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.590\nhundreds if not hundreds of thousands\nof authentication requests,\n\n92\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.550\nwell that directory server, its whole\njob is to authenticate people, right?\n\n93\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.490\nSo it's gonna see those and\nit's gonna keep trying to authenticate.\n\n94\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.346\nBut eventually what's gonna happen is I'm\ngonna saturate that network adapter so\n\n95\n00:04:45.346 --> 00:04:47.879\nmuch that let's say Cherokee\nis an authorized user and\n\n96\n00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:50.649\nI'm an unauthorized user,\nI'll put my black hat on here.\n\n97\n00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:54.093\nAnd Cherokee is supposed to be on that\nsystem maybe she is the admin on that\n\n98\n00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.080\nsystem and now she can't authenticate.\n\n99\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.640\nNow that's a denial of service, but\n\n100\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.440\nI could essentially do that\nmaybe from a single computer.\n\n101\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.310\nNow what if you're a larger organization,\n\n102\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.150\nlet's say if you're in a larger\norganization like Google, right?\n\n103\n00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.370\nAnd it happened years ago.\n\n104\n00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.680\nI'm sure they've got many checks and\n\n105\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.060\nbalances in place today to\nkind of combat this, right?\n\n106\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.890\nBut if you're a massive company\nlike Google my little what one\n\n107\n00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.350\ngig at best network adapter's not gonna\ndo anything to their bandwidth, right?\n\n108\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.900\nThey have massive server farms.\n\n109\n00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.660\nSo how do I go about or\nhow would somebody, an attacker,\n\n110\n00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.780\ngo about attacking a company like\nthat that has a lot of bandwidth?\n\n111\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.203\nWell, they need more than one computer,\nall right?\n\n112\n00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:35.942\nWell more than one computer is where we\nstart talking about the distributed aspect\n\n113\n00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:37.910\nof a denial of service attack.\n\n114\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.620\nIf I can't meet your bandwidth, okay, and\n\n115\n00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.590\nexceed your ability to respond\nto the services, then I've\n\n116\n00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.540\ndone really nothing in my job as a hacker\ntrying to get a denial of service.\n\n117\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.520\nSo, need to basically kind of like we\ndo in NIC teaming and bonding right?\n\n118\n00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.380\nWe aggregate more than one adapter\ntogether to get more bandwidth.\n\n119\n00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.920\nWell, you take more than\none attack system and\n\n120\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.130\nyou aggregate them together collectively.\n\n121\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.480\nAnd then all of those machines, thousands,\ntens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,\n\n122\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.590\nsimultaneously attack a single target with\nthe intention of bringing it offline.\n\n123\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.760\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nwhen you talk about those botnets and\n\n124\n00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.400\nyou guys might hear several terms\nout there, zombie army, drone army.\n\n125\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.140\nIt's kinda funny when you thing\nabout them, but not funny.\n\n126\n00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.130\nAnd you've said we've got these computers\n\n127\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.120\nout there that are being basically\nthe minions, or the bots or\n\n128\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.280\nthe drones to be a part,\nsometimes unknowingly, of these attacks.\n\n129\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.580\nAll right, but\nnow we've got smart watches.\n\n130\n00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.710\nWe've got smart light bulbs, thermostats.\n\n131\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.810\nWe have all these devices.\n\n132\n00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.260\nAnd it's kind of like a treasure trove for\nthose attackers, right?\n\n133\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.440\nSo, what do we,\nclassify those types of attacks as?\n\n134\n00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.760\n&gt;&gt; Well I haven't really talked so\nmuch about the botnet yet.\n\n135\n00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.850\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's do that since you mentioned it.\n\n136\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.830\nWhen it comes to a botnet,\nwhat is a botnet?\n\n137\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.650\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I was just\nautomatically thinking in my mindset,\n\n138\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.050\nI'm like, it's such a big thing nowadays.\n\n139\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.030\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, well, and if you think\nabout it, we already think about it.\n\n140\n00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.120\nWe already kinda know the term.\n\n141\n00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.590\nIf I've got a collection of computer\nthat have been grouped together and\n\n142\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.160\npeople don't know about it,\nthat's what it is.\n\n143\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.300\nIt's a botnet.\n\n144\n00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.000\nKind of finishing the concept\nin our minds here.\n\n145\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.680\nWith a botnet,\nCherokee also mentioned zombies, right.\n\n146\n00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.770\nYou basically have a piece of software\nthat an attacker tries to distribute.\n\n147\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.770\nThey're different avenues.\n\n148\n00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.080\nTrojan horses, if you will.\n\n149\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.890\nEmail, spam, attachments in email but\n\n150\n00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.930\nif they can get that software onto their\ncomputer and do some kind of remote\n\n151\n00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.990\nexploitation then what they can do is\ntake remote control of that computer and\n\n152\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.220\ndo that by tens of thousands of computers\nand then they can issue some kind of\n\n153\n00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.740\ncommand that tells all of those\ncomputers to attack a single target.\n\n154\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.600\nSo that's called a botnet, in fact,\nI'll give you kind of an example of it.\n\n155\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.880\nSo you know I've got\na little diagram here right?\n\n156\n00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.990\nSo we've got a hacker come lately here,\nand\n\n157\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.870\nof course-\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n158\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.995\n&gt;&gt; They're a bad guy because they've\ngot glasses and a beanie on.\n\n159\n00:07:52.995 --> 00:07:55.442\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No offense, I wear glasses too guys.\n\n160\n00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:57.598\nIf you wear a beanie out there,\nit doesn't mean you're a hacker.\n\n161\n00:07:57.598 --> 00:07:58.613\nBut it means you.\n\n162\n00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.149\nYou got a good start.\n\n163\n00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:02.517\nWe've got a piece of software, right?\n\n164\n00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:05.696\nAnd it's distributed to all\nthese different computers.\n\n165\n00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:09.783\nNow, these computers can be called drones,\nor more commonly, like Cherokee said,\n\n166\n00:08:09.783 --> 00:08:10.320\nzombies.\n\n167\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.560\nAnd why are they called zombies?\n\n168\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.449\nBecause they're not being controlled\nby their own will anymore,\n\n169\n00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:17.916\nthey're gonna be controlled by, for\ninstance, this end user, or attacker-\n\n170\n00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:19.462\n&gt;&gt; A virus in the brain.\n\n171\n00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:22.480\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and then there's going\nto be some kind of trigger point.\n\n172\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.190\nSo you could see things like,\nfor instance,\n\n173\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.120\ntechnology that's called logic bombs and\nbotnets that work hand in hand.\n\n174\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.070\nThey wait for a little awhile, they don't\ndo anything because we wanna propagate\n\n175\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.100\nthat malware to multiple computers.\n\n176\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.140\nAnd then they trigger at one\ntime attacking that endpoint.\n\n177\n00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.630\nThat is the type of botnet, right?\n\n178\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.400\nBut we also have other types of attacks\nas well, like we got for instance,\n\n179\n00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.820\ncoordinated attacks.\n\n180\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.920\nNow coordinated attacks\nare a little bit different.\n\n181\n00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.030\nBotnets, don't get me wrong,\nthey gotta be coordinated.\n\n182\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.770\nBut you could have them where\nthey're coordinated and\n\n183\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.220\nthe attackers are multiple people.\n\n184\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.770\nMultiple locations, right?\n\n185\n00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.600\nWe've got more than one person.\n\n186\n00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.790\nAnd even in botnets, you could\nhave a team of people doing this.\n\n187\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.235\nBut the computers, themselves,\naren't controlled by that team.\n\n188\n00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:08.010\nLet's say, for instance,\nby them sitting in front of them, right?\n\n189\n00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.360\nIt's an exploitation.\n\n190\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.690\nThe coordinated attack could be,\nquite literally,\n\n191\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.380\nmultiple people at their computers with\nknowledge beforehand that they're going to\n\n192\n00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.980\nattack a single target as.\n\n193\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.710\nSo that would be an example\nof the coordinated attack.\n\n194\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.320\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe're not talking about sci-fi movies.\n\n195\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.910\nThis is legit groups and\norganizations out there.\n\n196\n00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.859\nAnd sometimes,\nyou even hear that term like a hack.\n\n197\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.040\nIs it hacktivist?\n\n198\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.550\nYeah, because they're trying to\nattach a moral aspect to it.\n\n199\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.486\nTo kind of, I guess,\nmake them sleep better at night.\n\n200\n00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:35.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n201\n00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:35.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n202\n00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.760\nyou also mentioned a great term.\n\n203\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.130\nJust the fact that we've got\nthings like smartwatches.\n\n204\n00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.260\nAnd one that I know you were\nleading into was IoT, right?\n\n205\n00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure, exactly.\n\n206\n00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Internet of Things.\n\n207\n00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.322\nWe had a major DynDNS, dynamic DNS,\n\n208\n00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:51.240\ndenial-of-service that happened at the-\n&gt;&gt; Last October.\n\n209\n00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.380\n&gt;&gt; Was it, yeah, thank you.\n\n210\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.850\nI'm glad she can remember the dates,\n\n211\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.100\nI can't remember yesterday, so-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n212\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.680\nI think it was the 21st, I don't know.\n\n213\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.085\nI could be wrong, but I think something-\n&gt;&gt; So it hasn't been that long.\n\n214\n00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:00.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was such a huge event,\n\n215\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.760\nand it was really the first time that\nthis type of attack was brought to light.\n\n216\n00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.650\nWe see that was the Mirai\nsource code that was exploited,\n\n217\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.100\nand most of those IoT\ndevices use that source code.\n\n218\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.210\n&gt;&gt; They did, and most people didn't\neven know anything about it.\n\n219\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.080\nAnd they didn't have a lot\nof security to begin with so\n\n220\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.820\nthey were prime targets\nof being taken over.\n\n221\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.500\nAnd again, using all of these\ndevices to attack a single location.\n\n222\n00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.870\nIn this case,\nthey were attacking the DNS system.\n\n223\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.405\nWhich we'll talk about coming up here\nbecause that is one of the type of\n\n224\n00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:30.740\ndenial-of-service attacks\nthat we wanna talk about.\n\n225\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.795\nNow the other one that they mention\nhere too with your distributed\n\n226\n00:10:33.795 --> 00:10:36.820\ndenial-of-service attacks,\nthey talk about traffic spikes.\n\n227\n00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.709\nThat's really the ultimate goal, right?\n\n228\n00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:40.485\nIf you're gonna deny somebody a service,\n\n229\n00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:43.510\nit means you need to oversaturate\nthat service that's being provided.\n\n230\n00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.510\nAnd really the only way you can do that is\na spike of traffic going into the network\n\n231\n00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.550\nadapter or multiple network adapters for\nmultiple systems.\n\n232\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's not like that more and\n\n233\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.170\nmore people are buying these IOT devices,\nright?\n\n234\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.655\nAnd we saw, like you had mentioned, DynDNS\nis a big provider that offered that DNS\n\n235\n00:10:59.655 --> 00:11:02.195\nservice to a lot of\ndifferent organizations.\n\n236\n00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:05.740\nAnd it wasn't like they were\njust attacking Cherokee or Wes.\n\n237\n00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.729\nIt literally brought down a large\nportion of the entire East Coast for\n\n238\n00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:12.838\nthat particular attack and\nthe majority of a Friday.\n\n239\n00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.193\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you see the heat maps\nwhere they talk about the threat\n\n240\n00:11:15.193 --> 00:11:16.067\nindicators, right?\n\n241\n00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:19.886\nI think it was the entire eastern\nseaboard, northeastern seaboard,\n\n242\n00:11:19.886 --> 00:11:21.450\neven into Canada it was red.\n\n243\n00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.050\nAnd it had nothing to do\nwith actually being hot.\n\n244\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.860\nIt just happened to be that\nthey were under the attack.\n\n245\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.940\nNow, speaking of DNS,\n\n246\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.610\nbecause that was one of the things\nthat Iot DNS coordinated attack,\n\n247\n00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.940\nif you will, distributed denial-of-service\nattack, a few months ago that happened.\n\n248\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.520\nThey were effecting things like DNS.\n\n249\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.210\nNow, when we look at DNS based attacks,\n\n250\n00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.720\nthere's multiple distributed\ndenial-of-service attacks and really,\n\n251\n00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.570\nwhat it does is it's really\nhindering around UDP, okay?\n\n252\n00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.120\nCuz UDP is a connectionless service,\nright?\n\n253\n00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.260\nAnd I throw traffic out there and I don't\nreally care if I get a response, right?\n\n254\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.840\nIt's not like transmission control\nprotocol where I say to the endpoint,\n\n255\n00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.530\nI say, hey Cherokee.\n\n256\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.280\nOr in this case network adapters, hey,\nI need a connection-oriented service.\n\n257\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.080\nBoth of our network adapters communicate.\n\n258\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.280\nWe establish the parameters\nof the communication and\n\n259\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.160\nthen we start transmitting data.\n\n260\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.880\nUDP on the hand, just throws it on\nthe wire says hey, if it gets there,\n\n261\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.400\nit gets there.\n\n262\n00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.920\nAt best, it might have a little check some\nbut it does nothing to call back home.\n\n263\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.160\nSo if I can send multiple\nUDP type packets in,\n\n264\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.650\nwhere I don't care if there's a response.\n\n265\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.620\nIn fact,\nI really don't want the response back.\n\n266\n00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.130\nThen they'd make some very, very good\navenues for denial-of-service attacks.\n\n267\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.780\nLet me give you an example\nof a DNS attack.\n\n268\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.990\nLet's start real quick about\nwhat's going on with DNS, right?\n\n269\n00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.500\nWhen it comes to DNS, right,\nwe have basic UDP DNS queries, right?\n\n270\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.820\nGoing back to our protocols\nthat we talked about, right?\n\n271\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.725\nUDP or DNS can go over two\ndifferent protocol types, right?\n\n272\n00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:50.086\nCan be connection-oriented,\ntypically when DNS servers are talking,\n\n273\n00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:53.844\nwe don't want that information corrupted\nso they establish a connection state.\n\n274\n00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:58.426\nWhen I ask you, I got www.google.com\nwith the DNS server, where's the IP?\n\n275\n00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:00.790\nThat goes over UDP, all right.\n\n276\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.253\nAnd if I'm using a server,\nlet's say for instance,\n\n277\n00:13:03.253 --> 00:13:04.906\nI'm using a recursive DNS server.\n\n278\n00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:08.561\nThen what's happening is the DNS\nserver isn't storing at first,\n\n279\n00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:11.700\nit's not storing those results on itself,\nright?\n\n280\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.570\nSo what it does is basically it\ndoes a non-authoritative look,\n\n281\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.705\nwhich means it doesn't own the records and\nit asks somebody else for the answer.\n\n282\n00:13:18.705 --> 00:13:21.155\nSo for instance,\nwe've got a couple of users here.\n\n283\n00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:23.185\nThe first lady,\nshe looks up Google.com, right?\n\n284\n00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:27.823\nThe non-authoritative server, again, the\none that's not in control of Google.com\n\n285\n00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:32.083\nsays, yeah, let me go through my process\nof recursion in the DNS hierarchy and\n\n286\n00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.890\nI'll talk to Google.\n\n287\n00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.460\nAnd Google's authoritative server\nwill give back her answer.\n\n288\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.121\nSame thing goes with Microsoft,\nthis gentleman looks up www.microsoft.com,\n\n289\n00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.342\nneeds to find the IP.\n\n290\n00:13:43.342 --> 00:13:47.950\nThis server doesn't have that answer, goes\nout, goes through the recursive process.\n\n291\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.066\nTalks to Microsoft's authoritative DNS\nserver, responds back to this one.\n\n292\n00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:57.295\nLikewise, oops,\nrandom arrow in the Facebook query there.\n\n293\n00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.990\n[LAUGH] Next one, this young kid.\n\n294\n00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.190\nObviously, young kids's\ngonna be on Facebook, right?\n\n295\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.616\nSo ask for Facebook www.facebook.com.\n\n296\n00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:10.032\nThis server doesn't own the Facebook\ndomain, it's not authoritative.\n\n297\n00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:12.831\nSays, okay, well,\nlet me go talk to Facebook.\n\n298\n00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:14.712\nSo this is the normal process, right?\n\n299\n00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:17.160\nAnd then what happens to these answers?\n\n300\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.750\nWell, these answers now\nwill all get cached, right?\n\n301\n00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.090\nEvery DNS server,\neven your local DNS client,\n\n302\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.440\nwill cache a name that's been resolved.\n\n303\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.820\nWell, here's where the attack comes in.\n\n304\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.494\nWhen we talk about distributed\ndenial-of-service attack for DNS,\n\n305\n00:14:31.494 --> 00:14:32.121\nall right?\n\n306\n00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:34.348\nSo notice that those\nnon-authoritative answers,\n\n307\n00:14:34.348 --> 00:14:37.550\nthey all get stored in a little\ndatabase that's on this server.\n\n308\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.710\nAnd again,\nremember it speeds up name resolution.\n\n309\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.590\nNext time, I don't have to ask Google,\nI don't have to ask Microsoft, and\n\n310\n00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.560\nI certainly don't have to ask Facebook.\n\n311\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.000\nCuz now I have that\ninformation on the server.\n\n312\n00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.750\nWell, what if the hacker decides\nthat they get in there, right?\n\n313\n00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.130\nAnd they attack\nthe recursive DNS server and\n\n314\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.590\nthey put their bogus entries in there,\nall right?\n\n315\n00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.270\nOnce that happens,\nnow we've got some DNS poisoning going on.\n\n316\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:08.173\nAnd what can end up happening is,\nevery time these people ask for some,\n\n317\n00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.963\nfor instance, www.microsoft.com.\n\n318\n00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:17.900\nIt leads to an IP address that actually\ngoes to www.youjustgothacked.com, right?\n\n319\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.980\nAnd it's now maybe collecting\nyour information, right?\n\n320\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.698\nSo essentially that distributed\ndenial-of-service attack is how can we\n\n321\n00:15:24.698 --> 00:15:25.646\npoison the cache?\n\n322\n00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:28.740\nAnd now the authoritative service\naren't even involved, right?\n\n323\n00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.760\nCuz they never get asked the question.\n\n324\n00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.660\nRemember, if I ask you a question for\n\n325\n00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.162\na DNS query as a server and\nyou've got is stored locally.\n\n326\n00:15:35.162 --> 00:15:38.366\nYou're gonna give that\nanswer to me locally and\n\n327\n00:15:38.366 --> 00:15:41.020\nyou'll never ask the outside source.\n\n328\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:46.082\nSo if I can poison those responses,\nthen I can, essentially,\n\n329\n00:15:46.082 --> 00:15:51.638\nevery time you type out www.google.com,\nwww.microsoft.com.\n\n330\n00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:55.521\nI can map them to IP addresses of\nservers that I own as the attacker And\n\n331\n00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.315\nnow, I can pretty much\nlead you anywhere I want,\n\n332\n00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:02.350\nand perform whatever additional\nattacks we might need to.\n\n333\n00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Talk about getting a bang for\nyour buck here, Wes.\n\n334\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.080\nThis is really, I mean,\nif you think about an attacker and\n\n335\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.060\ntheir mindset why would they\ngo after Cherokee or Wesley?\n\n336\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.520\nWhat do they have that I want?\n\n337\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.820\nWhen I can go after this particular DNS\nsystem and have access to all sorts, and\n\n338\n00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.350\npush people onto whatever\nwebsite I want them to.\n\n339\n00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.383\nAnd even just last weekend we saw\nanother large DNS provider attack.\n\n340\n00:16:23.383 --> 00:16:26.260\nIt was a different style attack,\nwith memory buffer overflows there.\n\n341\n00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.628\nBut I have a feeling that\nthis is the trial and\n\n342\n00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:31.150\nthis is what we'll be seeing more often.\n\n343\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely and\nthat's another one they don't call it out.\n\n344\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.230\nSo I'm glad you kind of mentioned that.\n\n345\n00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.740\nThat's another type of denial of service\nattack it's a buffer overflow, right?\n\n346\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.690\nAnd even though they don't mention it\nhere, like I said, thanks for mentioning.\n\n347\n00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.370\nI think it will be of benefit to you guys,\nright?\n\n348\n00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.230\nICMP Internet Control Message Protocol,\nright?\n\n349\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.622\nWhat it's supposed to do is,\n\n350\n00:16:47.622 --> 00:16:51.201\nif I'm sending information into\nCherokee's computer and it's too fast.\n\n351\n00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:56.496\nThe network adapter over ICMP's gonna send\nback to my computer, hold on a second.\n\n352\n00:16:56.496 --> 00:17:00.955\nBuffers about 75% full if you don't slow\ndown, I'm gonna start dropping packets.\n\n353\n00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:02.755\nI can't process them fast enough.\n\n354\n00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:06.505\nWell, with a buffer overflow if you will.\n\n355\n00:17:06.505 --> 00:17:07.535\nWell, there's a couple of goals.\n\n356\n00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:09.575\nOne of the goals could\nbe just set you can't,\n\n357\n00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:11.845\nnow her computer can't respond\nto legitimate requests.\n\n358\n00:17:11.845 --> 00:17:12.367\nBecause I say, you know what?\n\n359\n00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:14.665\nI don't care about that 75% buffer,\nwhatever.\n\n360\n00:17:14.665 --> 00:17:16.980\nI'm just gonna keep\nsending information and\n\n361\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.090\nthen her computer can't respond to\nother legitimate traffic, right?\n\n362\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.920\nWorse case scenario, buffer overflow,\n\n363\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.640\nactually spills information over\nunchecked portions of memory and\n\n364\n00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.320\nthen that code can execute and\nthen now you got a zombie, right?\n\n365\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.750\nNow you're part of a botnet.\n\n366\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.120\nSo you have definitely have\nto worry about that as well.\n\n367\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.330\nThey call out a couple more,\nthey call out NTP.\n\n368\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.060\nAgain, NTP,\n\n369\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.795\nthe Network Time Protocol this is how our\ncomputers do time synchronization and\n\n370\n00:17:43.795 --> 00:17:48.330\nthere's different stratum layers\ndepending on how precise you need.\n\n371\n00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.920\nThe top of the hierarchy\n\n372\n00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.715\nI think that stratum is zero I\ncan't remember how the numbers are.\n\n373\n00:17:53.715 --> 00:17:56.005\nI think it's stratum zero is the top.\n\n374\n00:17:56.005 --> 00:17:58.715\nThey're the atomic clocks,\nthe US Naval Observatory.\n\n375\n00:17:58.715 --> 00:18:02.385\nAnd then they work their way down in\nlayers, right down to like for instance,\n\n376\n00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:03.135\nyour local ISP.\n\n377\n00:18:03.135 --> 00:18:07.195\nLet me give you an example your Windows\nservers, your Windows machines.\n\n378\n00:18:07.195 --> 00:18:09.115\nEvery time they boot up,\nif they've got internet connection,\n\n379\n00:18:09.115 --> 00:18:11.515\nwell if they've got internet connection or\nnot, they still try to do this.\n\n380\n00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:15.710\nThey try to resolve time.windows.com and\nthen if they can connect to it,\n\n381\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.660\nthey synchronize their clocks.\n\n382\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.660\nWell, synchronization is very important\nin all types of communications.\n\n383\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.800\nI'll give you another example.\n\n384\n00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.100\nInside an active directory domain\nyou used Kerberos or Kerberos,\n\n385\n00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.650\nhowever you want to say that, for the\nauthentication and it's time sensitive.\n\n386\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.740\nIf your computer buries five\nminutes from the domain controller.\n\n387\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.122\nYou get kicked off of the domain and\n\n388\n00:18:35.122 --> 00:18:37.268\nyou don't have access to your information,\nright.\n\n389\n00:18:37.268 --> 00:18:39.290\nYou don't have access, you can't log.\n\n390\n00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.615\nIn fact, your computer can't even\nlog into the domain anymore.\n\n391\n00:18:41.615 --> 00:18:43.800\nDenial-of-service, right.\n\n392\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.170\nAll over a time variance.\n\n393\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:51.140\nSo if my computer calls out with the UDP,\nrequest to an NTP server and\n\n394\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.160\nI don't get a request,\nit could cause problems as well.\n\n395\n00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.630\nYou're probably starting\nto notice something.\n\n396\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.130\nUDP?\nIt can be bad [LAUGH] it\n\n397\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.810\nmight be something that you wanna.\n\n398\n00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.320\nWell, you can't really stay away\nfrom it cuz you do need it.\n\n399\n00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.430\nNow these are all falling\nunder what is known\n\n400\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.860\nas reflective or amplified DNS attacks.\n\n401\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.310\nLet me give you an example\nof a smurfing attack.\n\n402\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.510\nThat's a form of reflective attack so\nI got an example here on my screen and\n\n403\n00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.008\nyou can see that I want you to think about\nwhat happens when we do a ping, right.\n\n404\n00:19:21.008 --> 00:19:24.720\nWhen we do a ping, we're sending an ICMP\necho request message to a single endpoint.\n\n405\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.140\nAnd we're hoping that we get a reply back,\nright now, for security purposes for\n\n406\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.045\nsomething like this.\n\n407\n00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:33.865\nMaybe ICP isn't turned on, all right?\n\n408\n00:19:33.865 --> 00:19:37.650\nNow, what if I could send a spoof?\n\n409\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.845\nWhat does spoofing mean?\n\n410\n00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:43.085\nSpoofing is basically pretending\nto be somebody you're not, right?\n\n411\n00:19:43.085 --> 00:19:47.090\nIt could be a MAC address, it could be\nan IP address that you're spoofing.\n\n412\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:52.228\nBut what if I spoof an IP address that\nsays all right this server is sending\n\n413\n00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:57.451\nan IC and P echo request message but\nnot to a single end point like we use with\n\n414\n00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:02.359\nPing or Trace RT or Trace Route if\nyou're in the Linux world, right.\n\n415\n00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:06.559\nWhat if we say we're gonna send the ping\nout to the broadcast address and\n\n416\n00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:12.180\nthere's 1,000 computers on that\nnetwork listening what's gonna happen?\n\n417\n00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.290\nWell if you notice, every one of those\ncomputers on that network is gonna do\n\n418\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.170\nan ICMP Echo Reply back\nto a single target.\n\n419\n00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.550\nAnd if I can have enough of\nthose ICMP Echo Requests,\n\n420\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.570\nI can bring that target offline.\n\n421\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.300\nNow that's the reflective point, right,\n\n422\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.330\nbecause I made it look like\nI'm this target, right?\n\n423\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.510\nThe victim all right, I send it,\nI spoof the IP address.\n\n424\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.930\nIt makes it look like the victim was the\none that told everybody on the network,\n\n425\n00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.020\nrespond to me right now.\n\n426\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.798\n&gt;&gt; Poor guy.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n427\n00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:41.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's the reflective attack.\n\n428\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.180\nNow, there's also an amplified attack.\n\n429\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.550\nAnd let's be careful,\nbecause they're not the same, all right?\n\n430\n00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.410\nIn these UDP responses,\n\n431\n00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.080\nusually when you send some kind\nof like an IC ICMP Echo Request.\n\n432\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.580\nYou're sending a little\nbit of information and\n\n433\n00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.410\nyou're expecting a little\nbit of information back.\n\n434\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.836\nAll right, But you can do something\nwith MTP, where you ask and\n\n435\n00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:09.130\nrequest MTP to give you a list of the last\n600 servers that it interacted with.\n\n436\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.818\nAnd can you imagine if you did that?\n\n437\n00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:13.152\nTimes 10,000.\n\n438\n00:21:13.152 --> 00:21:17.340\nNow you're asking that server to give\nback a lot more information than what\n\n439\n00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.270\nreally should just be a little\nbit of information, right?\n\n440\n00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.660\nIt's an amplified attack.\n\n441\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.590\nAll right, and this would be considered\na form of a smurfing attack, if you will.\n\n442\n00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.000\nAll right, so, we've talked about that.\n\n443\n00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.440\nWe've talked about things\nlike our physical DNS.\n\n444\n00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.770\nYou mentioned the unintentional DNS,\n\n445\n00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.970\nsomebody accidentally\nruns into the power line.\n\n446\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.081\nThey're not meaning to do it, but it's\nstill a form of denial of service attack.\n\n447\n00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:43.560\n&gt;&gt; I actually experienced\none the other night.\n\n448\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.370\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know this isn't\n\n449\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.710\nonline shoppers anonymous, but\nthere was a really great sale, and\n\n450\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.915\nI mentioned this on another show,\nbut it was nike.com.\n\n451\n00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:57.400\nAnd certain sites and brands,\nyou don't see a good sales too often.\n\n452\n00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.110\nSo, you got to hop on top of that.\n\n453\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.600\nAnd, I think, everyone has the same idea.\n\n454\n00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.790\nAnd it literally brought that server data.\n\n455\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.900\nI don't think they expected\nthat much traffic and\n\n456\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.085\nthat would be a firm denial of service.\n\n457\n00:22:08.085 --> 00:22:08.651\n&gt;&gt; It will, and\n\n458\n00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:12.107\nthat's one of the reasons we have things\nlike elasticity of the cloud, right?\n\n459\n00:22:12.107 --> 00:22:12.943\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n460\n00:22:12.943 --> 00:22:15.381\nwe could scale out really quick if we can,\nobviously they didn't.\n\n461\n00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:17.284\n&gt;&gt; Maybe we should tell them about it,\nyeah [LAUGH].\n\n462\n00:22:17.284 --> 00:22:19.537\n&gt;&gt; We should probably call Nike after\nthis episode is over and tell them,\n\n463\n00:22:19.537 --> 00:22:21.265\nyou guys really gotta use the cloud,\nman we heard it.\n\n464\n00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:23.880\nIt's really good, all kidding aside there.\n\n465\n00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.790\nWe do have a couple of other terms\nlike that I want to talk about.\n\n466\n00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.719\nOne of the ones that they mention is\nan ARP cache poisoning attack most of\n\n467\n00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:34.939\nthe attacks up till now,\nI haven't been able to say this.\n\n468\n00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:39.045\nBut an ARP cache poisoning attack is one\nthat's typically done on your land as\n\n469\n00:22:39.045 --> 00:22:43.160\na land-based attack I will mention\nsomething with the smurfing attacks.\n\n470\n00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.235\nThe reason they have to get\na little more tricky is,\n\n471\n00:22:45.235 --> 00:22:47.030\na smurfing attack can be easily countered.\n\n472\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:51.732\nBecause on the external interface, coming\ninto your network, a router can say,\n\n473\n00:22:51.732 --> 00:22:55.190\nokay, I see MP traffic, and\nthere's an excess of it.\n\n474\n00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.650\nIt's not important,\njust block it, just drop it.\n\n475\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.303\nIt's not so easy when it's\nthings like simflood attacks,\n\n476\n00:23:02.303 --> 00:23:06.729\nthrough TCP handshakes, when it's\nUDP floods like MTP time requests.\n\n477\n00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:09.745\nBecause the router is gonna look at that,\nit's gonna say\n\n478\n00:23:09.745 --> 00:23:13.490\nthat's legitimate information so\nI do want you to keep that in mind.\n\n479\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I did have one question\nabout that smurf attack.\n\n480\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.440\nWhen you mentioned the tens\nof thousands of end users or\n\n481\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.450\neven just a couple thousand.\n\n482\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.160\nAnd I cause physical\ndestruction to that machine,\n\n483\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.310\nwould that be considered a permanent DoS?\n\n484\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.280\n&gt;&gt; It very well could be,\nit very well could be.\n\n485\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.820\nIf you've for whatever reason, you ramp\nup the CPU cycles on it causes it to\n\n486\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.950\noverheat, hard drive failure for sure.\n\n487\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.910\nOne of the things that I think about,\n\n488\n00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:43.180\npermanent DOS is physical\ndestruction of the building.\n\n489\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.623\nCould be one of those as ones as well.\n\n490\n00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:46.282\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah,\n\n491\n00:23:46.282 --> 00:23:49.294\nkeep that in mind that when they say\npermanent DOS they're not kidding.\n\n492\n00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:51.791\nThey mean lights go out,\nlights don't come back on.\n\n493\n00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:54.255\nUsually in that case.\n\n494\n00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:57.732\nNow I did mention that I want to talk\na little bit about what is something on\n\n495\n00:23:57.732 --> 00:23:59.890\n[INAUDIBLE] an ARP cache poisoning attack.\n\n496\n00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.530\nAnd when this comes down to it, this is\nreally spoofing like I was telling you.\n\n497\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:08.124\nA couple of things, spoofing, where the\nhacker's pretending to be there somebody\n\n498\n00:24:08.124 --> 00:24:11.632\nthey're not for the purposes\nof redirecting communications.\n\n499\n00:24:11.632 --> 00:24:13.840\nLet's go ahead and\nI've got a little diagram here.\n\n500\n00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.290\nLet's kinda look at the normal process\nthat would happen with ARP, right?\n\n501\n00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.130\nNow IP, we've talked about IP.\n\n502\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.541\nIP doesn't really know\nanything about a Mac address.\n\n503\n00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:25.485\nSo what happens is when I have an IP\naddress and I need to resolve it to\n\n504\n00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:28.169\nthe physical location of that\ncomputer within the network,\n\n505\n00:24:28.169 --> 00:24:30.871\nthat's where we use address\nresolution protocol, right?\n\n506\n00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:35.610\nIt sits in a funky state somewhere\nbetween layer 3 and layer 2.\n\n507\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.360\nRight?\nSo IP says, ARP help me out here,\n\n508\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.960\nwhat's the Mac address?\n\n509\n00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:47.186\nAnd then ARP sends the local broadcast a\nmessage that says hey who has 10.10.10.10?\n\n510\n00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:48.126\nRight?\n\n511\n00:24:48.126 --> 00:24:51.330\nNow remember since it's\na broadcast communication,\n\n512\n00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.920\nthat means that all of these computers\nare going to hear it, right?\n\n513\n00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.320\nBut only the computer that has that\nIP address is gonna respond, and\n\n514\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.620\nthen there's some ARP reply message,\nright?\n\n515\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.830\nSo this computer that has 10.10.10.10\nsays yeah, that IP address\n\n516\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:11.150\nis at this MAC address, and\nsends that back to the broadcast, right.\n\n517\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:16.080\nNow the next thing that happens is my\ncomputer is gonna take that reply message\n\n518\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.190\nwith that mapping of an IP\naddress to a MAC address, and\n\n519\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.810\nit's going to cash it locally.\n\n520\n00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:25.460\nNow, I don't have to do a broadcast\nto try to resolve that name anymore,\n\n521\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:26.270\nkinda like DNS.\n\n522\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.680\nI can look locally, and it helps with\nthe resolution process, that mapping,\n\n523\n00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.130\nIP to MAC.\n\n524\n00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.494\nNow, what happens if an attacker,\non the other hand,\n\n525\n00:25:34.494 --> 00:25:37.284\ndecides to get in\nthe middle of this message?\n\n526\n00:25:37.284 --> 00:25:40.310\nAll right, same process goes on, right?\n\n527\n00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:45.760\nWe got an ARP request who has\n10.10.10.10 goes to the local broadcast.\n\n528\n00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.467\nThis time hacker come lately\nis on your network and and\n\n529\n00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:53.922\ninstead of 10.10.10.10,\n\n530\n00:25:53.922 --> 00:25:58.943\nactually being able to call\nthe hacker replies and says,\n\n531\n00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:04.280\nhey, 10.10.10.10 is at my Mac address.\n\n532\n00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.250\nThe hacker's machine.\n\n533\n00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.490\nSo what does my computer do is part of\nstep three, the normal ARP process.\n\n534\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:14.170\nIt says okay, well thanks for that\ninformation, let me go ahead and cache it.\n\n535\n00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.670\nAnd now we get bogus\ninformation in the ARP cache.\n\n536\n00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:18.610\nSo now what happens?\n\n537\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.956\nThe attacker, can now redirect\nbecause of that every time\n\n538\n00:26:21.956 --> 00:26:26.258\nthis computer unexpectedly, unexpectedly\nif I could say that make our own\n\n539\n00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:29.550\ncontribution to the English language here,\nthank you.\n\n540\n00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:35.860\n[LAUGH] Anytime it’s sending the 10.10\n10.10 10.10 which should be this computer.\n\n541\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.950\nNow because of that entry\nthat’s inside the ARP cache.\n\n542\n00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.640\nIt's mapping it to this hacker's computer.\n\n543\n00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.240\nAnd they can redirect traffic\nto the locations that they need.\n\n544\n00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:45.880\n&gt;&gt; So that's what?\n\n545\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.520\nARP poisoning?\n\n546\n00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.990\n&gt;&gt; That's the ARP cache poisoning,\nabsolutely.\n\n547\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.190\nNow Cherokee, I'm looking, and\n\n548\n00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:53.180\nit looks like we do have some\nadditional content here but\n\n549\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.840\nthis is gonna be another one of those\ntimes where I think I talk way too much.\n\n550\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.830\n&gt;&gt; It's alright, Wes.\n\n551\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.470\nI think all of these topics,\nit can happen to anyone.\n\n552\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.630\nIt's something that's pretty exciting,\npretty fun.\n\n553\n00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.890\nI mean.\nWe got through denial of service,\n\n554\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.690\ntypes of attacks.\n\n555\n00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.770\nAnd then we started talking about ARP.\n\n556\n00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:08.720\nBut, that's okay.\n\n557\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and\npick this right back up with a part two.\n\n558\n00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.270\nSo ladies and gentleman, stay tuned,\nwe have more NET+ headed your way.\n\n559\n00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.540\nBut we'll go ahead and sign off for now.\n\n560\n00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.170\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n561\n00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:19.870\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n562\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.053\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n563\n00:27:23.053 --> 00:27:29.029\n[MUSIC]\n\n564\n00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:31.956\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.941\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.714\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.010\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.820\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nknow that this is actually a part two\n\n7\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.020\nwhere we were exploring\nvulnerabilities and threats.\n\n8\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.260\nThis is a pretty interesting topic,\nand who better to explain it than Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.360\nWes Bryan himself.\n\n10\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.660\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.090\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.960\nIt's great to be with ITProTV,\nthat's right,\n\n13\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.460\nit looks like I talked quite\na bit in the first one.\n\n14\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.710\nAnd we've still got a bunch of stuff to\nget through which could be a good thing,\n\n15\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.820\ncould also be a scary thing just given\nthe topic that we're talking about.\n\n16\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.234\nVulnerability and threats well,\nyou got a bunch of them out there, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:46.800\nyou'll definitely have\nto be aware of them.\n\n18\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.691\nAnd it's good to be aware of these things,\n\n19\n00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.956\nnot only from the certification\nexam standpoint.\n\n20\n00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:53.858\nBut also as you make your way\ninto your networking career.\n\n21\n00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:57.164\nIf this is the very first networking\ncertification that you've taken.\n\n22\n00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:59.835\nIt is a good thing to be\nable to identify those, so\n\n23\n00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.060\nwe are going to pick up where we left off.\n\n24\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.014\nAnd in the first episode, we talked\na little bit about some different DoS\n\n25\n00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:06.815\nattacks, denial-of-service attacks.\n\n26\n00:01:06.815 --> 00:01:10.050\nAnd, more specifically,\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks.\n\n27\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.210\nKeep in mind the differences,\ndenial-of-service attack is typically\n\n28\n00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.158\na single attacker and a single target,\nor victim if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:22.770\nThe distributed denial-of-service\nattack is when you have multiple\n\n30\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.220\nattackers if you will.\n\n31\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.650\nWhether they're compromised systems or\nthey're some kind of a collaborative\n\n32\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.200\nattack, where it's more than one hacker\nall attacking a single endpoint.\n\n33\n00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.792\nWe also talked about a way to redirect\ntraffic on the local area network,\n\n34\n00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.137\nif you will, a land-b ased attack.\n\n35\n00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:40.740\nAnd that was through ARP cache poisoning.\n\n36\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.640\nKeep in mind that, [COUGH] when we\ntalk about ARP cache poisoning, we're\n\n37\n00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.000\ntalking about getting dad information,\nthe ARP entries inside of your machine.\n\n38\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.170\nSo that the attacker can redirect\ntraffic from the legitimate MAC address,\n\n39\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.690\nto his or her own MAC address,\nbasically rerouting traffic at their will.\n\n40\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.430\nSo, the next thing that they talk about,\nthey talk about spoofing.\n\n41\n00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.134\nWell, when we talk about spoofing, this\nreally about, just like the MAC address we\n\n42\n00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:09.750\ntalked about the ARP poisoning,\nARP cache poisoning, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.860\nWhat is happening here?\n\n44\n00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.080\nWell an attacker is taking\na legitimate IP address and\n\n45\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.920\nmapping their MAC address\nto a legitimate IP Address.\n\n46\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.460\nBut that MAC address isn't a legitimate\nMAC address as far as the end\n\n47\n00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.148\nuser is concerned.\n\n48\n00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:26.300\nThat's actually an attacker\nmasquerading as that IP.\n\n49\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.600\nSo that's a spoofing attack, if you will,\nessentially what's going on here.\n\n50\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.802\nIP spoofing attacks,\n\n51\n00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:35.040\nthe user when you're doing things\nlike packet crafting, if you will.\n\n52\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.900\nAnd you're modifying\nwhether it's the source or\n\n53\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.760\nthe destination address,\ntypically its gonna be the source address.\n\n54\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.708\nKeep in mind that spoofing is done for\nthe purposes of concealing your identity.\n\n55\n00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:49.310\nBasically, you don't want people\nto know that you are there.\n\n56\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.460\nAnd, again, spoofing can be\ndone in many different ways.\n\n57\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.710\nIf we talk about spoofing,\n\n58\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.400\nspoofing can also be considered\na social engineering attack.\n\n59\n00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.900\nWhere you're maybe doing some kind of\nsocial engineering where you're pretending\n\n60\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.390\nto be somebody that you're not,\npretexting, if you will.\n\n61\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.080\nBut when we talk about spoofing when it\ncomes to these network vulnerabilities,\n\n62\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.620\nwe're not so\nmuch talking about social engineering,\n\n63\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.000\nas we are modifying MAC addresses or\nmodifying IP addresses.\n\n64\n00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for clarifying Wes,\nbecause I was kind of wondering that.\n\n65\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.121\nYou hear this term, impersonization,\n\n66\n00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.410\nsometimes when you're talking\nabout social engineering as well.\n\n67\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.340\nAnd, it's not like we can really apply\nthat term to the technical side of things.\n\n68\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.122\nSpoofing would be more appropriate,\ncorrect?\n\n69\n00:03:29.122 --> 00:03:30.338\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and\n\n70\n00:03:30.338 --> 00:03:35.213\nyou could say [LAUGH] impersonation is\nthe social engineering spoofing, right?\n\n71\n00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:37.210\nBut, don't get it wrong on the exam.\n\n72\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.550\nTypically, you're right, Cherokee,\nwhen they talk about spoofing,\n\n73\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.280\nthey do mean whether it's\nsomething like your IP Address.\n\n74\n00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.810\nJust spoof who the original\nsource of the information is, or\n\n75\n00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.210\nwhether it's something\nlike the MAC address.\n\n76\n00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.610\nEither way, the goal is the same.\n\n77\n00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.940\nWe don't wanna know, or the attacker\ndoesn't want them to know that\n\n78\n00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.410\nthey're on the network there,\nif I could say that right.\n\n79\n00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.385\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI couldn't even say the word right, so.\n\n80\n00:03:57.385 --> 00:04:00.650\n[LAUGH] We'll get it together,\nI promise, guys [LAUGH].\n\n81\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.150\n&gt;&gt; So the next thing we go\ninto is an interesting topic.\n\n82\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.100\nAnd this is one people like to talk\nabout a lot, and that's wireless, right?\n\n83\n00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.820\nWe talk about things like wireless\nvulnerabilities and threats.\n\n84\n00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.390\nAnd boy,\nthere are a bunch of them out there.\n\n85\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.750\nThey call out a couple of topics\nthat I'd like to take care of\n\n86\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.450\nall in one little thought process here.\n\n87\n00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.040\nBecause one really does necessitate\nthe other, but not always.\n\n88\n00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.810\nAnd let me show you what I mean.\n\n89\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.790\nSo they talk about an evil twin in\na rogue AP, a rogue access point.\n\n90\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.060\nI want you to keep in mind that we're\ngonna take our wired network concepts.\n\n91\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.630\nWe're gonna just forget about them for\na second.\n\n92\n00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.910\nWe're gonna talk about radiated energy,\nand\n\n93\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.460\nwe're gonna talk about those wireless or\nunbounded media based type attacks.\n\n94\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.720\nSo what is an evil twin, and\nwhat is a rogue access point?\n\n95\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.640\nWell, I've got a little\nbit of a diagram here.\n\n96\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.730\nAnd let's go ahead and start out with\nthe easier one, a rogue access point.\n\n97\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.845\nAll right, Cherokee is\nthe administrator of a network, and\n\n98\n00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:55.358\nshe's got maybe an extended\nservice set set up.\n\n99\n00:04:55.358 --> 00:04:57.271\nWhere she's got multiple\nwireless access points, and\n\n100\n00:04:57.271 --> 00:04:58.500\nthey're part of a larger network.\n\n101\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.830\nAnd they're all servicing\na bigger network, right?\n\n102\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.110\nWell, I decide that I wanna\nthrow a rock in that calm pond.\n\n103\n00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.580\nAnd I just take any old access point,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.230\nAnd I go within the proximity of her\nnetwork, and I plug that access point in.\n\n105\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.940\nAnd I turn on DHCP, and\nit starts handing out IP addresses, right?\n\n106\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.061\nWell, that's a rogue access point.\n\n107\n00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:21.733\nIt just means that it's an access point\nthat's in the proximity of your wireless\n\n108\n00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:25.780\nclients and your wireless network that's\nunauthorized, it shouldn't be there.\n\n109\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.300\nNow, what's the difference\nbetween that and evil twin?\n\n110\n00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.107\nWell, evil twin takes the rogue\naccess point a little bit farther,\n\n111\n00:05:31.107 --> 00:05:32.615\nand a little bit more maliciously.\n\n112\n00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:34.820\nCuz now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna take, for instance,\n\n113\n00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.360\nyour server site identifier.\n\n114\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.500\nRemember that 32-bit identifier\nthat identifies the network and\n\n115\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.910\nall the devices associated with\nthe network, and we're gonna mimic it.\n\n116\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.230\nI say we're gonna clone it,\nwe're not really gonna clone anything.\n\n117\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.420\nMore than we're just gonna set\nthe settings in the rogue access point\n\n118\n00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.130\nto match the SSID that you might see,\nlet's say, in a hotspot.\n\n119\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.360\nSo, if you've ever been to\nyour favorite coffee spot, and\n\n120\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.120\nthat's why I chose coffee spot here,\nright?\n\n121\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.300\nBecause we have wireless hotspots, right?\n\n122\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.000\nAnd that wireless hotspot, what happens?\n\n123\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.780\nYou go up to the wireless hotspot,\nyou buy your coffee, or whatever,\n\n124\n00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.900\nyour morning breakfast.\n\n125\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.690\nAnd maybe you're searching through\na tablet or something, and\n\n126\n00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.870\nyou're connected to their network.\n\n127\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.770\nWell, they tell you that it's\nan open access point, and\n\n128\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.650\nit doesn't have anything like\na captive portal, right?\n\n129\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.870\nWhere, maybe, it will redirect you and\nyou have to put in some kind of password.\n\n130\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.600\nYou just find it, it's open, you connect\nto it, and boom you're ready to go.\n\n131\n00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.190\nWell, what happens if I take\nthat rogue access point, and\n\n132\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.538\nI put it in the proximity\nof the wireless hotspot?\n\n133\n00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:32.760\nI name it SSID, the same, and\nI keep it as an open network.\n\n134\n00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.770\n&gt;&gt; I'm none the wiser [LAUGH].\n\n135\n00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.665\n&gt;&gt; That's right, now you've hopped onto\nthe network, and I can only pray that,\n\n136\n00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:41.212\nas a hacker, that you're gonna connect\nto your banking information and\n\n137\n00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:44.373\nI'm gonna fire up a wireless pack or\na packet analyzer, right.\n\n138\n00:06:44.373 --> 00:06:46.430\nAnd maybe get access to your information.\n\n139\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.600\nSo understand that when we talk about\nthe evil twin and the rogue AP.\n\n140\n00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.810\nThe rogue access point is how\nyou attempt an evil twin, but\n\n141\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.510\nit doesn't have to be that way.\n\n142\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.287\nA rogue access point doesn't\nhave to be an evil twin.\n\n143\n00:07:02.287 --> 00:07:06.042\nAnd the reason I say that,\nit can be unintentional, right?\n\n144\n00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:08.210\nThe show host here right we have to.\n\n145\n00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.250\nFor instance, we have to, with practice\nthere's been many times since I've been\n\n146\n00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.280\nhere that I've brought up an access point.\n\n147\n00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.360\nI configure the settings and\nkinda demonstrate them on camera.\n\n148\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.225\nOr maybe we're doing some\nof our security shows.\n\n149\n00:07:19.225 --> 00:07:22.927\nAnd we've got some of the other hosts\nthat say hey, I wanna show you why you\n\n150\n00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:26.480\nshouldn't implement something like WEP or\nWEP or maybe WPS, right?\n\n151\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.510\nWell, when I fire up that access point or\nany one of the other hosts, if we didn't\n\n152\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.266\nhave the wireless network that is\nthe legitimate network set the way it is.\n\n153\n00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:39.514\nMaybe through misconfiguration,\nmaybe not due diligence here.\n\n154\n00:07:39.514 --> 00:07:40.924\nWell then the access point,\n\n155\n00:07:40.924 --> 00:07:43.877\nwhen it comes online could\nstart handing out IP addresses.\n\n156\n00:07:43.877 --> 00:07:46.877\nAnd if people weren't as savvy as\nI'd like to think that we are here,\n\n157\n00:07:46.877 --> 00:07:48.450\nthey might start connecting to it.\n\n158\n00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.679\nSo understand that it doesn't\nhave to be intentional.\n\n159\n00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:54.560\nWe've talked about denial-of-service\nattacks in the first part, right?\n\n160\n00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.565\nWe've said unintentional and intentional.\n\n161\n00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:57.284\nUnintentional.\n\n162\n00:07:57.284 --> 00:08:00.372\nIt could be somebody getting in\nan accident, hitting a power line.\n\n163\n00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:01.900\nBrings the power down.\n\n164\n00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.200\nWhatever service is being provided\ncan no longer be provided.\n\n165\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.070\nIt's not intentional,\nit's not malicious, right.\n\n166\n00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.860\nWell, the same thing can happen with\nthe access point just by plugging it into\n\n167\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.700\nthe wall and turning it on.\n\n168\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.360\nAnd that's why these wireless\nattacks can be problematic.\n\n169\n00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.300\nBecause of the fact that it's not\nas simple as, or it is as simple\n\n170\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.630\nas just plugging in and turning it on\nversus having some kind of rogue server,\n\n171\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.890\nyou know, where you actually have a plug\nwire into the network, you know, so\n\n172\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.320\nwe have to gain access to\nyour physical network.\n\n173\n00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.540\nWireless attacks, I don't have to gain\naccess to your physical network, right?\n\n174\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.250\nWe could sit outside of the, just outside\nyour all your office building, right,\n\n175\n00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.760\nand if we got you know maybe\na stealthy van something like that up,\n\n176\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.720\nwe can sit in that van, practice our\nattacks, so rogue access points,\n\n177\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.650\nevil twins, they're definitely\nsomething you have to worry about.\n\n178\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.700\nAnd one of the best things\nto do is just make sure you\n\n179\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.480\nsteer away from the defaults on\nyour wireless access configuration.\n\n180\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.630\nThat's one of the big things that can\nhelp and don't have those open networks.\n\n181\n00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.740\nSo Wes, what's something we can do\nto prevent that signal bleed in\n\n182\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.262\ncase we do have someone\nsitting in their stealthy van.\n\n183\n00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:09.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's a good thing.\n\n184\n00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:15.910\nAnd I believe and I know that you're aware\nof this, correct antenna and placement.\n\n185\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:20.300\nWe like to think that, hey,\nif I've got more powerful Antenna,\n\n186\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.080\nI'm gonna get better.\n\n187\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.710\n&gt;&gt; That's best.\n&gt;&gt; Coverage.\n\n188\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n189\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.760\nI can cover the whole building\nwell there's a problem with that.\n\n190\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.020\nOne of the problems is when you increase\nthe gain on the antenna you also increase\n\n191\n00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.070\nsignal to noise ratio and\ninterference potentially.\n\n192\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.850\nBut the other problem with that is\nyou expand the coverage area, and\n\n193\n00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.990\nif the coverage area is outside\nof that building, right?\n\n194\n00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.340\nWell then, somebody can stand\noutside of that building or\n\n195\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.140\nsit outside of that building, and\nthey can try to attack your network.\n\n196\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.740\nThe big thing comes to do with things\nlike wireless site surveys, right?\n\n197\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.500\nGood wireless planning.\n\n198\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.450\nLook at a heat map, and when I say\nheat map we're not talking about\n\n199\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.710\nthermal temperature but what we're\ntalking about is more your decibel's.\n\n200\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.190\nYou know, what is the Straight to your\nsignals and how are the antennas placed.\n\n201\n00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.270\nThat's one of the best\nthings that you can do.\n\n202\n00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.660\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; Now the other thing that they call out,\n\n203\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.530\nit looks like we're going to war here,\nwe're talking about war driving,\n\n204\n00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.110\nwe're talking about war choking.\n\n205\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.560\nAnd yes I have heard war driving,\nwar flying, war boating,\n\n206\n00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.360\nit was the mode of transportation.\n\n207\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.380\nReally they're just challenge Just\nchanged and let's talk about war driving.\n\n208\n00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.570\nIt doesn't matter what your\nmode of transportation is.\n\n209\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.820\n&gt;&gt; Are we getting back in that creepy van?\n\n210\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.400\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n211\n00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.810\nwe're getting back in that creepy van and\n\n212\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.450\nwhat we're doing is we're gonna be\ncircling around the neighborhood.\n\n213\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.540\nNo just kidding, don't do that.\n\n214\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.240\nWe're gonna be circling\naround the city and\n\n215\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.540\nwhat we wanna try to do is\nfind open access points.\n\n216\n00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.320\nOne that I know that if I sit right here\nin this spot, I can make a connection, and\n\n217\n00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.430\nI can jump on somebody's wireless network.\n\n218\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.000\nAnd if I do find an area like that,\nthen I can make it publicly\n\n219\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.310\nviewable to everybody else in the\nneighborhood or the city if I Mark some\n\n220\n00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.660\nkind of special design right there and\nthat's more chalking.\n\n221\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.580\nIt just says that hey I took my device.\n\n222\n00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.120\nI stood in this spot and\nI connected to a network so\n\n223\n00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.510\nI marked something on the sidewalk\nthat would let other people know that.\n\n224\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.730\n&gt;&gt; Wes have you ever seen\none of those symbols?\n\n225\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes I have.\n\n226\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.640\nI used to live in a small little\ntown in Keene, New Hampshire.\n\n227\n00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.450\nAnd I didn't know at\nthe time what he was doing.\n\n228\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.000\nI thought it was just someone\nthat liked sidewalk chalk and\n\n229\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.232\nnever grew out of that as a kid.\n\n230\n00:11:14.232 --> 00:11:15.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was later that I found\n\n231\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:16.450\nout and I learned.\n\n232\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.130\nI was like that's what he was doing.\n\n233\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.550\nAnd sure enough, and\nhe had a little device there.\n\n234\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.120\nAnd he sat there and\nhe marked his little design there and\n\n235\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.970\nwas letting everybody else-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n236\n00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.360\n&gt;&gt; In New Hampshire, know that if\nyou stood right there you could\n\n237\n00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.980\ngain access to the Prime Roast\nwireless access.\n\n238\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.930\nAccess point.\n\n239\n00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.380\nNow there's other modes of\ntransportation that they talk about.\n\n240\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.360\nAnd I tell you,\nthere is one that I thought about.\n\n241\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.770\nI sat there and I thought about,\nwhy would we use warflying.\n\n242\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.160\nOkay, well,\nI want you to think about this.\n\n243\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.500\nMight sound like it should\nit should matter to you, but\n\n244\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.970\nwith the with the prevalence of\ndrones today, think about a drone,\n\n245\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.190\nwhere can a drone go as opposed to\na car when it comes to searching for\n\n246\n00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.700\nopen access points and that's something\nthat you also have to keep in mind too.\n\n247\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.620\nNow, I'm not saying that's\ngonna be on the exam, but\n\n248\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.550\nas 2017 here at the time\nwe're filming this.\n\n249\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.630\nKeep in mind that it's becoming more and\nmore of a problem when you have things\n\n250\n00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.920\nlike drones who could have network\nadaptors that are placed in\n\n251\n00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.890\npromiscuous mode which means they're\ngonna accept all the signals,\n\n252\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.250\ndoesn't matter if it's address to them or\nnot and start scraping that information.\n\n253\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.486\nSo it is something that you definitely\nhave to worry about and wonder,\n\n254\n00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:26.220\nhey what do we do with\nsomething like that?\n\n255\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.780\nWell that's gonna be something, just make\nsure you don't have an open network.\n\n256\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.090\nMark sure you have good,\nstrong authentication.\n\n257\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.130\nWe'll talk a little bit more about\nthe protocols too as they come up here.\n\n258\n00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.126\nAll right, now they call out some\nolder technologies, techniques,\n\n259\n00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:46.489\nI mean they're still valid today, but this\nis something known as blue jacking and\n\n260\n00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:52.640\nblue snarfing Bluejack,\nthey're both Bluetooth attacks.\n\n261\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.540\nJust understand that, when they say Blue,\n\n262\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.380\nBlue Jacking they're\ntalking about Bluetooth.\n\n263\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.190\nNow, in the earliest version of Bluetooth\nthere wasn't any required security.\n\n264\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.660\nSo it's very easy to perform\nthese attacks, right?\n\n265\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.490\nWhat is blue jacking?\n\n266\n00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.180\nBlue jacking is where, Cherokee,\nyou're gonna be the victim today.\n\n267\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.620\nCherokee has her bluetooth\ncommunication turned on and\n\n268\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.960\nI try to make a connection to it.\n\n269\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.000\nBut I'm blue jacking.\n\n270\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.890\nI'm doing that for\nthe purposes of trying to scrape her data.\n\n271\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.450\nRight, maybe you should get\nan IT- an IP spreadsheet,\n\n272\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.790\nmaybe network documentation\nthat's on that device.\n\n273\n00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.630\nAnd I'd really like to gain access to it,\n\n274\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.240\nbecause I can start doing things\nlike network architecture design,\n\n275\n00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.610\nfingerprinting and stuff, and\ntry to make my way into the network.\n\n276\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.700\nWell, bluejacking is where I gain\naccess to the Bluetooth device.\n\n277\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.520\nFor the purpose of scraping\nthe information off of it.\n\n278\n00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.110\nBlue starfing on the other hand\nis where I make a connection to\n\n279\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.140\nher Blue Tooth enabled device\nin order to send my own signal.\n\n280\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.160\nRules, right.\n\n281\n00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.510\nSo again very close, but\nthe end result's a little bit different.\n\n282\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.580\nJacking I'm gonna grab your information.\n\n283\n00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.380\nBlue snarfing I'm gonna try to send my\nunauthorized signals out to your Bluetooth\n\n284\n00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.116\ncommunication.\n\n285\n00:13:59.116 --> 00:14:04.510\nNow as Bluetooth 2.0 came out\nthere was required security,\n\n286\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.850\nand Bluetooth 3.0 increase the security.\n\n287\n00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.860\nAnd I I don't know if Bluetooth 4.0 did.\n\n288\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.960\nI know one thing about the big\nthing about Bluetooth 4.0\n\n289\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.250\nis it went into a low powered Bluetooth.\n\n290\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.720\nThat it's not as power hungry\nas it has been in the past.\n\n291\n00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.740\nBut not saying that you\ncan't perform these.\n\n292\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.660\nBut they are a little bit\nmore difficult today.\n\n293\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.910\nANd if you think about it it's a little\nextra creepy because of the proximity of\n\n294\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.620\nlooking at the range that that attacker\nhas to be somewhat near you right Wes?\n\n295\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.790\n&gt;&gt; Very near you thirty meters I believe,\nten feet,\n\n296\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.290\nno no no ten feet,\nten meters, thirty feet.\n\n297\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.200\nThirty two point eight feet for\nthe average class devices and\n\n298\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.990\nThe other thing too, with the IOT we've\nbeen discussing, the just explosive\n\n299\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:54.460\npopularity of internet and things, and\npeople putting little bluetooth receivers.\n\n300\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.050\nThink about things like your\nbluetooth speaker bars.\n\n301\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.350\nIf I can find an attack into your smart TV\nthat has a webcam on it through bluetooth,\n\n302\n00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.700\nyou see you really got to understand\neven though I say that these attacks.\n\n303\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.230\nAre a little bit more difficult today\nit certainly doesn't mean that they\n\n304\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.240\nare impossible.\n\n305\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.450\n&gt;&gt; They can't evolve either.\n\n306\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.420\n&gt;&gt; Exactly cuz just all it takes\nis a new technology and somebody\n\n307\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.455\nthat drinks a lot of coffee, never sleeps\nto find an an exploit to it right.\n\n308\n00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:20.740\n[LAUGH] So we definitely have\nto keep them on lock down,\n\n309\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.230\none of the biggest things that\nyou can is if your device\n\n310\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:28.250\nNot all devices support this, but a lot of\nthem do when they support a pin, right?\n\n311\n00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.180\nAnd you might say, well, Wes, that's pin.\n\n312\n00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.130\nWhat is it, 11,000 possibilities,\nI think it is, of a four digit pin.\n\n313\n00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.470\nWell it's better than nothing, right?\n\n314\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.590\nIt's better than you just\nleaving the door wide open.\n\n315\n00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.010\nI'd much rather have a dead bolt\non that door and say, well yeah,\n\n316\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.120\nsomebody could kick the door in.\n\n317\n00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.590\nWell, they're not putting\nthe deadbolt on and\n\n318\n00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.750\nall they got to do is turn the handle and\npush the door open.\n\n319\n00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.640\nSo if you can, try to make sure that\n\n320\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.332\nyou're using the pins if they\ndo offer you that option.\n\n321\n00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:53.609\nAll right, now we get to the fun stuff.\n\n322\n00:15:53.609 --> 00:15:55.938\nAnd this is the protocols\nthat we were talking about,\n\n323\n00:15:55.938 --> 00:15:59.147\nbecause one of the things I mentioned\nis Is that on your wireless network,\n\n324\n00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:01.664\nyou should always try to\nimplement encryption, right?\n\n325\n00:16:01.664 --> 00:16:03.800\nYou'll have some kind\nof encryption protocol.\n\n326\n00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.710\nEven if it's the weakest\nencryption protocol.\n\n327\n00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.767\nBecause, better than nothing, right?\n\n328\n00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:11.520\nIt doesn't mean that it's gonna be\nthe one-stop shop and gonna secure you.\n\n329\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.000\nBut when we talk security, we usually talk\nabout a layered defense system, right?\n\n330\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.720\nMicrosoft follows the military\nspecification defensive depth.\n\n331\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.730\nSo just the encryption alone is not going\nto help you, but it is a good start.\n\n332\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.730\nThey mentioned some things that\nwe have to worry about, right?\n\n333\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.430\nAnd I'm going to mention them a little\nbit out of order here, Cherokee.\n\n334\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.030\nBecause of the way they mention them.\n\n335\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.930\nI'm gonna go from the oldest to\nmore newer ones that we have.\n\n336\n00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.960\nAnd then talk about the one, finally, that\nthey don't mention that you really should\n\n337\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.830\nbe using so\nyou know how to resolve the issue.\n\n338\n00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.640\nWired equivalent privacy.\n\n339\n00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.150\nWhen the, there's Wi-Fi Alliance and\n\n340\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.140\nthe IEEE first came out,\nthey needed a way to secure networks.\n\n341\n00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.170\nBecause in the earliest days, they had\nwhat are known are open systems, right?\n\n342\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.810\nAnd with the open systems,\nit's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n343\n00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.200\nIt just means anybody could\ngain access to your network.\n\n344\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.260\nSo they came up with a quick break fix.\n\n345\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.740\nIt's really all it was, it's wasn't\nthe one stop, again I say one stop shop,\n\n346\n00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.890\nbecause it doesn't fix everything.\n\n347\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.170\nAnd that was called\nthe Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n348\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.901\nNow by now, today in 2017,\n\n349\n00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:12.442\nyou really shouldn't be using\nWired Equivalent Privacy at all.\n\n350\n00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:15.282\nAnd it's because there's a lot\nof security vulnerabilities\n\n351\n00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:18.110\nthat surround it that we'll\ntalk about here in a second.\n\n352\n00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.656\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes,\n\n353\n00:17:18.656 --> 00:17:22.317\nthat name is a little misleading when\nwe see Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n354\n00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:26.208\nIt's hard for our minds not to,\nkind of, you know ,shift in that way.\n\n355\n00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:30.472\nThis may be equivalent to\nthe security of our wired networks.\n\n356\n00:17:30.472 --> 00:17:32.270\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of interesting\nthat you mention that.\n\n357\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.540\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's run with that thought for a second.\n\n358\n00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.280\nIf I take a network adapter and\nI plug it into the network,\n\n359\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.449\nwhat kind of privacy do I\nactually have on that network?\n\n360\n00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.690\nNone, right?\n\n361\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.680\nUnless you're implementing things like\nIPsec, the Internet Protocol Security, and\n\n362\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.310\nyou're doing confidentiality and\nencryption, and availability, right?\n\n363\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.250\nYou're using the encryption protocols.\n\n364\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:56.730\nYou don't have any [LAUGH]\nprivacy on a wired network.\n\n365\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.200\nBut if we take it back to the days\nwhen this first came out,\n\n366\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.200\nI want you to think about leaving all\nthe windows open in your house, right.\n\n367\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.260\nEverybody can just walk down the street,\nthey can look in your house,\n\n368\n00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.930\nthey can see what’s going on,\nthey know what’s, when you’re eating,\n\n369\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.280\nthey know when you’re getting ready for\nwork, or when you’re going to bed.\n\n370\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.100\nWouldn’t it be nice to just be\nable to pull the blinds down and\n\n371\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.190\nshut the windows so\nnobody outside can see what you’re doing.\n\n372\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.716\nAnd that’s essentially all WEP was, right?\n\n373\n00:18:19.716 --> 00:18:22.963\nWired Equivalent Privacy just means that\nunless I have physical access to your\n\n374\n00:18:22.963 --> 00:18:25.930\nnetwork, I don't know what's\ngoing on in your network.\n\n375\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.120\nIt doesn't really do much more than that,\n\n376\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.950\nin fact it was surrounded by\na lot of vulnerabilities.\n\n377\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.230\nThey do call out, throughout this exam,\n\n378\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.300\nthey do talk about things like\ninitialization vectors, IV's right?\n\n379\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.894\nWell initialization vectors,\n\n380\n00:18:37.894 --> 00:18:41.089\nyou got understand that if two\npiece of encrypted data, right?\n\n381\n00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:45.424\nWe take an algorithm that runs plain\ntext through this algorithm and\n\n382\n00:18:45.424 --> 00:18:47.650\nit produces cipher text, right?\n\n383\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.362\nIf I use the same mathematical algorithm\non the same exact piece of data,\n\n384\n00:18:52.362 --> 00:18:56.776\nchances are the encrypted output\nis going to be identical, right?\n\n385\n00:18:56.776 --> 00:18:57.560\nWe don't want that.\n\n386\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.490\nIn encryption, we don't want\nthere to be any predictability.\n\n387\n00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.882\nSo what they would do is they would\ntake initialization vectors and\n\n388\n00:19:03.882 --> 00:19:08.002\nadd that like padding and then encrypt the\nwhole entire thing so that two pieces of\n\n389\n00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:11.715\noutput would never come up with\nthe same encrypted output, if you will.\n\n390\n00:19:11.715 --> 00:19:16.043\nBut the problem is that little\ninitialization vector was only 24\n\n391\n00:19:16.043 --> 00:19:17.460\nbits long.\n\n392\n00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.540\nWhich gives you about\n16,777,216 possibilities and\n\n393\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.055\nthat might seem like a lot, but by today's\ncomputing standards, it really isn't.\n\n394\n00:19:26.055 --> 00:19:33.040\nCoupled with the fact that on\nthe end of a Wire Equivalent Privacy\n\n395\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.430\nweb frame is that there is a 32 bit\ncyclic redundancy check, right?\n\n396\n00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:38.312\nA little checksum and\n\n397\n00:19:38.312 --> 00:19:42.050\nthe checksum could be modified to\ntell you exactly what to expect.\n\n398\n00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.440\nAnd you'd be none the wiser that\nit had actually been manipulated.\n\n399\n00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.651\nSo WEP, don't use, right?\n\n400\n00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:50.726\nSo the other one that\nthey call out is WPA.\n\n401\n00:19:50.726 --> 00:19:54.240\nAll right, now WPA went a lot further.\n\n402\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.976\nAll right, it added a 48 bit\ninitialization vector, right?\n\n403\n00:19:57.976 --> 00:20:00.636\nSo it was a little bit more\ndifficult to do an IV attack.\n\n404\n00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:05.797\nAll right, the end of a WPA frame would\nuse something known as a Michael or\n\n405\n00:20:05.797 --> 00:20:06.990\nMic if you will.\n\n406\n00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.150\nIt's a measure of integrity code.\n\n407\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.560\nSo it made it a little bit harder.\n\n408\n00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.340\nThe problem was, underneath, it was\nstill using a weaker RC4 stream cipher,\n\n409\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.790\nand that could be manipulated.\n\n410\n00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.914\nSo you could do what's known as a brute\nforce attack against a WPA key.\n\n411\n00:20:23.914 --> 00:20:26.417\nAnd a brute force attack just means\nI'm gonna try to just guess all\n\n412\n00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:29.210\nthe possibilities, and I'm just gonna\nkeep hitting it and hitting it.\n\n413\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.260\nAnd hopefully eventually, I come up with\nwhatever your pre-share key might be.\n\n414\n00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.820\nSo that's why you really don't\nwant to be using WEP and\n\n415\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.590\nyou really don't wanna be using WPA.\n\n416\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.799\nToday, what you should be\nusing is WPA 2 or 802.11I.\n\n417\n00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.635\nNow what are the differences?\n\n418\n00:20:46.635 --> 00:20:48.670\nNothing, all right?\n\n419\n00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.890\nWe've got two consortiums, we've got\na bunch of standard consortiums as\n\n420\n00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.270\nI'm sure you're already aware of if\nyou're following along in this series.\n\n421\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.810\nWe have the Wi-Fi alliance and\nwe have what's known as the IEEE.\n\n422\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:01.940\nThe Wi-Fi alliance is the one that\nwent to the IEEE after WEP and said,\n\n423\n00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.692\nhey man, give us something.\n\n424\n00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:05.252\nGod, we need something right now.\n\n425\n00:21:05.252 --> 00:21:06.970\nWEP is, there's something wrong with WEP.\n\n426\n00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.950\nHelp us out.\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a band-aid\n\n427\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:09.670\nWPA, right?\n\n428\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.110\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is,\nit's a band-aid over a bullet hole.\n\n429\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.450\nIt's a perfect example because why,\nwhat happened?\n\n430\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.540\nThey said well, we're working on\nsomething, it's not finished, but\n\n431\n00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.550\nwe'll go ahead and give you this and\nyou can use it now.\n\n432\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.090\nSo they implemented WPA with something\n\n433\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.300\nknown as the Temporal Key Integrity\nProtocol, and we'll talk about that more.\n\n434\n00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.890\nJust understand that it\nwasn't a complete solution.\n\n435\n00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.260\nWhen they finally announced that, hey,\nit's complete, all of the bells and\n\n436\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.200\nwhistles, all of\nthe components are in place.\n\n437\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.446\nThey issue it out, the IEEE does,\nunder the formalized standard of 802.11I.\n\n438\n00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.620\nWi-Fi Alliance already had WPA,\nWi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n439\n00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.308\nSo they said, well we'll just call\nit Wi-Fi Protected Access II.\n\n440\n00:21:46.308 --> 00:21:50.500\nAnd so they are equivalent, that is\nwhat you want to be you using today.\n\n441\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.340\nWe will talk about some of those\nconcepts in another episode.\n\n442\n00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.540\nBut for now, vulnerabilities and threats,\n\n443\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.030\nknow that it's a vulnerability definitely\nto be using a Wired Equivalent Privacy,\n\n444\n00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:07.960\nand it is considered today\na vulnerability to be using\n\n445\n00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.590\nWPA because of the fact that it doesn't\nstand up to the brute force attacks.\n\n446\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.185\n&gt;&gt; And anytime you configure a device,\nwhether it be a server or\n\n447\n00:22:16.185 --> 00:22:20.347\nany kind of connectivity device to\naccept backwards compatibility,\n\n448\n00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:23.756\nyou're weakening the entire\nsecurity of that network.\n\n449\n00:22:23.756 --> 00:22:25.900\nSo you kind of have to\nmake that judgement call,\n\n450\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.900\nis it really worth these\nolder devices connecting?\n\n451\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.188\nMust they connect?\n\n452\n00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:32.170\nOr you know, is the security of my\nnetwork a little more important?\n\n453\n00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.946\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, because even in using WPA2,\nyou could find WPA2 isn't supported.\n\n454\n00:22:37.946 --> 00:22:39.683\nAES encryption, that we'll talk about,\n\n455\n00:22:39.683 --> 00:22:41.572\nis not supported by some\nof the older devices.\n\n456\n00:22:41.572 --> 00:22:45.500\nSo, there again, that's why we talk\nabout unpatched legacy systems.\n\n457\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to be careful with them.\n\n458\n00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.878\nBut people need them, I mean it\ncomes down to it, people need them.\n\n459\n00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:52.093\nYou know, especially if you spend a lot of\nmoney on a system that runs off a older\n\n460\n00:22:52.093 --> 00:22:53.040\nlegacy based system.\n\n461\n00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.615\nYour company might not have the money\nto fork out another $70 to $100,000\n\n462\n00:22:56.615 --> 00:22:57.381\njust to upgrade.\n\n463\n00:22:57.381 --> 00:23:00.520\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n464\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.550\nAll right, so the next thing that they\ncall out is something known as session\n\n465\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:04.850\nhijacking.\n\n466\n00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.536\nAnd with session hijacking, this is\nkind of interesting because the goal\n\n467\n00:23:08.536 --> 00:23:11.756\nhere is to take somebody who is\nalready authenticated, right?\n\n468\n00:23:11.756 --> 00:23:12.720\nWhat's authentication?\n\n469\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.620\nThat's proving your identity, well that's,\n\n470\n00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.440\nit is validating a set of credentials\nis really what authentication is.\n\n471\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.681\nRight, I prove I am who I say I am\nbecause when you challenged me,\n\n472\n00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:26.934\nI gave a username and password and\nI met that challenge, right?\n\n473\n00:23:26.934 --> 00:23:31.967\nNow, once I'm authenticated, typically we\nwill have a communication between myself,\n\n474\n00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:34.710\nthe client if you will, and the server.\n\n475\n00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:37.570\nNow, what if somebody can get in there\nafter you're already authenticated and\n\n476\n00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:41.690\nsteal little portions of data that\nare cast in your web browser and\n\n477\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.070\nthen represent them, replay them as it's\ncalled, replay attack back to the server,\n\n478\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.500\nas though it's, well,\nme as the authenticated user.\n\n479\n00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.070\nI'm gonna pick on Cherokee again,\nnow she's the hacker.\n\n480\n00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.690\nShe wears many hats around here.\n\n481\n00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.537\nNow she's the attacker.\n\n482\n00:23:54.537 --> 00:23:58.839\nI'm already authenticated, but she stole\nsomething known as a session cookie.\n\n483\n00:23:58.839 --> 00:23:59.823\nWell, the session cookie.\n\n484\n00:23:59.823 --> 00:24:01.719\nIn fact,\nlet's give you an example here, right.\n\n485\n00:24:01.719 --> 00:24:04.971\nSo what happens when you\ncommunicate with the web server and\n\n486\n00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.670\nyou're gonna authenticate.\n\n487\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.820\nIt really boils down to the fact that\nHTTP by itself is a stateless protocol.\n\n488\n00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.600\nSo if I connect to a web server,\nand I've been viewing this page for\n\n489\n00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.470\nthe past four hours and\nthen I shut down my browsing session, and\n\n490\n00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.570\nI reconnect to that server,\nthat server goes, who are you?\n\n491\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.240\nI don't know.\n\n492\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.700\nSo we have session cookies,\nright, and the session cookies,\n\n493\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.300\nwhat they do is they store information.\n\n494\n00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.130\nThey can contain things like passwords,\n\n495\n00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.230\nthey can contain things like credit\ncard numbers, names, and address, and\n\n496\n00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.130\na ton of other stuff if they're\nnot put in check, right?\n\n497\n00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.770\nThey can essentially contain more\nsensitive information than you\n\n498\n00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.850\nmight be aware of.\n\n499\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.220\nBut the big ones that I'm worried\nabout here is user information,\n\n500\n00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.125\nright, containing our password.\n\n501\n00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:53.150\nWell, if that's stored in my web browser,\n\n502\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.180\nright, and an attacker could steal my\ncookies, better stay away from my cookies.\n\n503\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.710\nBut if they can steal my cookie here,\nright, well it doesn't really stop\n\n504\n00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.020\nthe hacker from presenting that\ncookie back to the server.\n\n505\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.990\nAnd now I don't look like I'm even in the\nconversation anymore because the hacker\n\n506\n00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.800\nhas basically hijacked my session.\n\n507\n00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.969\nIt's already been authenticated, and\n\n508\n00:25:13.969 --> 00:25:18.000\nnow is completely communicating with\nthe server as though they are mates.\n\n509\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Sorry, Wes.\n\n510\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry, that's what you\nget when you steal cookies, right?\n\n511\n00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.220\nOr when you leave your\ncookies unprotected.\n\n512\n00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.150\nSo put them in a jar.\n\n513\n00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.200\nNo, just kidding.\n\n514\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.480\nThe big thing about this is\nthey're browsing histories, right?\n\n515\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.170\nThe other thing, too, might not be\nanything to do with you, it might be on\n\n516\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:36.228\nthe development end or maybe they're not,\nyou know, using the cookie appropriately.\n\n517\n00:25:36.228 --> 00:25:38.630\nSo that's session hijacking and\n\n518\n00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.140\nthe point there is once you've already\nauthenticated, if I can get that little\n\n519\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.190\npiece of information that's stored in your\ncomputer, typically via your web browser,\n\n520\n00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.910\nthen I can take that piece of information,\nand I can present it back to the server\n\n521\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.210\nand server goes yeah I remember who you\nare, even though you're the hacker.\n\n522\n00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.230\nSo you have to watch out that you do\nhave things like that where you have\n\n523\n00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.920\nsession hijacking.\n\n524\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.780\n&gt;&gt; Your browser's up to date,\nnot selecting the auto fill for\n\n525\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.080\nyour passwords like Remember Me options.\n\n526\n00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like that.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n527\n00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.220\nWell, I'm, looking at our list here,\nCherokee, and\n\n528\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.720\nI didn't think we would do it.\n\n529\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.252\nBut, it looks like we might have to\ngo into a part three on this one.\n\n530\n00:26:14.252 --> 00:26:15.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's okay, Wes.\n\n531\n00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.540\nWe'll definitely do that.\n\n532\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.510\nSo thank you so much for joining us today.\n\n533\n00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.870\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us, as well.\n\n534\n00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:23.070\nBut, stay tuned, because,\nas Wes has stated,\n\n535\n00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.920\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nshoot a part three, coming up.\n\n536\n00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.760\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off for\nthis episode, as your show host,\n\n537\n00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.440\nCherokee Boose.\n\n538\n00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.280\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n539\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.801\n&gt;&gt; See you next

00:00:11.987\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.987 --> 00:00:15.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.230\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.360\nWe've actually made it to a part\nthree in this particular topic,\n\n7\n00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.390\nwe're talking about vulnerabilities and\nthreats.\n\n8\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.940\nWith us we have Mr. Wes Bryan in\nstudios to help cover these concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.260\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.380\nIts funny, we said vulnerabilities and\nthreats and\n\n12\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.888\nI don't think we have\nmentioned one threat yet.\n\n13\n00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:37.130\nWe come [LAUGH] on the vulnerabilities\nto get through which is why you\n\n14\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.310\nshould definitely be\nwatching this episode.\n\n15\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.130\nAnd like I said in some of the past\nportions of this episode here,\n\n16\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.010\nkeep in mind that it's not only good for\nthe certification exam,\n\n17\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.050\nit's good too as you make your way into\nyour IT career to understand these,\n\n18\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.750\nso you'll be aware of them and\nunderstand the concepts too.\n\n19\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.450\nSo if you hear somebody in\nthe background talking about them,\n\n20\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.290\nthey won't be talking\na foreign language to you.\n\n21\n00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.130\nSo one of the things that we talked about\nright at the end of the last episode,\n\n22\n00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.380\nwe were talking about\ncommon wireless attacks,\n\n23\n00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.300\nwe talked about some of the protocol or\nencryption techniques,\n\n24\n00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.040\nprotocols, if you will,\nand their vulnerabilities.\n\n25\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.870\nWe talked about WEP,\nWPA having a weakness, but\n\n26\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.240\nthere's one that I did leave out.\n\n27\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.980\nAnd I do have to go back and make sure\nthat we cover that and that's WPS.\n\n28\n00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.859\nThat's the Wi-Fi Protected Setup.\n\n29\n00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.035\nWi-Fi Protected Setup.\n\n30\n00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.250\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n31\n00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.110\nthere's nothing really\nprotected about this one.\n\n32\n00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.992\nIn fact, it didn't really take long for\na hacker out there.\n\n33\n00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:34.974\nAnd I can think of his name,\nI think his name was Moxie Marlinspike,\n\n34\n00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:37.294\nI think is what his\nprofessional hacker's name is.\n\n35\n00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:37.963\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n36\n00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:42.220\nI think he works with people like RSA and\nBruce Schneier, and stuff.\n\n37\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.890\nSo he's definitely a whitehat hacker,\nif you will.\n\n38\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890\nHe finds exploits and he makes them\navailable publicly to the world.\n\n39\n00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.630\nAnd he was the one that found that WPS,\nWi-Fi Protected Setup,\n\n40\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.950\nlet's go ahead and step back and\nwe'll talk about what it is.\n\n41\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.240\nAnd then where the vulnerability lies.\n\n42\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.010\nThe WiFi Alliance wanted a way for\nthe average end user,\n\n43\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.340\nand again I mean average end user.\n\n44\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.090\nIt's not somebody like yourself that\nmight be studying for a certification,\n\n45\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.510\njust the average person that go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.520\nbe able to setup projection\non their networks, right?\n\n47\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.900\nSecure their wireless network.\n\n48\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.490\nSo this is really what they call\na push button security implementation.\n\n49\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.090\n&gt;&gt; I think it really had good intentions,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it did,\nit was to make it easier on the end user.\n\n51\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.345\nBut what we talked about and I know\nyou've studied this extensively, too.\n\n52\n00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:33.730\nIn security,\nwhen you start to go towards convenience,\n\n53\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.760\nsecurity starts to drop a little bit,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.430\nWhen you start to get a little\nbit more to complexity,\n\n55\n00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.950\nconvenience starts to drop a little bit\nbut then your security starts to go up.\n\n56\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.820\nSo with WPS what they did is they\nput a way that you could pushy\n\n57\n00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.320\na button on the router, and\n\n58\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.900\nthen you could put a code in to where you\nwould usually put your pre-shared key when\n\n59\n00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.680\nyou're authenticating against the wireless\nnetwork usually an eight digit code.\n\n60\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.030\nAnd what that would do is that would allow\nthe network adapter, the operating system\n\n61\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.400\nthat controls the network adapter to\ntalk to the wireless access point and\n\n62\n00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.380\nset up the encryption,\nand the security for you.\n\n63\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.580\nBut there's a problem with it,\nbecause the way it authenticates,\n\n64\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.690\nit authenticates in four\nindividual chunks, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.680\nAnd even worse is that as you start to\nguess, do some brute force attack against\n\n66\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000\nthose first four digits,\nit tells you when you get ' wrong.\n\n67\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.240\nNo you got them wrong.\n\n68\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.580\nNo you got them wrong, but\n\n69\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.090\nthen once you get them right,\nit lets you know, you got those right.\n\n70\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.870\nGo ahead and work on the next four.\n\n71\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.160\nWell, the problem is,\nit's very weak security, so\n\n72\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.650\na lot of the newer access points\nhave been already patched.\n\n73\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.210\nCheck the firmware on your router or\nwireless access point if you got one\n\n74\n00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.430\nthat's a little bit older,\nmake sure that you're patching them.\n\n75\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.300\nBecause a lot of the major\nmanufacturers what they did is they\n\n76\n00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.310\ngave you the ability to disable it because\nwhen if first came out, the Wi-Fi Alliance\n\n77\n00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.502\nstated that if you wanted your wireless\naccess point to be endorsed with Wi-Fi.\n\n78\n00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:57.000\nThe Wi-Fi symbol on it didn't\nhad to support WPS and\n\n79\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.010\nthe problem was not were they supporting\nit, but even though you would disable it,\n\n80\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.850\nyou could see by picking\nup a protocol analyzer,\n\n81\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.540\nyou could see them in the background that\neven though you told the access point to\n\n82\n00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.300\ndisable, it didn't truly disable it,\nso, it became a problem.\n\n83\n00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a problem, Wes, and\n\n84\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.400\nyou also see and the way I'd like to\nthink of it is sometimes when we're\n\n85\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.330\ntalking about security we do have\nto kind of forfeit something.\n\n86\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.950\nForfeit that convenience.\n\n87\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.559\nForfeit extra money or\nforfeit extra time but\n\n88\n00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.590\nit really all boils down\nto what's more important.\n\n89\n00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, diffidently think about it\nas you are going down a road, right?\n\n90\n00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.309\nAnd you know that you are going through an\narea that may be is not the greatest area,\n\n91\n00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:35.550\nfor whatever reason.\n\n92\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.340\nAnd they might have checkpoints along the\nway, with maybe law enforcement there for\n\n93\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.070\nwhatever reason.\n\n94\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.620\nRight now that does slow your travel time,\nbut the same point,\n\n95\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.500\nthe goal there is to make sure\nthat you're more protected.\n\n96\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.028\nSo keep that in mind, that you could drive\ndown that road, that nice fast road, but\n\n97\n00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:55.309\nthen again it could cause you some\nproblems, get you in some security issues.\n\n98\n00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.758\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it really is that balance,\n\n99\n00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:02.782\nthat fine line between convenience and\nsecurity and they usually are really\n\n100\n00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:08.190\non the pendulum scales there and\nthey usually don't balance out too well.\n\n101\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.840\n&gt;&gt; Kinda funny that analogy that\n\n102\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.730\nyou offered kind of reminded me of\nsomething I saw in the news recently that\n\n103\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.760\npeople were complaining about\ntheir deliveries in Trump Towers.\n\n104\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.790\nSo their Chinese food was actually\ncold by the time they made it up to\n\n105\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.845\nthe residence because of all the pat-downs\nand everything involved at that location.\n\n106\n00:05:25.845 --> 00:05:26.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but\n\n107\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.497\nat least your food was secure, right?\n\n108\n00:05:28.497 --> 00:05:30.220\n[LAUGH] So, yeah, eat.\n\n109\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.124\nAnd then, yeah, that's a classic example\nof the fact that the security kind\n\n110\n00:05:35.124 --> 00:05:39.070\nof trumped, if I should say [LAUGH],\nconvenience on there.\n\n111\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.980\nBad pun, I realize.\n\n112\n00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.090\nBut I digress, moving on.\n\n113\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.050\nNow the other thing that\nI also wanna mention that\n\n114\n00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.370\nI forgot to mention in the first one.\n\n115\n00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.010\nAnd that was, they call out things\nlike packet and protocol abuse.\n\n116\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.450\nPacket abuse can really just be things\nlike we were talking about with spoofing.\n\n117\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.910\nIf I can manipulate,\nif I can do a packet crafting and\n\n118\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.760\nI can change the source IP address and\nsend it towards your computer or\n\n119\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.870\nsend it towards the broadcast address,\nright?\n\n120\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.430\nMake everybody send\nan ICMP echo request or\n\n121\n00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.760\nreply message back to your computer,\nI can bring it offline, right?\n\n122\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.630\nWell, that's packet abuse, right?\n\n123\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.220\nYou're using the packet maliciously.\n\n124\n00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.180\nOr protocol abuse could be the fact\nthat you're using it in a way that it\n\n125\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.410\nwasn't initially intended.\n\n126\n00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.490\nSo for instance,\n\n127\n00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.080\nsomething like NTP, we talked about things\nlike NTP being the fact that my computer\n\n128\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.300\njust asks an NTP server, hey,\nwhat's the time stamp that you have, and\n\n129\n00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.925\nthen it compares its time stamp and\nif it's out of time, it adjusts it, right?\n\n130\n00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:36.400\nWell, since NTP uses UDP,\n\n131\n00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.710\nyou can for one, you don't have to worry\nabout a connection or related session.\n\n132\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.520\nYou can send as many of these\ncommunication packets or\n\n133\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.630\nNTP requests to the time\nservers as you want and it's\n\n134\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.650\nnot going to send any information back,\nif you will, as far as connection states.\n\n135\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.200\nNow what happens if I ask\nan NTP server to send me back\n\n136\n00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.240\nmore information than what is required,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.440\nI'm doing that as part of an amplified\nattack, and I'm abusing the protocol.\n\n138\n00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.650\nWe talked about doing DNS poisoning.\n\n139\n00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.625\nI'm sending the DNS registration, I'm\nputting my DNS entry into a DNS database,\n\n140\n00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:13.132\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:16.357\nIt's still the DNS protocol but the way\nI'm saying it is abusing the protocol and\n\n142\n00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:19.554\nthat's what happens a lot of times when\nwe talk about these different attacks.\n\n143\n00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:24.008\nWe take the basic network communications\nthat we use to make sure that our\n\n144\n00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:26.570\nnetworks are doing the communications.\n\n145\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.810\nAnd the abuse them in order\nto take our networks offline.\n\n146\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.500\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes, this is really important as to\nwhy we should understand how a protocol or\n\n147\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.570\nprocess works.\n\n148\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.720\nBecause if an attacker is going to be\nexploiting the weakness within that\n\n149\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.270\nprocess, within that protocol, within\nthat packet, then that's really gonna be\n\n150\n00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.390\nour major line of defense to prevent those\ntypes of attacks from occurring, right?\n\n151\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n152\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.170\nOur awareness goes to education,\ncommunication, and constant awareness.\n\n153\n00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.900\nTraining if you will if it's in there.\n\n154\n00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.291\nAnd it is a very cyclic process.\n\n155\n00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:58.948\nRemember security is a journey,\nit's never a destination to be reached.\n\n156\n00:07:58.948 --> 00:08:03.121\nYou're always going to be on that\njourney trying to secure your systems.\n\n157\n00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:07.358\nNext one that they come out with,\nthey talk about is the man in the middle.\n\n158\n00:08:07.358 --> 00:08:11.118\nAnd in fact, a lot of these can be formed\nor these vulnerabilities we talked about\n\n159\n00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:14.765\nsome of them can be performed by man in\nthe middle attacks, like for instance,\n\n160\n00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:16.280\nthe session hijacking attack.\n\n161\n00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.310\nI need to get an access\nto your session cookie.\n\n162\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.480\nIt could be the fact that it is\nbeing passed across the network, and\n\n163\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.430\nI reach out between you guys.\n\n164\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.110\nAnd I scrape that information,\nI put a protocol analyzer out there\n\n165\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.800\nthat gathers out information,\nand does packet capture as well.\n\n166\n00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.700\nSo I'll give you example here,\nI got just a basic diagram here.\n\n167\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.023\nYou have your victum and you have whatever\nresource it is in there, they're asking\n\n168\n00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:41.080\nfor a resource cuz keep in mind that's\nwhat where we talk about the network and\n\n169\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.540\nwhat is the basic network used for?\n\n170\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.580\nPurposes of communication and\nsharing resources that if I'm asking for\n\n171\n00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.870\na file server for a specific file,\nand somebody can get in between me and\n\n172\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.160\nthey can sniff that information and\nI'm already using something like FTP\n\n173\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.200\nthat isn't secure,\nwell there's a problem with that, right?\n\n174\n00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.610\nThey connect end up seeing things\nlike usernames and passwords.\n\n175\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.050\nSee the data itself for the purposes of\nintercepting the information, modifying\n\n176\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.970\nthe information or in the end, just\nredirecting the communication all together\n\n177\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:13.300\nin the case of like TCP session hijacking\nor TCP hijack or session hijacking attack.\n\n178\n00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.340\nIt could be just for\n\n179\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.250\nthe purposes of quite literally getting\nin between that person and then just\n\n180\n00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:25.060\ncompletely stopping their communication\nand taking over their communication.\n\n181\n00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.225\n&gt;&gt; Now Wess, some of the attacks that\nyou've mentioned before especially when\n\n182\n00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:29.545\nyou were discussing wireless.\n\n183\n00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:31.532\nThere can be a collaboration or\n\n184\n00:09:31.532 --> 00:09:35.250\na combination of techniques\nused to execute an attack.\n\n185\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.420\nFor instance, the example you just gave or\nsomeone had physical access to\n\n186\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.580\nyour network and tapped into that wire or\nif we were talking about wireless and\n\n187\n00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.840\nthey were able to set up\none of those rogue servers.\n\n188\n00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.170\nSo there are a lot of\ndifferent techniques to,\n\n189\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.970\nit's kind of a generic term when\nyou hear man in the middle, but\n\n190\n00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.100\nit is that interception that\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n191\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it really is.\n\n192\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.090\nIt's just being between a source and\ndestination.\n\n193\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.255\nAnd you're gathering the information\nagain like I said for\n\n194\n00:09:58.255 --> 00:10:01.895\nthe purposes of intercepting it,\nmodifying it if you will or\n\n195\n00:10:01.895 --> 00:10:04.835\njust completely redirecting\nthe information in general.\n\n196\n00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:10.490\nNow, the next one I call out\nis a single bullet point but\n\n197\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.250\nthis one is something known\nas social engineering.\n\n198\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.240\nAnd when it comes to social engineering,\n\n199\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.140\nsocial engineering is pretty\nmuch a fairly big topic.\n\n200\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.410\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I think we could go for\nan entire show just on social\n\n201\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.471\nengineering as a matter of fact\nwe do have shows on that, right?\n\n202\n00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.561\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We do, we do.\n\n203\n00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.652\nWe've got one professional\nthat came in here and\n\n204\n00:10:28.652 --> 00:10:31.661\ndid a whole week on Social Engineering so\nthese are pretty big topic and\n\n205\n00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:35.231\neven though it's mentioned here, I'm gonna\ntalk about some of the types of social\n\n206\n00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:38.250\nengineering as you could see out there and\nthere's all kinds of them.\n\n207\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.050\nThere are some of the common ones\nwhen we talk about impersonation.\n\n208\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.404\nI think Cherokee mentioned that in\nthe last portion on part two of this\n\n209\n00:10:45.404 --> 00:10:49.912\nmini series [LAUGH] that we've got\ngoing where you're impersonating,\n\n210\n00:10:49.912 --> 00:10:53.050\nyou're pretending to be\nsomebody you're not.\n\n211\n00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.820\nBut there's a difference here, right?\n\n212\n00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.060\nBecause you do have spoofing as well,\nthey might call it pretexting,\n\n213\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.820\nit's a little bit different.\n\n214\n00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.050\nCuz again, you're not really\nspoofing IP addresses, but\n\n215\n00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.500\nyou are pretending to\nbe somebody you're not.\n\n216\n00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.100\nAnd the big difference between something\nlike pretexting and impersonation,\n\n217\n00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:11.130\nimpersonation I really make no effort to\nconceal the fact that I'm there, right.\n\n218\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.250\nHey, this is help desk there, Cherokee.\n\n219\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.610\nYou're gonna have to change your\npassword at the end of the day,\n\n220\n00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.050\ncan I have your current password so\nI can do it?\n\n221\n00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.990\nYou know, just something.\n\n222\n00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.720\nAnd I know that might seem very,\nvery, I don't know, easy.\n\n223\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.660\nAnd you might say yeah,\nwell I'll recognize that.\n\n224\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.040\nWell maybe you will recognize that,\nbut somebody that maybe is not aware\n\n225\n00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.520\nthat this attack happens might say,\nwell, I'm helping the admin staff here,\n\n226\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.330\nlet me go and give you my username and\npassword, right?\n\n227\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.260\nThat's impersonation.\n\n228\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.670\nNotice that I didn't hide the fact\nthat I'm there, they can hear me.\n\n229\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.630\nPre-texting on the other hand,\nI wanna spoof the fact that I'm there,\n\n230\n00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.480\nI'm gonna hide and\n\n231\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.500\nconceal my identity but I don't even\nwant you to know that I'm there, right?\n\n232\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.980\nSo, again,\nmy goal is that I wanna get into a system,\n\n233\n00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.710\nI don't want you to know\nthat I'm even there.\n\n234\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.950\nSo that is a social engineering attack,\nthat is just a little bit different.\n\n235\n00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.975\n&gt;&gt; So, you could see different\ntechniques also being used here.\n\n236\n00:11:59.975 --> 00:12:02.845\nFor instance,\nif I were spoofing my telephone number and\n\n237\n00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:06.205\ncalling and saying, hey, this is so\nand so from the help desk.\n\n238\n00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:09.495\nI'd like you to give me\nyour log in credentials so\n\n239\n00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:12.660\nI can impersonate you and\nlogin o see to recreate that\n\n240\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.030\nissue that others in your department may\nhave been having or something like that.\n\n241\n00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.020\nSo, the person looks at the number\nthat came up on their display for\n\n242\n00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.590\ntheir telephone.\n\n243\n00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.760\nThey say, that's our other branch office,\nor whatever.\n\n244\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.810\nSo, it's kind of like a combo of the two,\nright?\n\n245\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.770\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n246\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.180\n&gt;&gt; I mean, just implementing something\nlike a policy saying, you know what?\n\n247\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.310\nLet me call you right back.\n\n248\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.870\nOr whatever your protocol is for\n\n249\n00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.410\nyour company can really help mitigate\nthose types of attacks from happening.\n\n250\n00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.010\n&gt;&gt; Yes, a good security policy\nin place and good training so\n\n251\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.550\nthat they could adhere to\nthe policy is what's gonna end up\n\n252\n00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.830\nmaking your business a little bit safer.\n\n253\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.200\nThey also, you know we also called out\nsome other ones that are common, right?\n\n254\n00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.520\nYou probably heard of things\nlike phishing scams, right?\n\n255\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.800\nA little popular in email, were looks\nlike it's a bank of America saying, hey\n\n256\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.880\nyour security, your information was almost\nreached but don't worry it's secured.\n\n257\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.701\nJust go ahead and login and\nchange your password.\n\n258\n00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:04.207\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n259\n00:13:04.207 --> 00:13:07.696\n&gt;&gt; When really what's happen is they\nspoofed the IP, they spoofed the webpage.\n\n260\n00:13:07.696 --> 00:13:11.815\nIt looks like the same webpage of Bank of\nAmerica and when you put in your username\n\n261\n00:13:11.815 --> 00:13:16.242\nand password, it's really just capturing\nthat information and sending it to a third\n\n262\n00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:19.640\nparty in which they can login as you and\ndrain your bank account.\n\n263\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.330\nThere's also vishing, as well.\n\n264\n00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.370\nVishing is a voice over IP, it's where\nI'm trying to get any information over\n\n265\n00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.140\nyour voice over IP system.\n\n266\n00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.340\nThere's also a spear phishing,\n\n267\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.440\nsome times it's called whaling,\nwhen we talk about spear phishing,\n\n268\n00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.890\nI like the term whaling it's always,\nthinking of attacking the big fish.\n\n269\n00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.140\n&gt;&gt; It's banking in your thought, right?\n\n270\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:37.720\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n271\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.174\n&gt;&gt; So spear phishing is\na targeted pishing attack, and\n\n272\n00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.840\nit's usually against the big leagues,\nright?\n\n273\n00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.120\nCIOs, CEOs.\n\n274\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:44.950\nProbably not the CIO.\n\n275\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.963\n&gt;&gt; Unless I just have a personal\nvendetta against you, right?\n\n276\n00:13:46.963 --> 00:13:47.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That could be,\n\n277\n00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.600\nthat could be, that could be.\n\n278\n00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.650\nMaybe, and\nthat's not really too off the mark either.\n\n279\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.850\nIf you talk about things\nlike malicious insiders.\n\n280\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; They could do a spear\n\n281\n00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.310\nphishing attack where they're attacking\nthe boss because they just got fired,\n\n282\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.930\nso that's a very valid thing.\n\n283\n00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.330\nSo we also got vhishing,\nI'm trying to think.\n\n284\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.870\nI don't think I forgot any, I'm sure\nthere's many different kinds out there.\n\n285\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.680\nBut these are just some\nof the common ones.\n\n286\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.440\nSpam, email, again, don't open your emails\nif you don't know where they come from.\n\n287\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.430\nThese can all lead to some kind\nof social engineering tab.\n\n288\n00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.130\nJust remember that social engineering\nreally boils down to this.\n\n289\n00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.040\nI'm trying to gain your credentials so\n\n290\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.020\nthat I can mount an attack\nagainst your system.\n\n291\n00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.410\nThat's really, I need to gain some\nkind of way to authenticate and\n\n292\n00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.890\nprove that even though I'm not you,\nit looks like you to the system.\n\n293\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.940\nCuz remember, once I've got your\ncredentials, there's no real way for\n\n294\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.330\nthe system to know that you aren't the one\nthat's entering those credentials.\n\n295\n00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.580\nAll right, so the next thing that we have,\nthis is kind of an interesting topic here.\n\n296\n00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.990\nThis is what's known as VLAN hopping and\nas you go on to higher level\n\n297\n00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.012\ncertifications, you will\nlearn much more about this.\n\n298\n00:14:53.012 --> 00:14:56.588\nBut VLAN hopping essentially is when,\nwhat are VLAN's?\n\n299\n00:14:56.588 --> 00:15:00.980\nOkay, again let's step back a little back,\nremember VLANs, its a way basically,\n\n300\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.980\nlogically divide the switch\nin the more than one switch.\n\n301\n00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.020\nRight if you talk about VLAN\nin a local area networks what\n\n302\n00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.870\nwe are doing is we got\na managed switch and\n\n303\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.080\nwe can logically divide ports of them and\nwe can group them together.\n\n304\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.120\nIn a way that makes them look like\na single local area network it's\n\n305\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.130\ncalled the virtual local area network.\n\n306\n00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.640\nAnd this is good because then we can\nimplement things like ACL's that for\n\n307\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.640\none if you're not in that VLAN\nyou don't communicate, right?\n\n308\n00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.883\nThen we can implement access control list\nand if we need routing we can implement\n\n309\n00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:32.432\nlayer three routing to handle\ncommunications between the VLANs or\n\n310\n00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:36.544\nwhat if there's a way that I can make\nthe switch think I should be on that VLAN,\n\n311\n00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:38.227\nwhere I really shouldn't be.\n\n312\n00:15:38.227 --> 00:15:41.278\nAnd that's VLAN hopping and I will\nan example, there's a basic example of\n\n313\n00:15:41.278 --> 00:15:44.103\none that I have got up here,this\nis called switch spoofing, right.\n\n314\n00:15:44.103 --> 00:15:48.410\nWe've got switch spoofing,you present to\none of the switches that is is handling\n\n315\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.400\nthe VLANs for\n\n316\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.020\nyou that you're a valid switch,\nthat's need access to a trump port, right.\n\n317\n00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.004\nThe trump port is multiple\nVLANs communicate through them.\n\n318\n00:15:57.004 --> 00:16:01.346\nSo if I can make this switch\nhere think right as an attacker.\n\n319\n00:16:01.346 --> 00:16:04.678\nI can make this switch think that I'm\na valid switch that should have access to\n\n320\n00:16:04.678 --> 00:16:05.455\nthat trunk port.\n\n321\n00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:09.596\nWell then, I could just basically\nsend my communication into anyone of\n\n322\n00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:14.151\nthe VLANs because all of these VLANs send\ntheir information over that one trunk\n\n323\n00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:14.990\nfor, right?\n\n324\n00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.842\nThis is 802.1Q that we're talking about,\nthe VLAN tagging unit.\n\n325\n00:16:18.842 --> 00:16:21.937\nThe other way that we can\ndo a VLAN hopping as well,\n\n326\n00:16:21.937 --> 00:16:25.032\nis to do what's known as double tagging.\n\n327\n00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:30.280\nAll right, when double tagging happens if\nI can send information into this switch,\n\n328\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.880\nthen it's going to look and\n\n329\n00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.870\ngonna inspect the 802.1Q VLAN tag and\nit's going to remove it, right?\n\n330\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.170\nWell since we've double tagged it,\nwhen it gets passed to the next switch,\n\n331\n00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:45.960\neven though we're not on that VLAN it's\ngonna inspect that second VLAN tag,\n\n332\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.980\nand it could basically put it out to be\nVLAN 20, in this case as an example here.\n\n333\n00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.966\nBecause it didn't realize that\nthere was another tag before it.\n\n334\n00:16:53.966 --> 00:16:55.760\nIt didn't even inspect it,\nthat's double tag.\n\n335\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.500\nSo basically it's putting more than\none of those 802.1Q tags there.\n\n336\n00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.810\nAnd when the first one's removed,\nit's sent into the second VLAN switch.\n\n337\n00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.760\nThe second VLAN switch actually sees the\nhidden VLAN tag that allows it to hop on\n\n338\n00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.714\nto, in this case, VLAN 20.\n\n339\n00:17:11.714 --> 00:17:17.310\nSo basically, bypassing what the purpose\nwas for the VLANs to begin with.\n\n340\n00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.820\nSo, that is another thing.\n\n341\n00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.810\nOther things they call out to is\na more generic here if you will.\n\n342\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.820\nThey talk about compromise systems.\n\n343\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.580\nCompromise systems, guys.\n\n344\n00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.890\nThis is exactly what it sounds, way back\nin the first part of this mini-series\n\n345\n00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.280\nwhen we talked about distributed denial of\nservice attacks, Cherokee had mentioned\n\n346\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.900\na term called in the botnets where\nshe mentioned zombies, right?\n\n347\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.800\nDrones if you will not only drones\nare the one that are flying\n\n348\n00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.060\naround with remote controls,\nbut these are zombie machines,\n\n349\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.390\nthese are machines that have been\naffected with a piece of malware but\n\n350\n00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.710\nnow has been listening out for\nsome kind of execution command.\n\n351\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.790\nRemember they all execute at one once,\n\n352\n00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.150\nsimultaneously against the single target,\nright?\n\n353\n00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:00.160\nWell that's a compromised system.\n\n354\n00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.830\nAnytime you have any kind of exploit,\na vulnerability, right,\n\n355\n00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:10.380\nthat vulnerability has been targeted and\nexploited, and somebody can hop off\n\n356\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.430\nof your computer to attack somebody else,\nthen you've got a compromised system.\n\n357\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.470\nFor instance, things like FTP servers\nthat allow for anonymous log-ons.\n\n358\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.448\nWe typically don't do that any more but\nthere might be out there,\n\n359\n00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:24.223\nI'm sure there are with how many\npeople are on the Internet.\n\n360\n00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:27.871\nI can do an FFTP bounce attack because\nnow that I've logged onto their server\n\n361\n00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:30.210\nanonymously, they really\ndon't know who I am.\n\n362\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.620\nAnd if I can get past that, then I can\nuse their server, a compromised system,\n\n363\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.190\nto attack another server or\nanother end point.\n\n364\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.960\nOther basics that they have here as well,\n\n365\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.480\nthey talk about the effect\nof malware on the network.\n\n366\n00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.000\nGuys, that should be pretty obvious.\n\n367\n00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.650\nMight not be, and that's understandable.\n\n368\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:50.710\nIt's one of the reasons these\npieces of malware are why\n\n369\n00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.010\nthey do what they do\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n370\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.780\nWhy they could be very\neffective in spreading, right?\n\n371\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.407\nA lot of times what you'll see\nare things like, for instance,\n\n372\n00:19:03.407 --> 00:19:04.921\njust sporadic activity.\n\n373\n00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:09.129\nYou could just see sporadic things\nhappening on your network that's all of\n\n374\n00:19:09.129 --> 00:19:10.420\na sudden.\n\n375\n00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.737\nKind of we talked about memory diagnosis.\n\n376\n00:19:12.737 --> 00:19:15.839\nDiagnosing memory is very hard\nbecause it causes very sporadic\n\n377\n00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.130\nissues that are here one day and\ngone the next.\n\n378\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.340\nIt could be the fact that you\nare spreading something like a worm, and\n\n379\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.230\nif you are spreading something like a\nworm, a worm it's a self replicating piece\n\n380\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.610\nof malicious code that hacks from computer\nto computer consuming all the resources\n\n381\n00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:35.310\nand then replicate itself, doesn't need a\nhost to pick it back on like a virus does.\n\n382\n00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.691\nAnd essentially consume all the resources\nwhether be the memory of a single server\n\n383\n00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:44.010\nor the network adapter of a single server\nor multiple devices across your network\n\n384\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.139\nthat it's now consuming and your network\ncomes to pretty much a stand still or\n\n385\n00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:51.502\na crawl when it comes to its ban\nwith the through put, not ban but\n\n386\n00:19:51.502 --> 00:19:53.057\nit'll be your through put.\n\n387\n00:19:53.057 --> 00:19:55.846\nAll right, some of the other things\nthat they talk about, insider threat,\n\n388\n00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:56.990\nmalicious employee, right?\n\n389\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:02.270\nWe talk about, we commonly say that a lot\nof your problems will come from within.\n\n390\n00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.670\nAgain, somebody who's fired, maybe\nan administrator that's left things like\n\n391\n00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.390\nBackdoor or\nAccess that now can compromise a system.\n\n392\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.470\nFor instance, so you also have to do\nemployee screening I mean it just has to\n\n393\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.880\nhappen especially if you've got\nan environment that is heavily secured you\n\n394\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.090\nmight have a screen policy\nthat's in place but\n\n395\n00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.490\na lot of times these insiders or malicious\ninsiders if you will, malicious employees\n\n396\n00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.350\nyou have to definitely be careful when\nyou get rid of them, make sure that you\n\n397\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.830\nhave things like Passwords that are\nchanged or accounts that are temporarily\n\n398\n00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:39.250\ndisabled until an administrator can\nget in there and use them as well.\n\n399\n00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't wanna be a Debbie Downer\nand mention the policies again.\n\n400\n00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:48.000\nSo I'm glad you did because having\nthose things configured our set of\n\n401\n00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.530\nthat ahead of time is going to make\nthat painful process even less painful,\n\n402\n00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.910\nbecause you don't wanna have those kind\nof conversations as an after thought.\n\n403\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the one thing I got to\nmake sure if that you don't delete\n\n404\n00:20:58.857 --> 00:20:59.561\nthe accounts.\n\n405\n00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:00.584\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Because we know that's not\n\n406\n00:21:00.584 --> 00:21:02.378\nthe way to do it,\nyou don't just delete the accounts,\n\n407\n00:21:02.378 --> 00:21:04.650\nbecause you'll lose access to\nwhatever the employee had access to.\n\n408\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.980\nSo, definitely we have\nto worry about that.\n\n409\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.150\nThey also call out things like for\ninstance zero day exploits.\n\n410\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:15.090\nA zero day exploit means it was found\ntoday and nobody else knows about it.\n\n411\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.791\nThese can be very problematic because\nif a hacker finds an exploit and\n\n412\n00:21:19.791 --> 00:21:24.166\nwe don't have some kind of patch\nsecurity fix, if you will, for\n\n413\n00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:28.130\nthis exploit and\nit's the very first one of its kind.\n\n414\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.241\nWell, then how far will it propagate\nbefore we actually get to stop it?\n\n415\n00:21:32.241 --> 00:21:35.605\n&gt;&gt; And it was kind of interesting,\nI remember reading a statistic,\n\n416\n00:21:35.605 --> 00:21:37.143\nI think it was from Symantec.\n\n417\n00:21:37.143 --> 00:21:39.285\nAnd the name zero-day\nis a little misleading.\n\n418\n00:21:39.285 --> 00:21:44.117\nBut like Wes just said, there has\nbeen a solution found for zero days.\n\n419\n00:21:44.117 --> 00:21:47.013\nA zero day attack,\nI wanna say was almost about a year.\n\n420\n00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:51.470\nAround 265 days that it takes before\nthis particular zero day has been\n\n421\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.460\ndiscovered and resolved.\n\n422\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.950\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's scary when you think about it.\n\n423\n00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.510\nIt just almost a year.\n\n424\n00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.470\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; Before it gets patched.\n\n425\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.270\nThat's exactly I've just from\nthis day right going forward or\n\n426\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.870\nswear that 200 something days you know\nends before it's patch this is the very,\n\n427\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.962\nyou wanna say first day a week just\nfounded out could be a minutes ago.\n\n428\n00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:15.320\nAnd that's why the things like heuristics\nand sample submissions are very good.\n\n429\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.241\nI'm an advocate.\n\n430\n00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:19.981\nI know some people for privacy concerns\ndon't like to do automatic sample\n\n431\n00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:23.722\nsubmission where they take a portion\nof code maybe that they've found and\n\n432\n00:22:23.722 --> 00:22:27.220\nyou submit it to the cloud or\nyou submit it to the manufacturer.\n\n433\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.590\nI'm an advocate for this and\nit's not necessarily for privacy concerns.\n\n434\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.750\nI don't really worry about that, it's just\nthe fact that if I've got that problem,\n\n435\n00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.980\nand I can do anything\nto help somebody else,\n\n436\n00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.400\nlike Cherokee's machine be patched from\nthat, then I certainly don't mind.\n\n437\n00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.010\nAnd again, I know there's many people\n\n438\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.290\nof each side of the river on that one so,\nI'm definitely for that.\n\n439\n00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:49.920\nNow that being said,\n\n440\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.510\nwe finally have reach the error before\nwe get into the threats if you will.\n\n441\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.020\nI know there was a threat.\n\n442\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.510\nThe vulnerabilities themselves,\n\n443\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.940\nI said at the beginning this we've\nbeen talking about vulnerabilities.\n\n444\n00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.620\nWe're really been talking about\nsome of the threats right.\n\n445\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.369\nThe attacks that people can\ntake against the machine.\n\n446\n00:23:07.369 --> 00:23:10.725\nNow we are gonna talk about the\nvulnerability things that leave us open to\n\n447\n00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:11.890\nan attack.\n\n448\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.105\nRight, how do I leave myself to\na denial of service service attack?\n\n449\n00:23:16.105 --> 00:23:19.865\nWell, I'm running a NTP server and\nI don't need to be.\n\n450\n00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:23.625\nRight, I've got a domain controller,\nit is the master time clock.\n\n451\n00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:26.285\nI don't maybe need another NTP server,\nright?\n\n452\n00:23:26.285 --> 00:23:29.205\n&gt;&gt; Like that protocol abuse that\nyou were just mentioning as well,\n\n453\n00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:31.175\nthat would be considered\nvulnerabilities too, right?\n\n454\n00:23:31.175 --> 00:23:31.845\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n455\n00:23:31.845 --> 00:23:35.910\nSo for instance, unnecessary services\nthat are running on your machine.\n\n456\n00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.761\nRemember when were doing\nthings like port scans.\n\n457\n00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:43.690\nIf I can see that you got port 80,\nport 443, port 389,\n\n458\n00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.820\nport 88, port 53 open you have\nto stop it and rewind it right.\n\n459\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.860\nDo remember all those ports I can\ntell you running a domain controller.\n\n460\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:52.484\nWhy?\n\n461\n00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:55.847\nPort 88, it's carver us or\nKerberos how do you want to say it.\n\n462\n00:23:55.847 --> 00:23:58.020\nRight, port 80, port 443.\n\n463\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.571\nChances are you're probably running some\nkind of IIFs, the fact that you're running\n\n464\n00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:06.082\nDNS off of port 443 and\nyou're running the elder ports as well.\n\n465\n00:24:06.082 --> 00:24:10.811\nRight, if you need these services by\nall means, you need to keep them up and\n\n466\n00:24:10.811 --> 00:24:15.618\nyou can't communicate, but if I've got\nIIS Running on a server that's not\n\n467\n00:24:15.618 --> 00:24:19.545\ngonna be a web server,\nthat's a big vulnerability, right?\n\n468\n00:24:19.545 --> 00:24:23.236\nHTTP can be very, very exploited.\n\n469\n00:24:23.236 --> 00:24:24.514\nIt's why we use HTTPS.\n\n470\n00:24:24.514 --> 00:24:27.020\nSo keep in mind that how\nwould I disable those ports?\n\n471\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.210\nI'm gonna shutdown the service.\n\n472\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.700\nIf you're not using the service,\nfor instance,\n\n473\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.920\nmaybe I turned on\nthe Windows Remote Management, right?\n\n474\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.760\nPort 5985, just random port I remember.\n\n475\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.510\nI'm doing PowerShell remoting.\n\n476\n00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.020\nI only needed to do it one time.\n\n477\n00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.170\nWell, there's no reason\nto leave that port open.\n\n478\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.450\nYou go into the server and\nyou do a stop-service winrm and\n\n479\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.840\nshut the service down and\nit closes the port down.\n\n480\n00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.985\nAnd that would be the combination\nof what they talk about,\n\n481\n00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:53.550\nunnecessary running service and\nopen ports.\n\n482\n00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.740\nNow not every port can you close, right?\n\n483\n00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.825\nIf we close the ports down,\n\n484\n00:24:56.825 --> 00:25:00.190\nthen we don't have communications between\nthe applications that need to use them.\n\n485\n00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:02.880\nYou just need to do things like\nvulnerability assessments.\n\n486\n00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.030\nI think you've mentioned in past episodes\nwe were running things like the Microsoft\n\n487\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.810\nBaseline Security Analyzer and finding\nout these things that might be running.\n\n488\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.430\nDo you have more than one admin that maybe\nhas a password set not to expire, right?\n\n489\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.595\nAnd I don't need that admin.\n\n490\n00:25:15.595 --> 00:25:18.920\nI should probably disable that account\nto make sure that it's people can't gain\n\n491\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.170\naccess to it.\n\n492\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.990\nUnpatched and legacy systems,\nwe've already mentioned that, right?\n\n493\n00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.620\nCherokee mentioned that in the last\nepisode when we were talking about keeping\n\n494\n00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.140\nolder devices around.\n\n495\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.435\nOr being forced to keep devices around,\nright?\n\n496\n00:25:31.435 --> 00:25:32.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And we can't run AES,\n\n497\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.340\nwe can't run WPA2, so\n\n498\n00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.040\nwe have to run something like\nthe older WPA with TKIP, right?\n\n499\n00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.640\nWell, that's a legacy system,\nand even if it is patched,\n\n500\n00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.580\nwe're running an older protocol and\nthe protocol itself is vulnerable.\n\n501\n00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.060\nSo keep in mind that even if you\ndo have a patched legacy system,\n\n502\n00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.620\nat a certain point that system is\nno longer going to be supported,\n\n503\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.570\nit's going to be at the end of life cycle,\nwhich means from that point on,\n\n504\n00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.250\nyou're not going to get any more patches.\n\n505\n00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.740\nSo if they can find additional exploits,\n\n506\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:01.330\nit's up to you to figure out how\nyou're going to secure your network.\n\n507\n00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:02.890\nWhat else do we have?\n\n508\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.740\nUnencrypted channels, right?\n\n509\n00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.070\nUse encryption.\n\n510\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.240\nRemember, we said wired equivalent\nprivacy is the equivalent of wired\n\n511\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.740\nprivacy on a wired network,\nwhich is none, right?\n\n512\n00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.920\nWell, that doesn't matter if you plug into\na network and you're not using something\n\n513\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:20.880\nlike IPsec or maybe Secure FTP, or\nSSH to configure your endpoints,\n\n514\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.590\nthen you've got unencrypted\ncommunications that are going on.\n\n515\n00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.630\nAnd the problem with that is that somebody\ncould get out there with a protocol\n\n516\n00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.900\nanalyzer and packet capture and\nthey could steal this information and\n\n517\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.140\nuse it to reverse engineer your\nnetwork if they needed to.\n\n518\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.930\nAll right,\nclear text credential protocols.\n\n519\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.140\nOne that comes to mind right away is\npassword authentication protocol.\n\n520\n00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.090\nWe typically aren't using it anymore.\n\n521\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.865\nWe really shouldn't be using it.\n\n522\n00:26:42.865 --> 00:26:45.675\nBut when you talk about things\nlike your VPN communications or\n\n523\n00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:49.115\nwas a way you could use something\nlike password or PAP, if you will.\n\n524\n00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:51.485\nAnd it sense that it's\nan authentication protocol.\n\n525\n00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.525\nIt does nothing with encryption,\nit just says,\n\n526\n00:26:53.525 --> 00:26:57.029\nthis is the mechanism you're gonna use to\npass your credentials to your endpoint.\n\n527\n00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:59.333\nAnd if they're in clear text like that,\nwell, again,\n\n528\n00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:01.943\nsomebody can scrape that information and\nmake it log in as you.\n\n529\n00:27:01.943 --> 00:27:05.579\nAnd keep in mind, once they have your\ncredentials, there's no way for that end\n\n530\n00:27:05.579 --> 00:27:09.340\nsystem to know that it's not you that's\nlogging in, it's actually the hacker.\n\n531\n00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.080\nAll right, we've got a couple more\nthings that I wanna talk about.\n\n532\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.910\nI'm gonna go ahead and jump over some\nof these protocols there, Cherokee.\n\n533\n00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:21.890\nKinda go off the beaten path here, and\nI wanna talk real quick about Tempest and\n\n534\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.540\nRF emanation, if I can say that word.\n\n535\n00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.680\nYou have radio frequencies,\nyou have electrofrequencies,\n\n536\n00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.530\nelectromagnetic frequencies, if you will,\nthat are emanating off of most of\n\n537\n00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.840\nthe devices that you use when\nyou plug them into power, right?\n\n538\n00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.490\nSo, for instance, we've got our laptops\nand our laptops that this point\n\n539\n00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.010\nare connected to the wired network so\nwe're okay but we also have monitors and\n\n540\n00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.350\nwireless adapters that are emanating\ninformation off of there.\n\n541\n00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.030\nAnd there are ways that they can,\nif they can get close enough,\n\n542\n00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.040\nthey can scrape some of that\ninformation and kind of rebuild it and\n\n543\n00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.613\nsee what's on your desktop,\nsee what's on your laptops.\n\n544\n00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.240\nAnd that's why they talk about using\nthings like tempershields that can block\n\n545\n00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.860\nthat electromagnetic inter,\nit's not interference, but\n\n546\n00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.630\nelectromagnetic energy from emanating\nout into areas that it should not.\n\n547\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.590\nSo you definitely have\nto worry about that.\n\n548\n00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.270\nAgain, you talk about unbounded media,\nwireless communications,\n\n549\n00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:13.650\nBluetooth communications, cellular\ncommunications, this is all radiated\n\n550\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.560\nenergy, it's emanating from some kind of\naccess point, from some kind of device.\n\n551\n00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.350\nAnd if I can get in the middle, I've got\na way that I can scrape that information,\n\n552\n00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.750\nthen I can probably rebuild it eventually,\nand\n\n553\n00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.710\nmaybe use it as an exploit\non your network.\n\n554\n00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.840\n&gt;&gt; And there's even a really cool concept,\nI can't for the life of me think of\n\n555\n00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.230\nthe exact terminology now, but the preface\nbehind it is going to be that there\n\n556\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.910\nare really unusual methods in which one\ncan obtain authentication information\n\n557\n00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:44.070\nsuch as measuring those clock cycles and\nthen being able to get that info.\n\n558\n00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.614\nOr even looking at heat maps, technical,\nlike the actual temperature of the CPU and\n\n559\n00:28:48.614 --> 00:28:49.900\nthings of that nature.\n\n560\n00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.844\nSo pretty fancy stuff we're talking there\nbut still you got to think about it,\n\n561\n00:28:53.844 --> 00:28:54.750\nit's possible.\n\n562\n00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.795\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, and\nas much as it might sound like, gosh,\n\n563\n00:28:57.795 --> 00:29:00.790\nwe're the people with the tin\nfoil hats walking around.\n\n564\n00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:01.760\nIt's not that way.\n\n565\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.310\nYou could have a very, very highly\nprotected network, like say military,\n\n566\n00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.830\nif you will.\n\n567\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.820\nAnd it's gonna be a little\nharder with military base.\n\n568\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.930\nCuz I've been to Gunter Air Force Base and\ndid some training for\n\n569\n00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.570\ntheir emergency business\nmanagement systems.\n\n570\n00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.138\nAnd yeah, you're not getting on\nthat base unless you have a pass.\n\n571\n00:29:17.138 --> 00:29:20.498\nBut if you have to think about just to\ntake it away from the military side, but\n\n572\n00:29:20.498 --> 00:29:21.285\nif you still got,\n\n573\n00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:24.982\nmaybe you've got a Department of Defense\ncontract, maybe your company, right?\n\n574\n00:29:24.982 --> 00:29:29.254\nConnects to some kind of networks, if\nyou will, that you need just the at most\n\n575\n00:29:29.254 --> 00:29:33.072\nprivacy and security cuz you're\nworking on patented information or\n\n576\n00:29:33.072 --> 00:29:37.590\npatented technologies that are gonna\nbe used in that type of environment.\n\n577\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.190\nWell, you need to make sure that you're\ntaking these things into consideration\n\n578\n00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.260\nbecause-\n&gt;&gt; Even the cabling.\n\n579\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.052\n&gt;&gt; They will.\nWhat's that?\n\n580\n00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:42.868\nYeah,definitely.\n\n581\n00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:44.711\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know that you buy into\nthat rating, the TEMPEST rating.\n\n582\n00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:45.634\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n583\n00:29:45.634 --> 00:29:50.354\nSo definitely pay attention to the fact\nthat you always have things like radio\n\n584\n00:29:50.354 --> 00:29:51.160\nfrequency.\n\n585\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.560\nI know they call RF Emanation so\nthey're probably, or yeah, emanation.\n\n586\n00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.520\nSo they're probably talking more wireless\ndevices here but just like we've also\n\n587\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.800\nmentioned, you can also do it with\nelectromagnetic frequencies as well or\n\n588\n00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.250\nelectromagnetic energy too.\n\n589\n00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.810\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n590\n00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.690\nNow the last thing I wanna talk about\nare some of the unsecure protocols that\n\n591\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.100\nthey call out and\nI've got a list of them here.\n\n592\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.570\nAnd there's really nothing fancy\nabout this list, unfortunately,\n\n593\n00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.250\nit's just a bunch of information that\nyou need to memorize for the test.\n\n594\n00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.900\nJust kidding, not really [LAUGH].\n\n595\n00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.820\nOne of the things I want you to remember\nthat these protocols here they do\n\n596\n00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.220\nopen us up to vulnerabilities and\n\n597\n00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:28.770\nwe really shouldn't be using them\nwith things like authentication.\n\n598\n00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.250\nSo, for instance, Telnet,\nTelnet is a great protocol,\n\n599\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.280\nI used it, I've used it quite a bit.\n\n600\n00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.610\nYou might say, well, wait a second,\nWes, but you told us not to use it.\n\n601\n00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.790\nWell, I'm using it to test whether\na certain port is connected,\n\n602\n00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.440\nlet's say against the mail server, right?\n\n603\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.810\nI just wanna know is port 25 open, right?\n\n604\n00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.922\nWell, I can use Telnet and I can connect\nthere and find if that port's open but\n\n605\n00:30:48.922 --> 00:30:52.098\nTelnet in itself is using it for\nremote log on is Cleartext.\n\n606\n00:30:52.098 --> 00:30:55.855\nWhich means that if I have a protocol in\na larger packet capture utility out there\n\n607\n00:30:55.855 --> 00:30:59.891\nand I grab that information, well, I could\nsee what's going on on your network, and\n\n608\n00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:02.550\nI can see what's going on\nbetween that communication.\n\n609\n00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:07.010\nSo Telnet, port 23, Cleartext,\nstay away from it if you can.\n\n610\n00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.380\nUse things like SSH.\n\n611\n00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:13.050\nAnd we'll talk more about\nthat in another episode.\n\n612\n00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:17.010\nNext one they call out here,\ntoo guys, is they call out HTTP,\n\n613\n00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.050\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol.\n\n614\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.170\nKeep in mind that when it comes to HTTP,\n\n615\n00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.140\nit's another one of those that's\nCleartext protocol, right?\n\n616\n00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.920\nIt's a request response type protocol\nwhere you connect to a server, you make\n\n617\n00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.650\na request, and if the server's got that\nresource, it sends it back to you and\n\n618\n00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:36.700\nthe web browser locally renders it so you\ncan see the webpage, the html if you will.\n\n619\n00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.150\nIt's all done in Cleartext.\n\n620\n00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.990\nSo if I can get in between you and\ncommunications with that web server,\n\n621\n00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.370\nthen I can potentially see what you're\ndoing and maybe use that to leap stone,\n\n622\n00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.760\nif you will, or\ncatapult into another type of attack.\n\n623\n00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.870\nThey also mentioned SLIP here.\n\n624\n00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.136\nI don't think you're really gonna see it\ntoo much unless you're maybe dealing with\n\n625\n00:31:55.136 --> 00:31:56.471\nsome devices that are in a museum.\n\n626\n00:31:56.471 --> 00:31:59.746\nSLIP is the Serial Line Internet Protocol.\n\n627\n00:31:59.746 --> 00:32:02.543\nIt was the predecessor,\ndid I say that right?\n\n628\n00:32:02.543 --> 00:32:05.760\nYeah, predecessor to PPP,\nthe Point-to-point protocol,\n\n629\n00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.500\nif I get that right, and\nit was a clear text protocol.\n\n630\n00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.461\nWhen we went to PPP the point-to-point\nprotocol this allowed\n\n631\n00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:15.490\nan encrypted password over a serial line.\n\n632\n00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.205\nSLIP is obsolete today,\nI wouldn't worry about it.\n\n633\n00:32:18.205 --> 00:32:22.135\nExcept for on the exam they might ask you\nit when it comes to an unsecure protocol.\n\n634\n00:32:22.135 --> 00:32:25.245\nSome of the other ones that they\nhave here, FTP, oldie but goodie,\n\n635\n00:32:25.245 --> 00:32:26.345\njust like Telnet.\n\n636\n00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:29.545\nVery, very highly optimized,\nif you will, for large file transfer.\n\n637\n00:32:29.545 --> 00:32:32.517\nBut the problem is,\nthere again, it is clear text,\n\n638\n00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:36.477\nthat's why you typically wanna implement\nthis with some kind of SSL if you will or\n\n639\n00:32:36.477 --> 00:32:39.957\nsome kind of encryption,\nyou get secure file transfer protocol.\n\n640\n00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:44.007\nTFTP, this is a strip down\nUDP version of FTP, and\n\n641\n00:32:44.007 --> 00:32:47.597\nwe've already talked about [LAUGH] UDP and\nsome of the flaws, it has,\n\n642\n00:32:47.597 --> 00:32:51.697\nit's not really flaws, it's just the facts\nthat some of the things that it doesn't\n\n643\n00:32:51.697 --> 00:32:56.510\nhave or the way that it acts can be\nexploited in anything over UDP can.\n\n644\n00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.887\nTrivial file transfer protocol is\njust stripped down that the fact,\n\n645\n00:32:59.887 --> 00:33:03.374\nissue the commands like you can in FTP and\nit does go over UTP, so again,\n\n646\n00:33:03.374 --> 00:33:06.715\nit's also one of those once it's\na clear text and can be exploited.\n\n647\n00:33:06.715 --> 00:33:10.264\nNow, the last two that we talked about\nis the simple management protocol and\n\n648\n00:33:10.264 --> 00:33:13.648\nthe very first one, we should be\ncompletely stay away from it completely\n\n649\n00:33:13.648 --> 00:33:17.330\nbecause there is no protection on\nthe simple network management protocol 1.\n\n650\n00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.344\nThey didn't pull a little bit of security,\n\n651\n00:33:21.344 --> 00:33:25.475\nlittle bit of security\nif you will in SNMP 2.\n\n652\n00:33:25.475 --> 00:33:28.723\nThey allowed you this communities and\nthe communities could be read,\n\n653\n00:33:28.723 --> 00:33:32.350\nwrite they could be read only but\nit still has both ability as well.\n\n654\n00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.720\nAnd ultimately today you should\nbe using SNMP version 3.\n\n655\n00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:41.690\nKeep in mind that if you are in\na completely isolated, isolated network.\n\n656\n00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.161\nSNMP version 2 is not bad.\n\n657\n00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:47.304\nIt's a little less complex to\nset up than SMP version 3, but\n\n658\n00:33:47.304 --> 00:33:52.988\nwhen it comes down to it, you're gonna be\nwanting to be using that protocol instead\n\n659\n00:33:52.988 --> 00:33:58.860\nbecause it has the most security and it is\nthe newer protocol and the recommendation.\n\n660\n00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.410\nSo be aware of these protocols.\n\n661\n00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.800\nMake sure that your aware\nof them on the exam.\n\n662\n00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.600\nKnow things like their port, so\nif they ask you, we see port 23 here.\n\n663\n00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.890\nWhat's going on?\n\n664\n00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:09.411\nWhy shouldn't I have?\n\n665\n00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:10.874\nWhy shouldn't I be using that?\n\n666\n00:34:10.874 --> 00:34:12.775\nI want you to know that it's Telnet.\n\n667\n00:34:12.775 --> 00:34:15.035\nAnd then understand how Telnet works so\n\n668\n00:34:15.035 --> 00:34:17.445\nthat you can get those\nanswers right on the exam.\n\n669\n00:34:17.445 --> 00:34:20.415\n&gt;&gt; Well that's pretty important to\nknow both the actual protocol name and\n\n670\n00:34:20.415 --> 00:34:21.045\nthe port numbers.\n\n671\n00:34:21.045 --> 00:34:21.705\nBecause like you said,\n\n672\n00:34:21.705 --> 00:34:25.965\nsometimes they might be represented\nby that numerical identity there.\n\n673\n00:34:25.965 --> 00:34:29.820\nAnd those are almost kind of\nlike gimme questions, right?\n\n674\n00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.340\nBecause it's easy, it's just memorization.\n\n675\n00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.570\nLike what I said, he said hey,\n\n676\n00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.310\nthis is the list, I kind kidding,\njoking, not joking thing.\n\n677\n00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.860\nBut definitely that's just gonna help you\nget through those questions a lot faster.\n\n678\n00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.810\nSo thank you so much, Wes, we finally,\nmade it through all this information,\n\n679\n00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.500\npart three, we did it.\n\n680\n00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.920\nBut ladies and gentlemen, stay tuned,\n\n681\n00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.350\nbecause we do have more\nNetPlus headed your way.\n\n682\n00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.030\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign off.\n\n683\n00:34:50.030

series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.570\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.168\nWhen it comes to configuring\ndifferent components throughout your\n\n8\n00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:20.952\nnetwork there's not just\na one size fits all.\n\n9\n00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:22.560\nAnd that's what we're\ngonna be covering today.\n\n10\n00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.460\nHow to harden different\ncomponents within our network?\n\n11\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.290\nSo we'll look at hardening techniques,\nand with us today we have Mr.\n\n12\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.540\nWes Bryan in studios.\n\n13\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.471\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.050\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back here.\n\n15\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.820\nIt's always a pleasure to be\nhere with the ITPro.TV crew.\n\n16\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.940\nThat's right, we're gonna look at some\nof the security techniques that you can\n\n17\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.890\nuse in order to make the devices.\n\n18\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.460\nAnd even some of the operating systems or\n\n19\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.810\nnodes in your network\na little bit more secure.\n\n20\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.350\nAnd it is gonna be something that's\nimportant in your networking career.\n\n21\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.548\nBecause one simple firewall, slip of a\nfirewall, configuration, turning it off or\n\n22\n00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:54.142\nany virus.\n\n23\n00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.821\nThis could do a lot of\nharm to your network, so\n\n24\n00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.474\nwe wanna make sure that you are aware of\nthese topics as well as preparing you for\n\n25\n00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:03.609\nthat CompTIA certification exam.\n\n26\n00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.119\nNow in past episodes, we have talked\nabout concepts like host-based and\n\n27\n00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.145\nnetwork based.\n\n28\n00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:11.025\nWell we're gonna start talking about here,\n\n29\n00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:15.135\none of the first things they call\nout is anti-malware software.\n\n30\n00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:17.785\nLet's step up for a second and\nredefine malware.\n\n31\n00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:21.290\nKeep in mind you might be thinking well,\nthat's antivirus software, right?\n\n32\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.465\nWell yes and no, any malware software,\nand remember that malware, right?\n\n33\n00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.180\nMalware is the umbrella term.\n\n34\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.660\nAnd underneath malware,\nwe have different types of malicious code\n\n35\n00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.370\nthat can basically perform unauthorized\nprocesses on our computer.\n\n36\n00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.810\nSo what is malware?\n\n37\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.971\nWell anything that's running on your\nmachine that you didn't put there.\n\n38\n00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:44.089\nAnd I'm not talking about the components\nwithin the operating system like updates,\n\n39\n00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:47.420\nbut more importantly any kind of\nprocess that is just unauthorized.\n\n40\n00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.333\nIt's not authorize by the operating system\nwe're on and isn't authorize by you.\n\n41\n00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.708\nSo it could be potentially malware, right?\n\n42\n00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:56.386\nSo when we talk about malware,\n\n43\n00:01:56.386 --> 00:02:00.530\nkeep in mind, we're talking about all\nof the bugs that fall under malware.\n\n44\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.060\nThings like viruses, things like Trojans,\nrootkits, botnets, worms, right?\n\n45\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.953\nBut if I talk about anti-virus then\nwe're just talking about looking for\n\n46\n00:02:08.953 --> 00:02:10.539\nvirus definitions, right?\n\n47\n00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.296\nKeep in mind that today because of\nthe fact that we're not just looking at\n\n48\n00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:15.283\nviruses anymore,\n\n49\n00:02:15.283 --> 00:02:19.480\nthey're a lot more sophisticated\nthan just the basic virus today.\n\n50\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.630\nWe did more of an all\nencompassing type of software.\n\n51\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.437\nNow where that software is located\nwithin your infrastructure,\n\n52\n00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:30.243\nwill tell you whether it's gonna\nbe a host base type of software or\n\n53\n00:02:30.243 --> 00:02:33.376\nit's gonna be network base or\neven today cloud base.\n\n54\n00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:35.077\nSo I got a little diagram here, and\n\n55\n00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:38.789\nthe only one I didn't put in the diagram\non my screen here is network based.\n\n56\n00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.141\nAnd that's because well that\none could be very big and\n\n57\n00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.652\nI couldn't fit that into the diagram, so\nI got a separate diagram for that one.\n\n58\n00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:47.490\nAnd we'll talk about each\none of these individually.\n\n59\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.570\nKeep in mind that we have\nthings like our host-based.\n\n60\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.873\nRemember, we have things like cloud based\nantimalware, as well as server based.\n\n61\n00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:58.460\nNow I understand, and\nunderstand this as well.\n\n62\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.500\nOn the exam, they talk about cloud and\nserver based.\n\n63\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.757\nKeep in mind, it's centralized\nantimalware protection, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:05.757 --> 00:03:08.882\nAnd that's unlike something\nlike a host-based anti,\n\n65\n00:03:08.882 --> 00:03:10.550\nand I put antivirus in there.\n\n66\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.323\nEven though I said, hey,\nthis is not called antivirus.\n\n67\n00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:13.441\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's called antimalware.\n\n68\n00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.190\nSo let me go ahead and\nfix my own slide here, right?\n\n69\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.430\nWhen we talk about antimalware\nhost-based what is going on here?\n\n70\n00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.370\nWhat we're talking about\njust reviewing and\n\n71\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.713\nscreening the activities that\nare happening on a single machine.\n\n72\n00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:30.730\nIt could be for instance,\nit could be a PC.\n\n73\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.400\nAnd I say PC in the strictest basic sense,\nwhether it's Windows, Macs, Linux or Unix.\n\n74\n00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.805\nIt's typically on a single\noperating system.\n\n75\n00:03:38.805 --> 00:03:42.310\nIt could be a server operating system,\ncould be a client side operating system.\n\n76\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.760\nBut host-based really only tries\nto protect a single device, right?\n\n77\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.152\nAnd that's why they call it host-based.\n\n78\n00:03:49.152 --> 00:03:52.180\nIt is protecting the host\nthat it is running on.\n\n79\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.799\nThat's a little bit different than\nsomething like for instance cloud based.\n\n80\n00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.910\nCloud based solutions today could\nbe protecting a lot of devices.\n\n81\n00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.138\nThis could be an Eterprise solution.\n\n82\n00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:06.234\nIt could be something small like\na home based cloud service,\n\n83\n00:04:06.234 --> 00:04:08.332\nlike McGaffey, or out there.\n\n84\n00:04:08.332 --> 00:04:14.090\nOr Norton is some of them, Semantic,\nthere's other ones out there, Trend Micro.\n\n85\n00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.330\nBut keep in mind that in cloud based,you\ncan do more than just a single\n\n86\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.940\ndevice, right?\n\n87\n00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.272\nYou can do multiple devices, and\nthat's one of the big things, and\n\n88\n00:04:21.272 --> 00:04:22.688\nmultiple types of devices.\n\n89\n00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:26.088\nFor example here, I've got your PC,\nwe've got laptops,\n\n90\n00:04:26.088 --> 00:04:29.360\nwe've got your mobile denies,\ncell phones, tablets.\n\n91\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.262\nCould be servers if you're\nin an Enterprise level.\n\n92\n00:04:31.262 --> 00:04:35.717\nKeep in mind, if it is Enterprise level\nand you're talking about protecting your\n\n93\n00:04:35.717 --> 00:04:39.721\nservers then you're talking about\nsomething that could be very costly,\n\n94\n00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:40.380\nall right.\n\n95\n00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.940\nNow we also have network based.\n\n96\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.596\nAnd you can probably see\nwhy I couldn't fit all of\n\n97\n00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:45.288\nthat-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n98\n00:04:45.288 --> 00:04:46.936\n&gt;&gt; In there because network based\n\n99\n00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.938\nantimalware solutions could be\ndeployed at multiple locations, right?\n\n100\n00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:53.588\nWith a host based,\nwe deploy it on one host, right?\n\n101\n00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.328\nand we do that times however many\nhosts are within our networks.\n\n102\n00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:58.359\nBut with a network based solution,\n\n103\n00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:01.820\nthis can be deployed in multiple\nareas within your network.\n\n104\n00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.855\nFor instance, you could have a gateway\ndevice that is performing some kind of\n\n105\n00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:09.070\nantimalware screening even before\nit hits something like your\n\n106\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.545\ndemilitarized zone in between\nyour two firewalls, right?\n\n107\n00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:15.750\nYou external firewall and\nyour internal firewall.\n\n108\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.250\nBut does that mean that\nonce the Edge antivirus,\n\n109\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.220\nor antimalware device has\ndone screening it, that\n\n110\n00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.440\nyou don't have to worry about anything\nanymore, then the answer is typically no.\n\n111\n00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.590\nSo you could have this in a larger\nEnterprise based network.\n\n112\n00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.905\nYou could have it deployed\nin multiple locations.\n\n113\n00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:37.310\nSo as an example here,\nwe've got a couple of subnets here.\n\n114\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.991\nAnd again, these could be logical too.\n\n115\n00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:42.224\nSo you could have one single device that\nis actually dividing your networks up\n\n116\n00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:42.779\ninto zones.\n\n117\n00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.378\nSo you could say physical or\nlogically, but keep in mind,\n\n118\n00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:51.161\nthat's one of the differences between\nthe network based and the host based.\n\n119\n00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:56.207\nThe network based is screening all of the\ntraffic from all hosts within the network.\n\n120\n00:05:56.207 --> 00:06:00.804\nVersus host based which is just really\nscreening the processes that are going on\n\n121\n00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:02.118\non the individual PC.\n\n122\n00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:06.048\n&gt;&gt; And I really like your diagram that\nyou showed with the cloud based and\n\n123\n00:06:06.048 --> 00:06:10.140\nthe server based because if you look\nat and contrast that with the host.\n\n124\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.351\nFor instance,\nif I have my laptop right here, and\n\n125\n00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:14.098\nI haven't scanned in a couple months.\n\n126\n00:06:14.098 --> 00:06:14.783\nDon't tell anyone.\n\n127\n00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:16.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But if that were the case,\n\n128\n00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.771\nthen that's my own prerogative and\nI don't have anyone yelling at.\n\n129\n00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:23.676\nBut in a business environment when you\nhave that centralized administration\n\n130\n00:06:23.676 --> 00:06:26.390\nwhether be the cloud or\na dedicated machine locally.\n\n131\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.818\nYou can set rules where that machine\nisn't allowed to connect to the Internet.\n\n132\n00:06:30.818 --> 00:06:34.854\nOr even on your network, if it doesn't\nhave the latest the most up to date\n\n133\n00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:37.119\ndefinitions with the new environment.\n\n134\n00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.870\nSo you kind of force people to do\nwhat you want them to do, right?\n\n135\n00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.157\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, so for\n\n136\n00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:44.358\nexample they have the older\nforefront end point protection.\n\n137\n00:06:44.358 --> 00:06:47.488\nI know some of you guys are out there,\nthat's all wrapped up into SCCM.\n\n138\n00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:51.469\nWell I know it's wrapped up into your\nsystem center technologies today but\n\n139\n00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.120\nit's still the same process.\n\n140\n00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.880\nWe just don't call it forefront\nendpoint protection any more.\n\n141\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.260\nWe're probably calling it system\ncenter endpoint protection by now, but\n\n142\n00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.830\nit's on a much larger scale.\n\n143\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.860\nAnd like Cherokee says, we can deploy\npolicies that say, you haven't checked it,\n\n144\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.731\nright Cherokee?\n\n145\n00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:06.231\nI'm the same way-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:07.098\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna jump in\n\n147\n00:07:07.098 --> 00:07:09.562\nthat same boat with you.\nI haven't checked my machine,\n\n148\n00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.971\nI don't think in the last two weeks,\neasily in the last two weeks.\n\n149\n00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:12.882\nAnd I should be,\n\n150\n00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:16.462\nbut in an Enterprise environment,\nyou cannot risk that kind of,\n\n151\n00:07:16.462 --> 00:07:20.670\nthat security vulnerability, right?\nSo we can deploy out policies that say,\n\n152\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.550\nhey, the moment your computer\nconnects to our network,\n\n153\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.220\nit better have antimalware on it.\nNot only should it be on, the definition\n\n154\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.510\ndatabase, whatever the criteria is\nthat we're using to identify malware,\n\n155\n00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.540\nthat needs to be up to date.\n\n156\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.524\nIt needs to be turned on and you might\neven have to have real time scanning\n\n157\n00:07:34.524 --> 00:07:37.280\ninvolved, too, so that we know\nthat the devices are connected.\n\n158\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.242\nAnd that's one of the great benefits of\nhaving something like a network deployment\n\n159\n00:07:41.242 --> 00:07:43.288\nwhen it comes to your malware protection.\n\n160\n00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:46.380\nSo you see host based solutions,\nyeah, they're great.\n\n161\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.257\nBut a lot of times unless they\nare controlled by an administrator, and\n\n162\n00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:51.176\nI am certainly not trying\nto pick on end users.\n\n163\n00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:55.707\nI am telling you I am one of the ones\nthat are not doing that myself.\n\n164\n00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:59.244\nBut that is one of the good things from\na security standpoint is that if you do\n\n165\n00:07:59.244 --> 00:08:02.784\nhave something like network based or\neven cloud based for that matter too,\n\n166\n00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:06.493\nYou typically have some kind of admin,\nwhere you can delegate administrative\n\n167\n00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:09.780\ncontrol out of these, and\nyou can make sure that they are happening.\n\n168\n00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.335\nSo again, keep in mind the difference\nbetween the host-based,\n\n169\n00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:17.710\nthe network-based, and\nthe cloud-based solutions.\n\n170\n00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.580\nNow they also call out some\ndifferent technologies when it\n\n171\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.610\ncomes to hardening your system Systems,\nand again,\n\n172\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.520\nkeep in mind that we're not only\ntalking about simple systems.\n\n173\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.740\nWe're also talking about more so\nthe network as well.\n\n174\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.920\nSo, another part of the network-hardening\ntechniques that we can implement,\n\n175\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.740\nis on a switch level.\n\n176\n00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.590\nAnd there are different things that\nwe can do on the switch level.\n\n177\n00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:43.140\nSo for instance, they talk about\nthings like DHCP snooping, all right.\n\n178\n00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.920\nWith DHCP snooping, one of the things\nthat this does, is this allows you to\n\n179\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.590\nessentially validate DHCP messages\nfrom untrusted sources, right.\n\n180\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.120\nSo, we had talked about\nit in a prior episode,\n\n181\n00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.210\nwe talked about the rogue access point,\nright.\n\n182\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.440\nAnd we said how very easy it\nis to cause a problem, and\n\n183\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.750\nit doesn't have to be intentional.\n\n184\n00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.660\nKeep in mind, I could put the black\nhat on and I could try to be\n\n185\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.860\nmaliciously doing this and the evil\nlaugh that comes along with it, but\n\n186\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.000\nit could just be something as\nsimple Is plugging the power in and\n\n187\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.490\nturning the device on and it's got\nDHCP server service running in it.\n\n188\n00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.940\nIt starts handling out IP addresses.\n\n189\n00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.680\nSo, wouldn't it be nice to have a switch\nthat could monitor those DHCP messages.\n\n190\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.490\nAnd if they come from an untrusted\nsource they could turn around and\n\n191\n00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.620\nthey can completely discard it.\n\n192\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.240\nIt's one of the great things about having\nDHCP snooping turn on on your switches.\n\n193\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.060\nNow a lot of times that's gonna be in\ncombination with things like a DAI\n\n194\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.910\nsometimes they call it a dynamic\narp inspection, right?\n\n195\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.660\nWe'd also talked about denial service\nattacks that can also happen through what?\n\n196\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.220\nAre cache poisoning.\n\n197\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.790\nIf I'm a hacker out there and I decide to\nmaybe let everybody know on the network\n\n198\n00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.950\nthat, hey, you're IP address actually\nbelongs to my MAC address and\n\n199\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.970\nif I can get that information out to\neverybody, well now everybody when\n\n200\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.190\nthey try to send information to that\nIP address that they think is you,\n\n201\n00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.000\nit's really going to me as a hacker.\n\n202\n00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.850\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to be\nable to dynamically inspect and\n\n203\n00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.760\nvalidate those ARP messages,\nand then, if they aren't valid\n\n204\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.460\nmessages coming from a trusted source,\nwe completely discard them.\n\n205\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.940\nAnd so that's another great thing to have,\nand usually they work together.\n\n206\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.680\nThe DHCP snooping in combination\nwith dynamic ARP Inspection.\n\n207\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.620\nAll right, so some of the other things\nthat they also talk about when it comes to\n\n208\n00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.250\nour switches.\n\n209\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.470\nYou might have heard this\nin wireless networks.\n\n210\n00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.010\nIt's a real common technique\nin wireless networks.\n\n211\n00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.230\nIt is something known as\nMAC address filtering.\n\n212\n00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.740\nHowever, keep in mind that this could be\na part of wired port security, right.\n\n213\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.280\nIf I have a group of MAC addresses that,\nlet's say, we whitelist, all right.\n\n214\n00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.870\nWhen I talk about blacklist,\nwell you can do allow or deny.\n\n215\n00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.810\nBut let's say we whitelist.\n\n216\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:55.410\nI can say the communications that go\nacross these ports can only come from\n\n217\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.550\nthese MAC addresses.\n\n218\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.590\nSo now, let's say that I'm trying to\ndo an ARP poisoning attack, right?\n\n219\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.350\nWell, I plug into this port and\nI started to send out ARP requests right?\n\n220\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.630\nOr even ARP replies just to tell\nyou like a gratuitous ARP, right?\n\n221\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.320\nThat just tells you\nwhat you should expect.\n\n222\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.440\nIf it's not coming from a valid source\nthen what happens is it gets completely\n\n223\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.850\ndiscarded in an attempt to stop those\nare ARP cache poisoning attacks.\n\n224\n00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.640\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, you told me the other day\nthat Mac addressing can be spoofed.\n\n225\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.990\nSo, when we look at that, you say,\n\n226\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.990\nwell why would you implement\nsomething like that?\n\n227\n00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.290\nBut when you think about it, you also told\nme when we're thinking about security,\n\n228\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.630\nwe're talking about layers, right.\n\n229\n00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.330\nSo, we're adding complexity to that\nparticular attack and slowing down,\n\n230\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.270\npreventing that attack from occurring,\nright?\n\n231\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.910\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n232\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.840\nCuz you look at virtualization today.\n\n233\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.350\nIt's so\neasy to Just change a MAC address, right?\n\n234\n00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.970\nHow is it we have one physical MAC address\nor one physical adapter in the machine but\n\n235\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.590\nI've got 15 virtual\nmachines running on it and\n\n236\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.420\neach one has their own physical address or\nMAC address?\n\n237\n00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.060\nWell that's because that is a legal,\n\n238\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.630\nnot illegal, a legal,\nImplementation of back spoofing.\n\n239\n00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.670\nWe do it in order to have\nmultiple virtual machines\n\n240\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.910\ncommunicating out of\na single physical adapter.\n\n241\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.930\nIt is something that can happen very, very\neasy, and that's why with these three,\n\n242\n00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.660\nthings like DHTP Snooping, Dynamic\nARP Inspection, they just call it out\n\n243\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.700\non the exam as ARP Inspection, those\nof you that are going onto higher level\n\n244\n00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.440\ncertification We'll learn a lot more\non the hands-on in configuring this.\n\n245\n00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.740\nIn the Cisco world you'll see\nan acronym there, DAI and it's dynamic.\n\n246\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.740\nIt just means that because of the fact\nthat ARP is always happening on our\n\n247\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.535\nnetworks to do ARP resolution,\nit has to be done.\n\n248\n00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:34.295\nDynamic can't be something\nthat's just static.\n\n249\n00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:37.095\nOkay, we looked once and\nwe're not gonna look again.\n\n250\n00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:41.685\nNo it has to be a constant, ongoing thing\nthat's part of normal Lan communications\n\n251\n00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:45.175\nat least until we move completely to IPV6,\nARP is going to be doing a lot of\n\n252\n00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:50.850\nbroadcasts, so it is important to\nhave that turned on on your networks.\n\n253\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.460\nNow the other thing that\nthey call out as well,\n\n254\n00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.960\nthey call out things for\ninstance VLan assignments.\n\n255\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.840\nAnd when we talk about VLan assignments,\n\n256\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.440\nthis just boils down to\nimplementing VLans, right?\n\n257\n00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.250\nSo, why would I implement\na V Lan as far as security goes?\n\n258\n00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.350\nWell, think about what a VLAN is\nallright.So not to assume that you know\n\n259\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.290\nwhat the acronym means\nVirtual Local Area Network.Essentially,\n\n260\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.150\nwhat you are doing you're\ntaking one physical switch and\n\n261\n00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.490\nyou're chopping it up and dividing up into\nlogical switches.Now think about switch\n\n262\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.210\ncommunication right If I have a switch and\na device isn't plugged into that switch\n\n263\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.450\nam not aware of it,\nI can't communicate with him.\n\n264\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.880\nSo, when you do a virtual\nLocal Area Network and\n\n265\n00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.610\ntreat a portion of these switches ports.\n\n266\n00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:34.480\nLets if you do port based\nVLANs ,you are saying okay.\n\n267\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.310\nThese four, five, ten,\n20 ports on the switch,\n\n268\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.228\nthey can only communicate as\nthough they were in just a LAN.\n\n269\n00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:45.632\nWell, how do we communicate\nacross local area networks?\n\n270\n00:13:45.632 --> 00:13:48.740\nRight, there's where we have to go\nup the layers to layer three and\n\n271\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.200\nwe have to use routing techniques.\n\n272\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.670\nSo, when I implement a VLAN, and\nI assign a device to that one VLAN.\n\n273\n00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.010\nIf I want them to be able\nto talk to the other VLANs,\n\n274\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.220\nwe implement that layer three\nrouting communications, right?\n\n275\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.020\nSo, we can apply things like ACLs\nto our virtual local area networks.\n\n276\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.990\nIf we want them to communicate,\nthen we can also implement routing.\n\n277\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.960\nAnd, the other thing that the VLANs\nwill also help is things like broadcast.\n\n278\n00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.427\n&gt;&gt; Right, we can bring down the broadcast\ndomains because each individual VLAN is\n\n279\n00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:18.094\ntreated a separate switch and\n\n280\n00:14:18.094 --> 00:14:21.239\nthe broadcast communications\nthat happen on one VLAN.\n\n281\n00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:24.821\nThey don't propagate to the next VLAN and\nthat can be important in a very secure\n\n282\n00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:28.618\nenvironment where you don't want somebody\nto just be able to plug into your network\n\n283\n00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.224\nand sit out there and\nspray broadcast communications and\n\n284\n00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:33.000\nmulticast communications\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n285\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.820\nthey can listen to that information that\nmight be coming off of your servers,\n\n286\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.110\nthat could have sensitive\ninformation in it, right?\n\n287\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.890\nMaybe a little bit more information\nthat we want hacker come lately,\n\n288\n00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.690\nto gain access to.\n\n289\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.260\nAll right, now it's kinda interesting,\n\n290\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.430\nbecause in VLANs assignments almost\nbring us right into our next topic.\n\n291\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.010\nAnd that's network segmentation Now\nthere's a couple different ways that we\n\n292\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.090\ncan do this, right.\n\n293\n00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:56.340\nWe can do it layer 2, right.\n\n294\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.040\nWith layer 2 we're gonna do thing like\nyour virtual local area networks, but\n\n295\n00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.620\nwe can also do network segmentation\nthrough things like subnets right, and\n\n296\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.470\nthe subnets its good cause\nyes we are We're isolating\n\n297\n00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.410\nthe broadcast traffic, but\nwe can also implement things like\n\n298\n00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.010\nACLs that don't allow the communications\nbetween the different subnets, right?\n\n299\n00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:21.070\nSo it's a better way to, network\nsegmentation kind of assists security.\n\n300\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.530\nLike Cherokee mentioned earlier, it's\nnot a one-size-fits-all type solution.\n\n301\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.910\nWe have to implement\nadditional technologies,\n\n302\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.220\nPort security Mac address filtering.\n\n303\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.640\nOther things around that to insure that\nthe one thing that we implement isn't by\n\n304\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.310\nitself.\n\n305\n00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.720\nAnd then, people are gonna find their way\naround some kind of network segmentation.\n\n306\n00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.210\nThe reason I say that is\nif you think about it,\n\n307\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:44.390\nwhat is it that defines if I'm\non subnet one or subnet two?\n\n308\n00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.321\nMy IP address, but more than that,\na subnet mask okay, so\n\n309\n00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.101\nnow you have two subnets.\n\n310\n00:15:50.101 --> 00:15:53.650\nI changed my subnet mask,\nnow I'm on your network all right, so\n\n311\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.082\nthat itself does you no good it's\nthe fact that you have to do.\n\n312\n00:15:57.082 --> 00:16:01.150\nMultiple things in order\nto get this accomplish.\n\n313\n00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.907\nAll right, so\n\n314\n00:16:01.907 --> 00:16:05.892\nthe next thing that they call out is\nsomething known as security policies.\n\n315\n00:16:05.892 --> 00:16:08.672\nAnd in fact, let me I got\na diagram here for the VLANs and\n\n316\n00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:12.270\nI forgot to tell you let's take\na look at that real quick.\n\n317\n00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:12.980\nThere we go, thank you.\n\n318\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.230\nSo if you look I've got a series\nof maybe servers, right?\n\n319\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.800\nAnd want those servers just to be able\nto communicate between one another.\n\n320\n00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.120\nAnd I really don't want everybody\njust hooking into a single server.\n\n321\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.040\nWell I can logically divide the switch\nup to where it looks like we have\n\n322\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.940\nthree individual local are networks.\n\n323\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.762\nAnd then if I want, I can apply things\nlike ACLs in the routing topology, right?\n\n324\n00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:37.463\nThe layer three topology to allow these,\n\n325\n00:16:37.463 --> 00:16:40.940\nto communicate between\neach other if I want to.\n\n326\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.950\nAnd that's part of network segmentation,\nbut\n\n327\n00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.350\nagain be careful because VLAN is perfect\nfor network segmentation, right?\n\n328\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:53.075\nBut subnets in and of themselves,\nthey help assist security, right?\n\n329\n00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:57.816\nJust like I said, I changed my subnet mask\nto the same subnet mask that you have and\n\n330\n00:16:57.816 --> 00:16:59.860\nnow I've jumped on your network.\n\n331\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.410\nSo we have to use a combination of things.\n\n332\n00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:07.400\nWe might use something like VLANs with\nthe routing technologies on top of it.\n\n333\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.840\nIf we're implementing something like\nsubnets, then we might be using those ACLs\n\n334\n00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.050\nto control access between or\ncontrol the communications between.\n\n335\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.293\nNow the next thing that they call out.\n\n336\n00:17:18.293 --> 00:17:19.537\nThis is a little bit different,\n\n337\n00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:21.941\nthis is well I guess it could be\nkind of the same thing as an ACL.\n\n338\n00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:23.780\nThese are called security policies.\n\n339\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.247\nIn fact, think somewhere around here I've\ngot, yeah, I got a Windows 7 machine here,\n\n340\n00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.747\na little older machine here.\n\n341\n00:17:29.747 --> 00:17:31.660\nBut we also have security policies,\n\n342\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.510\nand security policies can\nhelp to configure devices.\n\n343\n00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.125\nNow there's a couple different types\nof security policy, actually there's\n\n344\n00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:39.677\nall different types of security policies\nreally, when it comes down to it.\n\n345\n00:17:39.677 --> 00:17:40.493\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But-\n\n346\n00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:42.602\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] More than I'd want to mention.\n\n347\n00:17:42.602 --> 00:17:43.494\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n348\n00:17:43.494 --> 00:17:47.732\nSo let's talk about you have\na corporate security policy.\n\n349\n00:17:47.732 --> 00:17:51.180\nSo if we talk about the corporate\nsecurity policy first, what is that?\n\n350\n00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.426\nThat's just what security means to your\ncompany, how you're gonna implement it,\n\n351\n00:17:54.426 --> 00:17:55.258\nhow it's enforced?\n\n352\n00:17:55.258 --> 00:18:00.254\nAnd potentially, what would be the results\nof a violation of a security policy, okay?\n\n353\n00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:02.393\nBut how do we adhere to\nthe security policy and\n\n354\n00:18:02.393 --> 00:18:04.570\nhere's where it'll get a little tricky.\n\n355\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.150\nWe implement security policies to define\nadherence to the security policy.\n\n356\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.800\nNow here's where it gets\na little confusing.\n\n357\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.030\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, we were just talking\nabout the different ways that we can\n\n358\n00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.820\nimplement different kinds of\nanti-malware techniques, right?\n\n359\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.360\nAnd we even mentioned from\na business perspective or\n\n360\n00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.730\nbusiness side of things, that if\nthat device falls out of compliance,\n\n361\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.760\nwe can put it in a quarantine or\nremediation portal.\n\n362\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.138\nSo if we look at things like health\npolicies and network access policies and\n\n363\n00:18:32.138 --> 00:18:35.626\nthings like that,\nthat's kind of the same thing, right?\n\n364\n00:18:35.626 --> 00:18:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nthe other one that comes to mind too,\n\n365\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.464\nwhether you're in a domain environment or\n\n366\n00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:43.714\na workgroup environment is like\nlocal security policy, right?\n\n367\n00:18:43.714 --> 00:18:45.392\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; I cannot define things like with\n\n368\n00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:48.365\nthe security settings, in fact, let me\nshow you here rather than sit here and\n\n369\n00:18:48.365 --> 00:18:50.030\ntalk about it,\nlet me show you what I mean.\n\n370\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:56.392\nSo you have something in a Windows machine\nand it's called a local security policy.\n\n371\n00:18:56.392 --> 00:18:58.989\nAnd there's a few different\nways that you can get to it.\n\n372\n00:18:58.989 --> 00:19:03.806\nSo for instance, here on the run line,\nI'm just typing the secpol.msc.\n\n373\n00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:05.059\nAnd if I launch this,\n\n374\n00:19:05.059 --> 00:19:09.805\nthis will launch my local security policy\nand there's other ways to get to this.\n\n375\n00:19:09.805 --> 00:19:12.205\nLet me just take a second and show you\nguys another way that you can get to this.\n\n376\n00:19:12.205 --> 00:19:15.295\nIf you needed the long walk about version,\nthe scenic route.\n\n377\n00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:19.497\nWe can always go to start, we can go\nto control panel, system and security.\n\n378\n00:19:19.497 --> 00:19:23.375\nAnd then down here at the bottom I've got\na series of administrative tools, right?\n\n379\n00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.050\nAnd inside of our administrative tools,\nif I need to,\n\n380\n00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.322\nI can see that right there I have\nthe local security policy as well.\n\n381\n00:19:29.322 --> 00:19:31.059\nSo what is the local security policy?\n\n382\n00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:33.977\nAnd I got you a little confused I'm sure,\nwhen I said hey,\n\n383\n00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:37.928\nthe security policy helps us adhere to\nthe parameters of the security policy.\n\n384\n00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:39.034\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n385\n00:19:39.034 --> 00:19:43.885\nIf you look at some of the things\nthat we can do here, right?\n\n386\n00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:45.560\nAnd you do commonly in a domain,\n\n387\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.037\nyou have what's known as a default domain\npolicy that pushes out password policies.\n\n388\n00:19:50.037 --> 00:19:54.140\nAnd really these are gonna be no\ndifferent, only where they're applied and\n\n389\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.880\nwhat the default settings are.\n\n390\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.330\nBut when you look at them,\nthey contain typically the same settings.\n\n391\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.640\nSo if I look at a password policy, right?\n\n392\n00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.199\nWe can do things like\nenforce password history.\n\n393\n00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:06.160\nFor example,\n\n394\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.140\nI don't want somebody to reuse a password\nuntil a certain amount of time.\n\n395\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.065\nWe can do something like that,\nwe can for instance,\n\n396\n00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:18.001\nmake sure that our passwords meet\na complexity requirement, right?\n\n397\n00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:20.599\nAnd we got to use a certain amount\nof character sets, upper case,\n\n398\n00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:21.459\nlower case, right?\n\n399\n00:20:21.459 --> 00:20:25.200\nTwo of those are the character sets,\nspecial characters and numbers.\n\n400\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.960\nWe can also do things like what is\nthe minimum password length as well.\n\n401\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.532\nWhen you implement things like complexity\nand a greater password length,\n\n402\n00:20:31.532 --> 00:20:35.502\nthen you exponentially increase whatever\nthe computational power it would take to\n\n403\n00:20:35.502 --> 00:20:36.479\nbreak that policy.\n\n404\n00:20:36.479 --> 00:20:39.010\nOr it's not the policy excuse me,\nthe password itself.\n\n405\n00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.070\nBut these could be outline in a security\npolicy and that's what I mean.\n\n406\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:46.986\nThen you go to the device where you can\nimplement whatever the standard that it's\n\n407\n00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:48.875\nset for your company, right?\n\n408\n00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:51.870\nIt's not the only thing that we can do,\nwe got all kinds of things here.\n\n409\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.790\nWe got like for\ninstance account lockout policies here.\n\n410\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.260\nAnd these are good for\n\n411\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.880\nstopping things like brute force\nattacks on machines, right?\n\n412\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.930\nI can implement an account lockout policy\nthat says, well how many times can you\n\n413\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.060\nenter the wrong password before\nyou're gonna get locked out?\n\n414\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.180\nAnd well how long are you\ngonna get locked out?\n\n415\n00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.150\nAre you gonna get locked out for\nso many minutes?\n\n416\n00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.958\nAre you gonna get locked out indefinitely\nuntil I call Cherokee as the administrator\n\n417\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.276\nand say Cherokee,\nsomebody's locked out again.\n\n418\n00:21:19.276 --> 00:21:20.505\n&gt;&gt; It happened again.\n&gt;&gt; It happened again,\n\n419\n00:21:20.505 --> 00:21:21.620\nCherokee can you help me out?\n\n420\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.450\nGo in Active Directory or whatever.\n\n421\n00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.830\nShe would know what to do,\ngo into Active Directory and\n\n422\n00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.160\ncan you reset the password or\nreset the count for us?\n\n423\n00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.720\nBut at least what this does and\nlike we've been stressing with any kind of\n\n424\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.183\nsecurity implementation is\nthis leads to awareness.\n\n425\n00:21:37.183 --> 00:21:39.185\nCherokee said,\nI didn't know that we had this problem.\n\n426\n00:21:39.185 --> 00:21:40.167\nBut now that you're locked\n\n427\n00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:42.011\nout indefinitely I realize\nthat it's happening.\n\n428\n00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:45.200\nSo we can start to get things\nlike statistics and find out,\n\n429\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.600\nis this happening at 1 in the morning?\n\n430\n00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.427\nWell nobody's supposed to be here at\n1 in the morning, so what's going on?\n\n431\n00:21:50.427 --> 00:21:53.458\nOr is it just the fact that it's\nhappening on a Monday morning, right?\n\n432\n00:21:53.458 --> 00:21:56.362\nIf it's happening on a Monday morning,\nit's probably Wes\n\n433\n00:21:56.362 --> 00:22:00.760\nfat fingering the keyboard, after I got\ndone spilling coffee on my shoe, right?\n\n434\n00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.600\nIt might not necessarily be some kind\nof security implementation that or\n\n435\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.050\nsecurity breach.\n\n436\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.750\nSo you can also do things like that,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.260\nFor instance, you can implement\nthings like local security policies.\n\n438\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.732\nSome of the other things\nthat they call out as well,\n\n439\n00:22:15.732 --> 00:22:18.449\nthey call out things like\ndisabling network services.\n\n440\n00:22:18.449 --> 00:22:22.693\nUnnecessary network services, remember\nwhen it comes to security we got three\n\n441\n00:22:22.693 --> 00:22:25.747\ngoals confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n442\n00:22:25.747 --> 00:22:28.717\nConfidentiality is gonna help handle\nthrough things like encryption.\n\n443\n00:22:28.717 --> 00:22:32.451\nIntegrity is gonna handle through things\nlike harsh values into talk about\n\n444\n00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:33.051\ncoming up.\n\n445\n00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:35.948\nBut it also leads to availability, right?\n\n446\n00:22:35.948 --> 00:22:40.754\nWe just can't disable all network\nservices, but if I don't run FTP.\n\n447\n00:22:40.754 --> 00:22:46.170\nOr maybe I'm running FTP server I'm not\neven using FTP, but it's on my network.\n\n448\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:46.889\nThat could be a problem, right?\n\n449\n00:22:46.889 --> 00:22:49.893\nThat's an unsecure protocol,\nand from a security standpoint,\n\n450\n00:22:49.893 --> 00:22:51.157\nit's clear text, right?\n\n451\n00:22:51.157 --> 00:22:54.332\nSo it could cause some issues,\nand if I'm not running FTP,\n\n452\n00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:56.120\nchances are I need to disable it.\n\n453\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:01.228\nIf I'm not using Telnet,\nwhy even have it on?\n\n454\n00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:05.053\nNow I say that and some of you might be\nsaying well I know I use Telnet in order\n\n455\n00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:08.175\nto find out if I can connect,\nif a port's open.\n\n456\n00:23:08.175 --> 00:23:09.194\nWell I understand that but\n\n457\n00:23:09.194 --> 00:23:11.516\nonce you're done you should\nprobably turn it off, right?\n\n458\n00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:14.725\nDon't leave things like these on.\n\n459\n00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:19.569\nNetwork services also understand,\nthey talk about disabling open ports.\n\n460\n00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:22.087\nAnd not specifically in this one, but\n\n461\n00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:26.501\nI kind of want you to know that they\nreally run hand in hand, right?\n\n462\n00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:29.625\nIf I have a service on,\nit's gonna use a port, right?\n\n463\n00:23:29.625 --> 00:23:30.434\nNetwork communications.\n\n464\n00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:32.323\nIf I have FTP, what is it doing?\n\n465\n00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:36.165\nIt's listening out for\nport 21 for incoming commands.\n\n466\n00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:40.285\nIf I'm not using it, I turn off the\nservice, it shuts down the port, right?\n\n467\n00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:42.140\nIt's like a hole in the dam, right?\n\n468\n00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.769\nOr a window, I don't know why you'd have\na window go in there but shut the window.\n\n469\n00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:49.698\nWe don't want these services running,\nbecause they can be exploited, right?\n\n470\n00:23:49.698 --> 00:23:56.090\nIf we have some kind of sensitive website\nwe shouldn't be using HTTP, right?\n\n471\n00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.581\nWe should disable HTTP,\nwhich closes down the port.\n\n472\n00:23:59.581 --> 00:24:03.508\nAnd we should implement something\nlike an SSL certificate,\n\n473\n00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:06.500\nbind it to the website,\nso now we have HTTPS.\n\n474\n00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.100\nSo it's important to keep that in mind,\nthat we do have protocols and stuff, and\n\n475\n00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.270\nservices that use them.\n\n476\n00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.729\nAnd if we're not using them,\nthey need to be disabled.\n\n477\n00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:16.293\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, all right.\n\n478\n00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:20.241\nSo that takes us to close to the end or\ndo you have any final thoughts or\n\n479\n00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:22.540\nwould you like to cover anything else?\n\n480\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think cuz I know\nI got a whole bunch more.\n\n481\n00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:26.971\nI don't think we quite have enough time.\n\n482\n00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:27.945\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To fit it all in this one.\n\n483\n00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:31.974\nBut I will tell you up til now some\nof the things that we've talked about\n\n484\n00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:33.430\nimplement them.\n\n485\n00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.350\nIf you're not aware of these things,\nthen make yourself aware.\n\n486\n00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.180\nThere's plenty of security\nwebsites out there.\n\n487\n00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.429\nWatch ITPro.TV,\n\n488\n00:24:40.429 --> 00:24:42.987\nwe've got plenty of security-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n489\n00:24:42.987 --> 00:24:44.733\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, plenty of security episodes.\n\n490\n00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:48.119\nSo if you guys aren't familiar with this\nor want more information by all means,\n\n491\n00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:49.940\ncheck out some of those other episodes.\n\n492\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.311\nBut the main thing is, make sure you're\naware and implement these things.\n\n493\n00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:56.174\nBut I think other than\nthat we'll go ahead and\n\n494\n00:24:56.174 --> 00:24:57.999\nleave them with a cliff hanger for\npart two.\n\n495\n00:24:57.999 --> 00:24:59.308\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sounds good.\n\n496\n00:24:59.308 --> 00:25:03.374\nSo like Wes said, stay tuned\nbecause we have more techniques,\n\n497\n00:25:03.374 --> 00:25:05.830\ntechniques to go ahead and offer you guys.\n\n498\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.526\nBut that about does that for\nthis episode, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n499\n00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:10.911\nsign off as your show host,\nremember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n500\n00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:11.778\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n501\n00:25:11.778 --> 00:25:15.592\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here in ITPro.TV\n\n502\n00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:21.608\n[MUSIC]\n\n503\n00:25:21.608 --> 00:25:25.053\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:14.690\nWelcome to CompTIA's Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.945\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:19.820\nNow we ran out of time\nin the last episode,\n\n7\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.240\nbut that's okay because we're gonna\npick right back up where we left off.\n\n8\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.392\nAnd we were discussing techniques to\nimplement hardening throughout our\n\n9\n00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:27.250\nnetworks.\n\n10\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.480\nWith us today, we have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.810\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.360\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks, Cherokee,\nfor having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.490\nAlways a pleasure to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.333\nThat's right,\n\n15\n00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:38.500\nwe're gonna come back at you with more\nhardening techniques like Cherokee said.\n\n16\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.084\nAnd I almost forgot to mention\nthis in the first one.\n\n17\n00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.485\nOne of the biggest hardening\ntechniques that you can use,\n\n18\n00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:46.988\nbest advice I can give you,\nis steer away from the defaults.\n\n19\n00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:50.409\nWe always have default configurations\nwith a lot of our devices.\n\n20\n00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.057\nAnd hardening techniques typically will\nsteer you away from those defaults and\n\n21\n00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:57.550\nmaking sure that you are doing things\nlike we talked about in the first part.\n\n22\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.490\nDisabling things like unnecessary\nservices, which typically closes down\n\n23\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.580\nthings like your ports that are open\nthat those services rely on.\n\n24\n00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.313\nThings like your different anti-malware\nsolutions and the different types.\n\n25\n00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:10.456\nNow if any of that sounds unfamiliar,\ngo back and watch the first part and\n\n26\n00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:12.298\nthen you can jump back in and\nyou can pick up where you left off.\n\n27\n00:01:12.298 --> 00:01:17.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, speaking of picking up where\n\n28\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.070\nwe left off, we were just about to\ntalk about using secure protocols.\n\n29\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.980\nIt is one of the objectives\nthat they call out.\n\n30\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.960\nAnd in another episode [LAUGH] they\ncalled out, don't use unsecure protocols.\n\n31\n00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.096\nBut they didn't really have a compare and\ncontrast.\n\n32\n00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:34.880\nSo Cherokee and\n\n33\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.326\nI, we were actually talking about\nthis before we started the show.\n\n34\n00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:41.103\nAnd we said, wouldn't it be good to\nactually put them side by side so\n\n35\n00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:42.680\nyou can kind of tell what's going on?\n\n36\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.340\nWell, if I shouldn't use this one,\nwhat should I use?\n\n37\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.046\nSo that's what we're\ngonna look at here today.\n\n38\n00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:52.030\nStarting out, we're gonna look at, and\nI've got a little diagram up here again.\n\n39\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.630\nIt's not much.\n\n40\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.480\nIt's more of the memorization\nstuff that a lot of people\n\n41\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.340\nreally don't like when it comes down\nto just sheer specifications and facts.\n\n42\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.460\nSo if we can take a look at my computer\nhere, on the left-hand side, what we'll\n\n43\n00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.660\nsee are the unsecured protocols that\nwe've talked about in a previous episode.\n\n44\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.879\nWe went ahead and\nbrought them back for a part two.\n\n45\n00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.545\nNo just kidding, no.\n\n46\n00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:15.828\nWe brought them back so we could kinda do\na compare and contrast so you know, well,\n\n47\n00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:18.390\nif we don't use Telnet,\nwhat do we use, right?\n\n48\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.450\nSo keep in mind that we've talked\nabout not using Telnet for\n\n49\n00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.740\nthe purposes of remote log on, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.660\nIt's perfect for testing whether a port\nis open, making a connection and\n\n51\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.905\nyou do a Telnet, and you put the port,\nlike Port 80, at the end of it.\n\n52\n00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:33.317\nYou send that against a host.\n\n53\n00:02:33.317 --> 00:02:38.305\nYou can say, I can see Port 80\nis open on my web server, right?\n\n54\n00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:39.480\nMaybe I need to test that.\n\n55\n00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.585\nSo it does have a good use, right, a good\nuse scenario for something like that.\n\n56\n00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:49.998\nBut it really should never be used for\nremote logons, cuz let's step back, right?\n\n57\n00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:52.695\nLet's go back to the future, right?\n\n58\n00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:57.240\nRemember when the first parts of ARPANET,\nright, what we get today,\n\n59\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240\nwe have our Internet.\n\n60\n00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.211\nBut in the first earliest days,\n\n61\n00:03:00.211 --> 00:03:04.893\nwe only had five entities that were\nreally connected to that large ARPANET.\n\n62\n00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:08.135\nSo security wasn't really\na problem in those days, right?\n\n63\n00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:12.960\nWhat you would is you would, I think it\nwas Steve Wozniak that I was thinking.\n\n64\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.430\nHe made mention that he would jump on\nthe ARPANET and hack the system just so\n\n65\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.820\nhe could console in and play Solitaire on\n[LAUGH] another major terminal, right?\n\n66\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.170\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the thing, Wes, is during\nthe infancy of the Internet everyone,\n\n67\n00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.100\nthey knew each other,\nthey trusted each other,\n\n68\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.920\nthey weren't worried about someone\nreally being malicious in that sense.\n\n69\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.715\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n70\n00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:36.159\nBack in the good old days, like Palo Alto\nResearch, when it was everybody come\n\n71\n00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.200\ntogether and we got a lot of\nthe technologies that we've been using.\n\n72\n00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.590\nSo not really good,\nmaybe good in those days, but\n\n73\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.020\nnot really good for today, right?\n\n74\n00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.528\nBecause it's a much darker place\non the web out there today.\n\n75\n00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:48.103\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, that's so sad.\n\n76\n00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:48.974\n&gt;&gt; I know it is.\n\n77\n00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.520\n[LAUGH] We get out the world's\nsmallest violin here.\n\n78\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.230\nBut we do have to keep in mind that\nthere are people out there that can be\n\n79\n00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.670\nin between the source of the destination\nof those communications.\n\n80\n00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.060\nSo today if you're gonna\nmake a remote logon,\n\n81\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.190\nyou really should be using\nthe secure shell, right, SSH?\n\n82\n00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.532\nThis way that we have encryption when I\nmake communication, let's say, for myself,\n\n83\n00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:11.340\nlet's say,\nlike a CentOS maybe I gonna CentOS Server.\n\n84\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.505\nAnd I wanna do some configurations on it.\n\n85\n00:04:13.505 --> 00:04:15.880\nI wanna restart Apache or\nsomething like that.\n\n86\n00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.230\nIf I was using Telnet,\n\n87\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.600\nthey could see the communications that\nare happening between me and that server.\n\n88\n00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.460\nBut if I use SSH,\nthat's a little bit different.\n\n89\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.223\nNow we're using keyed encryption.\n\n90\n00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:31.783\nAnd the goal here is to ensure that\nnobody can eavesdrop on that information.\n\n91\n00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:35.565\nI'm sure I mentioned this port in\nother episodes, but let's go ahead and\n\n92\n00:04:35.565 --> 00:04:36.850\nmention it just in case.\n\n93\n00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.690\nRemember, SSH utilizes port 22.\n\n94\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.730\nNow in another episode as well,\nwe also talked about HTTP, right?\n\n95\n00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.710\nHTTP, it's a git, it's a request\nresponse type client server protocol,\n\n96\n00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.950\nbut there's a problem with it, right?\n\n97\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.560\nIt is clear text.\n\n98\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.253\nAll right, so if I was communicating,\nI'm gonna pick on Cherokee again here.\n\n99\n00:04:56.253 --> 00:04:59.473\nIf I was communicating between myself and\nthe server, and Cherokee decided,\n\n100\n00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.250\nI'm not gonna wear the white hat anymore.\n\n101\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.346\nI'm putting the black hat on today.\n\n102\n00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.100\n&gt;&gt; Yee-haw!\n\n103\n00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.136\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right, let's go!\n\n104\n00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now she can see,\n\n105\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.574\n[LAUGH] potentially see all the\ninformation that's going from myself and\n\n106\n00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.170\nthe server.\n\n107\n00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.350\nHowever, if we implement SSL with HTTP,\nlet's go ahead and shorten it.\n\n108\n00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.596\nWe get HTTPS, right?\n\n109\n00:05:15.596 --> 00:05:18.881\nNow we have, a lot of times,\n128-bit encryption.\n\n110\n00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.723\nI don't if it's moved.\n\n111\n00:05:19.723 --> 00:05:21.250\nI'm sure it's moved on from there, too.\n\n112\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.712\nBut we at least get 128-bit encryption so\n\n113\n00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:28.376\nthat the communications that are from the\nclient, which is typically a web browser,\n\n114\n00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:32.298\nand the endpoint, which is usually\nyour web servers, are encrypted.\n\n115\n00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.103\nAnd we hope that there's\nno eavesdropping on them.\n\n116\n00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:35.910\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's back the truck up.\n\n117\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.460\nYou just said to combine SSL Secure\nSockets Layer with HTTP, is that correct?\n\n118\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.103\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did.\n\n119\n00:05:42.103 --> 00:05:43.970\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what do we call that?\n\n120\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.210\n&gt;&gt; We call that HTTPS,\n\n121\n00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.910\nthe Hypertext Transfer Protocol\nover Secure Sockets Layer.\n\n122\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.360\nDon't try to say that ten times fast.\n\n123\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.250\nI don't even know if I can say it once.\n\n124\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.030\nSo we do have that.\n\n125\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.520\nAnd that really brings us into\nour next protocol here, and\n\n126\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.450\nthis might get a little confusing.\n\n127\n00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.640\nTLS, SSL, what's the difference?\n\n128\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.025\nWell, there's a lot of difference, but\nsometimes it's confusing because people\n\n129\n00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:10.870\nsay you're using HTTPS, but\nreally underneath you're using TLS.\n\n130\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.250\nWhat does that mean?\n\n131\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.190\nWell, SSL is considered no longer secure.\n\n132\n00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.330\nAnd there was some vulnerabilities\nin it in the fact that if I was,\n\n133\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.640\nlet's say that I have\nan older legacy machine.\n\n134\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.380\nAnd I connect over SSL to a web server.\n\n135\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.740\nThat web server could tell me,\nhere is what I support.\n\n136\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.380\nWhat do you think you're gonna use?\n\n137\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.748\nAnd I could negotiate a lower\nlevel SSL 1.0 or 2.0, right?\n\n138\n00:06:33.748 --> 00:06:35.211\nWell, that's the problem.\n\n139\n00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.383\nThat negotiation of a lesser\ncyber strength ends up\n\n140\n00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:40.826\nleading to a security vulnerability.\n\n141\n00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:45.612\nWith Transport Layer of Security,\nTLS, it's a little different,\n\n142\n00:06:45.612 --> 00:06:49.747\nyou cannot negotiate a lower\ncyber strength, if you will.\n\n143\n00:06:49.747 --> 00:06:53.250\nAnd with Transport Layer Security,\nnow we're gonna implement things like\n\n144\n00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.360\ncertificates and\ndo certificate based authentication.\n\n145\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.887\n&gt;&gt; But we don't have a new name for\nit, we still would call it HTTPS,\n\n146\n00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.340\neven though we are now using,\nas well, TLS.\n\n147\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.405\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we have that protocol suite but\n\n148\n00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:05.850\nwe don't have a new name.\n\n149\n00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.529\n&gt;&gt; Really, and I think it was HTTP,\nor, excuse me, I'm sorry, SSL 3.1,\n\n150\n00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.496\nI think it was.\n\n151\n00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:16.150\nOr at a certain point SSL became TLS, so\nit does get a little bit confusing there.\n\n152\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.900\nBut keep in mind, TLS is really what we're\nusing, the Transport Layer Security data.\n\n153\n00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.090\nAnd again, it does allow us to\nimplement things like certificate based\n\n154\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.690\nauthentication, which certificate based\nauthentication is a not completely.\n\n155\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.290\nYou can never say never in security,\nbut a lot more secure\n\n156\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:38.000\nthan some of the earlier encryption\nmethods that we were using.\n\n157\n00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.348\nNow the next one that they have is\nSecure File Transfer Protocol, right?\n\n158\n00:07:42.348 --> 00:07:46.052\nWe've also talked about unsecure\nbeing FTP, like I've mentioned in\n\n159\n00:07:46.052 --> 00:07:49.390\nthe first part of this episode\nthat it is a clear text protocol.\n\n160\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.456\nSo you wanna implement some kind of SSL,\nSecure Copy Protocol, or SSH.\n\n161\n00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:58.685\nThey got all different variations\nof the different types of FTPs.\n\n162\n00:07:58.685 --> 00:08:03.249\nSecure FTP because now what you have\nIs you have an encrypted communication\n\n163\n00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:08.246\nbetween you and the FTP server, and I can\nissue my FTP commands, my Git commands,\n\n164\n00:08:08.246 --> 00:08:12.321\nmy Put commands, my List commands,\nall those old Unix commands.\n\n165\n00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:16.725\nAnd I don't have to worry about somebody\nintercepting that communication and\n\n166\n00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:21.594\nseeing what's inside of that directory, or\neven more so the information that is being\n\n167\n00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:26.150\nloaded into the FTP server or even in this\ncase, downloaded from the FTP server.\n\n168\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:30.900\nSo keep in mind, you're gonna\nwanna be using secure FTP today.\n\n169\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.670\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I see the next protocol\nthat you have listed here is IP Sec.\n\n170\n00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.447\nAnd I just alluded to a protocol suite,\nbut there's more than meets the eye here,\n\n171\n00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:38.951\ncorrect?\n\n172\n00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.620\n&gt;&gt; There is, and\nI think what I'm gonna do,\n\n173\n00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.070\nis I'm gonna kinda jump ahead\nof you on this one, Cherokee.\n\n174\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.540\nCuz I do wanna just mention,\nIPsec is its own entity.\n\n175\n00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.631\nSo I wanna, real quick,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n176\n00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:54.959\nmention SNMPv3, and then we got\na lot to talk about when it comes to\n\n177\n00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.848\nIPsec because it is a powerhouse\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n178\n00:08:58.848 --> 00:09:02.271\nSo in the past episodes,\nwe've talked about how SNMPv1,\n\n179\n00:09:02.271 --> 00:09:04.460\nthere's no security on it, right?\n\n180\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.080\nSo that information that I'm\ngetting from my devices,\n\n181\n00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.420\nright, remember,\nsimple network management protocol.\n\n182\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.901\nI can find the condition and the state\nof my network devices and guess what,\n\n183\n00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:17.665\nif you're doing a man in\nthe middle eavesdropping attack,\n\n184\n00:09:17.665 --> 00:09:19.508\nI can intercept all that information.\n\n185\n00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.035\nI can kinda know what the architecture and\nthe design is.\n\n186\n00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:28.960\nWhat the devices are SNMPv2\nimplemented things like communities\n\n187\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.060\nthat would require things like a password\nbut SNMPv3 goes a lot farther than that.\n\n188\n00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.490\nImplementing things like usernames and\n\n189\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.900\npasswords and\nit's a lot more secure today.\n\n190\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.520\nAnd it is the one that you're\ngonna be wanting to set up.\n\n191\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.280\nHowever, keep in mind that SNMPv3 is\na lot more complex to set up than SNMPv2,\n\n192\n00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.580\nbut it is the one that\nyou want to be using.\n\n193\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.750\nNow, here we go with the one that you were\ntalking about, and I joke about it, but\n\n194\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:01.240\ni really like IP Sec because, it's not\njust a single individual protocol.\n\n195\n00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.671\nLike Cherokee alluded to, it's a suite\nof technologies, a suite of protocols,\n\n196\n00:10:06.671 --> 00:10:10.939\nthat when all combined together\nthey try to secure our network.\n\n197\n00:10:10.939 --> 00:10:13.600\nSo what are some of the things\nthat it allows us to do?\n\n198\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.360\nWell, IPSec allows us to do a few things.\n\n199\n00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.100\nAnd we'll talk about what\nthese acronyms are here guys.\n\n200\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.510\nSo don't think that I'm gonna leave you\nstranded here, feed you alphabet soup and\n\n201\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.250\nthen we'll move on.\n\n202\n00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.940\nWe'll talk about them.\n\n203\n00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.120\nSo it allows me confidentiality.\n\n204\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.320\nAll right, well,\nwhat is it that allows me confidentiality?\n\n205\n00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.387\nWell, we get encryption through\nsomething known as ESP.\n\n206\n00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:37.150\nAnd when we talk about ESP, we're talking\nabout the encapsulated security payload.\n\n207\n00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:42.134\nWe get things like integrity all right\nhow do we get things like integrity\n\n208\n00:10:42.134 --> 00:10:46.791\nwell that's through hashing values or\nhashing algorithms a one way\n\n209\n00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:51.611\nfunction message digest five or\nshow in the fact that we take a specific\n\n210\n00:10:51.611 --> 00:10:56.620\nbit of data we run it through\na mathematical algorithm I can't even say.\n\n211\n00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.509\nAnd it produces a fixed length value\nin which you can't reverse engineer it\n\n212\n00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:04.845\nbecause it doesn't matter\nhow much data you have,\n\n213\n00:11:04.845 --> 00:11:10.140\nthe fixed value that it produces,\nsize-wise, is never gonna change, right?\n\n214\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.460\nAnd I know that if that value is\nthe same the moment that it is sent\n\n215\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.260\nacross the wire, over to my computer, and\nI check that value and nothing's changed,\n\n216\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.530\nI've compared them, then I know that\nthey match and there must not have been\n\n217\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.190\nanything change in that communication or\nthat data, whether it be through malicious\n\n218\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.800\nintent or just being general\nnetwork communication errors right?\n\n219\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.240\nAnd ICVs, don't let the ICV again, that\nintegrity check value catch our guard.\n\n220\n00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.060\nAll it means is that there's a way when\nwe send communications from one computer\n\n221\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.490\nthat's in an IP sec relationship to\nanother computer that has joined an IP sec\n\n222\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.750\nrelationship that they can check\nit at their end and find out,\n\n223\n00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.110\nis it the same value, and\nif it is the same value,\n\n224\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.020\nwe know that packet of data hasn't lost,\nor hasn't been modified.\n\n225\n00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.760\nAnd again, it's not always because of\nmalicious intent, even though that is\n\n226\n00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.200\none of the primary focuses, it could\nbe things like transmission errors.\n\n227\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.520\nWe also get things like anti\nreplay protection right.\n\n228\n00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.660\nWe talk about things like, for\ninstance, session hijacking and\n\n229\n00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.660\nthe fact that I can replay a session\ncookie during an authenticated session\n\n230\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.310\nback to the server, and I can essentially\ntake an authenticated user right out of\n\n231\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.520\nthe conversation and start to represent\nmyself once I replay their session cookie.\n\n232\n00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.340\nWell this has things like sequencing.\n\n233\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.107\nAnd sequencing, please understand,\nno different than what we're talking about\n\n234\n00:12:30.107 --> 00:12:33.603\nwhen we mention transmission control\nprotocol, breaking your data up, and\n\n235\n00:12:33.603 --> 00:12:37.421\nthen sequentially numbering it so that it\ncan be rebuilt when it's transmitted over\n\n236\n00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:38.900\nthe network in the right order.\n\n237\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.770\nWell it's the same thing,\nor close to the same thing.\n\n238\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:46.530\nYou know that every packet that\nis supposed to be part of this\n\n239\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.560\nIPSec communication cuz it's\nsequentially numbered, so\n\n240\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.440\nif somebody was to steal let's say\na part of it, now I'm the hacker and\n\n241\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.560\nI try to replay that to one of Cherokee's\nservers, it looks at it and it says wait,\n\n242\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.330\nfirst of all this isn't a part of\na security association which we'll get to.\n\n243\n00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.820\nWell, I don't even know what that number\nmeans, so it completely discards it so\n\n244\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.380\nwe can't replay it later.\n\n245\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.310\nThe other thing too is timestamping,\nall right.\n\n246\n00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.110\nWe have timestamping protocols,\nIPsec is one of them, again,\n\n247\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.390\nthat uses timestamping too.\n\n248\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.650\nAs well as, what I mentioned SA,\nSecurity Associations.\n\n249\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:19.970\nAnd we'll talk about SAs here,\ncoming up in a bit, too.\n\n250\n00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.340\nNow, we also get things like,\nfor instance, non-repudiation.\n\n251\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.260\nRepudiation, if you think about it,\nI can't.\n\n252\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.700\nLet's say Cherokee's\ndoing an audit right now\n\n253\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.920\nof the communications\ngoing across the network.\n\n254\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.710\nAnd she comes to me and\n\n255\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.280\nshe says, Wes, that communication,\nit came from your computer.\n\n256\n00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.240\nAnd I say-\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't me.\n\n257\n00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.676\n&gt;&gt; Wasn't me you're cuckoo for\ncockoo poss right she says, no, no, no.\n\n258\n00:13:42.676 --> 00:13:47.730\nI can see your security association in\nthe audit logs, I can see time stamping.\n\n259\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.110\nThere's no way you can say that's not your\ncommunication, it is your communication.\n\n260\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.170\nNow that's not only good for.\n\n261\n00:13:55.262 --> 00:13:57.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That came from your computer\n\n262\n00:13:57.868 --> 00:13:58.731\nregardless.\n\n263\n00:13:58.731 --> 00:13:59.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n264\n00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.420\nSo the security association,\nyou have to enter into that relationship\n\n265\n00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.650\nbefore you can even communicate right here\ncomputers have to do this process that\n\n266\n00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.230\nI'll explain coming up, so there is no\nway that I could say that wasn't mine.\n\n267\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.190\nAnd I also something to\njust throwing it out\n\n268\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.510\nthere is called a security\nparameter index.\n\n269\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.012\nAnd a security parameter index is actually\nthat stamp on it that says it's part a of\n\n270\n00:14:21.012 --> 00:14:22.301\nthis security association.\n\n271\n00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:25.295\nSo wee get those things\nlike non-repudiation so\n\n272\n00:14:25.295 --> 00:14:29.968\nagain as a kind of a recap keep in mind\nconfidentiality through encryption,\n\n273\n00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:34.494\nintegrity through hashing values\nmessage digest if you will empty replay\n\n274\n00:14:34.494 --> 00:14:39.109\nprotection with time stamping and\nsequencing as well as non repudiation.\n\n275\n00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:42.450\nNow I wanna talk a little bit about\nwhat security association are.\n\n276\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.780\nI mentioned that term and acronym essay.\n\n277\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.470\nIt really boils down to really\njust something simplistic.\n\n278\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.372\nA Security Association is a trust\nrelationship between two end points\n\n279\n00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:53.968\nof an IP set communication.\n\n280\n00:14:53.968 --> 00:14:58.597\nAll right it means my computer trusts\nyours, your computer trusts mine,\n\n281\n00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:02.777\nif I'm talking to a server it means\nmy computer trusts the server,\n\n282\n00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:07.880\nknows who the server's identity is and\nthe server themselves know my identity.\n\n283\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.210\nWhy?\nCuz we had to go through a security\n\n284\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.120\nassociation in order to set up this\ncommunication and there are a couple of\n\n285\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.589\ndifferent types of security associations\nthat I want you guys to be aware of.\n\n286\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.490\nThere is, well we'll go ahead and\nwe'll zoom in on the first one.\n\n287\n00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.134\nThe first one is what's known as\na phase 1 Security Association, and\n\n288\n00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:27.997\nyou might hear a few different\nterms thrown out there.\n\n289\n00:15:27.997 --> 00:15:31.509\nAnd more commonly, you'll hear\nmain mode security association,\n\n290\n00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:34.603\nor you might even here IKE\nphase one security association.\n\n291\n00:15:34.603 --> 00:15:38.060\nSo, a few different terms that all\nmean the same thing, all right?\n\n292\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.751\nNow take the terminology and just kinda\nthrow it out of your mind for a second.\n\n293\n00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:42.884\nWhat is a phase 1 security\nassociation doing?\n\n294\n00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:46.574\nWell, this is where we set up things\nlike we negotiate the authentication and\n\n295\n00:15:46.574 --> 00:15:48.126\nwe do our key exchange, right?\n\n296\n00:15:48.126 --> 00:15:50.673\nA key exchange is a way two\ncomputers who have never\n\n297\n00:15:50.673 --> 00:15:54.677\ncommunicated before can agree on a key,\ntransfer them over a public wire, and\n\n298\n00:15:54.677 --> 00:15:58.697\nif anybody's looking, they won't be\nable to derive what the key is, right?\n\n299\n00:15:58.697 --> 00:16:00.827\nSo that's the first part.\n\n300\n00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:04.318\nNow the second part that we have\nis what is known as a Phase 2\n\n301\n00:16:04.318 --> 00:16:05.840\nSecurity Association.\n\n302\n00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.670\nAnd we look at a Phase\n2 Security Association.\n\n303\n00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.490\nEach computer actually sets up, so if I\nhave two computers and in this case and\n\n304\n00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.940\nthis example, I have a client and\nI have a server.\n\n305\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.381\nWhen we get into Phase 2 Security\nAssociation, now we have two, one,\n\n306\n00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:21.090\nunidirectional, right?\n\n307\n00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.560\nUnidirectional security associations.\n\n308\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.914\nOne leading from the client\nPC back to the server and\n\n309\n00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:29.652\none from the server back to the client PC.\n\n310\n00:16:29.652 --> 00:16:34.423\nAnd this is where your encrypted\ncommunications happen after that\n\n311\n00:16:34.423 --> 00:16:36.645\nkey exchange is done, right?\n\n312\n00:16:36.645 --> 00:16:38.495\nFrom here, we're actually sending data.\n\n313\n00:16:38.495 --> 00:16:41.312\nAn outbound security association from\nthe client to the server to send\n\n314\n00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:42.515\nencrypted communications.\n\n315\n00:16:42.515 --> 00:16:46.586\nAnd one from the server back to the client\nto encrypted communications from\n\n316\n00:16:46.586 --> 00:16:48.660\nthe server back to the client itself.\n\n317\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.284\nThat's also called a quick\nmode security association.\n\n318\n00:16:51.284 --> 00:16:57.330\nAlso sometimes called an IKE Phase\n2 Security Association.\n\n319\n00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.699\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe security associations.\n\n320\n00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:01.953\nAgain it boils down to\na trust relationship,\n\n321\n00:17:01.953 --> 00:17:04.517\na negotiation that has to\nhappen in the first part.\n\n322\n00:17:04.517 --> 00:17:06.602\nAnd then as the second part happens,\n\n323\n00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:09.640\nthat's where we get\nthe encrypted communications.\n\n324\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.320\nNow we do have some other IP components.\n\n325\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.882\nI told you this was not\na little topic by any means,\n\n326\n00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:19.049\nand let me kind of bring these into-\n&gt;&gt; Not for the faint of heart here.\n\n327\n00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:23.330\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nSo I talked about IKE, what is IKE?\n\n328\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.254\nIKE is the Internet Key Exchange, and\n\n329\n00:17:25.254 --> 00:17:28.333\nI kind of mentioned that's how\nit's pretty genius design.\n\n330\n00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:31.277\nAnd there's a couple of people\nthat were at the first,\n\n331\n00:17:31.277 --> 00:17:34.416\nWhitfield Diffie and\nMartin Hellman, and then also RSA.\n\n332\n00:17:34.416 --> 00:17:39.361\nAnd I wanna say it was in the mid 70s,\nthey came out with this way that,\n\n333\n00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:44.061\nagain, two devices that had never\ntalked before could communicate\n\n334\n00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:47.378\nover a public network,\nexchange a master key.\n\n335\n00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.883\nAnd then if somebody was\nis eavesdropping on and\n\n336\n00:17:49.883 --> 00:17:52.268\nthey could get pieces\nof the communication.\n\n337\n00:17:52.268 --> 00:17:55.271\nBut there's no way they could\nderive what the master key was,\n\n338\n00:17:55.271 --> 00:17:57.929\nthat's called an Internet Key Exchange and\nin IPsec,\n\n339\n00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:00.318\nit's done with\nthe Diffie-Hellman protocol.\n\n340\n00:18:00.318 --> 00:18:04.631\nI really don't know what there gonna\ngo that much in depth on the exam, but\n\n341\n00:18:04.631 --> 00:18:06.939\nat least you know that it is a part of it.\n\n342\n00:18:06.939 --> 00:18:07.876\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n343\n00:18:07.876 --> 00:18:12.480\nWe'd rather have all your bases covered\nthen only have a couple of them covered.\n\n344\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.438\nNow, I have kind of, and\nthere's a typo in here.\n\n345\n00:18:15.438 --> 00:18:21.061\nI have typed up erroneously the next\n\n346\n00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:27.435\ncouple of protocols that are extensions\n\n347\n00:18:27.435 --> 00:18:32.688\nin IPsec, and that is And ESP.\n\n348\n00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:34.730\nAuthentication Header, what is that about?\n\n349\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.768\nWell when you need just integrity, and\nyou need things like non repudiation,\n\n350\n00:18:38.768 --> 00:18:41.471\nyou use something like\nthe authentication header.\n\n351\n00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:44.130\nHowever it does have a limitation, right?\n\n352\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.240\nIt's not used when you\nneed confidentiality.\n\n353\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.130\nConfidentiality is through encryption and\n\n354\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.490\nthe authentication header\ndoesn't do encryption.\n\n355\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.710\nIf you need encryption,\nthen you get all of the CIA triad.\n\n356\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.700\nYou get confidentiality,\navailability or integrity and\n\n357\n00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.150\navailability because\nthe Encapsulated Security Payload.\n\n358\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.810\nThis goes a little bit farther and\nwhat this does is not only gives you\n\n359\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.770\nthe benefit that you get out of But\nit also gives you encryption as well.\n\n360\n00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.726\nSo that if I need to secure\nthe communication, so\n\n361\n00:19:11.726 --> 00:19:13.362\nwe don't have any eavesdropping on it.\n\n362\n00:19:13.362 --> 00:19:19.250\nWe're gonna implement something like ESP.\n\n363\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.778\nNow I've already kinda talked about ICV,\nthat's just an integrity check value.\n\n364\n00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:30.460\nYou might hear other terms when it comes\nto IPsec, you might hear HMAC, right?\n\n365\n00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.656\nHMAC is really just nothing more than\na hashing message authentication code.\n\n366\n00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:41.172\nAnd it's accomplished either through\neither MD5 or SHA, SHA if you will.\n\n367\n00:19:41.172 --> 00:19:43.279\nThese MD5, Message Digest 5,\n\n368\n00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:46.903\nthis is an older hashing\nalgorithm that's pretty much.\n\n369\n00:19:46.903 --> 00:19:51.496\nIt's not obsolete because we\ntalk about defense and depth.\n\n370\n00:19:51.496 --> 00:19:55.900\nMessage Digest 5 by itself,\njust using that is really weak,\n\n371\n00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.915\nit's vulnerable, right?\n\n372\n00:19:57.915 --> 00:20:03.770\nSHA is the more current standard and\neven SHA has many different variants.\n\n373\n00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.832\nI believe SHA-1 is a 160 bit encryption\nand it's considered kind of weak.\n\n374\n00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:11.214\nThey say theoretically it is\nopen to collision attacks.\n\n375\n00:20:11.214 --> 00:20:13.739\nSo really if you're\ngonna be using it today,\n\n376\n00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:18.402\nyou should be using something like\nSHA-256 and I believe SHA-384 as well.\n\n377\n00:20:18.402 --> 00:20:21.083\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nRyan we're doing a show the other day and\n\n378\n00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:25.244\nwe're configuring a CISCO router and\nthe particular community wanted to\n\n379\n00:20:25.244 --> 00:20:28.748\nexecute wouldn't even work\nbecause he was trying to use SHA.\n\n380\n00:20:28.748 --> 00:20:31.660\nAnd now he had to actually do\na hack to even use SHA because now,\n\n381\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.347\nhis manufacturer is saying, hey.\n\n382\n00:20:33.347 --> 00:20:36.150\nAnd it was at the end of last year\nthat they made that judgment call.\n\n383\n00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.462\nThey said, look,\nthis is the end of life for this guy.\n\n384\n00:20:38.462 --> 00:20:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure enough.\nAnd we don't want to get too much into\n\n385\n00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.757\nSecurity+ here, but\nwhat it does is Message Digest 5 and\n\n386\n00:20:46.757 --> 00:20:52.620\nSHA-1 are theoretically known that\nyou could do collision attacks.\n\n387\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.830\nBasically, we talk about\na one way function, right?\n\n388\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.486\nI take a piece of text and\nI run a Message Digest 5 through it and\n\n389\n00:20:59.486 --> 00:21:03.055\nit puts a really small fixed link value.\n\n390\n00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:06.639\nWell if I can find any kind of other\ncode that will generate that same\n\n391\n00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:10.167\nexact hash value,\nthat's called a hashing collision, right?\n\n392\n00:21:10.167 --> 00:21:13.060\nAnd it could be used as an exploit.\n\n393\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.905\nSo if you're using these by themselves,\n\n394\n00:21:16.905 --> 00:21:18.825\nyou should be using\nsomething other than SHA-1.\n\n395\n00:21:18.825 --> 00:21:22.155\nHowever, keep in mind that you're using\nthings like authentication header or\n\n396\n00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:24.650\nyou're using encapsulation\nsecurity payload.\n\n397\n00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.436\nTime stamping, sequencing, and\nall the stuff that's around it.\n\n398\n00:21:27.436 --> 00:21:31.500\nSo inside of IPsec,\nit's not just by itself.\n\n399\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.959\nIt's got components, right?\n\n400\n00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:37.640\nIt's got partners, it's more of a layered\ndefense when it comes to those packets.\n\n401\n00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.315\nAll right, so\n\n402\n00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:41.589\nthat's pretty much got IPsec,\nlet's see what else do we have here?\n\n403\n00:21:41.589 --> 00:21:43.971\nSome of the other things\nthat they talk about.\n\n404\n00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:46.548\nThey talk about things\nlike access list and\n\n405\n00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:49.780\nwe've talked about some of\nthese in other episodes.\n\n406\n00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.635\nBut I wanna go ahead and\n\n407\n00:21:50.635 --> 00:21:53.335\njust kinda re-hash them here as\nwe're talking about hashing values.\n\n408\n00:21:53.335 --> 00:21:55.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All upon intended, right?\n\n409\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.080\nWe have-\n&gt;&gt; I saw what you did there.\n\n410\n00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.243\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna end up in\na hallow lane before we're done-\n\n411\n00:21:59.243 --> 00:21:59.761\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n412\n00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:00.332\n&gt;&gt; At least I will.\n\n413\n00:22:00.332 --> 00:22:01.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n414\n00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:05.320\nthey talk about things like web\nfiltering and content filtering, guys.\n\n415\n00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.010\nVery basically,\n\n416\n00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.630\nthere are sites out there that we\ndon't want people having access to.\n\n417\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.210\nAnd even in a business environment, and\nI'm not talking about the obvious sites,\n\n418\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.530\nbut it could be things like\neven social media, right?\n\n419\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.000\nSocial media is something that we might\nnot want from an internal standpoint if we\n\n420\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000\nhave a very secure managed network.\n\n421\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.540\nAnd we don't want people\ngiving away trade secrets.\n\n422\n00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.404\nSo they might do web filtering or content\nthat just says certain types of traffic or\n\n423\n00:22:31.404 --> 00:22:34.540\ncertain types of websites we're\nnot gonna allow you access inside\n\n424\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.886\nof the Enterprise network.\n\n425\n00:22:35.886 --> 00:22:39.142\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why but The Office comes\nto mind when they try to log on to\n\n426\n00:22:39.142 --> 00:22:43.100\ntheir Facebook and YouTube but that's\nexactly what you're talking about here.\n\n427\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.474\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and then like I said, some of the\nobvious risque sites that have no place\n\n428\n00:22:47.474 --> 00:22:51.279\ninside of the business,\nonline gambling site and stuff like that.\n\n429\n00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.926\nWhere it's not only something that\nshouldn't be in the business.\n\n430\n00:22:53.926 --> 00:22:56.480\nIf you're in your state,\nit might be actually illegal.\n\n431\n00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.680\nSo you might be violating some\nstate law and now your company\n\n432\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.590\nis gonna be held liable for the actions\nthat you or the end users are performing.\n\n433\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.910\nSo you do your due diligence and you make\nsure that this kind of content is filtered\n\n434\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.280\nout from accessing your network before\nit even gets into your network.\n\n435\n00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.320\nAnd then they also talk about\nthings like port filtering, right?\n\n436\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.780\nPort filtering again,\nclosing down unnecessary ports.\n\n437\n00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.300\nI don't want things like communication.\n\n438\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.143\nMaybe I've got a server that is only gonna\naccept things like encrypted web traffic.\n\n439\n00:23:23.143 --> 00:23:27.047\nI don't wanna see port 80, I don't wanna\nsee any of these other ports coming in, or\n\n440\n00:23:27.047 --> 00:23:31.060\nany communications trying to be made\nwith those ports, so I filter them out.\n\n441\n00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.100\nIP filtering can be source or destination,\nit's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n442\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.816\nI have a range of IP addresses,\n\n443\n00:23:35.816 --> 00:23:39.051\nI have a subnet that I don't\nwant to communicate, right?\n\n444\n00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:43.103\nI can say no, if anything that's coming\nfrom this 10.network and a certain subnet\n\n445\n00:23:43.103 --> 00:23:47.170\nmask, I don't want any of that\ncommunication coming into this server.\n\n446\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.910\nI can do things like IP filtering as well.\n\n447\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.580\nImplicit deny, I know that we've taken\ncare of this in another episode,\n\n448\n00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.830\nwhere we talked about firewalls.\n\n449\n00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.390\nBut let's go ahead and again, since it's\nhere, let's kind of just go over it again.\n\n450\n00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.110\nRemember, implicit deny\njust basically means\n\n451\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.620\nanything that isn't allowed is denied.\n\n452\n00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.020\nAnything that isn't explicitly\nallowed is implicitly denied.\n\n453\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.670\nSo we find this in things like firewalls,\nright?\n\n454\n00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:14.530\nFirewalls say all inbound traffic,\nit's denied.\n\n455\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.298\nUnless you make an exception to the rule,\nthat deny rule and you say,\n\n456\n00:24:17.298 --> 00:24:18.890\nI'm gonna allow RTP traffic through.\n\n457\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.910\nI'm gonna allow SNMP traffic through.\n\n458\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.850\nI'm gonna allow things like maybe\nthe Windows Remote Management Ports to\n\n459\n00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:26.365\nbe open.\n\n460\n00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:30.819\nSo keep in mind implicit denied\njust means anything that isn't\n\n461\n00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:34.780\nexplicitly allowed is implicit,\nimplicitly denied.\n\n462\n00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.930\nAll right,\nwell we've got a few more things.\n\n463\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.083\nWhat do you say,\nCherokee are we gonna cut her here or?\n\n464\n00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:41.597\n&gt;&gt; Call part two.\n\n465\n00:24:41.597 --> 00:24:43.223\n&gt;&gt; Maybe go through and call a part two?\n\n466\n00:24:43.223 --> 00:24:45.059\n&gt;&gt; I think so\nbecause we look at things like a wireless,\n\n467\n00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:48.030\nthat's gonna take a little bit of time,\nso let's go ahead and do that.\n\n468\n00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.370\nYou heard it ladies and gentlemen.\n\n469\n00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.147\nStay tuned, we're gonna have actually,\nwait a second, this isn't part two.\n\n470\n00:24:52.147 --> 00:24:52.747\n&gt;&gt; It's part three.\n\n471\n00:24:52.747 --> 00:24:53.342\n&gt;&gt; Part three.\n\n472\n00:24:53.342 --> 00:24:55.223\nMy gosh, yeah, so stay tuned.\n\n473\n00:24:55.223 --> 00:24:57.387\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap things up here in a moment.\n\n474\n00:24:57.387 --> 00:25:01.450\nBut for this show,\nwe'll go ahead and cut it off here.\n\n475\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.721\nRemember I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n476\n00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:03.534\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n477\n00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:05.288\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n478\n00:25:05.288 --> 00:25:13.495\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:16.150\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:11.342\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Comp TIA Network+\nseries, I'm your show host,\n\n5\n00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.440\nCherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.120\nWell we've done it,\nwe actually make it to a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.100\nWell enough because we had so\nmuch to cover,\n\n8\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.955\nwe're gonna pick right back up with our\nharding techniques, specifically we'll be\n\n9\n00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:28.770\nlooking at wireless first because\nthat's really a broad term, right Wes?\n\n10\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely is,\n\n11\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.420\nin fact I'm gonna start probably having\nthis, release this under a pseudo name,\n\n12\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.590\nkinda like Steven King and Richard Barton,\ncuz I got talk so much, but just kidding.\n\n13\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.740\nWe are coming back with the Part Three and\nwell,\n\n14\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.080\nwe had quite a few things that\nwe still didn't talk about, and\n\n15\n00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080\nI couldn't get in the last five\nminutes of the last episode.\n\n16\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.040\nSo as a recap, some of the things that we\nhave been talking about in the first part,\n\n17\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.650\nwe talked a little bit about\ndifferent types of malware.\n\n18\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.980\nTalked about things like switch\nhardening techniques such you could do,\n\n19\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.430\nnetwork segmentation.\n\n20\n00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.300\nWe got into the second part,\n\n21\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.330\nwe talked about some of the security\nprotocols you should be using and\n\n22\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.120\nkinda cross reference those with\nsome of the unsecured protocols.\n\n23\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.780\nSo you could see what not to\nuse versus what to use, and\n\n24\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940\nwhat else did we talk about?\n\n25\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.460\nWe also talked about things like IPsec.\n\n26\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.720\nAnd IPsec, you're probably gonna get\na few questions on the exam about it.\n\n27\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.030\nSo we try to lay out the fact\nthat it's a suite of protocols,\n\n28\n00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810\nthere's a lot of different components,\na lot of moving pieces in it.\n\n29\n00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.760\nSo if you're not familiar with IPsec,\nand you want a little bit more\n\n30\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.910\ninformation about the terminology,\ndefinitely go back and watch Part 2.\n\n31\n00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.040\nThen we also talked about different\nthings that you can do for access lists,\n\n32\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.360\ncontent filtering, things like port\nfiltering and IP filtering as well.\n\n33\n00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.430\nNow, we're gonna move on to\neverybody's favorite topic, and\n\n34\n00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.390\nthat is wireless hardening techniques.\n\n35\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.500\nAnd, well, these are, just like anything\nelse in your network, it's very,\n\n36\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.270\nvery important.\n\n37\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.070\nBut I will tell you these are some of\nthe things you really need to be on top of\n\n38\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.490\nbecause unlike a wired network\nwhere I actually have to\n\n39\n00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.010\nphysically plug into your network, a\nwireless network, it's radiated energy and\n\n40\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.260\ntechnically I'm not going to\nplug in to your network at all.\n\n41\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.210\nIn fact,\nif I can sit outside of your network and\n\n42\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.330\ntry to eavesdrop on your network,\nI can potentially mount attacks.\n\n43\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.000\nSo some of the things we're gonna\nlook at are ways that you can\n\n44\n00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.120\ntry to secure your wireless network, and\nthen some considerations, as some legacy\n\n45\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.620\nprotocols that are out there that\nyou really shouldn't be using today.\n\n46\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.080\nAt a very minimum, maybe just because\nyou're doing due diligence, and\n\n47\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.360\nyou don't wanna leave an open system.\n\n48\n00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.980\nBut other than that,\nyou really shouldn't be using them.\n\n49\n00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.790\nIn the middle.\n\n50\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.340\n&gt;&gt; And with the proliferation of all these\ndifferent devices that we see out there,\n\n51\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.280\nwireless networks are so common.\n\n52\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.660\nI mean most networks at least support\nthem in some kind of fashion.\n\n53\n00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah if you think about for\ninstance BYOD, bring your own device.\n\n54\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.760\nWe just got millions and\nmillions of devices out there.\n\n55\n00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.710\nI know they pick on me around here because\nI've got probably four tablets at home.\n\n56\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.070\nI've got my cellphone that connects to my\nWi-Fi so let's just understand I'm not\n\n57\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.150\ntalking about being on CDMA or\nGSM networks or even Edge or LTE networks.\n\n58\n00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.980\nI'm talking about connecting my cellphone\nto the Wi-Fi network and then that becomes\n\n59\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.380\nanother device on your network that you\nneed to make sure that we are securing.\n\n60\n00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.540\nSo coupled with the fact\nthat it's radiated energy,\n\n61\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.210\nthe fact that people can just\ngather this information from you.\n\n62\n00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.980\nJust by standing in proximity to your\naccess point makes it very scary.\n\n63\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.370\nNow, we're not telling you to\ngo put tinfoil hats on, it's not\n\n64\n00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.288\nwhat we're trying to say here, but there\nare some techniques that you can use to.\n\n65\n00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:33.700\nJust make sure that wireless network\nis a little bit more secure.\n\n66\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.620\nOne of the first things that they call\nout is an oldie but not so goodie and\n\n67\n00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.030\nthat is the wired equivalent\nprivacy that's left.\n\n68\n00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.830\nAnd we talked about wired equivalent\nprivacy in past episodes.\n\n69\n00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.950\nIt's kind of a confusing term.\n\n70\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.250\nIt's a little bit misleading, cuz\nCherokee, I'll throw this question at you.\n\n71\n00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.070\nHow much privacy do you think\nI have on a wired network?\n\n72\n00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.740\n&gt;&gt; Well, we did discuss this the other\nday, so it really just depends.\n\n73\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.960\nIn today's environment,\nyou wanna have some privacy.\n\n74\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.390\nYou want to have some security.\n\n75\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.810\nBut when that term came out\nthat's two different levels,\n\n76\n00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.130\ntwo different playing fields.\n\n77\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.087\n&gt;&gt; It really is and when the IAAA\nfirst came out with WEP there,\n\n78\n00:04:09.087 --> 00:04:12.920\nthey were really just trying to just\nhave some kind of temporary fix.\n\n79\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.720\nWhile they could work\non a better solution.\n\n80\n00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.130\nThey knew that the wired equivalent\nprivacy was literally gonna be nothing\n\n81\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.850\nmore than pulling the shades or\nthe blinds down on your network, so\n\n82\n00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.070\nthe average passer byer couldn't\neavesdrop on what the conversation is.\n\n83\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.560\nBut keep in mind as time went on and\nas technologies advanced,\n\n84\n00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.920\nit didn't take too long for\n\n85\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.570\nWEP to really become a vulnerability and\nheavily exploitable by itself.\n\n86\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.720\nAnd it's really surrounded with a lot of\nproblems, it's not just any one component\n\n87\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.330\nof it that causes the vulnerability, it's\nactually a multitude of vulnerabilities.\n\n88\n00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.230\nIt just depends on how\nyou attack the protocol.\n\n89\n00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.600\nSo let's talk about\nwired equipment privacy.\n\n90\n00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.360\nI got a little bit of a diagram\nhere to kinda help us out with this\n\n91\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.480\nwith wired equivalent privacy,\nit is one of these protocols that\n\n92\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.510\nit doesn't have a very good\nencryption method, if you will.\n\n93\n00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.060\nIn fact, if we can take a look at my\nmachine here, you'll see that the wired\n\n94\n00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.130\nequivalent privacy, they talk about\nthe difference of key lengths, right?\n\n95\n00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.280\nSo what is a key length, or\nwhat is a key in general?\n\n96\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.660\nBut understand that a key it's\na modifier to an algorithm\n\n97\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.450\nthat makes that unique to you and\nI, our current conversation, right?\n\n98\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.180\nThe greater the key length potential for,\nthe stronger the encryption.\n\n99\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.960\nWell when you look at WEP, WEP starts\nout with some very, very small keys.\n\n100\n00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.880\nNow you might hear 64-bit encryption,\nyou might hear 128-bit encryption,\n\n101\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.020\nbut technically that's\nnot really accurate.\n\n102\n00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.120\nWhen it comes to the key lengths,\n\n103\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.268\nthey're actually 40-bit encryption and\n104-bit encryption.\n\n104\n00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:51.150\nAnd there's 24-bits here that\nare up in the front, and\n\n105\n00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.010\nthey're called something knows\nas initialization vectors.\n\n106\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.890\nAnd the problem is that\nthis initialization vector,\n\n107\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.740\nthis point right here.\n\n108\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.190\nWas something that could be exploited,\nand that's because, well, it's 24-bits.\n\n109\n00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.480\nAnd if I can get in there and I can scrape\nenough of these initialization vectors,\n\n110\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.160\nwe can start to see patterns.\n\n111\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.750\nAnd remember,\nyou don't wanna see patterns in security.\n\n112\n00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.340\nBecause people do statistical analysis\nattacks and say, that matches,\n\n113\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.120\nthis matches, this matches, this matches.\n\n114\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.370\nAnd they can start to reverse engineer and\n\n115\n00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.460\nstart to predict what some of\nthose values are gonna be.\n\n116\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.410\nAnd when you look at it, 24-bits in and\nof itself isn't a very big number.\n\n117\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.995\nWe were talking about 16 million,\nit's just under 17 million possibilities.\n\n118\n00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:38.415\nAnd a modern computer can rifle through\nthose combinations really quick,\n\n119\n00:06:38.415 --> 00:06:42.545\ncalculate those similarities that they\nget, and start to derive, for instance,\n\n120\n00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:45.305\nlike the key, and\nwhat the key actually is.\n\n121\n00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:46.585\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you hear that term.\n\n122\n00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:48.135\nAnd we don't ever want to be predictable.\n\n123\n00:06:48.135 --> 00:06:50.915\nAnd you hear this term,\nbeing strongly non-random.\n\n124\n00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:52.055\nSo, that's what you're looking for.\n\n125\n00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.965\nYou don't want someone to be able\nto predict your next move, or\n\n126\n00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:55.965\nyour pattern there.\n\n127\n00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.495\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd the best we can get, right,\n\n128\n00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:58.315\nis pseudorandom, right?\n\n129\n00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:01.220\nBecause in computing\nyou have to understand\n\n130\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.160\nnothing happens unless\nyou program it that way.\n\n131\n00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.780\nSo that is a predictability\nbased on the program.\n\n132\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.490\nSo they try to add like she is saying\na little bit of randomness to it, so\n\n133\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.790\nwe talked about things like pseudorandom\nnumber generators to try and\n\n134\n00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.370\njust make sure that its not predictable\nthat's one of the problems.\n\n135\n00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.790\nThe other problem with WEP was\nthe fact that it was using this very\n\n136\n00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.120\nrelatively weak RC4 stream cipher.\n\n137\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.080\nRC4, I've heard on a lot\nof different names for it.\n\n138\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.060\nRon's code.\n\n139\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.080\nRivest Cypher, if you will.\n\n140\n00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.780\nAnd it's not very strong.\n\n141\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.802\nNow speaking of the keys too\nI'm pretty sure Cherokee,\n\n142\n00:07:36.802 --> 00:07:39.910\nI probably should mention\nsomething about those keys.\n\n143\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.680\nThe key doesn't change, it's a static key.\n\n144\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.160\nWell, why would you\nthink of your password?\n\n145\n00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.759\nYour password essentially\nis a pre-shared key.\n\n146\n00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.205\nYou say, well wait a second,\nwhat do you mean it's a pre-shared key?\n\n147\n00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:52.952\nWell, if you put in your password,\n\n148\n00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:56.352\ndoesn't someone on the other end\nhave to know what your password is?\n\n149\n00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:59.592\nIn order to validate the password,\nthat means both end points.\n\n150\n00:07:59.592 --> 00:08:03.465\nYou and whatever the end point is that\nyou're authenticating against both know\n\n151\n00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:04.630\nthe password.\n\n152\n00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.920\nWell, the problem is with that,\nif your password never changes,\n\n153\n00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.440\nyou're giving me all the time in the world\nthat I can try to guess the password.\n\n154\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.650\nWell any time you have a static key and\nyou're doing a static key generation,\n\n155\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.910\nyou're giving me a little bit of time\nin order to guess the password or\n\n156\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.130\nthe key itself.\n\n157\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:29.090\nNow as the bit length increases, that\ncould take a gazillion years, all right.\n\n158\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.500\nNow that's not a technical\nnumerical value by any means.\n\n159\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.520\nBut it can take you a long time,\nthe greater the key lengths get.\n\n160\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.950\nWhen you look at the fact that 24\nbits is initialization vector, and\n\n161\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.020\nyou only have 40 bits and\n104 bits encryption, it really doesn't\n\n162\n00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.290\ntake long that these could be brute forced\nbecause of the fact that first of all,\n\n163\n00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.670\nthey keys aren't that long, and\nthe fact that they never change.\n\n164\n00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.060\nSo you're giving the hackers all the time\nthey need in order to get in and\n\n165\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:54.900\nbreak the password.\n\n166\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.760\nSo, the other thing that it\nhas is a very weak check some.\n\n167\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.080\nLet's put it at end it's a 32\nbit CRC redundancy check.\n\n168\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.790\nAnd the problem is that it could\nbe modified by the attacker\n\n169\n00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.780\ntelling the end point\nwhat they should expect.\n\n170\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.360\nSo, remember how we talk\nabout in the first part,\n\n171\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.520\nwe talked about hash values, right?\n\n172\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.510\nIf I run a piece of data through a hash\nvalue, it produces a fixed length,\n\n173\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.625\nand if I send that fixed length value\nto the end point, they can also\n\n174\n00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:31.815\nrun that same algorithm across the data\nand they could compare the two values.\n\n175\n00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:35.525\nAnd if those two values match,\nthen you can tell that there,\n\n176\n00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:38.015\nthat nothing has been modified\ninside of that document.\n\n177\n00:09:38.015 --> 00:09:39.855\nIt's maintained its integrity.\n\n178\n00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:43.325\nWell what if I intercept that information\nin the middle between source and\n\n179\n00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:43.995\ndestination?\n\n180\n00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:46.085\nI tell the the destination, as the hacker,\n\n181\n00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.085\nI tell the destination here's\nwhat you should expect.\n\n182\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.760\nWhen that's not the original hash value.\n\n183\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.335\nSo it can be modified, and\nthe person that's on the other\n\n184\n00:09:54.335 --> 00:09:57.847\nend could be none the wiser\nthat it had a caused problem.\n\n185\n00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:02.626\nSo wired equivalent privacy,\nI have heard of people saying if you have\n\n186\n00:10:02.626 --> 00:10:06.271\na hot spot and\nyou don't wanna live in an open system,\n\n187\n00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:11.145\nits better than nothing but\nkeep in mind it is very, very exploitable.\n\n188\n00:10:11.145 --> 00:10:12.246\nIt is not a technology,\n\n189\n00:10:12.246 --> 00:10:15.890\nit’s not an encryption protocol that I\nwould be using on your networks today.\n\n190\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.580\nSo what happened?\n\n191\n00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.880\nWhere did we go in the life cycle\nof encryption on wireless networks?\n\n192\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.700\nWell, the next thing that came out is they\ncame out with something known as WPA,\n\n193\n00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.880\nall right.\n\n194\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:36.050\nAnd WPA, it was more of like a I don't\nknow, I think you had a good analogy.\n\n195\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.250\nIt sort of like a band-aid right?\n\n196\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.260\nIt's not the actual fix, but\nwe're just gonna temporarily\n\n197\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.380\ntrying to close off some of\nthe vulnerabilities that we had in WEP.\n\n198\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.430\nSo what WPA did all right,\nthe Wi-Fi alliance they go to the IAAA and\n\n199\n00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.330\nthey say hey, this web thing which you\ngave us it's not really that good.\n\n200\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.810\nWe really need to try something else.\n\n201\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.760\nDo you have anything?\n\n202\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.290\nThey were working on the next generation\nof encryption technologies but\n\n203\n00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.860\nthey haven't completed it yet.\n\n204\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.520\nSo, they said I tell you what, here's what\nwe have right now, here's what we'll give\n\n205\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.335\nyou, and they release it out\nas a Wi-Fi protected access.\n\n206\n00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:15.440\nSo what Wi-Fi protected access did is it\ntook still the original WEP protocol and\n\n207\n00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.670\nthe RC4 stream cypher.\n\n208\n00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.850\nBut it's kind of interesting.\n\n209\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.430\nEvery frame in an 802.11 communication\nwould have its own encryption key and\n\n210\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.190\nthe encryption keys would change.\n\n211\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:31.310\nTKIP stands for the Temporal Key Integrity\nProtocol and just by example here,\n\n212\n00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.420\njust for your own understanding understand\nthat it would keep rotating through\n\n213\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.510\ndifferent keys on every frame that would\npass over the 802.11 based network.\n\n214\n00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.040\nAnd does that mean that\nit is completely secure?\n\n215\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.450\nWell, no because it's still using\nthe relatively weak stream cipher.\n\n216\n00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.150\nBut the fact of the matter was,\n\n217\n00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.020\nis that every key was temporal,\nwhich means it's temporary.\n\n218\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.520\nSo that by the time you would maybe break\none key, well, we've already changed keys.\n\n219\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.790\nWe've discarded that key, and\nwe're just gonna keep going that and\n\n220\n00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.720\nrotating through.\n\n221\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.980\nSo, that was\nthe Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n222\n00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:12.130\nNow, even WPA,\nWPA did include some additional things.\n\n223\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.389\nGet that TKIP out of there.\n\n224\n00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:18.132\nWPA did some things to the frames\nthat made it a little bit more\n\n225\n00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:20.800\nsecure than WEP, all right.\n\n226\n00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.253\nThey realized that the initialization\nvector was too small.\n\n227\n00:12:23.253 --> 00:12:26.010\nThe possibilities weren't that great.\n\n228\n00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.520\nSo what they did is they extended\nit from 28 bits to 48 bits, right.\n\n229\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.100\nAnd now we have the same amount\nof possibilities that we do\n\n230\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.990\ntheoretically is mac addresses,\nright, that's a 48 bit address and\n\n231\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.210\nthat's trillions and trillions and\ntrillions of combinations.\n\n232\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:45.590\nSo theoretically, you can never\nsay impossible, not practical,\n\n233\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.210\nthat it just made the initialization\nvector a little bit more secure and\n\n234\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.190\nnot as easy to run against these checks.\n\n235\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.909\nNow, the encrypted payload,\nhowever, keep in mind,\n\n236\n00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:00.090\nit was still using the RC4 stream cipher.\n\n237\n00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.687\nBut then it added something called MIC,\nM-I-C,\n\n238\n00:13:03.687 --> 00:13:08.860\nmessage integrity code, and sometimes\nyou might hear this called Michael.\n\n239\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.540\nAnd what it does is it increases\nthat bit length to 64 bits so\n\n240\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.678\nit's a little bit harder to manipulate.\n\n241\n00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:21.280\nSo WPA did some good things over what WEP\n\n242\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.060\ndidn't do, but it was still vulnerable\nto things like brute force attacks and\n\n243\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.770\nstuff so you could still give it\nenough time you could potentially\n\n244\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.280\ngain access to that key it's\ncertainly not impossible.\n\n245\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.340\nAll right, now the next thing that we have\nthey come out with finally what happened\n\n246\n00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:44.150\nwas the IEEE finished, finalized,\ntheir standard that they were working on.\n\n247\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.140\nAnd they released it out as\nsomething known as 802.11i.\n\n248\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.448\nWell keep in mind the consortium\nof wireless manufacturers,\n\n249\n00:13:51.448 --> 00:13:55.774\nthe Wi-Fi Alliance, they had already\nreleased a subset of the functionality of\n\n250\n00:13:55.774 --> 00:13:57.491\nwhat would later be released and\n\n251\n00:13:57.491 --> 00:14:01.328\nthey released it under the marketing\nname of Wi-Fi protected access.\n\n252\n00:14:01.328 --> 00:14:05.959\nSo when the IEEE comes out with 802.11i,\n\n253\n00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:13.620\nthe Wi-Fi alliance says well we're just\ngonna use the marketing name WPA2.\n\n254\n00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.550\nWPA2 and 802.11i are the same thing.\n\n255\n00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:21.130\nThis is the next generation WPA, if you\nwill, and it's been out for a while.\n\n256\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.500\nWhen I say next generation,\nit's not anything that's brand new but\n\n257\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.800\nthis did something really good.\n\n258\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.215\nSee TKIP in and of itself was vulnerable.\n\n259\n00:14:29.215 --> 00:14:34.555\nAnd the fact that you were using a weaker\ncypher strength also made it vulnerable.\n\n260\n00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:39.004\nWhen we look at WPA2,\nWPA2 if I could say that right, or\n\n261\n00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:44.779\n2.11i it uses a yes encryption,\nthe advanced encryption standard.\n\n262\n00:14:44.779 --> 00:14:48.220\nIt also uses something known as CCMP,\nall right.\n\n263\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:53.203\nThat replaced the earlier TKIP so you get\nmuch larger encryption and you still get\n\n264\n00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:57.830\nthe Michael message integrity check or\ncode if you will that's at the end.\n\n265\n00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.266\nSo WPA is what you should be using today,\nor,\n\n266\n00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.270\nexcuse me, I'm sorry, WPA2 is really\nwhat you should be using today.\n\n267\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.580\nNow if you're coming from the home\nenvironment then chances are what you're\n\n268\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.250\ngoing to use is something known as WPA,\nand this could be WPA or it could be WPA2,\n\n269\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:18.500\nyou're going to be using something\nknown as personal WPA or WPA2 personal.\n\n270\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.810\nAnd what personal means is\nyou're using a pre-shared key.\n\n271\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.390\nIt's like a password to join the network\nand associate with the network.\n\n272\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.440\nSo I have a password that I have\nto put on the network adapter of\n\n273\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.480\nthe wireless device that's\ngoing to connect and\n\n274\n00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.440\nI also have to configure that obviously\nin the access point itself, all right?\n\n275\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.929\nHowever, in an enterprise environment,\n\n276\n00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:41.273\nyou might be going with something\nknown as WPA2 enterprise.\n\n277\n00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:44.799\nAnd again, they also have\na WPA version of this as well,\n\n278\n00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:48.112\nfor backwards compatibility\nwith legacy devices.\n\n279\n00:15:48.112 --> 00:15:50.823\nI don't know if I have\nthe enterprise here, yes.\n\n280\n00:15:50.823 --> 00:15:53.172\nActually Yes.\n\n281\n00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:58.850\nWe'll go ahead and\ntalk briefly about 802.1x.\n\n282\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.380\nThey put this here in\nthe wireless technologies,\n\n283\n00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.701\nbut let's understand that this is not just\ncontingent on having a wireless network.\n\n284\n00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:08.520\n802.1x is called\nport-based authentication.\n\n285\n00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.053\nIt just happens to be that what\nthe wireless communication,\n\n286\n00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:15.516\nyou could implement what's\nknown as enterprise mode, and\n\n287\n00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:19.137\nenterprise mode can send radius\nmessages to a radius server.\n\n288\n00:16:19.137 --> 00:16:23.022\nSo before anybody even connects\nto your wireless network,\n\n289\n00:16:23.022 --> 00:16:26.985\nthe port closes down and\nthen that device can pass your radius\n\n290\n00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:31.190\nauthentication off to the radius\nserver and negotiate for you.\n\n291\n00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.730\nAnd then, once that negotiation is done\nand you've met the requirements for\n\n292\n00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.690\nthe authentication and unlocked support\nand you join the wireless network.\n\n293\n00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.260\nHowever, be careful,\n\n294\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.030\nbecause this is not something that\nis just used on a wireless network.\n\n295\n00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.780\nIf we have a switch port,\nwe're doing switch port security,\n\n296\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.110\nwe can do 802.11x where somebody\nconnects to the switch.\n\n297\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.940\nAnd we send radius messages\noff to the radius server, and\n\n298\n00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.360\nthe switch locks that port down\nbefore the authentication happens.\n\n299\n00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.160\nOnce authentication is negotiated,\nyou open the port and\n\n300\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.330\nyou allow them to communicate.\n\n301\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.110\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a good point, Wes, because\nit can be both wired or wireless for\n\n302\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.960\nthat authenticator.\n\n303\n00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.680\nAnd sometimes you'll even see it being\nreferenced as a triple-A server, and\n\n304\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.490\nthat's what they're\nreferencing right there.\n\n305\n00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.320\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, yes.\n\n306\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.710\nSo yeah, definitely keep that in mind,\nthat 802.1x.\n\n307\n00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.720\nAnd I might as well go ahead and\ndo this and I'll show you this, guys.\n\n308\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.340\nBe careful on the exam,\nwe should not be modifying my documents\n\n309\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.680\non screen here because\nthat always works well.\n\n310\n00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.450\nBut I do have to just kinda show you,\nguys, something.\n\n311\n00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:34.460\nHopefully, and if I take the AP out here.\n\n312\n00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:34.990\nI wanna show you,\n\n313\n00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.720\nguys, there is a big difference\nbetween these two terms here, okay.\n\n314\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.280\nWhen we talk about 802.1x, we're talking\nabout port based authentication.\n\n315\n00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.480\nYou might see in documentation.\n\n316\n00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.949\nWhere they're talking about an 802,11\ntechnology, and they're talking\n\n317\n00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:58.432\nabout all four or five of the wireless\nstandards, A, B, G, and N, and AC today.\n\n318\n00:17:58.432 --> 00:18:04.358\nSo rather than write it out like that,\nA, B, C, C?\n\n319\n00:18:04.358 --> 00:18:05.450\nThere is no C.\n\n320\n00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.390\nA, B, G, N, and AC, they just say,\nit means the whole family, so\n\n321\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:16.750\nthey put x as more of a variable, but it's\n802.11x so that 1 extra 1, if you got that\n\n322\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.670\ncould make the difference between getting\nit right and getting it wrong on the exam.\n\n323\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.956\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I can't even tell you, I've\nactually been sitting in the exam booth\n\n324\n00:18:23.956 --> 00:18:27.450\nbefore and especially the PowerShell\ncommands if it's one little letter off,\n\n325\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.449\nyou've got and Microsoft, they go beyond.\n\n326\n00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:31.675\nYou guys are gonna be taking a.\n\n327\n00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:35.070\nIt's ABCD, and sometimes I have like\nA through H or A through J, and\n\n328\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.510\nyou're like,\nthere isn't one letter different here,\n\n329\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:38.320\nand-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n330\n00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.720\n&gt;&gt; So knowing the differences between\nthose standards is really key.\n\n331\n00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.459\n&gt;&gt; And it is, and\nit also proves that you know the language.\n\n332\n00:18:44.459 --> 00:18:48.717\nThat's what it comes down to tha you\nknow what the language is that we\n\n333\n00:18:48.717 --> 00:18:53.201\ntalk when talk about network so\ndefinitely be aware but some of the other\n\n334\n00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:57.835\nconcepts that they mention here they\nmention Transport Layer Security we\n\n335\n00:18:57.835 --> 00:19:01.823\nwe've mentioned Transport Layer Security\nin the context of.\n\n336\n00:19:01.823 --> 00:19:07.615\nUsing encrypted HTTPS traffic\ncertificate based authentication.\n\n337\n00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:11.604\nTLS isn't something that it's done\njust in a wireless network, but\n\n338\n00:19:11.604 --> 00:19:15.388\nwe can use certificate based\nauthentication where both of the end\n\n339\n00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:19.310\npoints have a certificate that\nissued by a certificate authority,\n\n340\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.552\nincreases the authentication strength\nof the security that much more.\n\n341\n00:19:23.552 --> 00:19:28.089\nThey also call out tunneled TLS,\nI do want you to be aware of that.\n\n342\n00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:31.773\nIt's exactly what it sounds like,\nit's a tunneled TLS communication.\n\n343\n00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:38.760\nIt's T-T-L-S, not very common but it is\nsomething that might come out on the exam.\n\n344\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.800\nWe've also talked about\nin switch hardening,\n\n345\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.828\nwe've talked about MAC filtering and\nthat was on a port basis.\n\n346\n00:19:45.828 --> 00:19:50.403\nA group of MAC addresses that were\nallowed to communicate with over porch\n\n347\n00:19:50.403 --> 00:19:51.380\non the switch.\n\n348\n00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.600\nWell, you can also do MAC\nfiltering in a Wireless network.\n\n349\n00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.850\nAnd when you do MAC filtering\non a wireless network,\n\n350\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.170\nit's kinda like the same concept.\n\n351\n00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.470\nYou're saying okay, well I know Cherokee,\nI know my MAC address, I know maybe\n\n352\n00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.910\nour tablet's MAC address, we're gonna\nallow them to communicate on our network.\n\n353\n00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.640\nBut, any other MAC addresses are gonna\nbe filtered out and denied access.\n\n354\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:19.650\nIt's not something that you wanna\ndo by yourself or by itself.\n\n355\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay Wes, are we talking\ninbound connections for this\n\n356\n00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.150\nMAC address filtering, or are we trying to\nallow or prohibit certain MAC addresses.\n\n357\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.823\nWhat can we do?\n\n358\n00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:29.870\nWhat kind of configurations\nare you talking about?\n\n359\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.540\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting that you asked that.\n\n360\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.080\nThe way I presented it, it would be,\nwe're only going to allow these.\n\n361\n00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.460\nBut that's right, we can do allow or deny.\n\n362\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.923\nSo for instance, we can say, okay, these\ngroup of MAC addresses are allowed on\n\n363\n00:20:41.923 --> 00:20:45.066\nthe network and nothing else or\nwe could do it opposite.\n\n364\n00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:48.706\nMaybe we've got a couple of people that\nwe know what their MAC addresses are and\n\n365\n00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:52.250\nthey're now disgruntled employees,\nwe don't want them on our networks.\n\n366\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.150\nWe can say, okay allow al MAC\naddresses except these two.\n\n367\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.382\nSo you could do a white listing or\nyou could do a black listing,\n\n368\n00:20:59.382 --> 00:21:00.637\nan allow versus a deny.\n\n369\n00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:03.760\nAnd that'll really be contingent\non the settings that you have on\n\n370\n00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.363\nthat device that you're using.\n\n371\n00:21:05.363 --> 00:21:08.003\nSo that pretty much takes care\nof the wireless security,\n\n372\n00:21:08.003 --> 00:21:11.908\nnow they do call out some different user\nauthentication methods, I'll go ahead and\n\n373\n00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:14.778\ntalk about one you really\nshouldn't be using at all anymore.\n\n374\n00:21:14.778 --> 00:21:18.711\nAnd that's the password authentication\npassword protocol PAPP it\n\n375\n00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:21.609\nallows authentication of\na remote connection but\n\n376\n00:21:21.609 --> 00:21:25.887\nall it does is authenticate you it does\nabsolutely nothing to protect your\n\n377\n00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:30.732\nuser name or password o it's a plain text\nprotocol it really should be using it now.\n\n378\n00:21:30.732 --> 00:21:34.293\nThey came out with something as\nmore of a replacement for PAP, and\n\n379\n00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.060\nit was a little bit more secure.\n\n380\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.950\nAnd that's something called\n\n381\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.530\nthe Challenge-Handshake\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n382\n00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:44.334\nAnd then Microsoft has their spin and\ntheir variant on it that is MS-CHAP,\n\n383\n00:21:44.334 --> 00:21:47.980\nwhich MS-CHAP is\nrelatively insecure today.\n\n384\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.807\nSo really, the industry standard that is\nbeing adopted today is MS-CHAP version 2.\n\n385\n00:21:52.807 --> 00:21:55.719\nBut either way,\nthe concept is still the same, but\n\n386\n00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:59.170\nthis is a challenge-response\ntype of protocol.\n\n387\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.910\nLike for instance, we say,\nit's a handshaking protocol.\n\n388\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.190\nWhen we say TCP, right,\nit's a three way handshake.\n\n389\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.300\nI send a synchronization\nrequest to the server,\n\n390\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.240\nthe server sends me back\na synchronization acknowledgement says,\n\n391\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.910\nhey I realized you wanna\nestablish a communication.\n\n392\n00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.720\nAnd then the last part my client\ncomputer says, okay I acknowledge and\n\n393\n00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.770\nsend an acknowledge, right.\n\n394\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.970\nSo we have the seen,\nthe seen act, and the act packet.\n\n395\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.330\nWell, this challenge hand shake\nauthentication protocol goes to that\n\n396\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.630\nhandshaking process as well.\n\n397\n00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.360\nIn fact, if we gonna look at my computer\nhere, I got kind of a simplistic diagram\n\n398\n00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.160\nof what's really going on\nwith CHAP you got this.\n\n399\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.770\nFour step process, give or\n\n400\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.820\ntake if you will, you have what's\nknown as a connection request.\n\n401\n00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.086\nAnd then the server sends back\nan authentication challenge and\n\n402\n00:22:43.086 --> 00:22:46.943\nthen there's a challenge response\nmessage that goes back from the client,\n\n403\n00:22:46.943 --> 00:22:49.789\nback to the server or\nfrom the client back to the server.\n\n404\n00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:53.325\nAnd then based on that\nauthentication response,\n\n405\n00:22:53.325 --> 00:22:57.540\nit's either gonna be accepted or\nit's gonna be rejected.\n\n406\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.731\nNow, that is the high-level\noverview of what's going on, but\n\n407\n00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:03.070\nlet's look at it just a little bit more.\n\n408\n00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.830\nWhen you look at the first part,\nthe first part is\n\n409\n00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.820\na connection request that is established\nover LCP, or the Link Control Protocol.\n\n410\n00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.600\nThe next thing that happens is\nthere's an authentication challenge.\n\n411\n00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.551\nAnd what the authentication challenge,\nthe server sends a random value, boom,\n\n412\n00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:21.284\nsends it back to the client.\n\n413\n00:23:21.284 --> 00:23:25.197\nNow what the client does as part\nof the challenge response is,\n\n414\n00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:30.316\nit takes the challenge and the password\nthat we're gonna use to authenticate and\n\n415\n00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:32.650\nessentially runs through hashing,\n\n416\n00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.166\nit performs a one way function with\nthe challenge and the password, and\n\n417\n00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:42.009\nit sends that hashed value as the\nchallenge response back over the network.\n\n418\n00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:44.237\nNow I want you to see why CHAP or MS-CHAP,\n\n419\n00:23:44.237 --> 00:23:48.901\nMS-CHAP version two is much better than\nthe password authentication protocol path.\n\n420\n00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:55.119\nNotice the password itself Never hit\nthe wire, it's only the hashed value.\n\n421\n00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:59.240\nAll right, so then what does the server do\nas part of the authentication acception or\n\n422\n00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.870\nrejection, all right?\n\n423\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.770\nWell, the server,\nit takes the challenge that it remembers,\n\n424\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.760\nbecause it issued the challenge.\n\n425\n00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.850\nAnd it says, well,\nI know what the password is.\n\n426\n00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.280\nLet me take that password and\n\n427\n00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.710\nthe challenge I gave you, and let me run\nit through a one way function, all right?\n\n428\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.400\nAnd let me compare the two.\n\n429\n00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:20.370\nNow, if that value happens\nto be the same value,\n\n430\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:25.260\nthen we can deduce that you\nare who you say you are,\n\n431\n00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.290\ncuz when I challenged you, you had a\npassword that you performed a function on,\n\n432\n00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.450\nsend it over the wire to me, and\nthen I could revert, not really reverse\n\n433\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.540\nthe process, I could do the same\nprocess and compare the two values.\n\n434\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.030\nIf you didn't have the right password,\nwell, the server's gonna say,\n\n435\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.680\nwell I don't know what is.\n\n436\n00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.330\nYou're obviously not who you're reporting\nto be, because I have your password and\n\n437\n00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.240\nwhen I perform that one way function,\nthese didn't match, so you must not have\n\n438\n00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.140\ngiven me the right password, so\nthe connection is gonna be rejected.\n\n439\n00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.770\nThat's the challenge handshake\nauthentication protocol.\n\n440\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.820\nThere's other ones out there too,\nwe also have the extensible authentication\n\n441\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.470\nprotocol, EAP, and this is really good,\nbecause what this does is this is\n\n442\n00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.660\na framework that points the point to point\nprotocol basically down in this framework,\n\n443\n00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.700\nand you can add other\nauthentication methods to it.\n\n444\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.350\nSo that's the extensibility part.\n\n445\n00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.140\nThis is where we get\nthings like Smart Cards,\n\n446\n00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.470\nCertificate based authentication\nthrough AEPTLS, and\n\n447\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.820\nthere's all different types of variance\nand we'll probably see additional variance\n\n448\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:34.390\nkeep coming out as they produce the\ntechnologies, and as technology advances.\n\n449\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.370\nNow they also call out something known\nas Kerberos, all right, or Kerberos,\n\n450\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.820\nhowever you might wanna say that.\n\n451\n00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.320\nAnd what is Kerberos?\n\n452\n00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.270\nWell, Kerberos, or Kerberos,\n\n453\n00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.640\nif you will, is a Ticket times\nstamping protocol, all right.\n\n454\n00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.070\nAnd what it does is it uses the primary\nauthentication mechanism inside of\n\n455\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.120\na Windows domain, right.\n\n456\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.362\nAnd what happens is when he client\nperforms a log on, all right,\n\n457\n00:25:57.362 --> 00:26:01.095\nthey log on against the Kerberos server\nand then act a directory domain.\n\n458\n00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:02.740\nIt's gonna be your domain controller.\n\n459\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.870\nAnd what happens is a, you know what?\n\n460\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:06.750\nI have that wrong.\n\n461\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:09.150\nLet me get the right steps there.\n\n462\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.030\nSo the client logs on.\n\n463\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:18.190\nThe Kerberos server then turns around and\nissues the client a timestamped TGT.\n\n464\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:24.050\nTGT stands for ticket granting ticket and\nthen that's cached on the local machine.\n\n465\n00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.070\nNow, I'm logged in.\n\n466\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.940\nI've got this TGT cached.\n\n467\n00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.470\nYou might say, well, what happens\nif I try to access a resource?\n\n468\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.563\nWill I take the TGT, and\nI present it to the resource?\n\n469\n00:26:34.563 --> 00:26:35.554\nUh-uh.\n\n470\n00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:38.062\nThis is where, this is kind of\nwhere these guys out there at MIT,\n\n471\n00:26:38.062 --> 00:26:39.972\nthey're just absolutely brilliant,\nsaid no.\n\n472\n00:26:39.972 --> 00:26:44.790\nYou are not passing the TGT back, in\nfact what you gonna do is you gonna send\n\n473\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.766\nthe TGT back to the Kerberos server,\nlet's gonna a look at the time stamping\n\n474\n00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:53.280\ninformation and\nit makes sure that it's valid.\n\n475\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.090\nRight, and once it validates the TGT,\n\n476\n00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.150\nit's gonna give you another\nticket called a service ticket.\n\n477\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.560\nThe service ticket is issued, and\nthen it's the service ticket ultimately,\n\n478\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.400\nthat is basically sent over\nto the resource server.\n\n479\n00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.500\nLet's say if it's a file server that\nyou're trying to gain access to.\n\n480\n00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.000\nWell, why is it that the resource\nserver trusts the service ticket?\n\n481\n00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.250\nWell, it trusts the authority\nthat issued it.\n\n482\n00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.850\nAnd it says well,\n\n483\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.410\nit's gotta be the Kerberos server\nthat issued this service ticket,\n\n484\n00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.720\nso I trust it because, I don't know who\nyou are but I trust the Kerberos server.\n\n485\n00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.960\nSo you must be good right?\n\n486\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.460\nSo the Kerberos server says your good, I\nwill let you have access to the resource.\n\n487\n00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.410\nKeep in mind Kerberos, by the way, does\nhave a specific port that it goes over and\n\n488\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.220\nthat is port 88.\n\n489\n00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.320\nI'm not sure if it will show up on\nthe exam but just in case it does.\n\n490\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those MIT ladies and gents.\n\n491\n00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.520\nThey kind of mean like a double entendre\nhere whenever you look at Kerberos and\n\n492\n00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.760\nthey were talking about\nthat three-headed dog.\n\n493\n00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.890\nAnd just like Wes showed us you\nsee those three main components so\n\n494\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.020\nif that helps you remember it.\n\n495\n00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.360\nThen more power to you.\n\n496\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, now Cherokee, one of the\nlast things that they call out, I think,\n\n497\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.380\nis kinda interesting because this\nis implementing hardening systems.\n\n498\n00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.460\nWe're talking about\nuser authentication and\n\n499\n00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.500\nthat's something known as\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n500\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.070\nLet's go ahead and talk about what\nthe authentication factors are so\n\n501\n00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.440\nwe can know what multi-factor\nauthentication is.\n\n502\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.990\nIn fact, I got a little list here for you,\n\n503\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:19.480\nanother one of those lovely lists here on\nmy desktop, if we can take a look at that.\n\n504\n00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.650\nThe common authentication factors\nthat we have are something you know,\n\n505\n00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.240\nsomething you have, and\nthen something you are.\n\n506\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.210\nAll right,\nif we say something that you know right?\n\n507\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.470\nThat's a user name and a password, right?\n\n508\n00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.080\nA PIN, right?\n\n509\n00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.320\nA PIN, a shared secret, a security\nquestion, that's something I know,\n\n510\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.680\nall right.\n\n511\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.960\nSomething you have, that could be\nsomething as simple as I'm sitting here\n\n512\n00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.370\ngrabbing for it around my neck and\nit's not there but like an RFID key fob.\n\n513\n00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.010\nThank you, and\nCherokee got hers right here.\n\n514\n00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:52.920\nAnd we've got a little RFID card here,\nright?\n\n515\n00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.850\nThat's something I have.\n\n516\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.200\nThank you there, Cherokee.\n\n517\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.320\nAnd it could be something like\na little key fob if you will.\n\n518\n00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.470\nThat is something you have.\n\n519\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.400\nThat's another authentication factor.\n\n520\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.500\nThe last common authentication\nfactor is something you are.\n\n521\n00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.910\nSomething you are boils\ndown to biometrics, right.\n\n522\n00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.500\nA hand geometry scanner,\na retinal scanner,\n\n523\n00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.040\na fingerprint scanner,\na voice recognition system.\n\n524\n00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.100\nI went ahead and\nput a couple of newer ones that they also,\n\n525\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.500\nI don't know if they're\ngonna throw these in here.\n\n526\n00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.370\nBut these are ones that\nare maybe aren't so common yet.\n\n527\n00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.130\nCuz they're still trying to refine the\ntechnology and this is something you do.\n\n528\n00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.700\nI don't know if it's\ngonna be on the exams.\n\n529\n00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.330\nSomething you do is some\nkind of action that can be\n\n530\n00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.840\nused to authenticate who you are like for\ninstance, I've heard of,\n\n531\n00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.900\nit's just really a key stroke what\nit sounds like, but key board typing\n\n532\n00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:44.150\npattern recognitions, verifying you\nare who you are by something that you do.\n\n533\n00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.300\nThey can authenticate me just by how\nmany times I hit the backspace button.\n\n534\n00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.140\nThat's like my electronic white out,\nif you guys remember what a white out is.\n\n535\n00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.540\nSomewhere you are is like geolocation,\nthey can also do that.\n\n536\n00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.840\nAgain, these aren't as common.\n\n537\n00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.790\nI want you to know for the test the more\ncommon ones that we talk about.\n\n538\n00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.060\nSo what does it mean to be multifactor?\n\n539\n00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.680\nWell, it's two or all of these, right?\n\n540\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.760\nYou might hear it called one factor,\nwhich is not a multifactor, two factor and\n\n541\n00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.360\nthree factor authentication.\n\n542\n00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:15.930\nMultifactor just combines more than\none of these authentication factor,\n\n543\n00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.200\nso do keep that in mind when we say\nmultifactor identification we're talking\n\n544\n00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.660\nabout like a user name and password and\nmaybe a key fab way An RSID,\n\n545\n00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.010\none of those key generators, right?\n\n546\n00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.730\nCould be biometrics and\na PIN number, right?\n\n547\n00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.480\nI'll give you a classic example, of one\nthat you're probably using on a daily\n\n548\n00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.925\nbasis if you didn't realize it, right?\n\n549\n00:30:36.925 --> 00:30:38.725\nYour credit card, right?\n\n550\n00:30:38.725 --> 00:30:40.515\nMaybe not your credit card but\na debit card.\n\n551\n00:30:40.515 --> 00:30:42.585\nI swipe my debit card,\nI still have to know my PIN.\n\n552\n00:30:42.585 --> 00:30:46.455\nAnd it combines something you\nknow with something you have.\n\n553\n00:30:46.455 --> 00:30:50.507\nAnd the combination of the two mean\nit's a multi-factor authentication.\n\n554\n00:30:50.507 --> 00:30:53.077\nWhen you implement multi\nfactor authentication,\n\n555\n00:30:53.077 --> 00:30:56.037\nyou are increasing your security.\n\n556\n00:30:56.037 --> 00:30:56.927\n&gt;&gt; Now, you mentioned this,\n\n557\n00:30:56.927 --> 00:31:00.257\nbut I just want to really clarify,\nbecause you said username and password.\n\n558\n00:31:00.257 --> 00:31:03.957\nSo, Wes, if you were to categorize that,\nhow would it be categorized?\n\n559\n00:31:03.957 --> 00:31:05.627\nIs that multi factor authentication?\n\n560\n00:31:05.627 --> 00:31:08.817\n&gt;&gt; I'm glad you asked that, because\nI tell you, when I first started out\n\n561\n00:31:08.817 --> 00:31:11.337\nI would have thought that that is\na multi factor authentication, but\n\n562\n00:31:11.337 --> 00:31:13.260\nboth of those are something you know.\n\n563\n00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.480\nJust because it's two you would\nthink that it's multi, but\n\n564\n00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.400\nit's just multiples of a single factor,\nright?\n\n565\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.100\nIt's something you know.\n\n566\n00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.220\nYou know your name and\nyou know your password.\n\n567\n00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.260\nNow if you were to take that and\ncombine a username and\n\n568\n00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.580\npassword with a smart card that you had\nto swipe on the side of the keyboard or\n\n569\n00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.050\non the side of the monitor or\nsomething, that would be multi factor.\n\n570\n00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.490\nDon't confuse that.\n\n571\n00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.480\nUser name and\npassword is being multi factor.\n\n572\n00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.120\nIt's still a single factor or\na one factor authentication mechanism.\n\n573\n00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.570\n&gt;&gt; I see that happening more and\nmore often, we're going to be probably\n\n574\n00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.490\nin the future, the certain passwords are\ngoing by the way side, and where I'm even\n\n575\n00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:52.260\ngetting messages on my cellphone to have\nthat additional authentication there.\n\n576\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.470\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, well, looking at it,\nthe last thing that they talk about we've\n\n577\n00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.400\nkinda already covered but\nI'll just recap it real quick.\n\n578\n00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.080\nRemember message digest.\n\n579\n00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.420\nThese are one way functions and again,\n\n580\n00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.390\nthey call it as a one\nway encryption method.\n\n581\n00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.440\nIt's not really encryption,\n\n582\n00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.899\nit's just the fact that you're\nproducing a fixed link value.\n\n583\n00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.870\n&gt;&gt; Regardless of what the data size is\nit's called one way because it can't\n\n584\n00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.980\nbe reverse engineered to tell you what\nthe original information was, and\n\n585\n00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.770\nit's done for\nthe purposes of things like for instance,\n\n586\n00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.490\ndigital signatures out there to\nverify that the integrity of\n\n587\n00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:27.120\nan application that you're downloading\nhasn't been modified in transit Whether\n\n588\n00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.020\nit be through malicious intentions or\nnetwork transmission errors,\n\n589\n00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.410\noperating systems that you download,\nany kind of application.\n\n590\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.810\nAgain, it's about the verification and\nthe integrity of whatever it is,\n\n591\n00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.460\nwhatever communication, what other\nsoftware application that you're using.\n\n592\n00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.490\nKeep in mind that you really shouldn't be\nusing message just five any more it really\n\n593\n00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:53.170\nshow one 160 bit years\nconsider the explodable or\n\n594\n00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:57.995\ncrackable if you will and really you\nshould be using things like 256 bit and\n\n595\n00:32:57.995 --> 00:33:01.155\nabove when it comes to\nthe secure hashing algorithm.\n\n596\n00:33:01.155 --> 00:33:03.525\n&gt;&gt; Well, we made it through\nall the way to part three.\n\n597\n00:33:03.525 --> 00:33:06.785\nSo thank you so much, Wes, for\ntaking the time to explain all of that.\n\n598\n00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:09.085\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\nfor hanging in there with us.\n\n599\n00:33:09.085 --> 00:33:11.685\nBut stay tuned,\nwe do have more NetPlus headed your way.\n\n600\n00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:15.455\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off on this\nshow as your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n601\n00:33:15.455 --> 00:33:16.285\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n602\n00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.778\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n603\n00:33:20.318 --> 00:33:25.278\n[MUSIC]\n\n604\n00:33:25.278 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.490\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network+ show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.540\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.300\nIn this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.720\nwe'll be looking at different types\nof physical security controls.\n\n7\n00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.760\nWith us today we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.350\nWes Bryant in studios,\nthank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.950\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back,\n\n10\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.170\nalways a pleasure to be\nhere with the ITProTV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.940\nThat's right, physical security controls.\n\n12\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.460\nWe've been looking at other episodes when\nwe've been talking about security, but\n\n13\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.710\nmore from a network standpoint and things\nlike host security network base security.\n\n14\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.570\nBut we also have to take a step back and\n\n15\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.770\nwe got to kind of look at things\nlike the old lock and key, right?\n\n16\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.660\nWe have to make sure that people can't\ngain physical access into our network so\n\n17\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.820\nthat's gonna be what we're primarily\nbe looking at in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.430\nJumping right in,\n\n19\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.960\none of the first topics that they talk\nabout are what are known as man traps.\n\n20\n00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.520\nAnd maybe you're not familiar\nwith what a man trap is,\n\n21\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.020\nbut you've probably seen even\nthe basic type of man trap, right?\n\n22\n00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.260\nWhat do these do?\n\n23\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590\nFirst of all, what they do is they help\nto prevent against things like piggy-back\n\n24\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.750\nattacks, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.470\nWhere a secure door opens up,\ntwo people walk through, right?\n\n26\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.460\nIn a secure environment,\n\n27\n00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.730\nyou wanna make sure that if you\nhave one authenticated entry,\n\n28\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.260\nyou only have one person going through\nthat door, think of the turn style, right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.460\nThe turn style is a basic\nform of like a man trap.\n\n30\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.320\nNow it's not technically the man trap but\nit does keep people from more than one\n\n31\n00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.680\nperson from going through some kind\nof secure entry or secure area.\n\n32\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.730\nI think for\ninstance inside of the airport, right?\n\n33\n00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.980\nYou go into a secure area, the turn style\nallows you through, you take your picture\n\n34\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.810\nif you're doing international travel,\nmaybe you have to swipe your passport.\n\n35\n00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.830\nBut you have to keep in mind,\nit's the person that's behind you,\n\n36\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.260\ncannot go through with you, and\nthat's essentially what the man trap is.\n\n37\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.690\nIn fact, these man traps, they can get\nvery, very sophisticated in the fact that\n\n38\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.880\nyou typically will have a public entrance\nand you have a door on each side,\n\n39\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.120\nright, and one person walks in that\ndoor and that door behind them closes.\n\n40\n00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.495\nOnce that door behind them door\ncloses you walk to the second side,\n\n41\n00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.472\nthe other side of this room and you have a\ndoor that you need a secure area that you\n\n42\n00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:14.121\nneed to authenticate against.\n\n43\n00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.550\nOnce you authenticate against\nthat secure area door,\n\n44\n00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.800\nit opens up It allows\nthe person to go through.\n\n45\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.880\nThat door closes and\nthen the next person can come in.\n\n46\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.590\nSo keep in mind that the man\ntrap's a good way to stop the,\n\n47\n00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.200\nagain the piggy back attacks\nthat can happen, right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.290\nIn a very secure environment,\nyou might think well,\n\n49\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.390\nit might be easy to bypass if somebody\nholds a door open for somebody, right?\n\n50\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.940\nAs human beings, we want to help somebody.\n\n51\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.400\nSo if I wanna do some kind of\nsocial engineering attack where I'm\n\n52\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.950\npretending to be somebody I'm not and\n\n53\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.800\nI walk up to that door and I'm fumbling\nfew boxes as the bad actor, right.\n\n54\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.935\nSomeone is gonna probably trying\nto help me in, open the door.\n\n55\n00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:54.300\nThis, basically prevents that, right.\n\n56\n00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.888\nThis says it doesn't matter\nwho's coming through that door.\n\n57\n00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:00.020\nWe're gonna have one public entrance,\none person walks in that door.\n\n58\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.630\nThe door closes then they go to the other\nside of the man trap, they authenticate,\n\n59\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.810\nthe secure area door opens up.\n\n60\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.050\nIt closes and\nthen the next person can come in.\n\n61\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.190\nSo keep in mind that's\nessentially what the man trap is.\n\n62\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.050\nNow, they also talk about keeping things\nlike physical security controls and\n\n63\n00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.250\ntalk about network closets.\n\n64\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.736\nWhat might you think that a network\ncloset would really be, well,\n\n65\n00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.907\nanything why is that security?\n\n66\n00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:29.250\nWell, if you think about your servers,\nright and your network equipment,\n\n67\n00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.036\nyou just don't want anybody being\nable to gain access to them.\n\n68\n00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:35.937\nSo, for instance,\nyou don't wanna put a server in,\n\n69\n00:03:35.937 --> 00:03:39.070\nI don't know, like a facilities closet.\n\n70\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.850\nAnd I've seen them there, too.\n\n71\n00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.380\nBecause anybody can gain access to them,\nright?\n\n72\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.390\nAnd your network switches, what if\nsomebody can gain physical access to it,\n\n73\n00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.600\nwalks over and plugs into that device?\n\n74\n00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.630\nThey plug into that device.\n\n75\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.900\nRemember, what is it?\n\n76\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.020\nOne of the ten immutable laws of\nsecurity says that if I can gain\n\n77\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.660\naccess to your network,\nit's no longer your network.\n\n78\n00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.430\nSo that's why it's important that we have,\nwe implement things like network closets.\n\n79\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.070\nIn fact, we've got one here\nat the ITProTV studios, and\n\n80\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.180\nit has a cypher lock, a keypad door lock.\n\n81\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.380\nAnd we'll look at some of those coming up,\nbut It means that you have to\n\n82\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.270\nhave the code in order to open up\nthe door and get into the server closet.\n\n83\n00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.150\nSo if you say network closets if you\nsay server closets guys keep in mind\n\n84\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.420\nthat these are pretty much one and the\nsame unless you're talking about something\n\n85\n00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.810\nlike maybe premise wiring or\nIntermediate distribution frames but\n\n86\n00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.235\nwhat we're not really worried about that\nright now because you might have a network\n\n87\n00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:36.420\nclosets on each floor,\nbut that doesn't matter.\n\n88\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.600\nEach floor was gonna have to\nhave its own secure location for\n\n89\n00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.400\nyour network equipment.\n\n90\n00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.250\nThey also talk about things like,\nfor instance, video monitoring.\n\n91\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.270\nWell video monitoring,\nthey call out things like IP cams, and\n\n92\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.700\nthey also call out CCTV and\nclosed caption TV.\n\n93\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.080\nWhat's kind of interesting today is when\nyou look and you are searching for these\n\n94\n00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.610\ntypes of technologies, you really see that\nthey're one and the same sometimes right.\n\n95\n00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.630\nAn IP based camera that allows you to\ndo closed circuit television, right.\n\n96\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.270\nBut there are many different kinds, and it\nreally depends on what you have to view,\n\n97\n00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.490\nthe areas that you have to view, on which\ntype you might acquire or purchase.\n\n98\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.100\nFor instance they have bullet,\nbullet IP based cameras.\n\n99\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.415\nI tell you what, let's go ahead and\ngo shopping here, we're gonna ahead.\n\n100\n00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:26.790\n&gt;&gt; Hey!\nThat's right we're gonna.\n\n101\n00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:27.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna expect\n\n102\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.420\n&gt;&gt; Now you're talking my language now.\n\n103\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.626\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna spend some\nof Cherokee's money here.\n\n104\n00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:31.940\n&gt;&gt; Wait wait, what.\n\n105\n00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n106\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.860\nNot so fun anymore.\n\n107\n00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and\n\n108\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.370\nlet's talk about the like\nthe first the first type of IP\n\n109\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.680\ncamera that they mentioned and\n\n110\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.220\nI'm just kind of giving you an example\nthese really aren't on the objectives.\n\n111\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.850\nThey kind of leave it a little vague and\njust talk about IP cameras.\n\n112\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.490\nSo one of the types that you\ncould have is a bullet camera,\n\n113\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.180\nin fact it looks like my search history is\ntelling me I've done this once or twice.\n\n114\n00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.840\nYou can look, for instance let's go to\nAmazon here, they've got bullet cameras.\n\n115\n00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.470\nAnd you can see probably why\nthey're called a bullet camera.\n\n116\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.110\nI mean, it's kinda shaped like a bullet.\n\n117\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.100\nAnd depending on what type of\n\n118\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.330\nlighting you have might dictate\nwhich type of camera you have.\n\n119\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.050\nFor instance,\nyou might need low light visibility.\n\n120\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.850\nAnd in a low light visibility,\na lot of time these, and not all the time.\n\n121\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.140\nBut these bullet cameras will have\na series of LEDs around them.\n\n122\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.050\nAnd that's for things like infrared,\nthey call them night vision.\n\n123\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.420\nThey might call them IR\ncameras as well for infrared.\n\n124\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.060\nBut that is in situations where you\nhave very low light visibility.\n\n125\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.830\nAnd you need to be able to see there.\n\n126\n00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.420\nThey've also got other kinds too so for\n\n127\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.665\ninstance, another type of IP cameras\nwhat is known as a dome camera.\n\n128\n00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:44.150\nAnd a dome camera, it really depends\nyou probably seen some of these\n\n129\n00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.590\nas a web camera where it's just a ball a\nglobe if you will sitting down on a base,\n\n130\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.350\nwell you take the whole thing, turn it\nupside down and mount it on the ceiling,\n\n131\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.380\nwell now you've got a dome-based\nIP camera that can be used for\n\n132\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.970\nmonitoring your physical security.\n\n133\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.570\nNow, keep in mind that\nwith these dome cameras,\n\n134\n00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.470\nthey can have a different range\nof a viewing area, if you will.\n\n135\n00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.870\nSo for instance,\n\n136\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.260\nsome types of dome cameras will also\nbe called what's known as a PTZ camera.\n\n137\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.100\nSo if we go ahead and look at a PTZ\ncamera, you can see an example of some\n\n138\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.490\nover here and, let's see here,\ndoes Amazon have any of those?\n\n139\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.210\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll go ahead and go shopping here.\n\n140\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.640\nSo this is again CCTV and\nyou can see it's a type of PTZ camera,\n\n141\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.010\nand what that means is, pan, tilt, zoom.\n\n142\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.730\nIt means how does the camera\nmove in its base?\n\n143\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.540\nAnd again, the base is typically\nmounted to the the ceiling, or\n\n144\n00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.700\nit could be mounted to\nthe side of the wall.\n\n145\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.152\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, if we look at these PTZ\ncameras, sometimes they do draw or\n\n146\n00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.630\nrequire more wattage to go ahead and\nfunction.\n\n147\n00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.684\nSo if we're using something like POE,\npower over Ethernet,\n\n148\n00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:53.914\nthen we might want to look at\nan alternative POE+ just because you\n\n149\n00:07:53.914 --> 00:07:57.380\nwant to look at the amount of energy\nthat That these particular devices\n\n150\n00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.726\ndraw in case that's something\na feature you're looking for.\n\n151\n00:08:00.726 --> 00:08:03.751\n&gt;&gt; True, and if you look at things\nlike your outside, your perimeter,\n\n152\n00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:05.170\nthe perimeter of the building.\n\n153\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.992\nIt's sometimes not so\neasy to install an electrical conduit,\n\n154\n00:08:07.992 --> 00:08:11.093\nbecause the outside of the building\na lot of times is blocks, right?\n\n155\n00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:15.612\nSo, do keep that in mind,\nthat if you do need to run power to them,\n\n156\n00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:21.070\nyou might need to include something\nlike PoE plus, power over ethernet.\n\n157\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.110\nThat not only do you have an IP\nbased camera that's delivering\n\n158\n00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.820\nthe network communications over.\n\n159\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.190\nTypically a Cat cable, the category 5E,\ncategory 6, if you will.\n\n160\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.348\nBut it could also handle having\nthe power injected on that line,\n\n161\n00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.130\nbasically the power of the camera as well.\n\n162\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.473\nSome of the considerations that\nwe need to think about is,\n\n163\n00:08:41.473 --> 00:08:44.215\none of the big ones is\nstorage considerations.\n\n164\n00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:48.726\nAnd why I say that is you might want\nto couple this with things like, for\n\n165\n00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:52.936\ninstance your DVR capabilities,\ndigital video recording, and\n\n166\n00:08:52.936 --> 00:08:57.400\nwhen it comes to digital video recording,\nit can add up pretty good.\n\n167\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.910\nIn fact, the storage capacity or\n\n168\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.550\nthe storage accrual if you will,\nthat can add up relatively fast.\n\n169\n00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.070\nSo you also have to consider, if you\nare gonna have one of these CCTV cameras,\n\n170\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.760\nIP based cameras, you have to think about\nwhere is your data gonna be stored and\n\n171\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.410\nhow fast are you gonna accrue the data.\n\n172\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.491\nNow this might be something were\nyou implement like a for instance,\n\n173\n00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:25.803\nyou're grandfather father's son type tape\nrotation method or storage media method.\n\n174\n00:09:25.803 --> 00:09:27.016\nYou also have to keep in mind,\n\n175\n00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:29.650\nthe hard drives or\nwhere you're gonna store that information.\n\n176\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.350\nIs it gonna be cloud based storage.\n\n177\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.068\nThey do have solutions like that to where\nwell you're just getting charged for\n\n178\n00:09:36.068 --> 00:09:38.772\nthe amount of storage you have or\nthat you're cooling but\n\n179\n00:09:38.772 --> 00:09:41.555\nit is something that you have\nto take into consideration.\n\n180\n00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:46.180\nThe other thing too is that do we have\nthe remote viewing capabilities, right.\n\n181\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.900\nIf we're talking about for\n\n182\n00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.660\ninstance having a security guard, we'll\nyou've got the remote viewing capability.\n\n183\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.880\nYou've got a security guard\nbehind a series of monitors and\n\n184\n00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.060\nthey're watching what's going on.\n\n185\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.350\nBut if you don't have that,\nwe're having an access to him?\n\n186\n00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.680\nWell, again it is IP based communications,\nso a lot of times they'll have the remote\n\n187\n00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.920\nviewing capabilities to where you don't\nhave to be in the physical location of\n\n188\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.570\nthe area in order to see what's\ngoing on within your business.\n\n189\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.640\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, we probably would wanna think\nabout the logical placement of these\n\n190\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.490\ndevices if we do have remote\ncapability enabled because,\n\n191\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:24.042\nif I have it placed on my DMZ or\nsome kind of like no authentic,\n\n192\n00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:28.260\n[LAUGH] If I can't speak here,\nno authentication type network,\n\n193\n00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.330\nthen I wouldn't want anyone to be\nable to look at my, at company or\n\n194\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.080\nmaybe it's not a big deal but\nyou kinda wanna think about that, right?\n\n195\n00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so we're trying to\nimplement security and the security that\n\n196\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.340\nwe're implementing becomes the security\nrisk itself and that can happen.\n\n197\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.544\nI mean, IP based cameras, you have all\nkinds of different attacks that'll go\n\n198\n00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:49.702\nacross the network to where people try\nto gain access to the IP based network.\n\n199\n00:10:49.702 --> 00:10:52.746\nSo if they can gain access\nto an IP based network,\n\n200\n00:10:52.746 --> 00:10:56.720\nthey can potentially gain\naccess to the IP based camera.\n\n201\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.648\nAnd this is really could be a concern\nbecause think about where it might not be\n\n202\n00:11:01.648 --> 00:11:04.653\nperimeter that you're\njust doing too right.\n\n203\n00:11:04.653 --> 00:11:09.252\nAnd when I say perimeter security, I'm not\nnecessarily talking about a logical DMZ or\n\n204\n00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.528\nsomething but literally\nthe perimeter of your building, but\n\n205\n00:11:12.528 --> 00:11:14.360\ninside of your building, right?\n\n206\n00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.730\nIf you're doing internal security and\n\n207\n00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.230\nsomebody can piggyback off\nthat IP based communication.\n\n208\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.720\nThey now can see what's going on inside\nof your networks and even worse,\n\n209\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.040\nthey can start to profile, right?\n\n210\n00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.290\nDo fingerprinting and stuff and\nsay, well, I know at 9 PM,\n\n211\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.120\nthat guard is gonna leave his desk or\nher desk.\n\n212\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.660\nThey're gonna go and\nthey're gonna take lunch, and\n\n213\n00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.820\nthey're not gonna be back for an hour.\n\n214\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.690\nWell, you gotta make sure that you\nalso secure your IP-based cameras,\n\n215\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.810\ntoo, cuz they can become a security risk.\n\n216\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.396\nYour security can become\nthe security risk.\n\n217\n00:11:43.396 --> 00:11:45.250\nSome of the other things\nthat I would consider, too.\n\n218\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.720\nWe talked about POE, so\n\n219\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.620\nobviously with POE that's gonna be some\nform of wired based well, it is gonna be.\n\n220\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.540\nIt's gonna be wire based communications,\nbut you also have,\n\n221\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.520\nmay be you don't have\nthe wiring infrastructure,\n\n222\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.460\nmay be you don't need POE and can afford\nto do something like WiFi communications.\n\n223\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.068\nNow, going back to what Cherokee was\nmentioning, if we implement something like\n\n224\n00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:11.676\nWiFi communications on top of that, well\nnow we have radiated energy that might be\n\n225\n00:12:11.676 --> 00:12:14.057\na little bit easier to get\ninside of that network too.\n\n226\n00:12:14.057 --> 00:12:17.734\nSo you also have to think about that\njust like we talked about in past\n\n227\n00:12:17.734 --> 00:12:22.596\nepisodes when it comes to things like your\nradiated communications because now you've\n\n228\n00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:26.470\ngot RF communications that are emanating\noff of that IP based camera so\n\n229\n00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.760\nyou can have people that are sitting\noutside your network trying to crack in.\n\n230\n00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.579\nAnd, again,\n\n231\n00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:36.170\nyour camera becomes the point of entry\nwhen you're trying to secure yourself.\n\n232\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.530\nI mentioned a little bit\nabout low light visibility.\n\n233\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.720\nAgain, keep in mind you have things like,\nfor instance,\n\n234\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.880\ninfrared they talk about\nnight vision cameras.\n\n235\n00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.880\nA lot of times they're gonna be one and\nthe same.\n\n236\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.050\nAn infrared, night vision based camera.\n\n237\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.480\nI know that in one of\nthe companies that I worked for,\n\n238\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.550\nit could actually recreate color, too.\n\n239\n00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.110\nSo not only be able to see low\nlight visibility but it could take.\n\n240\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.157\nAnd it had some kinda computer software\nthat with it to where it can kinda\n\n241\n00:13:00.157 --> 00:13:03.611\nreconstruct the color too, but\nI thought it was looking at.\n\n242\n00:13:03.611 --> 00:13:05.669\nSo I don't know if you really need that.\n\n243\n00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:08.600\nBut that is kind of a flair,\nand it is kinda nice.\n\n244\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.450\nI mean, I can't tell what the color car\nis that was sitting outside of that\n\n245\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.200\ncorner of the building at 11 PM at night.\n\n246\n00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.050\nWouldn't it be nice to\nactually be able to tell,\n\n247\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.380\nif we didn't get a license plate number?\n\n248\n00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.442\nSo those are also things that you have to\nkeep in mind, too, when you are choosing\n\n249\n00:13:24.442 --> 00:13:29.990\nwhat kinda IP camera that you are gonna\nbasically purchase for your CCTV.\n\n250\n00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.012\nThe other thing too, motion sensors.\n\n251\n00:13:33.012 --> 00:13:36.940\nMotion sensors, in today's world everybody\nwants to go green and everything,\n\n252\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.190\nmotion sensors.\n\n253\n00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.410\nDo they trigger when they detect motion,\ndo they come on?\n\n254\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.182\nBecause, if you think about it maybe\nthey're recording 24/7 then your storage\n\n255\n00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:48.583\nis definitely gonna become something you\nhave to worry about when it comes to\n\n256\n00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:49.396\nstorage accrue.\n\n257\n00:13:49.396 --> 00:13:52.286\nBut if they're motion\nsensitive again maybe they're\n\n258\n00:13:52.286 --> 00:13:55.308\ntriggered through motion\nthat's always an option too.\n\n259\n00:13:55.308 --> 00:14:00.510\nNow they mention other things too like for\ninstance the probably one of the oldest\n\n260\n00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.891\nphysical security implementations\nwe have in existence, right?\n\n261\n00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:06.770\nGood old door lock.\n\n262\n00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.270\nWell, the door locks have come a long way\nwhen we look at the technologies today.\n\n263\n00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.490\nFor instance, they also call out things\nlike the keypad locks, cipher locks.\n\n264\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.443\nWell the cipher locks, keypad locks,\nthese typically take some kinda numerical\n\n265\n00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.100\npin entry if you will in\norder to gain access.\n\n266\n00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.840\nIn fact,\nthere's all different kinds of vendors.\n\n267\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.060\nAnd so, we're gonna continue\nto go shopping here on.\n\n268\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.340\nI know, Honeywell has these two.\n\n269\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:36.160\nSo if I go out to Honeywell,\nyou might see a keypad door lock.\n\n270\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.840\nLet's go ahead and\nsee if we can find some of these.\n\n271\n00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.010\nLike I said Honey, Honey, not Honeywell.\n\n272\n00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.670\nIt helps if you type the name right.\n\n273\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.020\nBut you can see these are some of them.\n\n274\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.980\nThese look more like they aren't for\nindustrial uses.\n\n275\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.680\nThey could be they're\njust kinda pretty here.\n\n276\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.390\nBut this is essentially what is known\nas a cipher door or a keypad door lock.\n\n277\n00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.330\n&gt;&gt; We're seeing some of these more\nadvanced type of technologies or\n\n278\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.450\nconcepts even coming to just\nthe residents I have even\n\n279\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.000\nseen just where was a quick set\nthe brand for like biometrics locks and\n\n280\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.630\nit was less than $100 I thought\nwhat that's pretty interesting.\n\n281\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.585\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly enough one of\nthe restaurants that I work for\n\n282\n00:15:14.585 --> 00:15:18.664\na restaurant right they had one on these\ndoors, so the employees had to enter again\n\n283\n00:15:18.664 --> 00:15:22.050\na numerical key, some kind of key\ncombination, in order to get in.\n\n284\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.670\nSo yeah, they work really well.\n\n285\n00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.140\nSome of the other brands here,\nKaba, if I'm saying that right.\n\n286\n00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.450\nSorry guys out there if you work for\nthis company and\n\n287\n00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.650\nI just completely murdered the name,\nbut you can see right now,\n\n288\n00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.750\njust K-A-B-A right up there in\nthe top of the search engine comes up.\n\n289\n00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.589\nWith these keypad locks in and this is\none in fact this is kinda interesting.\n\n290\n00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:43.123\nI think this might be the one tha was\non the door that I was telling you at\n\n291\n00:15:43.123 --> 00:15:44.363\nthe restaurant that I worked at.\n\n292\n00:15:44.363 --> 00:15:45.879\nAnd you can see they're not really cheap.\n\n293\n00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:51.861\nBut again how expensive\nshould security be?\n\n294\n00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:53.275\nWell how much can you afford to lose?\n\n295\n00:15:53.275 --> 00:15:54.963\nThat is really what it boils down to.\n\n296\n00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:58.750\nSo the pros and cons of these are,\nthey could be expensive.\n\n297\n00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.585\nAgain, the benefit is that they can\nsecure your doors a little bit more\n\n298\n00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:06.034\nthan just the traditional lock and\nkey, if you will, as well.\n\n299\n00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:09.989\nLockState's another one, just so\nwe're not picking on any one company.\n\n300\n00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:14.820\nI mean, we're not making any money off\nof this but, LockState is another one.\n\n301\n00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.654\nThey also have their keypad\ndoor digital door locks,\n\n302\n00:16:18.654 --> 00:16:21.813\nkind of give you an example\nof them here too.\n\n303\n00:16:21.813 --> 00:16:26.740\nAnd again, some of these are kind of fancy\nlooking, more like they're the home based,\n\n304\n00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.230\nresidential, you could see\nsomething like that as well.\n\n305\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.710\nBut again, they also have\ncommercial ones likewise, as well.\n\n306\n00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.342\n&gt;&gt; And something you might wanna consider,\nWes, I know like something we have here on\n\n307\n00:16:38.342 --> 00:16:42.328\nITProTV, we have a proximity card\nreader and it's kinda convenient.\n\n308\n00:16:42.328 --> 00:16:46.930\nPayton might, I saw him the other\nday he had one of our employees.\n\n309\n00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.760\nHe had it in his backpack,\nand he had his hands full,\n\n310\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.500\nbefore he kind of just turned his back and\nit was really convenient.\n\n311\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.220\nSo that might be something you wanna\nconsider whenever you realize look,\n\n312\n00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.520\nyou will need at least one hand\navailable to enter the key in.\n\n313\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.040\n&gt;&gt; Sure, and the other great thing about\nthose, too, is I have to share that\n\n314\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.060\npassword with you, right,\nif I have a keypad and I have a key lock.\n\n315\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.710\nAnd if I share that password with you, how\ncan I tell for auditing purposes, right?\n\n316\n00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.340\nAnd I know you're heavy into security and\nsecurity policies,\n\n317\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.830\nand understand that we have to\ndo audits from time to time.\n\n318\n00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:18.530\nWell, I can't tell, unless I can correlate\na key pad entry with a time clock punch,\n\n319\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.750\nwho it actually was that entered that key.\n\n320\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.740\nAnd the problem is I have to share that.\n\n321\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.785\nAll right, in human nature is,\nthat could be very vulnerable.\n\n322\n00:17:27.785 --> 00:17:31.237\nThat could be a vulnerability that we\ndon't want and again I'm not picking on\n\n323\n00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:34.600\nanyone end user, but that's how we had\nto get in simply at the restaurant.\n\n324\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.130\nSo that's one of the things about\nthings like proximity readers.\n\n325\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.990\nLike Cherokee has mentioned including they\nalso put in things like key fabs too.\n\n326\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.700\nI know that one of the companies\nthat I used to work for\n\n327\n00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.300\nwe had little key fabs and\nthey really work the same way.\n\n328\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:51.930\nYou get close enough to a RF ID, radio\nfrequency identifier pad, and depending\n\n329\n00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:57.020\non what kind of power its using, will\ndictate how close you have to be to it.\n\n330\n00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.570\nBut there is a problem when it comes to\nany kind of standardization with these,\n\n331\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.100\nand that's because they\ntypically are very proprietary,\n\n332\n00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:10.230\nnot anyone manufacturer is really\nfollowing, necessarily, a standard.\n\n333\n00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.390\nRemember, we use standardization for\ninteroperability and\n\n334\n00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.930\nconsistency across multiple vendors\nwhen it comes to a single technology.\n\n335\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.780\nSo I'll throw out some.\n\n336\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.114\nISO does have a 14-443 specification,\nthey also have ISO, and\n\n337\n00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:25.530\nI had to write these guys down.\n\n338\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.970\nI don't know that they're\ngonna ask you on this exam,\n\n339\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.990\nanything about the ISO accreditation.\n\n340\n00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.890\nBut remember, that's the international\norganization for standardization,\n\n341\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.179\nthey also have one that is the 15-639.\n\n342\n00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:38.090\nThey're contact lists, right?\n\n343\n00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.125\nThis is one of the things,\nthat's why they call it proximity readers,\n\n344\n00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:45.162\nunlike some that you know\nhave that magnetic strips.\n\n345\n00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:45.927\nYou're not the only one\nthat can't talk today.\n\n346\n00:18:45.927 --> 00:18:48.994\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Magnetic strips where like a credit\n\n347\n00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:49.980\ncard, right.\n\n348\n00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.570\nThat is a contact based reader,\nI have to actually swipe the card,\n\n349\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.140\nlike a smart card, right?\n\n350\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.260\nThese are a little bit different,\nin the fact that they allow you, in fact,\n\n351\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.030\nI think I got one right here.\n\n352\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.007\nThis is a form of one here,\nif I can get this out of the package here,\n\n353\n00:19:06.007 --> 00:19:09.287\n[SOUND] bear with me, guys,\nthere, just for a second.\n\n354\n00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:11.967\nBut this is like one of\nthe cards that we use, and\n\n355\n00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.990\nthis system that we use here\nis a very popular system.\n\n356\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.010\nIn fact, we can look at, since you got\nmy computer up here on the screen.\n\n357\n00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.060\nThis is by a company called HID, and here\nit is one of the major manufacturers when\n\n358\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.580\nit comes to security and\nidentity solutions.\n\n359\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.430\nI also do some that store the credentials\nand that's where I wanted to get back,\n\n360\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.380\nI kinda diverted a little bit, right.\n\n361\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.820\nWith a key parter, or sipher lock,\n\n362\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.960\nI have to share whatever\nthe numerical entry is, right.\n\n363\n00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.320\nWell, with something like this,\nyou can get a programmer, and\n\n364\n00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.700\nit associates it with a specific identity.\n\n365\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.270\nAnd even more so, if it's a smart card,\n\n366\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:47.430\nit can actually cash credentials if\nit has the smart card functionality.\n\n367\n00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.850\nAnd I'm not sure if this one does have it,\nbut\n\n368\n00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.060\nthis does come from\na manufacturer like HID.\n\n369\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.610\nAnd they have some\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n370\n00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.060\nLike for instance, I know that,\nin fact, I've got all kinds of toys,\n\n371\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.980\nI probably should have pulled out\nbefore we ever started this episode.\n\n372\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.010\nTheres other ones out there,\nthey don't all just look like this.\n\n373\n00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.832\nLike here's one from A Wood.\n\n374\n00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:08.840\nThis is actually,\nI use this in my apartment,\n\n375\n00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.445\nthis one's actually kind of thick.\n\n376\n00:20:10.445 --> 00:20:13.655\nAnd you can it's actually two\npieces clamped together so\n\n377\n00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:16.925\nthere's probably a little bit\nof logic in here somewhere.\n\n378\n00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:21.650\nSo A Wood's another one out there,\nin fact we can kind of look at A Wood.\n\n379\n00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:27.140\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of nice because if,\nlet's say, I got fired from ITPRO.TV,\n\n380\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:33.160\nthey wouldn't need to change all the pins\non all the doors because of Cherokee.\n\n381\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.960\nThey would just revoke\nher individual token.\n\n382\n00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nthat makes it a lot more convenient.\n\n383\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.870\nSo you can see here and, again, these guys\ngotta understand that we're not talking\n\n384\n00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.460\nabout something that's necessarily cheap.\n\n385\n00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.390\nIt can get It can get fairly expensive,\nbut this is another brand out there, and\n\n386\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.150\nagain, it's radio frequency identifier,\nright.\n\n387\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.488\nSo I get close to it and\nthey've got different kinds.\n\n388\n00:20:53.488 --> 00:20:56.510\nThey got low-frequency,\nthey got high frequency,\n\n389\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:21:00.510\nthey even got ultra high frequency,\nyou can see the range varies.\n\n390\n00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.400\nI've seen some of the ranges\nin some of the specifications,\n\n391\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.210\nfour to five in a half inches,\nsix to eight inches.\n\n392\n00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.830\nAnd some of them,\nthe ultra high frequencies,\n\n393\n00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.070\nthey go all the way up to eight inches,\nalmost a foot away, or two feet away,\n\n394\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.550\n24 inches inches would be, so\nyou don't have to get quite too close.\n\n395\n00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.720\nI don't know what ours is,\nI just funny once in awhile.\n\n396\n00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.983\nI'll walk past it, and I'm not even close\nto it, and it says user unrecognized.\n\n397\n00:21:20.983 --> 00:21:22.910\nSo, it's picking up something.\n\n398\n00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:29.010\nIt just depends on what quality you have\nwill dictate how far away it has to be.\n\n399\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.490\nNow, that being said, there's a few other\nthings that we also have in here too,\n\n400\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.290\nand You guys are probably very familiar\nwith things like biometrics, right?\n\n401\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.480\nWell biometrics is also a form\nof physical security control.\n\n402\n00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.770\nNow it can get very,\nvery expensive as well.\n\n403\n00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:47.620\nWe talk about things like fingerprint\nreaders, facial recognition systems,\n\n404\n00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.770\nvoice recognition, hand geometry scanners,\n\n405\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.890\nretinal scanners, and there are definitely\nsome brands out there too like, for\n\n406\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.680\ninstance, NEC Is a pretty\nbig one that I know of.\n\n407\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.490\nAnd you see that displays solutions,\n\n408\n00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.460\nthey have another division here too,\nbiometrics, that's what I want.\n\n409\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.170\nAll right, so you can go to\nthe Biometrics division of NEC and\n\n410\n00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.680\nagain you can find all kinds of different\nproducts and solutions that they have.\n\n411\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.540\nAnd they have them to where they are also\nthings like government compliant, because\n\n412\n00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.290\nwhat the FBI needs might not be what\nsomebody that works at a restaurant needs.\n\n413\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.440\nSo you might need a certain\nlevel of classification.\n\n414\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.060\nAnother one that I know does FBI class and\n\n415\n00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.520\ncertified biometric\nsolutions is called Aware.\n\n416\n00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.881\nSo if you look at Aware Biometrics,\nin fact,\n\n417\n00:22:35.881 --> 00:22:40.057\nI wanna say they have it right on their\npage, they tell you, you want FBI class?\n\n418\n00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:41.670\nWell, we've got it.\n\n419\n00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.310\nI think it's somewhere in here maybe\nnot that might be integrated biometrics\n\n420\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.750\nthat I'm thinking of.\n\n421\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.885\nBut you can see some of the options,\noops, maybe you can't.\n\n422\n00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:54.710\n[LAUGH] You can see some of\nthe options that they have down here.\n\n423\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.800\nLike for instance, you can see\nfingerprint, face and iris, again,\n\n424\n00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.690\nretinal scans that you can do,\nagain, they get very, very expensive.\n\n425\n00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.550\nBut this is one of those\nauthentication factors that we talked\n\n426\n00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.110\nabout in a previous episode where\nwe talked about something you are.\n\n427\n00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.106\nWhen it comes to a retinal pattern,\n\n428\n00:23:10.106 --> 00:23:13.110\nit's pretty tough to try\nto duplicate that, right.\n\n429\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.990\nNow, a password I can try and\nguess it, I can try and\n\n430\n00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:16.470\nuse software to try and break it,\n\n431\n00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:21.320\nuse social engineering fishing scams to\ntry and pull that information out of you.\n\n432\n00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.696\nBut chances are I'm not gonna be\npulling any retinas out, I hope not.\n\n433\n00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:27.112\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say not without jail right.\n\n434\n00:23:27.112 --> 00:23:30.824\nThis isn't Minority Report here,\nI don't want Tom Cruise following.\n\n435\n00:23:30.824 --> 00:23:35.090\nBut, give me another one and\nin fact that was integrated biometrics,\n\n436\n00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.850\nI think it's the one\nthat does the FBI class.\n\n437\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.400\nYeah, this is the one.\n\n438\n00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.680\nWhen you go up to their website again,\n\n439\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.080\nit depends on the what\nkind of clash you need.\n\n440\n00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.790\nAgain, you can see some of these\ncan get very, very expensive and\n\n441\n00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.810\nthey tell you, I'm pretty sure,\nyeah there we go.\n\n442\n00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.765\nI was like, one of them does.\n\n443\n00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:57.340\n&gt;&gt; It makes you wonder like the ones that\nrequire a pulse, like how did they get to,\n\n444\n00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.860\ncome to that conclusion?\n\n445\n00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.623\nTo require that,\nyou know what happened really?\n\n446\n00:24:01.623 --> 00:24:03.280\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's other ones, too,\n\n447\n00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:09.430\nthat do vascular patent,\nvascular signature pattern identification.\n\n448\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.690\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; And what that means is they can\n\n449\n00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:14.070\nlook at your veins and check out\nheart rate and circulatory system.\n\n450\n00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.400\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz that's very difficult, really,\n\n451\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.990\nreally difficult, to duplicate that,\nbut one of the things is that.\n\n452\n00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.930\nIt kinda proves who you are, so\nthese are examples of some as well.\n\n453\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.580\nOne of the last ones that I\nthink is kinda interesting and\n\n454\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.380\ndefinitely is something that if you're\ngonna go to physical access controls,\n\n455\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.240\nyou should have access to is\nthings like security guard, right?\n\n456\n00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.090\nIf you have a security guard,\nwell what can they do?\n\n457\n00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.310\nWell a lot of times they\ncan react in realtime,\n\n458\n00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.170\nif we're talking about an IP based camera,\nright?\n\n459\n00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.990\nWe're talking about remote learning.\n\n460\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:52.410\nNot remote learning, I'm sorry, remote\nviewing then I'm not in the vicinity\n\n461\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:57.060\nof that location or maybe I'm closed but\nI'm not really In that location.\n\n462\n00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.530\nSo what ends up happening?\n\n463\n00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.265\nI find out something's going on,\nI've gotta get in my car.\n\n464\n00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:03.037\nGonna drive down to the place and\n\n465\n00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:06.132\nhopefully by the time I get\nthere they're still there.\n\n466\n00:25:06.132 --> 00:25:07.310\nWell, they might not be.\n\n467\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.840\nThe great thing about a security guard is,\nwhile it isn't the stop all in your\n\n468\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.230\nphysical security controls,\nat least they can monitor situations.\n\n469\n00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.250\nAnd they can react in real time and\n\n470\n00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.225\nthat's one of the great things\nabout the security guard.\n\n471\n00:25:21.225 --> 00:25:25.164\nIs the fact that they are there,\nthey're on the physical location and\n\n472\n00:25:25.164 --> 00:25:29.264\nthey can act in real time, not only\nto things like physical intrusions.\n\n473\n00:25:29.264 --> 00:25:33.377\nBut even things that we talk about from\nthe security standpoint like disasters or\n\n474\n00:25:33.377 --> 00:25:35.550\nsomething happens to the building.\n\n475\n00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.151\nAnd it's not intentional, right,\n\n476\n00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:39.689\nthose things that happen that\nnature just brings our way.\n\n477\n00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:43.199\nIt's good to have the security guards\nbecause not only are they monitoring for\n\n478\n00:25:43.199 --> 00:25:44.369\nintentional break ins but\n\n479\n00:25:44.369 --> 00:25:47.880\nit could be unintentional too through\nthings like disaster as well.\n\n480\n00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.157\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they even just having a presence\nthere may even act as a deterrent at\n\n481\n00:25:52.157 --> 00:25:52.850\ntimes.\n\n482\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.410\nSo thank you so much for\ntelling us about different types of\n\n483\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.790\nphysical security controls\nthat we can implement.\n\n484\n00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.610\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n485\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.350\nBut stay tuned.\n\n486\n00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.610\nWe do have Net+ headed your way.\n\n487\n00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.830\nFor this show I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host.\n\n488\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.640\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n489\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n490\n00:26:06.450 -->

00:00:10.591\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.222\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.980\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910\nIn this episode, we will be discussing\ndifferent types of firewalls.\n\n7\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.230\nWe're really gonna be focusing\non the basic firewalls,\n\n8\n00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.180\nalthough there are several\ndifferent features out there and\n\n9\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.480\ndifferent ways you can label a firewall.\n\n10\n00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.800\nWith us today, we have Mr. Wes Bryan to\nexplain the different types of firewalls.\n\n11\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.980\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n12\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.980\nAlways great to be with the ITProTV,\non stage, I should say, if I can say that.\n\n14\n00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.120\nThat's right, we're gonna be\ntalking about basic firewalls.\n\n15\n00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.050\nAnd well, these can get very complex.\n\n16\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.450\nSo the good thing is, on the Net + exam,\n\n17\n00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.250\nthey're gonna just really\nlook at some of the basics.\n\n18\n00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.878\nAnd that's what we hope to\nstraighten out in this episode.\n\n19\n00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:58.798\nNow we're gonna go ahead, and one of the\nfirst things that we're gonna dive into is\n\n20\n00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:02.057\ngoing to be the different types of\nfirewalls that you have out there.\n\n21\n00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:06.660\nAnd they really call out about\nfour different things, right?\n\n22\n00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.030\nHost based, network based,\nsoftware, or hardware based.\n\n23\n00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.274\nSo let's see if we can help you out with\nthose, and I got a little diagram here\n\n24\n00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:16.523\nmaybe hopefully help you guys out in\nunderstanding about what the different\n\n25\n00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:18.471\ntypes of firewalls are that we have,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.430\nWhen we talk about something\nlike a host based firewall,\n\n27\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.790\nwhat we're talking about is a firewall\nthat is running on a specific system,\n\n28\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.730\nright, a single host, if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.710\nAnd what this one is,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n30\n00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.060\ngive these PCs here some\nidentification here if we can.\n\n31\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.294\nWe'll call this PC1 or PC!.\n\n32\n00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:46.038\nWe'll call this PC2 and\n\n33\n00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:49.040\nPC3, all right?\n\n34\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.250\nSo when we talk about host based\nfirewalls, what we mean here is that\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.050\nthe firewall that is running\non PC1 is only protecting and\n\n36\n00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.600\nmonitoring traffic that is coming in and\nout of the network adaptor on PC1, right?\n\n37\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.030\nJust a single host,\nsame thing goes for PC2 and PC3.\n\n38\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.750\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n39\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.800\nI've got a Windows Server 2008 box here,\nand if I dive down, in fact,\n\n40\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.227\nlet me go ahead and close\nthe Initial Configuration Task Wizard.\n\n41\n00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:21.181\nAnd I'm sure Server Manager's gonna\ncome up, so we'll hurry up, wait for\n\n42\n00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.495\nthat [LAUGH], and\nthen we'll shut that down.\n\n43\n00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:25.485\nAnd then let's go ahead, and\nlet's get into the firewall.\n\n44\n00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:28.615\nNow, inside of Windows, there's\na couple different types of firewalls.\n\n45\n00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.155\nThere's a basic firewall,\nwhich is what we're looking at, but\n\n46\n00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:33.625\nI'm also gonna look at what they\ncall the advanced firewall.\n\n47\n00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:38.920\nAnd yeah, you can get very advanced with\nit if you really want to, but It's not so\n\n48\n00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.910\nadvanced that I think that it's out of the\nballpark or the realm of our show here.\n\n49\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.600\nSo let's go ahead first, and\nlet's look at the basic firewall here.\n\n50\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.240\nI'm gonna go ahead and go to the Start\nmenu, we'll go to Control Panel,\n\n51\n00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.535\nSystem and Security, and\n\n52\n00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:54.895\nthen if we dive here, you'll see\nthe Windows firewall right here.\n\n53\n00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:58.961\nAll right now, with the Windows firewall,\nwhat is a firewall and what does it do?\n\n54\n00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:02.955\nAll right, well, with a firewall,\nwhat it does is it screens traffic.\n\n55\n00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:05.877\nAll right, it looks at traffic that is\ncoming into the network adapter and\n\n56\n00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:07.872\nthat is going out of the network adapter,\nright?\n\n57\n00:03:07.872 --> 00:03:11.562\nAnd it makes a decision\non whether to allow or\n\n58\n00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:17.260\nto block that traffic based\non some predefined criteria.\n\n59\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.160\nNow those predefined criterias could\nbe an ACL, an access control list.\n\n60\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.390\nA predefined criteria in this\ncase could be rules, if you will,\n\n61\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.535\nthat are set in place, if you're doing\nthings like rule-based access control.\n\n62\n00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.715\nAnd the firewall,\nwhat it does is as traffic comes in,\n\n63\n00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:35.745\nlet's just say comes into the network\nadapter, it inspects the traffic.\n\n64\n00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:37.685\nAnd it says, okay, I see this traffic.\n\n65\n00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.198\nDo I have a rule that matches\nthat traffic, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:44.207\nAnd if I look and say okay,\nI've got a rule that matches the traffic.\n\n67\n00:03:44.207 --> 00:03:46.517\nNow we've gotta apply an action to it.\n\n68\n00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:50.347\nAnd that action is typically gonna be\neither allow the traffic to come into\n\n69\n00:03:50.347 --> 00:03:53.120\nthe device or\njust go ahead and discard it.\n\n70\n00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.940\nAll right, that's essentially\nwhat the firewall's doing.\n\n71\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.670\nNow this firewall here,\nyou can see is turned on, and\n\n72\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.987\nwe can see we got a few\ngreen check marks here.\n\n73\n00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:02.897\nAnd it lets me know that we\nare successfully monitoring\n\n74\n00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:06.261\na few different network location\nslash profiles and windows.\n\n75\n00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:11.085\nThey use what are known as network\nlocations, and when you choose what\n\n76\n00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:16.170\ntype of network location you are on,\nit sets an overall profile, right?\n\n77\n00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.560\nA profile is like a global suite\nof settings that by default\n\n78\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.940\napply once you make that choice.\n\n79\n00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.920\nIn this case, looks like we're\non a public network, all right?\n\n80\n00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.606\nNow, this would be the same type of\nnetwork that you might be on if you're on\n\n81\n00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:31.487\na WiFi hotspot,\nit might say you might wanna choose this.\n\n82\n00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:35.620\nAnd why might I wanna choose something\nlike this on a public network?\n\n83\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560\nWell, a public network,\n\n84\n00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.400\nwe don't want people to have\naccess to certain things, right?\n\n85\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.511\nWe don't want people to make\na connection to my machine, so\n\n86\n00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.807\nwhen we talk about a public network, it\nblocks all the connections that aren't on\n\n87\n00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:51.814\na list of pre-approved rules, if you will,\nof what kind of applications.\n\n88\n00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:54.570\nBut then it also does something\na little bit farther.\n\n89\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.770\nAnd this is really more of the dynamic\nsecurity in Windows, so I don't wanna\n\n90\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.090\nstray too much off topic, but it turns off\nthings like network discovery as well.\n\n91\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.060\nThe home network or private network,\n\n92\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.560\nthis means that you trust the devices\nthat are within that network,\n\n93\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.260\nso what it does is, it still blocks\nall of your incoming traffic.\n\n94\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.930\nIt allows all outbound traffic,\nthat's the normal default of a firewall.\n\n95\n00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.350\nThat's something called an implicit deny,\nby the way.\n\n96\n00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.100\nImplicit deny means everything is\ndenied unless explicitly allowed.\n\n97\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.560\nAnd that's typically\nthe way firewalls work.\n\n98\n00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.540\nAnything that comes into the network\nadapter, that comes into the machine,\n\n99\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.390\nis going to be blocked by default,\nunless you make an exception.\n\n100\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.190\nWhat is an exception?\n\n101\n00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.680\nAn exception to the rule, right,\nthat's why we call them exceptions.\n\n102\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.343\nThe rule says everything\ninbound is blocked,\n\n103\n00:05:40.343 --> 00:05:42.947\nexcept whatever you put on the list,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:47.114\nAnd then the firewall checks that list,\nand it says does this\n\n105\n00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:51.610\ntraffic meet that criteria, and\nthen what do I do with it after?\n\n106\n00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.515\nSo this work profile that you can see,\nit says we're not connected here.\n\n107\n00:05:55.515 --> 00:06:00.347\nThat home or work private network,\nagain, the firewall profile settings\n\n108\n00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:05.060\nare gonna be a little bit less\nrestricted than the public network.\n\n109\n00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.733\nAnd then domain network, really,\n\n110\n00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.816\nit's a lot like the same thing as\nthe work in the private network.\n\n111\n00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:13.449\nThe big difference here is you're\ntypically gonna be governed by some other\n\n112\n00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:14.253\ncomputer in it.\n\n113\n00:06:14.253 --> 00:06:15.965\nA lot of times,\nthat's a domain controller.\n\n114\n00:06:15.965 --> 00:06:20.488\nSo really, you can see there's not too\nmuch difference between these two, except\n\n115\n00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:25.150\nfor the fact that things like network\ndiscovery by default are turned off.\n\n116\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.430\nWhich you can always turn back on,\nall right?\n\n117\n00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.682\n&gt;&gt; And so by default, we have these\nrecommendations on Microsoft,\n\n118\n00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:35.050\nkind of like they have these\npreset three categories.\n\n119\n00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.770\nThis is how we think you should, but\nwe have the ability to change that and\n\n120\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.620\ncustomize it, right?\n\n121\n00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.170\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and that's where\nthe advanced firewall comes in, and\n\n122\n00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.478\nthat's why I said I don't think\nthe advanced firewall is so\n\n123\n00:06:43.478 --> 00:06:45.970\nadvanced cuz you'll look at the title,\nright?\n\n124\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.008\nBasic firewall,\nlet's take you to the advanced one, right?\n\n125\n00:06:51.008 --> 00:06:52.571\nWhat are we saying,\nthat the basic one's boring, no, but\n\n126\n00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:53.760\nthere are a few more\nthings that you can do.\n\n127\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.943\nJust like Cherokee's asking, I think\nyou were saying, can we customize it?\n\n128\n00:06:56.943 --> 00:06:57.445\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n129\n00:06:57.445 --> 00:06:59.552\n&gt;&gt; And you absolutely can.\n\n130\n00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:02.940\nAll right, let me show you the basic\nfirewall setting, what we can customize.\n\n131\n00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.750\nAnd then show you why we might use\nsomething like the more advanced firewall.\n\n132\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.750\nSo for instance,\nif I'm in the basic firewall,\n\n133\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.720\nWindows is full of these little\ntask links that you can use.\n\n134\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.080\nNotice I can allow a program\nthrough the firewall.\n\n135\n00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.088\nI'll show you a little bit more\nabout that here in a second,\n\n136\n00:07:18.088 --> 00:07:19.224\nchange notification settings.\n\n137\n00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:22.050\nNow this personally,\nI don't like to change.\n\n138\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.260\nI know some people are in favor of, hey,\nif it's protected, don't let me know.\n\n139\n00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.913\nAs long as it's protected, I don't care,\nI don't need to see the notification.\n\n140\n00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:32.477\nI on the other hand wanna see every\nnotification, that's just the way I am,\n\n141\n00:07:32.477 --> 00:07:36.725\nbecause if I'm getting attacked, I don't\neven know if it's getting attacked, right?\n\n142\n00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:39.665\nIf I'm constantly seeing something\nis blocked and blocked and\n\n143\n00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.865\nblocked and blocked.\n\n144\n00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:43.485\nThat might let me know that I'm\nunder some kind of attack, and\n\n145\n00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:44.525\nI wanna be aware of that.\n\n146\n00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:46.125\nSo whether you do that or\nnot, it's up to you.\n\n147\n00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:50.480\nTurning the firewall on or off, right, we\nneed to fix applications that are broken,\n\n148\n00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.305\nwe just turn firewall off, right?\n\n149\n00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.977\nJust kidding, don't do that.\n\n150\n00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:57.949\nWe only allow the communications\nthrough This link here,\n\n151\n00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:02.400\nand then we'll look at\nthe advanced settings coming up.\n\n152\n00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.460\nBut I wanna look a little bit at the allow\na program or feature through the firewall,\n\n153\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.140\nand when you choose this, you'll\nnotice that, you can see right here,\n\n154\n00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.330\nit's pretty intuitive.\n\n155\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.490\nIt says allow programs to\ncommunicate through the firewall.\n\n156\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.340\nThis isn't outbound communication.\n\n157\n00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.610\nI want you to go back to the default\nnature of a basic firewall.\n\n158\n00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.630\nOutbound communications are allowed.\n\n159\n00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.240\nIt's the inbound communications\nthat aren't allowed and\n\n160\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.970\nthat's what this is defining.\n\n161\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.670\nThe basic firewall defines\nwhat applications you wanna\n\n162\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.470\nallow to communicate to the firewall.\n\n163\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.190\nSo for instance if I want people to be\nable to connect via remote desktop, right?\n\n164\n00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.160\nWell, I could go in and I could set remote\ndesktop turn it on and then windows\n\n165\n00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.280\nthrough its dynamic security, will open\nup the firewall automatically for me.\n\n166\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.790\nBut let me show you where you can set\nthat, open up the firewall yourself.\n\n167\n00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.590\nHere, I could scroll down and\n\n168\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.500\nI could find things like remote\ndesktop here and I could check that.\n\n169\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.820\nAnd you'll notice that I have\na series of these profiles, right?\n\n170\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.530\nWell, I'm connected to the profiles,\nthe public profiles.\n\n171\n00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.280\nSo if I wanted to open this and up and\nI wanted it to be the most secure,\n\n172\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.900\nI could just say well, just the firewall\nor the profile that I'm connected to but\n\n173\n00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.370\nthen I can turn around if I wanted to,\nI could also\n\n174\n00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.428\nallow it in down communication\nto the other profiles as well.\n\n175\n00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:19.420\nAnd then once that's done,\nwe go ahead and choose OK.\n\n176\n00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.430\nAnd if I come back in here and\nI scroll back down, I can see that now\n\n177\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.360\nI've allowed Remote Desktop to\ncommunicate through the Firewall, right?\n\n178\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.910\nThis is a basic host Firewall, all right?.\n\n179\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.960\nThat would the basic host firewall again\nthis is also something known as a software\n\n180\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.380\nFirewall too.\n\n181\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.450\nYou can do a little bit more\nwith host base firewall so\n\n182\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.480\nwhat were just here again, I'm just show\nyou the basic if I get out here I can go\n\n183\n00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.150\nto the advance settings if I want to.\n\n184\n00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.110\nEasy way to get there, remember\ninside of Windows, 6,000 different\n\n185\n00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.180\nways to get in the same location,\nyou just have to pick your favorite.\n\n186\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.700\nI'm gonna go ahead and\npush the Start menu.\n\n187\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.670\nI like this MSC command because\nit's the smallest one in Windows,\n\n188\n00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.140\nyou will not find a smaller one.\n\n189\n00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.510\nAnd it's WF for Windows Firewall, .msc.\n\n190\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.480\nAnd when you launch that,\n\n191\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.980\nit launches the Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.060\nNow, what's a little bit more\nadvanced than this, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.930\nLet's go ahead and jump to the most\nadvanced that you could do with this.\n\n194\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.660\nYou could setup things like IPSec,\ncommunication, connection, security rules\n\n195\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.500\nthat use IPSec for the authentication and\nthe encryption in your communication.\n\n196\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.009\nThat's one of the things that makes\nit advanced, real advanced, right?\n\n197\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.070\nBut more so advance because notice\nthat I can get little more granular\n\n198\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.480\nwith what I define inside of\nthis basic sudden of few well.\n\n199\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.490\nFor instance i can create my own rules,\nright?\n\n200\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.400\nIn the basic firewall all it\nwas was turn the check mark\n\n201\n00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.590\nput a check mark on the check box and that\nallows the application through a firewall.\n\n202\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.860\nWell, we can do a little bit more\nwith these so space firewalls.\n\n203\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.930\nI can choose a new rule and\nwhen I create a new rule\n\n204\n00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.490\nmaybe I wanna do it by a program right,\nmaybe on a specific port, all right?\n\n205\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.790\nMaybe I say, I wanna port, I don't want\nthe remote desktop to just allow remote\n\n206\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.940\ndesktop, maybe I've wanna just allow it by\nthe port and I can do something like this\n\n207\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.960\nwhere i create a port rule and I can\nsay TCP and then I can say port 3389.\n\n208\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.150\nAnd I'm essentially opening\nthe firewall up to accept\n\n209\n00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.400\nthe port if you will that remote\ndesktop is communicating on.\n\n210\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.850\nI'm not saying that's not\nthe way you should do it, but\n\n211\n00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.909\nyou do have that option here.\n\n212\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.490\nWe can get even more\nspecific if we want to,\n\n213\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.910\nwe could do things like predefined, right?\n\n214\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.390\nWe can do a predefined rule and\nthese are kind of awesome,\n\n215\n00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:28.660\nI like these because they have,\nin this case it's a server, right?\n\n216\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.760\nAnd it's a domain controller\nmore specifically, so\n\n217\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.010\nI can say well, Just like you see in\nremote desktop in that list well this is\n\n218\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.180\nwhere you can do it here from\nthe events firewall as well.\n\n219\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.690\nWe could go custom, this one is\nreally cool because if I do a custom\n\n220\n00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.188\nrule I can do things like for\ninstance blocking ICMP echo replies.\n\n221\n00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:46.475\nAnd it assure send the request\nall you want, right?\n\n222\n00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:50.220\nAnd I don't wanna send,\nmaybe I don't wanna block all\n\n223\n00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.870\nICMP maybe I just wanna\nblock ICMP echo replies.\n\n224\n00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.160\nWell I can come in here to Services,\nright, and I can do a customize, right?\n\n225\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.030\nAnd I could look through here.\n\n226\n00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:05.810\nAnd I do believe, if I look in here,\nI believe there's an ICMP.\n\n227\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.500\nI don't know if I could filter,\nhopefully I could filter.\n\n228\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.610\nYep, there we go.\n\n229\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.464\nAnd I don't see it in here,\n\n230\n00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:17.440\nno I don't see it in here but\nyou can customize.\n\n231\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.080\nI don't know where I messed that up.\n\n232\n00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.170\nMaybe it's the protocols here that,\nthat's it.\n\n233\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.320\nI knew it was in there somewhere.\n\n234\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.100\nIt's been a bit since I've been\nhere in this advanced firewall,\n\n235\n00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.470\nbut I get set things like custom\nsettings inside of the message,\n\n236\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.130\nICMP where I wanna say, I just don't\nwanna allow replies to come through.\n\n237\n00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.120\nSo for instance,\nif we do ICMP V4 and I customize and\n\n238\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.160\nI could say specific IP ICMP,\nmaybe the reply messages.\n\n239\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.760\nSo there's the echo request.\n\n240\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Now those are really customized.\n\n241\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.170\nThey're like.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're very customized.\n\n242\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:56.300\n&gt;&gt; The other rule on, it kind of throws\nyou off a little bit because it says,\n\n243\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:01.810\nfile and printer sharing but by unchecking\nthat you're essentially stopping or\n\n244\n00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.230\nprohibiting the ICMP traffic together.\n\n245\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.300\n&gt;&gt; That's right I might still wanna\nbe able to send things like ICMP,\n\n246\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.490\nI might wanna be able to do tracert\nyou know again it just depends on\n\n247\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.300\nyou wanna really customize and that's why\nthey talk about the advanced firewall.\n\n248\n00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.710\nIt's not only setting inbound rules,\nbut also setting and\n\n249\n00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.400\ncustomizing your outbound rules too.\n\n250\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.420\nAnd that's one of the things that you\ndon't get with the basic firewall.\n\n251\n00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.180\nSo just understand that a host based\nfirewall, this is one that's going to be\n\n252\n00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.990\nrunning right here on a specific device,\nversus something like maybe a network.\n\n253\n00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.310\nThey call out like the network\nbase firewall, right?\n\n254\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.560\nThe network base firewall\nis not only a device that\n\n255\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.510\nscreens all traffic coming in and\nout of your network.\n\n256\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.530\nNot just like a hostbase, right?\n\n257\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.050\nThe hostbase is only monitoring\ntraffic that's coming to and\n\n258\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.870\nfrom the network adapter\nin that specific host.\n\n259\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.060\nVersus a network based firewall which is\nalso called a hardware based firewall as\n\n260\n00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.530\nwell because it's screening all\ntraffic from every device going in and\n\n261\n00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.610\nout of your network.\n\n262\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.870\nNow don't let this confuse you and\n\n263\n00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.610\ndon't get tripped up on the minushas if\nyou will, because technically a hardware\n\n264\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.730\nbased firewall has to have some kind\nof software on it running it, right?\n\n265\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.710\nWe software in order to use our hardware.\n\n266\n00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.860\nSo don't let that confuse you, they're\ntypically calling this because it's\n\n267\n00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.520\na physical device that I can\nplace on my network, right?\n\n268\n00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.460\nVersus a host based firewall is a\ncomponent of the operating system, right?\n\n269\n00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.145\nIt's all software based, it's not\na physical device that I could plug into\n\n270\n00:14:26.145 --> 00:14:28.751\nlike one of these network based devices,\nall right?\n\n271\n00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.710\nThese network based firewalls they\ncan do all kinds of things, right?\n\n272\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.740\nI think we've talked about\nthem in past episodes.\n\n273\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.220\nI know in other shows we've talked\nabout them you might see NGFW.\n\n274\n00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.230\nNext Generation firewall, right?\n\n275\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.480\nNext generation firewalls, these really\ncan do a lot of different stuff.\n\n276\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.920\nThings like intrusion detection and\nintrusion prevention as well.\n\n277\n00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.670\nVPN concentrators all built\ninto a single device like for\n\n278\n00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.230\ninstance like a Cisco ASA device.\n\n279\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.790\nSo they can do a lot more.\n\n280\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.020\n&gt;&gt; Different levels of the OSI model.\n\n281\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and\n\n282\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:03.360\nin fact speaking of the OSI model that's\na good place to talk about application.\n\n283\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.610\nThey talk about application in context to\nwhere firewalls, well what does that mean?\n\n284\n00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.530\nWell, with these, I think they're\ncalled fourth generation firewalls,\n\n285\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.380\nanyways the next generation\nfirewalls essentially they can\n\n286\n00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.320\npeel back the onion wrappers, right?\n\n287\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.080\nRemember we talked about encapsulation\nyou think about a couple of\n\n288\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.010\ndifferent ways, right?\n\n289\n00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.600\nThe Russian doll little one into\na bigger one into a bigger one, or\n\n290\n00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.300\nan onion you can think of the onion has\nlayers wrapped up during encapsulation.\n\n291\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.720\nWell, I want you to think about it, right.\n\n292\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.000\nWhen we talk about network communications,\nwe're looking at ports.\n\n293\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.670\nIf we talk about ports, right,\nwe talk about the transport layer.\n\n294\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.350\nSo no longer are we talking\nabout the network layer,\n\n295\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.350\nwe're talking about the transport layer.\n\n296\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.380\nAnd then we go even further.\n\n297\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.228\nWe can go into things like\nthe session layer when we\n\n298\n00:15:46.228 --> 00:15:47.688\ndo staple packet inspection, right?\n\n299\n00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:50.769\nBecause staple packet inspection\nsays I can see the state\n\n300\n00:15:50.769 --> 00:15:52.511\nof the communication, right?\n\n301\n00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:55.464\nMaybe we're doing things like\nwe don't want any, what is it?\n\n302\n00:15:55.464 --> 00:15:56.072\n&gt;&gt; Hijacking.\n\n303\n00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.863\n&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you The TCP flood attack,\nor SYN flood attacks,\n\n304\n00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:01.235\nI couldn't think of the SYN flood attack,\nright?\n\n305\n00:16:01.235 --> 00:16:05.730\nWhere we take advantage of the TCP\nthree-way handshake, right?\n\n306\n00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.900\nWe send SYN requests and can SYN request,\n\n307\n00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.620\nand we've got a server sending back\nan acknowledgement and waiting for\n\n308\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.224\nthat last part, or the synchronization\nacknowledgement, right?\n\n309\n00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:19.285\nAnd the third part is the host device\nshould send back an acknowledgement packet\n\n310\n00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:23.810\nthat says okay, we've got a connection\nthat's oriented or ready to go.\n\n311\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.090\nWell, with these staple\npacket inspections,\n\n312\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.200\nthey can see the fact that\na SYN packet was sent, right,\n\n313\n00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.480\nwe're gonna build up this connection,\nright, connection oriented protocol.\n\n314\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.698\nAnd it can see that a synact came back,\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n315\n00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:39.662\nThat's exactly it.\n\n316\n00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:40.765\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna establish it again.\n\n317\n00:16:40.765 --> 00:16:44.744\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so what it does is\nessentially, it will discard the bogus\n\n318\n00:16:44.744 --> 00:16:48.671\ninformation or the additional\ninformation that's not required.\n\n319\n00:16:48.671 --> 00:16:51.380\nSo the stateful packet inspection,\nthey can do that.\n\n320\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.530\nBut even more so, right,\nhow do you monitor and\n\n321\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.310\nprotect against things like\nSQL injection attacks, right?\n\n322\n00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.090\nSome cross-side scripting attacks, right?\n\n323\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.720\nThese are exploits on HTTP that\nsit at the application layer.\n\n324\n00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.200\nWell, application aware and content aware\napplication based firewalls, they can see\n\n325\n00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.327\nthis, and they can implement things like\ncounter measures in order to stop that.\n\n326\n00:17:13.327 --> 00:17:17.300\nSMTP based attacks and\nstuff, they can stop this.\n\n327\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.500\nSo basically what it boils down to,\nall right, application layer, firewall, it\n\n328\n00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.678\ncan monitor traffic from the network layer\nall the way up to the application layer.\n\n329\n00:17:26.678 --> 00:17:29.899\nThey also talk about other\ntypes of firewalls as well,\n\n330\n00:17:29.899 --> 00:17:32.993\nthings like small office,\nhome office firewalls.\n\n331\n00:17:32.993 --> 00:17:36.354\nAnd when we talk about these firewalls,\nwe're typically talking about at\n\n332\n00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:39.410\nthat point, you might wanna get\ninto some network based firewall.\n\n333\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.352\nIt could be an ASA.\n\n334\n00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.430\nYou've gotta be careful\nwith the licensing though,\n\n335\n00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.190\nbecause it can get very\nexpensive really quick.\n\n336\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.240\nBut that, again, is giving you\nthe advantage that you can do things,\n\n337\n00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.650\nlike implement VPN communications.\n\n338\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.944\nRight, you can do stateful pack and\ninspection,\n\n339\n00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:57.395\nyou can have intrusion prevention\nsystems all in a single unified device.\n\n340\n00:17:57.395 --> 00:18:00.265\nWhich also brings us to another\nconcept that we have to talk about is\n\n341\n00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:02.090\nunified threat management.\n\n342\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.680\nWe have, for instance, we have malware\ntechnology, we have antivirus technology,\n\n343\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.110\nwe have intrusion prevention, intrusion\ndetection systems, VPN concentrators.\n\n344\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.240\nWouldn't it be nice to have\na single interface to log in to and\n\n345\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.890\nmanage all of those different\ncomponents of your security?\n\n346\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.270\nAnd that's what UTM is, unified threat\nmanagement is just taking all those\n\n347\n00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.960\ncomponents and putting them into some\nkind of centralized administration.\n\n348\n00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.920\nKeep in mind, again, the small office,\nhome office firewall that they talk about,\n\n349\n00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.810\nwe're not talking about,\nit doesn't have to be very expensive, but\n\n350\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.210\ntypically it's not gonna\nbe a host based firewall.\n\n351\n00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:37.930\nIt will be more of\nthe network based firewall.\n\n352\n00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.538\n&gt;&gt; And even if you check out\nsome of our PS SYN shows, and\n\n353\n00:18:40.538 --> 00:18:44.747\nif you have an older machine, I don't say\nolder, but I guess then extra machine that\n\n354\n00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:48.565\ndoesn't have to be too beefy or have\na really lot of hardware laying around.\n\n355\n00:18:48.565 --> 00:18:51.505\nThat's actually a free piece of\nsoftware that you can go ahead and\n\n356\n00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:52.800\nconfigure a firewall on.\n\n357\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n358\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.460\nOpen source, gotta love open source, and\nit's definitely becoming very popular.\n\n359\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.260\nSome of the other things that they talk\nabout, they talk about the settings and\n\n360\n00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.730\ntechniques.\n\n361\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.640\nOne of the things they mentioned, and I've\nalready I kinda talked about that, ACLs.\n\n362\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.440\nThey also talk about virtual\nwire versus routed as well.\n\n363\n00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.020\nIf you have a non-routed environment\nwhere you just have switches basically,\n\n364\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.680\nvirtual wire is a way to bond\nmultiple ethernet ports together.\n\n365\n00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.620\nRouted typically means you're gonna be\nrouting between subnets and this is where\n\n366\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.990\nyour ACLs can come into place,\nwhat's allowed and what's not allowed.\n\n367\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.050\nThey also talk about DMZ, too,\ndemilitarized zone, right?\n\n368\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.789\nWell, what is the DMZ?\n\n369\n00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:33.810\nI kinda got a diagram here\nwe can kinda look at.\n\n370\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.710\nSo this lady, she's a customer,\n\n371\n00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.500\nand she needs access to one of\nour company resources, right?\n\n372\n00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.690\nMaybe we have a public website, right?\n\n373\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:48.110\nAnd we need her to be able to do\nthings like order our products, right?\n\n374\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.623\nWell I need to give the outside external\nusers, non business users, right?\n\n375\n00:19:52.623 --> 00:19:54.872\nWe're not talking about an extranet here,\n\n376\n00:19:54.872 --> 00:19:57.380\nbut what we're talking\nabout is outside users.\n\n377\n00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.680\nPeople that are outside of my company, I\nneed to give them access to my resources.\n\n378\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.280\nSo what do I do?\n\n379\n00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.590\nDo I give them access to\nmy entire internal network?\n\n380\n00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.179\nThen the answer is no.\n\n381\n00:20:05.179 --> 00:20:08.850\nWhat we do is we have\nsomething like a DMZ.\n\n382\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.030\nWe have two firewalls, right?\n\n383\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.390\nWe have an external firewall that allows\nthis this lady to make a connection to.\n\n384\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.220\nI just put public resource in this case\ncould be a web application, right?\n\n385\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.253\nSo we allow her to communicate through\nthe external firewall into the website, so\n\n386\n00:20:23.253 --> 00:20:24.719\nthat she can do her ordering.\n\n387\n00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:29.163\nBut what we don't allow her to do is\ncommunicate through the internal firewall\n\n388\n00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:33.160\nback into the internal resources\nwithin our inside network, right?\n\n389\n00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.565\nSo that's the DMZ.\n\n390\n00:20:34.565 --> 00:20:36.962\nA couple of other names you\nmight hear this called,\n\n391\n00:20:36.962 --> 00:20:38.931\nyou could hear it called an edge network.\n\n392\n00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:41.350\nYou could hear it called\na perimeter network,\n\n393\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.500\nyou could even hear it called\na screen subnet as well.\n\n394\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.393\nSo just a couple of different\nterms that are out there.\n\n395\n00:20:45.393 --> 00:20:47.830\n&gt;&gt; That's funny, I've even thought\nof a couple, there are just so\n\n396\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.040\nmany different names for this.\n\n397\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.310\nA bastion host, even a honeynet,\nhoneypot being in one individual machine,\n\n398\n00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.990\nhoneynet being more than one machine.\n\n399\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.525\nSo yeah, keep that in mind.\n\n400\n00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:59.435\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A lot of different terms.\n\n401\n00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:03.305\nWell I know Microsoft uses screen\nsubnet a lot, perimeter network.\n\n402\n00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:06.495\nSo if you don't hear the term DMZ,\nthank goodness its CompTIA exam,\n\n403\n00:21:06.495 --> 00:21:08.415\nmost likely you're gonna hear DMZ.\n\n404\n00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:12.580\nJust keep in mind, when you need to get\npublic access to a resource within your\n\n405\n00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.610\nnetwork, but you don't wanna give\nthem access to your internal network,\n\n406\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.370\nyou put up the DMZ and\nthis can give them access.\n\n407\n00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.350\nWe've already mentioned the implicit deny,\njust remember implicit deny, it's how\n\n408\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.610\nfirewalls work, if it's not explicitly\nallowed, if I don't make a rule for it.\n\n409\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.770\nRight, like we showed you,\nallowing an application through or\n\n410\n00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.810\ncreating your own inbound rule,\nthen it's gonna be blocked, right?\n\n411\n00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:39.680\nSo unless it's explicitly allowed, it's\ncalled implicitly denied or implicit deny.\n\n412\n00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.340\nIf you're on the list, you gain access,\nif you're not on the list,\n\n413\n00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.460\nyou don't gain access.\n\n414\n00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.530\nThat's the way it works, kinda like\nreservations at a fancy restaurant.\n\n415\n00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.571\nYou're either on the list, gain access to\nthe restaurant, you're not on the list,\n\n416\n00:21:50.571 --> 00:21:52.550\nno food for you, so you keep that in mind.\n\n417\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.467\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of interesting if you\nlook at white listing versus black listing\n\n418\n00:21:56.467 --> 00:21:58.187\nand think about that for a second,\n\n419\n00:21:58.187 --> 00:22:01.860\nyou have to know about the bad guy\nto black list or to prohibit them.\n\n420\n00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.820\nSo white listing, in my opinion,\n\n421\n00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.510\nis kind of the way to go because\nyou're saying look, I trust Wes.\n\n422\n00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:10.554\nHe's a good guy, I'm gonna let him\ninto my, what did you say, restaurant.\n\n423\n00:22:10.554 --> 00:22:11.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n424\n00:22:11.754 --> 00:22:15.858\nit just really depends on that, the\ndifferent approaches that you wanna take,\n\n425\n00:22:15.858 --> 00:22:19.042\nbut kind of letting people in as\nthey need to get in versus hey,\n\n426\n00:22:19.042 --> 00:22:21.573\nI'm gonna let everyone in and\nstop the bad guys.\n\n427\n00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:22.988\nCuz you don't even know all the bad guys,\nright?\n\n428\n00:22:22.988 --> 00:22:23.906\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n429\n00:22:23.906 --> 00:22:26.850\nAnd it can become very, very difficult.\n\n430\n00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:31.500\nIf you say hey, I allow absolutely\nnothing, except for this one application,\n\n431\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.380\nwell that might be the way to go, or\nyou might wanna allow everything and\n\n432\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.660\nonly block stuff as it comes about.\n\n433\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.055\nSo again, it's really what's going\nto be what suits your network.\n\n434\n00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:45.921\nThey also talk about different traffic\ntypes as well when they talk about inbound\n\n435\n00:22:45.921 --> 00:22:47.650\nand outbound traffic guys.\n\n436\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.520\nAnd I've got a little diagram here for\nyou guys.\n\n437\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.426\nI shouldn't be too hard\nto understand here,\n\n438\n00:22:53.426 --> 00:22:58.330\nagain inbound traffic depends on\nthe perspective of the firewall, right?\n\n439\n00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.307\nBecause inbound traffic,\nas far as a network base firewall,\n\n440\n00:23:01.307 --> 00:23:05.650\nmeans inbound traffic that's going to\neverybody within the network right?\n\n441\n00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:11.330\nInbound traffic for a host based firewall\nis just what's going into the adaptor.\n\n442\n00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.700\nOutbound traffic is information that's\nbeing sent out of the device, or in this\n\n443\n00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.500\ncase, if it's a network based, like I\nmentioned, a network based firewall.\n\n444\n00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.460\nIt could be the information that's\nbeing sent out of every device out to\n\n445\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.390\nthe public network.\n\n446\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.480\nLet's see here.\n\n447\n00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.410\nThey also talk about, again,\ninternal versus external.\n\n448\n00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.910\nWe definitely have to talk about that.\n\n449\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:37.280\nAnd that really just goes back to,\nfor instance, the DMZ, again,\n\n450\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.480\nyour DMZ,\njust think about your internal network.\n\n451\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.514\nI don't wanna give everybody\naccess to my internal network.\n\n452\n00:23:43.514 --> 00:23:47.832\nIt's one of the reasons we hit you\nwith a whole bunch of acronyms, guys.\n\n453\n00:23:47.832 --> 00:23:50.252\nWhen we talked about remote\naccess technologies and\n\n454\n00:23:50.252 --> 00:23:53.772\nall the things that you would have to\nimplement to allow people that should be\n\n455\n00:23:53.772 --> 00:23:56.850\nin your network access to your\nnetwork in a secure manner.\n\n456\n00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.720\nIt is one of the reasons that\nwe implement DMZs because\n\n457\n00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.780\nwe certainly don't want just everybody\naccessing the internal network.\n\n458\n00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.940\nThe external network is typically where\nwe're gonna have those resources,\n\n459\n00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.150\nwhether it's for\nthe purposes of typically e-commerce,\n\n460\n00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:16.260\nwhere we want people to have access\nto maybe a website on the front end.\n\n461\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.770\nAnd then we have firewall rules that\nstill allow that information to go to\n\n462\n00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.820\nthe database on the internal network,\nmaking sure that we secure it as well.\n\n463\n00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.280\nSo know your firewalls, guys.\n\n464\n00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.470\nAgain, let's see, stateless,\nstateless inspection,\n\n465\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.090\nI did talk about stateful, but\nI didn't mention stateless.\n\n466\n00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.010\nLet me go ahead and mention stateless.\n\n467\n00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.690\nStateless is just your\nbasic traffic analyzation.\n\n468\n00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.420\nIt's just,\ndoes this traffic meet the rule, right?\n\n469\n00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.270\nWell I can tell you that it is,\n\n470\n00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.190\nfor instance,\nI can tell you that it's port 80, right?\n\n471\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.361\nBut stateless information says,\nwell, you said port 80.\n\n472\n00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:54.146\nI mean, I don't care if it\nsays HTTP traffic or not.\n\n473\n00:24:54.146 --> 00:24:56.760\nI'm just looking at the port 80,\nright, stateless.\n\n474\n00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.750\nStateful and packet inspection says,\nyou know what?\n\n475\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.300\nWe're blocking port 80.\n\n476\n00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.520\nBut we're also blocking unencrypted\nweb traffic, and just because you\n\n477\n00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.490\nput port 443, I can look at that\ninformation in the stateful, right?\n\n478\n00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.724\nPealing back those layers, so I can see\nthat's plain text HTTP communication.\n\n479\n00:25:12.724 --> 00:25:15.702\nStateless says I don't really\ncare about any of that,\n\n480\n00:25:15.702 --> 00:25:17.960\nI just need to know its kinda static.\n\n481\n00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.780\nWhat does this say?\n\n482\n00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.660\nWhat is this, and what does the rule say?\n\n483\n00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.230\nAnd I either allow or deny it.\n\n484\n00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.180\nIt doesn't make decisions like a stateful\npacket inspection that can implement\n\n485\n00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.710\nthings like realtime countermeasures to\nthings like SYN flow attacks, if you will,\n\n486\n00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.530\nand the synchronization attacks as well.\n\n487\n00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.170\nAll right, Cherokee, well,\nI think we've just about got it all there.\n\n488\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:43.078\nJust keep in mind, guys, whatever firewall\nyou have, make sure that it is turned on.\n\n489\n00:25:43.078 --> 00:25:46.681\nAnd I don't care what any form\nsays when you're troubleshooting,\n\n490\n00:25:46.681 --> 00:25:48.776\nyou don't just turn the firewall off.\n\n491\n00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:51.810\nAnd if that fixes the problem,\nconsider the problem fixed.\n\n492\n00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.570\nJust remember it's a temporary solution.\n\n493\n00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.596\nAlways have your firewalls up and running.\n\n494\n00:25:55.596 --> 00:25:57.621\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of like\ngoing to a car dealership and\n\n495\n00:25:57.621 --> 00:26:00.465\nlooking at all the different bells and\nwhistles that they have available.\n\n496\n00:26:00.465 --> 00:26:04.060\nRemember, there's not just a one size\nfits all when it comes to firewalls.\n\n497\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.116\nSo definitely, thank you for\n\n498\n00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:08.127\ntaking the time to differentiate between\nthe different types that we see out there.\n\n499\n00:26:08.127 --> 00:26:11.358\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but stay tuned,\n\n500\n00:26:11.358 --> 00:26:13.500\nwe have more Net + headed your way.\n\n501\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.865\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour

00:00:12.221\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:14.680\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to\nCompTIA Network Plus+ Theories.\n\n5\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.900\nI'm your show host Cherokee Booth.\n\n6\n00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.450\nIn this episode, we'll be looking\nat network access control models.\n\n7\n00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.800\nAnd while the name may seem a little\nself-explanatory, I know Mr. Wes Bryan\n\n8\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.020\nwill really take it down to that level and\nexplain it for us like we want him to.\n\n9\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.720\nSo thank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.820\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.491\nThat's right, we're looking\nat network access control and\n\n12\n00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:38.162\nthat's interesting in this topic\nthey don't really call out\n\n13\n00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:43.049\ntoo many individual topics but the topic\nthat they do call are gonna be important.\n\n14\n00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:46.280\nSo we are gonna be talking what\nit is that you can control\n\n15\n00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.360\nthe access to your networks\nwhen devices do try to connect.\n\n16\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.280\nOne of the first things that they call\nout is something known as 802.1x.\n\n17\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.960\nAnd we've talked about 802.1x in a few\ntimes over the course of this series.\n\n18\n00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.090\nBut, since we're now just focusing\non network access control,\n\n19\n00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.865\nI kinda wanna mention again and\nkind of recap it.\n\n20\n00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.787\n802.1X, what does that mean for us?\n\n21\n00:01:08.787 --> 00:01:10.987\nWell, that's port-based authentication.\n\n22\n00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:14.136\nThere's a couple of different locations\nthat you could see this inside of\n\n23\n00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:14.804\nyour network.\n\n24\n00:01:14.804 --> 00:01:18.820\nIt is commonly linked together\nwith wireless communications.\n\n25\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.570\nHowever, don't get it confused that it\nIt has to be a wireless communication.\n\n26\n00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.370\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n27\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.498\nWell, inside of WPA, WPA2 enterprise\nlevel, what it allows you to do\n\n28\n00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:34.810\nis it allows you to implement\n802.1x port-based authentication.\n\n29\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.238\nAnd I got a little diagram\nhere we can kinda look at it.\n\n30\n00:01:37.238 --> 00:01:41.798\nAnd this just means that when a for\ninstance when a remote access client or\n\n31\n00:01:41.798 --> 00:01:46.677\nreally any client for that matter tries\nto connect to your wireless network.\n\n32\n00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:50.974\nIf you've got an access point that is\n802.1x compliant, it means that that\n\n33\n00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:55.355\ndevice is gonna close down that port of\ncommunication the moment I try to connect.\n\n34\n00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:56.899\nAnd it's gonna turn around, and\n\n35\n00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.112\nit's gonna try to port forward some\nauthentication on your behalf.\n\n36\n00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:02.723\nAnd what I mean by that is\nyou're gonna authenticate,\n\n37\n00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:04.369\nit's gonna close the port down and\n\n38\n00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.190\nit's gonna send that authentication\ntypically into a radio server.\n\n39\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.955\nAnd then how do we have your radio server\nset up you might authenticate on a radio\n\n40\n00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:15.951\nserver that's not really not common as\nthe fact, if you're gonna implement all of\n\n41\n00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:19.662\nthis security you're probably not\nauthenticating on the radio servers more\n\n42\n00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:22.916\nthat you are having the radio server\ntaking that authentication and\n\n43\n00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.633\nsend it back to like an ELDAP or\ndirectory based server.\n\n44\n00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:29.494\nIt performs the authentication and\nsays, yeah I know who that person is,\n\n45\n00:02:29.494 --> 00:02:31.310\nthose credentials are verified.\n\n46\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.187\nAnd then what happens is the radial\nserver passes that information back\n\n47\n00:02:36.187 --> 00:02:39.281\nthrough the 802.1x component device.\n\n48\n00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:43.555\nAnd at this point it's really just kinda\nmore like a go-between if you will,\n\n49\n00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:47.897\nit opens up the port and it gives a radial\nsuccessful authentication method and\n\n50\n00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:49.773\nnow the person can communicate.\n\n51\n00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.642\nNow that's the wireless implementation.\n\n52\n00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:56.545\nI do want you guys to be careful with this\nbecause of the fact that I've noticed that\n\n53\n00:02:56.545 --> 00:03:00.740\nthe CompTIA objectives do lump\ninto together a lot in wireless.\n\n54\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.639\nBut it doesn't have to be a wireless\ncommunication technology.\n\n55\n00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.736\nIn fact, it's also a wired technology.\n\n56\n00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:11.191\nYour switches will also\nperform 802.1X authentication.\n\n57\n00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.214\nAnd I want you to think about\nthe ability to close down a port.\n\n58\n00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:15.910\nAlmost like physical security right.\n\n59\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.270\nWe can turn that port off, and\nthe switch can do the same thing.\n\n60\n00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.667\nIt can handle the authentication in\nthe background as more like a go between,\n\n61\n00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:29.411\npassing it off to whatever\nthe validating entity is.\n\n62\n00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:33.047\nAnd then once you're approved,\nthe switch turns the port back on, and\n\n63\n00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:36.270\nnow you can communicate across\nthe rest of the network.\n\n64\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.200\nYou could couple this with other things,\nlike policy servers as well, for instance,\n\n65\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.280\ninside of Microsoft's Server.\n\n66\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.129\nFor the longest time they've had what's\nknown as Network Access Protection,\n\n67\n00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.923\nthat says sure, we'll open up the port,\nif you have your firewall turned on,\n\n68\n00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:53.337\nif you have your anti-virus\nsoftware turned on,\n\n69\n00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:56.218\nif you have Windows update turned on and\nyou're up to date.\n\n70\n00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:59.577\nIf you don't meet that policy, well just\ngo ahead and keep that port close and\n\n71\n00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:03.430\nyou're not gonna gain access to\nthe network, hence network access control.\n\n72\n00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.830\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what you're really saying\nhere is that if I were an attacker,\n\n73\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.840\nposing as a visitor to your building,\nI wouldn't be able to just randomly\n\n74\n00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.520\nwalk up to that ethernet port and\nplug my laptop in.\n\n75\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.725\n&gt;&gt; Definitely and\neven on the switch as well too.\n\n76\n00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:19.309\nSo whether it's a drop like the drops\nthere on the wall or if somebody has\n\n77\n00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:23.581\nphysical access to your server clause that\nI'm sure you don't have to worry about-\n\n78\n00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:24.284\n&gt;&gt; It might have other problems.\n\n79\n00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.180\n&gt;&gt; It might have greater problems than\njust whether you're implementing 802.1x.\n\n80\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.293\nI have also mentioned this\nin other episodes, too,\n\n81\n00:04:31.293 --> 00:04:34.190\nbut I do want you to keep in\nmind this is one of these\n\n82\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.531\nones that it's very easy to get wrong,\nbut it's also easy to get right.\n\n83\n00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:44.880\nKeep in mind that there's a big\ndifference between 802.1x, and 802.11x.\n\n84\n00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.760\nWhen you see 802.11x,\nwhat they're saying is that it typically\n\n85\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.804\nsupports all of the different\nvariations of the 802.11 standard,\n\n86\n00:04:54.804 --> 00:04:59.708\nversus just a single one,\n802.1x is port based authentication.\n\n87\n00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:04.135\nAll right, so some of the other things\nthat they also talk about here in this\n\n88\n00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:08.094\ncollection of objectives,\nthey talk about posture assessment.\n\n89\n00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:11.794\nAnd posture assessment you can\nalso say security posture or\n\n90\n00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:14.532\nwhat is the security plan for\nyour company?\n\n91\n00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:16.940\nWhere do they stand on security?\n\n92\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.360\n&gt;&gt; That's so fine,\nthat's exactly what I was gonna say.\n\n93\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.630\nThat's how I remember it, right?\n\n94\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.380\nBecause what is your stance?\n\n95\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.299\nHow do you feel about it?\n\n96\n00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:24.890\n&gt;&gt; Right, posture, right?\n\n97\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; How you saw posture assessment\n\n98\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.820\nis basically looking at an evaluation\nof your system security, right?\n\n99\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.053\nThe applications that you might have on\nthat system that help to enforce security,\n\n100\n00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:38.689\nor help to protect that system.\n\n101\n00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.315\nIt could be antivirus software,\nit could be malware software.\n\n102\n00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:45.323\nAnti-malware software,\nyou don't wanna put malware software,\n\n103\n00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:48.077\nyou're actually going back in\nyour security posture there.\n\n104\n00:05:48.077 --> 00:05:49.358\n&gt;&gt; Don't do it.\n\n105\n00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:52.538\n&gt;&gt; General malware protection,\nand again posture assessment,\n\n106\n00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:54.578\nis the assessment of a single system, or\n\n107\n00:05:54.578 --> 00:05:58.598\nmaybe your entire network when it's\na security posture, seeing where's that\n\n108\n00:05:58.598 --> 00:06:01.900\nsystem said when it comes to\nthe overall security of that system.\n\n109\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.740\nI'm gonna jump over one here, Cherokee,\nkinda talks about another concept here\n\n110\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.540\ncalled persistent and\nnon-persistent agents.\n\n111\n00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.920\nWell, what is a persistent agent?\n\n112\n00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.140\nIt's one that doesn't get off your back.\n\n113\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.500\nJust kidding, no.\n\n114\n00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.991\nA persistent agent is one that's typically\ninstalled on the device locally, and\n\n115\n00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:25.257\nit can be constantly on,\nit could be real time monitoring.\n\n116\n00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:29.812\nNon-persistent agents are those\nagents that piece of software,\n\n117\n00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:34.605\nthat runs a start up, it's held in memory,\nonce it scans if you well it\n\n118\n00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:39.019\nwill check system processes but\nthen once that software stops.\n\n119\n00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.240\nIt's running in RAM, right?\n\n120\n00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.110\nRAM is volatile.\n\n121\n00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.560\nIt means that once its done running, it's\ngonna be cleared out of the memory, and\n\n122\n00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.273\nit's not going to be there the next\ntime you boot the machine up.\n\n123\n00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:51.021\nSo, when it comes to, again, these agents,\n\n124\n00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:55.820\nnon-persistent is one that is run in RAM,\ntypically at the start-up process.\n\n125\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.075\nOnce its done,\nit's closed that RAM is freed up and\n\n126\n00:06:58.075 --> 00:06:59.605\nthat software is no longer there.\n\n127\n00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:02.192\nSo, for instance,\nif you It's not an agent but\n\n128\n00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:05.504\nthe same concept goes with like Win PE,\nboot disks, right?\n\n129\n00:07:05.504 --> 00:07:08.504\nBoot disks they run at\nthe time of boot but\n\n130\n00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:12.840\nonce we're no longer used\nthe Operating System comes on.\n\n131\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.870\nThose boot Discs are no longer used.\n\n132\n00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.453\nThey had all of their information stored\nin memory, now that the operating\n\n133\n00:07:19.453 --> 00:07:23.757\nsystem's online, that applications\nmemory is basically flushed.\n\n134\n00:07:23.757 --> 00:07:27.693\nPersistence agents, again, typically\nTypically installed, like a piece of\n\n135\n00:07:27.693 --> 00:07:32.780\nsoftware installed, they run locally and\nthey will constantly monitor your systems.\n\n136\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.690\nAll right, now they talk about a couple\ndifferent types of networks as well here.\n\n137\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.370\nOne of the network types that they\ntalk about is a guest network,\n\n138\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.680\nnow maybe some of you guys have seen\na wireless, your wireless network.\n\n139\n00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.482\nMaybe some of you've setup your\nwireless network at your house.\n\n140\n00:07:48.482 --> 00:07:51.343\nNow if you haven't, that's okay,\nno worries that's why you're here.\n\n141\n00:07:51.343 --> 00:07:53.109\nSo what's a guest network?\n\n142\n00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:56.464\nAll right, I want you to consider a\nsituation where I have a wireless Network\n\n143\n00:07:56.464 --> 00:07:57.573\nat my house, all right.\n\n144\n00:07:57.573 --> 00:08:01.516\nWe typically have some kind of switch\nthat's built in to the device as well that\n\n145\n00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:03.800\nwe can plug our wired devices in.\n\n146\n00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.526\nAll right, if I have to give\na guest access to my home network,\n\n147\n00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:12.849\nthat means that potentially, they can gain\naccess to the resources within my network.\n\n148\n00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:14.807\nNow on the enterprise level side,\n\n149\n00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:17.854\nimagine if you have a customer\nthat comes in, right.\n\n150\n00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:20.663\nThey're in the lobby,\nthey just wanna kinda search the web.\n\n151\n00:08:20.663 --> 00:08:24.771\nWell you certainly don't wanna give them\naccess to your enterprise level network\n\n152\n00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:28.830\nwhere they can potentially do more damage\nthan what it's really worth, right?\n\n153\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.680\nWe don't wanna give them access to\nthe shares that are on our network,\n\n154\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.660\nfile servers if you will that are storing\ninformation, our domain controllers.\n\n155\n00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.580\nSo what we can do is we can create\nwhat's known as a guess network and\n\n156\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.070\nit typically allows them\ninternet connection, right.\n\n157\n00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.770\nIt just says, okay, you don't gain\naccess to the internal network but\n\n158\n00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.770\nwhat we'll do it we route you\nout back to the gateway and\n\n159\n00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.428\nwe'll let you at least\nhave internet connection.\n\n160\n00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:56.780\nNow, you gotta be careful with this\nbecause sometimes guest networks could be\n\n161\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.686\nopen networks, and\nyou know what an open network is, right.\n\n162\n00:08:59.686 --> 00:09:01.720\nIf you don't, they can be dangerous,\n\n163\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.910\nright, because open network just\nmeans I don't have to authenticate.\n\n164\n00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.250\nAnd if I don't need to authenticate,\nthen anybody can get on that network.\n\n165\n00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.280\nIt doesn't have to be your customer.\n\n166\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.820\nIt could be somebody sitting out in\nthe lobby that you have no clue and\n\n167\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.900\nthey really don't care\nabout your business.\n\n168\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.930\nSo you,\neven a guest network it is advised to\n\n169\n00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.500\nhave some kind of authentication that's\nrequired, just like your regular network.\n\n170\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.680\nSo if they join on it,\nkind of like a hotspot, right?\n\n171\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.890\nYou'll see these hot spots that\nhave things like, for instance,\n\n172\n00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.700\ncaptive portals that will point them back\nto a website that requires them to put in\n\n173\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.120\nsome kind of an identifying information\nin order to gain access to that guest\n\n174\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.630\nnetwork, even if it isn't allowing\nthem access to the internal network.\n\n175\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.520\n&gt;&gt; Like if you're at the barbershop or\nsomething,\n\n176\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.280\nit's just written on the chalkboard,\nbut it helps a little bit, right?\n\n177\n00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting, we talk about\nsome of these security techniques and\n\n178\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.220\nI swear that some of them really all they\ndo is keep the legitimate people out of\n\n179\n00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.770\nyour networks and the hackers out, well.\n\n180\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.160\n&gt;&gt; Well kind of like the physical\nsecurity we were just talking about,\n\n181\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.540\nthey say that about keeping the locks\non the door is good, right?\n\n182\n00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.210\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it's a simple fix, but\n\n183\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.970\nit can do a world of good when\nit comes to your security.\n\n184\n00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.690\nNow the other thing that\nthey talk about is they talk\n\n185\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.680\nabout quarantine networks, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.010\nWell a quarantine network is\ntypically one in which A device,\n\n187\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.260\nif it's in a quarantined network,\n\n188\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.210\ncan't communicate with any of\nthe other devices within your network.\n\n189\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.170\nNow, I say that, but with the exception\nyou might have one device that it\n\n190\n00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.350\nmight be able to communicate with, and\na lot of times that's what's known as\n\n191\n00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.530\na remediation device,\na lot of times a remediation server.\n\n192\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.500\nLet me give you an example.\n\n193\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.890\nSo let's say that we're implementing\nsomething like Network Access, Protection.\n\n194\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.080\nAnd the requirement is that you\nhave your firewall turned on,\n\n195\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.940\nyou have things like for\ninstance, not only your firewall,\n\n196\n00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.490\nyou have your anti-virus installed,\nit's running real-time protection.\n\n197\n00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.500\nThe definitions are up to date.\n\n198\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.960\nYour running windows updates,\nyou're up to date.\n\n199\n00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.530\nAnd if that information,\nif those basically pre-determined criteria\n\n200\n00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.570\naren't met, the moment the device connects\nto the network, then what happens is it's\n\n201\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.740\nkicked off of the main network and\nit goes into this isolated network.\n\n202\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.920\nAnd that's like, just like when we talk\nabout viruses, we talk about quarantines.\n\n203\n00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.560\nWe quarantine malware, what are we doing?\n\n204\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.010\nWe're putting a protective\nboundary around it, so\n\n205\n00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.730\nthat it cannot infect other\nportions of your system.\n\n206\n00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.650\nWell, that's what your\nquarantine network is.\n\n207\n00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.030\nYou might have a network policy that\nsays you have to have those components,\n\n208\n00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.460\nthose security components\nturned on on the device\n\n209\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.250\nin order to gain access to\nthe rest of the network.\n\n210\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.910\nBut if you don't have those, then what\nhappens again is you get kicked off and\n\n211\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.810\nyou usually can only talk to\nmaybe a server that's inside of\n\n212\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.740\nthat remediation or\nquarantine network, if you will.\n\n213\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.190\nBecause it might be a server that's doing\nWSUS, Windows Server Update where it says,\n\n214\n00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.310\nyour device connected to\nthe network typically when it\n\n215\n00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.550\ndoes it takes a statement of how often and\nhands it over to a policy server.\n\n216\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.120\nThe policy servers says,\nokay so you're telling me,\n\n217\n00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.350\nokay you got your firewall on good,\nwe're good with that what else,\n\n218\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:03.700\nyou got your anti virus software on,\nthat's good.\n\n219\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.020\nYour definitions are up to date, Windows\nupdates haven't been run in six months.\n\n220\n00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.045\nWell, you're gonna be set-off\nto the isolation network,\n\n221\n00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:16.710\nthe quarantine network and you're gonna\ntalk to the remediation group which\n\n222\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.150\ncould be a group of servers\ndoing a multiple roles.\n\n223\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.790\nCould be one that's doing\nend-point protection that\n\n224\n00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.420\ndownloads the software to your machine.\n\n225\n00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.130\nGets it up and running, makes sure\nthat it's running in real time or\n\n226\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.100\nit could be a WSUS server.\n\n227\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.780\nYou just communicate with it,\nit talks to that server.\n\n228\n00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.560\nIt says, here, I'm running Windows 7,\nI'm running Windows 8, Windows 10.\n\n229\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.110\nI need these updates, and\n\n230\n00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.100\nit pulls them down and it does\nwhat's known as remediation, right?\n\n231\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.550\nHow it's set up is really up to you,\nagain.\n\n232\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.160\nBut the basic point of the matter is that\nit gets kicked off the network so if it\n\n233\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.300\ndoesn't meet these checks and balances and\nthe security policy that we don't have\n\n234\n00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.805\nto worry about a network that have sub par\nsecurity or security not a network but\n\n235\n00:12:58.805 --> 00:13:03.155\na device being on our network that has\nsubstandard security implications.\n\n236\n00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:06.095\nAnd it gives us a chance too to\nremediate those without just saying,\n\n237\n00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:11.600\nI'm sorry, you don't have your updates, no\nfood for you, no network access for you.\n\n238\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.180\nAt least we give them also\na chance to remediate so\n\n239\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.830\nthey can come into compliance with\nwhatever the security policy is.\n\n240\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.290\nAnd hopefully at that point\nwe can open them up and\n\n241\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.900\ngive them access to\nthe rest of the network.\n\n242\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.580\n&gt;&gt; One thing we might wanna consider\nmaybe, just an idea, is the types of\n\n243\n00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.720\ndevices that we're allowing to\nconnect to our network too, right?\n\n244\n00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.213\nBecause if we have different operating\nsystems that might be additional cost\n\n245\n00:13:32.213 --> 00:13:35.166\nif we're looking an get different\npieces of remedial software or\n\n246\n00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:36.255\nour agent just pick so.\n\n247\n00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:39.213\n&gt;&gt; Yeah one of the examples that I can\nthink of is thinks like MDM, right,\n\n248\n00:13:39.213 --> 00:13:42.388\nmobile device management solutions\nlike for instance Microsoft Intune.\n\n249\n00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:46.540\nWe have a lot of devices that can't be\ntraditionally managed like they're things\n\n250\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.983\nlike group policy like our client\nworkstation can and our servers.\n\n251\n00:13:49.983 --> 00:13:54.070\nSo we can implement something like a\nmobile device management solution in which\n\n252\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.350\nwe can govern the level of access somebody\nhas based on the condition of the device.\n\n253\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.140\nAgain, do they have end-point protection?\n\n254\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.370\nIf they don't have some kind of end-point\nprotection on those mobile devices,\n\n255\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.180\nwell they're not gonna gain access to\nthings like our company resources.\n\n256\n00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.060\nSo it's a good advantage to make sure that\nyou're not just looking at one solution,\n\n257\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.950\nyou're looking at multiple solutions\neven something as much as like\n\n258\n00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.060\nCisco's network access control\nwhich is a pretty robust system and\n\n259\n00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.840\nit's one that's commonly used\ninside of the networks today.\n\n260\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.730\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, you kind of alluded to this.\n\n261\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.840\nI think we spoke about it\nin a previous episode, but\n\n262\n00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.470\nwhat's the difference between\nEdge versus access control.\n\n263\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's all about how many\npeople you bug when it comes down to it.\n\n264\n00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.740\nSo let's take edge control.\n\n265\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.310\nWho does that affect?\n\n266\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.200\nAnybody on the outside of your network,\nright.\n\n267\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.810\nIf we look at edge control,\njust go back to basics, right.\n\n268\n00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.220\nDMZs, in fact,\nI got a little diagram here, right.\n\n269\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.248\nSo if this young lady is trying\nto gain access to our web server,\n\n270\n00:14:47.248 --> 00:14:49.461\nif we could pull up my screen here.\n\n271\n00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:53.437\nThis lady here is trying to gain\naccess into a public resource,\n\n272\n00:14:53.437 --> 00:14:55.173\nlike a Web Server, right.\n\n273\n00:14:55.173 --> 00:14:56.925\nI'm gonna do edge control, right.\n\n274\n00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:58.975\nWe're gonna put a perimeter\nnetwork out there, right.\n\n275\n00:14:58.975 --> 00:15:00.480\nIt's not a quarantine network.\n\n276\n00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.170\nWe're not quarantining anybody.\n\n277\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.903\nWe just need to give them\naccess to a resource.\n\n278\n00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.183\nWell if I do edge control like that,\n\n279\n00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:10.290\nhow does that affect the people\nthat are on my internal network?\n\n280\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.970\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Not really much at all.\n\n281\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.850\nUnless of course,\nI misconfigure the internal firewall and\n\n282\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.160\nI block all outgoing traffic.\n\n283\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.880\nWell now it's gonna affect everybody but\njoking aside,\n\n284\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.070\nedge control only affects the people\nthat are on the outside of your network\n\n285\n00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.780\ntrying to gain maybe access to your web\nserver where you're doing your e-commerce.\n\n286\n00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:36.210\nHowever access control on the other hand\nis done all throughout your network.\n\n287\n00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.150\nAnd access control most of\nthe times affects everybody\n\n288\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.470\ninternally on your network, right.\n\n289\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.910\nSo we talk about ACLs.\n\n290\n00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.266\nWhat do we do to control access\nto different resources within our\n\n291\n00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:44.927\nother networks?\n\n292\n00:15:44.927 --> 00:15:47.899\nWell inside of Windows and\nEunix and Linux and Mac,\n\n293\n00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.329\nwe use things like permissions, right.\n\n294\n00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:53.193\nCould you perform read,\nexecute, write permissions,\n\n295\n00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:56.007\nfull control if you're in Windows and\nstuff like this?\n\n296\n00:15:56.007 --> 00:15:58.733\nWe can basically control access that way.\n\n297\n00:15:58.733 --> 00:16:03.186\nWe could put ACLs on switches that\ndictate which communications can go to\n\n298\n00:16:03.186 --> 00:16:06.610\nwhich VLANs, or\nin our routers internally, as well.\n\n299\n00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.710\nSo access control doesn't\nhappen just on the edge.\n\n300\n00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.900\nIn edge control, it does.\n\n301\n00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.035\nAccess control happens\nthroughout your network and\n\n302\n00:16:15.035 --> 00:16:17.545\ntypically affects everybody\nwithin your network.\n\n303\n00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:21.985\nAnd that's one of the differences when\nyou look at edge versus access control.\n\n304\n00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:24.695\nEdges have edge control's happening\nin one portion of your network,\n\n305\n00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:27.945\ntypically in the DMZ\nperimeter screen subnet.\n\n306\n00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:31.895\nWhere access control itself is happening\nthroughout your organization and\n\n307\n00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:36.610\nmost often is effecting everybody in\nthe organization, not just external users.\n\n308\n00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.490\n&gt;&gt; And we're really just not talking\nabout an all-or-nothing type.\n\n309\n00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.160\nAnd so access control,\nwe might wanna limit and allow certain\n\n310\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.450\npeople certain access, especially even\nif you're thinking about remote access.\n\n311\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:51.560\nMaybe, Wes, when you're traveling,\nit's harder for me trust that\n\n312\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.180\nyou are who you say you are, if someone\nsteals your laptop and your credentials.\n\n313\n00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.792\nSo maybe I'm gonna say,\nyou know what, Wes?\n\n314\n00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:59.726\nWhen you're working remotely,\nI'm only gonna give you access\n\n315\n00:16:59.726 --> 00:17:03.379\nvia remote connection to these network\ncomponents, not full-blown access.\n\n316\n00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:05.588\nSo it's kind of a cool concept\nwhen you think about it.\n\n317\n00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:10.190\n&gt;&gt; It is, and there again, that goes back\nto remote access, who is it affecting?\n\n318\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.562\nIt's affecting the people on\nthe outside of your network,\n\n319\n00:17:12.562 --> 00:17:14.897\nversus affecting everybody\ninternally on your network.\n\n320\n00:17:14.897 --> 00:17:18.641\nSo there is a big difference there,\nhowever, you might even consider\n\n321\n00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:22.209\nedge networks, like Cherokee,\nsaying a form of access control.\n\n322\n00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:24.806\nSo access control happens everywhere.\n\n323\n00:17:24.806 --> 00:17:28.030\nEdge control is, again,\nsome kind of perimeter network.\n\n324\n00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.430\nIn fact, we talked a lot about this.\n\n325\n00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.540\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's look at some of the things that\n\n326\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.286\nyou can do when it comes to, for instance,\ncontrolling the access to the network.\n\n327\n00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:39.330\nSo I've got a Windows 7 machine here,\n\n328\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.850\nand we're gonna drop down\nto our Command Prompt.\n\n329\n00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.500\nWe're gonna do an ipconfig, and\nlet's see what kind of IP address we have.\n\n330\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.910\nAll right, so\nyou can see that I have an IP address.\n\n331\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.435\nYou can see what the domain name is here.\n\n332\n00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:54.325\nAnd you can see that I\nhave a default gateway.\n\n333\n00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:55.896\nLet's see if I can ping\nthe default gateway.\n\n334\n00:17:55.896 --> 00:18:00.602\nSo we'll do our ping of 192.168.1.1, and\n\n335\n00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:06.342\nit looks like I can communicate\nwith the default gateway, right?\n\n336\n00:18:06.342 --> 00:18:09.290\nI don't know, let's ping by name,\nlet's see if DNS is working, right?\n\n337\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:14.650\nSo we'll ping DC01, and I can gain access,\nI can communicate with DC01.\n\n338\n00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.020\nSo notice there's communication here.\n\n339\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.160\nNow, we're gonna do something\nthat's a little bit different here,\n\n340\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.590\nin fact, my head's kinda covering it up.\n\n341\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.869\nI'm gonna go down here, all right,\nand I'm gonna right-click,\n\n342\n00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:27.869\nI'm gonna open up my Network and\nSharing Center, all right.\n\n343\n00:18:27.869 --> 00:18:36.216\nNotice that I have a connection\ninto demo.itpro.tv.\n\n344\n00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:38.465\nAll right, so\nwhat we've seen in the ipconfig commands.\n\n345\n00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:43.405\nNow, what happens if I'm\nimplementing access control, and\n\n346\n00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:48.155\nit requires me to, let's say,\nhave a firewall turned on?\n\n347\n00:18:48.155 --> 00:18:49.230\nIn fact, I can show you that.\n\n348\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.056\nIf I switch over to my\nNetwork Policy Server here, and\n\n349\n00:18:53.056 --> 00:18:58.172\nwe open up something like,\nlet's open up Network Policy, all right?\n\n350\n00:18:58.172 --> 00:19:00.813\nI can look in here, and I can see,\nwell, what are the requirements here?\n\n351\n00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:03.584\nAnd if I drill down into this,\nI can see that I have, for\n\n352\n00:19:03.584 --> 00:19:07.990\nNetwork Access Protection, I have\nsome System Health Validators, right?\n\n353\n00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.140\nWell, technically it's only one.\n\n354\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.200\nIt allows for third-party, but I've only\nseen the only Security Health Validator.\n\n355\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.990\nNotice it says here's our\nSecurity Health Validator.\n\n356\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.580\nWell, what's that gonna require?\n\n357\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.489\nWell, let's look at the Settings,\nall right.\n\n358\n00:19:21.489 --> 00:19:23.275\nI got my default configuration.\n\n359\n00:19:23.275 --> 00:19:27.942\nAnd if you're gonna connect to my network,\nin this case, you can see these\n\n360\n00:19:27.942 --> 00:19:33.020\nsettings are to defined the Windows\nSecurity Health Validator provider.\n\n361\n00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.480\nAnd these define the requirements for\n\n362\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.070\na client computer to\nconnect to your network.\n\n363\n00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.230\nNow, I went ahead and\nI just did us some basic ones here.\n\n364\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.960\nI said, you know what,\nyou gotta have your Firewall on but\n\n365\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.380\nyou can see that we can\nrequire other things, right?\n\n366\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.490\nI can require things like anti-spyware\napplication has to be there,\n\n367\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.850\nit has to be turned on.\n\n368\n00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:50.730\nThings like your\nAutomatic Update settings,\n\n369\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.730\ndifferent Security settings, as well.\n\n370\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.850\nI believe if we scroll down here,\nyou can see some additional ones.\n\n371\n00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.370\nRestrict access for clients that don't\nhave all the available security updates,\n\n372\n00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.110\nright, we can do things like that.\n\n373\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.960\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead,\nand I'll leave it basic here.\n\n374\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.000\nI'm going to say, you know what,\nif you're gonna connect to this network,\n\n375\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.950\nyou have to have your firewall turned on,\nall right?\n\n376\n00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.530\nWell let's see,\nswitching back to our client, and\n\n377\n00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.052\nwe'll get out of the Network and\nSharing Center.\n\n378\n00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:16.640\nAnd let's go ahead and let's go into\nControl Panel &gt; System and Security,\n\n379\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.810\nand we'll go into\nthe Windows Firewall here, all right?\n\n380\n00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:25.330\nNow, when I go into the Firewall, you can\nsee that the firewall is turned on, right?\n\n381\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.123\nOkay, so\nwhat happens if we turn the firewall off?\n\n382\n00:20:29.123 --> 00:20:33.394\nWell, let's go ahead and we're gonna turn\nthe firewall off and see what we get here.\n\n383\n00:20:33.394 --> 00:20:35.105\n&gt;&gt; No!\n&gt;&gt; Yes [LAUGH] because you always get\n\n384\n00:20:35.105 --> 00:20:38.023\nthose people that'll say,\nif you're testing it, just go ahead,\n\n385\n00:20:38.023 --> 00:20:39.020\nturn the firewall off.\n\n386\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.490\nAnd that will fix the application, and\n\n387\n00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.250\nthen, unfortunately,\nthey never turn it back on.\n\n388\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.010\nAnd now you've got a security\nvulnerability within your network.\n\n389\n00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.050\nWell, with this Network Access Control,\n\n390\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.060\nwe can enforce the fact that\nthe firewall has to be on.\n\n391\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.810\nWe'll go ahead and choose OK on this,\nand you can see down here,\n\n392\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.800\nit tells me Firewall's turned off, right?\n\n393\n00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.650\nYou need to turn on the firewall.\n\n394\n00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.580\nAnd notice what it says right here,\nNetwork Access Protection.\n\n395\n00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.350\nYour Network access might be limited.\n\n396\n00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.995\nSo what's happening is,\nmy computer reached\n\n397\n00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:09.715\nout to the Network Policy Server and\nsaid here's my statement of health.\n\n398\n00:21:09.715 --> 00:21:12.238\nWe looked that System Health Validator and\nsaid, well wait a second,\n\n399\n00:21:12.238 --> 00:21:14.185\nyour firewall's turned off.\n\n400\n00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:16.115\nYou're not gonna gain\naccess to the network.\n\n401\n00:21:16.115 --> 00:21:19.940\nBut notice what happen to the firewall,\nit kicked right back on.\n\n402\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.190\nWhy is that?\n\n403\n00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.200\nWell because I've got this set up for\nauto-remediation.\n\n404\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.010\nIf it sees that there's a problem and\nit can fix it,\n\n405\n00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:30.920\nit automatically remediates it,\nwhich means it fixes the problem.\n\n406\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.930\nAll right now, let's say we go\na little bit farther, all right, and\n\n407\n00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.450\nI'm really gonna break Windows now.\n\n408\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.385\nAll right,\nI'm gonna get down into our Services and\n\n409\n00:21:40.385 --> 00:21:44.770\nI'm gonna stop the service\nthat the firewall relies on.\n\n410\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.440\nAnd what is that?\n\n411\n00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.856\nWell, you probably guessed,\nit's the Windows Firewall service.\n\n412\n00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:51.860\nNot too amazing there.\n\n413\n00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.870\nSo we'll click Stop here and\n\n414\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.960\nyou'll see that it's going to\nattempt to stop the firewall.\n\n415\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.530\nNow, notice I get that same warning but\n\n416\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.869\nnotice what happened, notice how it\ninstantly kicks back over to Stop.\n\n417\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.455\nAgain, it's auto-remediating.\n\n418\n00:22:05.455 --> 00:22:08.962\nSo I'm gonna have to trick it a little bit\nto show you guys the demonstration here.\n\n419\n00:22:08.962 --> 00:22:10.762\nBecause it's doing its job,\n\n420\n00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:16.210\nit's automatically remediating the client\nhere by turning its firewall back on.\n\n421\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:21.460\nBut if I go up here and I disable\nthe firewall service, and I say, OK.\n\n422\n00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.290\nAnd oops, I probably still need\nto stop the service here and\n\n423\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.020\nthat's what we're gonna go ahead and do.\n\n424\n00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.492\nNow that the service is disabled,\nit isn't gonna turn back on.\n\n425\n00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:30.480\nAnd you could see I'm\ngetting that warning here.\n\n426\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.382\nAnd in a second, Network Access Protection\nshould tell me, or NAP,\n\n427\n00:22:34.382 --> 00:22:38.530\nthat you should say well,\nyour communication might be limited.\n\n428\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.930\nAnd why is it limited?\n\n429\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:44.290\nWell, it's limited because of the fact\nthat I turn the firewall off, right?\n\n430\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.520\nAnd according to\nthe Network Access Control,\n\n431\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.040\nwe have to have that firewall turned on\nin order to gain access to the network.\n\n432\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.930\nSo now let's see what happens when I\ndrop back down to my Command Prompt.\n\n433\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.792\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nclose these up here, all right.\n\n434\n00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.007\nFirst of all, without doing an ipconfig,\n\n435\n00:22:59.007 --> 00:23:03.139\nlet's rerun that same ping command cuz\nwe still have the commands output here.\n\n436\n00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:04.480\nLet's go ahead and just rerun that.\n\n437\n00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.690\nIsn't that funny?\n\n438\n00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.860\nAll of a sudden I get a transmit failed,\nall right.\n\n439\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.080\nWell, why is that?\n\n440\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:17.510\nWell, let's go ahead and\nwe'll rerun our ipconfig.\n\n441\n00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:22.390\nAnd this time I'm gonna do a forward\nslash switch there with all.\n\n442\n00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.904\nAnd I want you to look at the difference,\n\n443\n00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.455\nnotice the connections\nspecific DNS suffix.\n\n444\n00:23:28.455 --> 00:23:34.789\nBefore it was demo.itpro.tv.\n\n445\n00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:42.312\nNow look what it says,\nquarantine-net.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n446\n00:23:42.312 --> 00:23:45.107\nAll right, and I also want you\nto look at this subnet mask.\n\n447\n00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:49.360\nNotice the subnet mask,\nit means I can't talk to anybody.\n\n448\n00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.240\nAnd if you look at my quarantine state,\n\n449\n00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.459\nremember we're talking about\nthe quarantine networks.\n\n450\n00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.654\nI'm restricted, all right.\n\n451\n00:23:56.654 --> 00:23:59.577\nNow, one of the last things I\nmight say is let's go ahead and\n\n452\n00:23:59.577 --> 00:24:03.105\nlet's try to ping the NPS server,\nright, the Network Policy Server.\n\n453\n00:24:03.105 --> 00:24:07.389\nSo I'm gonna do a ping, 192.168.1.2.\n\n454\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.980\nThat's interesting, I'm getting replies.\n\n455\n00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.400\nWhy am I getting replies?\n\n456\n00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.910\nWell, we'll go a little bit farther here.\n\n457\n00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.146\nLet's do the route print command.\n\n458\n00:24:16.146 --> 00:24:18.150\nAll right,\nI wanna see the routing table and\n\n459\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.480\nshow you what this did to the client here.\n\n460\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.530\nAll right, if I look at the routing table,\nI don't have any local network routes.\n\n461\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.470\nThe only thing I have is myself and\nthe NPS server.\n\n462\n00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.200\nNotice that's it's masked out.\n\n463\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.340\nI can only talk to the server, why?\n\n464\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.830\nThat's the Network Policy Server.\n\n465\n00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.651\nIn order to remediate, I still have\nto say, here's the current state.\n\n466\n00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:42.365\nSo I have to be able to talk to them\nin order to gain access to the physical\n\n467\n00:24:42.365 --> 00:24:43.337\nnetwork again, right.\n\n468\n00:24:43.337 --> 00:24:46.860\nOr gain full access to the network.\n\n469\n00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.890\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's see if we can do a remediation here.\n\n470\n00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.629\nNow, I broke it on purpose here,\nso I have to go back and\n\n471\n00:24:53.629 --> 00:24:55.608\nI have to turn on the Windows Firewall.\n\n472\n00:24:55.608 --> 00:25:00.046\nAnd again, like I said, you don't\nwant your firewall turned off at all,\n\n473\n00:25:00.046 --> 00:25:01.778\nbut sometimes people do it.\n\n474\n00:25:01.778 --> 00:25:04.758\nAnd we're gonna change this back to\nAutomatic, we'll choose Apply, and\n\n475\n00:25:04.758 --> 00:25:05.620\nwe're gonna start.\n\n476\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.270\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll close this down and\n\n477\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.570\nwe're gonna rerun our ping command.\n\n478\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.172\nOops, no that's right,\nwe're not in PowerShell.\n\n479\n00:25:16.172 --> 00:25:21.616\nAll right, so we're gonna do a ping and\nwe'll do a one 192.168.1.1\n\n480\n00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:27.270\nAnd like that,\nI gain access to the network again, why?\n\n481\n00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.988\nBecause my computer turned around and\nit talked back to that NPS server and\n\n482\n00:25:31.988 --> 00:25:33.976\nit says here's my statement.\n\n483\n00:25:33.976 --> 00:25:38.054\nDoes it match what you say needs to\nbe done in order to gain access to\n\n484\n00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:38.953\nthe network?\n\n485\n00:25:38.953 --> 00:25:41.673\nAnd in this case,\nsince the firewall's turned back on,\n\n486\n00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:44.360\nyou're in compliance\nwith the health policy.\n\n487\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.410\nThe Network Policy Server let's\nthe rest of the network know,\n\n488\n00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.490\nin the domain control,\nin this case, no, he's good.\n\n489\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.390\nLet's go ahead and give this device\naccess to the rest of the network.\n\n490\n00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.150\nSo it shows you an example of how\nwe can control the level of access\n\n491\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.520\nthat a device has to the network,\nbased on some security settings.\n\n492\n00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.380\nAnd that is a classic example\nwhen you're running something\n\n493\n00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.840\nlike Network Access Control.\n\n494\n00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think that's about it for\nthis episode, Wes.\n\n495\n00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.630\nThat's brings us to the end, but thank you\nso much for showing us those examples.\n\n496\n00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.000\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for joining us.\n\n497\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.910\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n498\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.280\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n499\n00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:18.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n500\n00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.519\n&gt;&gt; See you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n4\n00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.040\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.760\nIn this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.470\nwe will be exploring different\ntypes of basic forensic procedures.\n\n7\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.570\nWith us today we have Mr.\nWes Bryan in studios.\n\n8\n00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.230\nThank you for joining us, Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.470\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.510\nAlways great to be with the ITProTV crew.\n\n11\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.250\nThat's right, we're gonna look at\nreally It's really about a 30,000\n\n12\n00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.260\nfoot overview on forensics, because\nthis has its own doctoral dissertations.\n\n13\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250\nAnd this can get very complex but\nat the Network+ level guys,\n\n14\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550\nthey really just want you to be able\nto classify some of the information.\n\n15\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.930\nAnd be able to just really define it\nmore as more than actually jump in and\n\n16\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.460\nperform things like forensic analysis.\n\n17\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.420\nNow, if you're going on to\nsomething like that, well that is\n\n18\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.770\ndefinitely a one field that is a good\nfield to get in, but keep in mind that not\n\n19\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.630\nonly is it a popular field but it is a\nfield that has it's own science behind it.\n\n20\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.150\nSo if you are going to work your way\nup in things like forensics analysis,\n\n21\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.470\nyou probably got a lot of\nschooling ahead of you.\n\n22\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.588\nThat is not what we're looking\nat here today [LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:17.136\nWe're just trying to identify some of\nthose basics so we'll go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:17.902\njump right in.\n\n25\n00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:21.660\nLet's go ahead and just kinda talk\na little bit about forensics, right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.200\nWhen we talk about forensics in general,\nwe're just talking about\n\n27\n00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100\nthe process of using some kind of\nscientific knowledge and collection,\n\n28\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.890\nanalysis and\nthe presentation of evidence in a court.\n\n29\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.940\nNow, that's basic forensics, right?\n\n30\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.770\nBut, we're not talking\nabout just basic forensics,\n\n31\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.710\nwe're really talking about basic\ncomputer forensics, right?\n\n32\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.560\nSo, a little bit different here but\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n33\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.900\nsome of the concepts are the same.\n\n34\n00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.570\nKeep in mind that forensics in general.\n\n35\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.660\nWhen you talk about forensics, it doesn't\nmatter if it's computer forensics or\n\n36\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.300\ncriminal forensics, you're really\njust talking about the recovery and\n\n37\n00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.020\nanalysis of evidence that eventually\nwill be presented in a court of law.\n\n38\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.200\nComputer forensics, on the other hand,\nis basically a collection and\n\n39\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.050\nanalysis of data from computers, networks,\n\n40\n00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.990\ncommunication streams and\ndifferent types of storage mediums.\n\n41\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.500\nSo keep in mind that when\nwe talk about forensics,\n\n42\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.630\nwe're talking about more on\nthe computer forensic side.\n\n43\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.340\nSo that's really what we\nare focused in on today.\n\n44\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.350\nOne of the first topics that they call\nout on the exam is first responders.\n\n45\n00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.060\nNow, when we talked about in\nour disaster recovery episode,\n\n46\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.240\nwe talked about first responders.\n\n47\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.050\nKeep in mind, these can be non-IT,\nthese can be things like your EMTs,\n\n48\n00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.090\nyour medical teams, right,\nlaw enforcement, fire.\n\n49\n00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.970\nBut we're talking about first\nresponders in a little bit different\n\n50\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.800\nmindset if you will.\n\n51\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.970\nWe're talking about criminal\nfirst responders, right?\n\n52\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970\nI mean criminal a they're criminals but\n\n53\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.450\nthey are responding to some\npotential criminal activity.\n\n54\n00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.230\nAnd they need to make sure that\nthey do things like security area.\n\n55\n00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.570\nSo, when we talk about our first\nresponders in this aspect,\n\n56\n00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.960\nwe're really talking about the people\nthat have the authority and\n\n57\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.150\njurisdiction to label something,\nmaybe a potential crime scene, right.\n\n58\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.040\nWhen I say crime scene,\nagain, don't think of CSI.\n\n59\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.680\nWell, maybe some episodes of CSI.\n\n60\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.440\nBut again, we're talking more in\nthe electronic world than anything else.\n\n61\n00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.130\nYour first responders, keep in mind,\n\n62\n00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.060\nare typically things like\nyour forensics examiners.\n\n63\n00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.030\nAnd also you have things like\nincident response policies, right.\n\n64\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.370\nIf there is some kind\nof security incident,\n\n65\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.348\nyou could have a security\nincident response team.\n\n66\n00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:33.480\nAnd that sometimes, it could be\ndifficult right, the first responders,\n\n67\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.860\nor any type of first responder,\nwhether it's criminal investigation or\n\n68\n00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.870\nit happens to be a disaster right.\n\n69\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.510\nThey're trying to contain and\nremediate the situation and that\n\n70\n00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.740\nportion of the containment and remediation\nmight destroy valuable evidence.\n\n71\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.470\nSo you might say that like your forensics\nexaminers could be your first responders.\n\n72\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.920\nBut you could have a security\nincident responder and\n\n73\n00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.390\ntheir priorities might be\na little bit different.\n\n74\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.430\nAnd they really need to communicate\ntogether to make sure that if you\n\n75\n00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.130\nare responding to some kind of security\nbreach, right, a security incident, right.\n\n76\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.000\nWhat is that?\nIt's a violation of a security policy.\n\n77\n00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.890\nIt could really boil down to\nsomebody sharing a password.\n\n78\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.690\nOr it could be as complex as\nsomebody hacking into a system,\n\n79\n00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.770\nsomebody doing something on their\ncomputer that they shouldn't do.\n\n80\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.290\nSo keep in mind that the communication\nis important here, because first\n\n81\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.360\nresponders sometimes have different\npriorities that could damage evidence.\n\n82\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.910\n&gt;&gt; Wes you raised a really good point\nbecause we're not always going to\n\n83\n00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.750\nbe having the same end goal when\nwe're talking about security.\n\n84\n00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.570\nYou may find conflicting components and\nwe'll start talking about this and\n\n85\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.650\nWes will explain the order\nof volatility that sometimes\n\n86\n00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.290\nevidence can be fleeting and what that\nmeans is, if I need to go ahead and\n\n87\n00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.160\na machine and create an ISO image and\ncopies to perform my analysis on.\n\n88\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.680\nYou know, am I gonna be taking my machine\nout of the production environment?\n\n89\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.370\nIs it gonna be hurting the mom and\npop shops that really\n\n90\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.050\nrequire their limited amount\nof equipment that they have?\n\n91\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.050\nSo, just something to consider.\n\n92\n00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've heard some people talk\nabout it, and professors, you know,\n\n93\n00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.616\nhave mentioned in other schools,\nnot that I was attending them, but\n\n94\n00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:06.330\nI read a lot of information on this and\nstuff, and try to get ideas, and\n\n95\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.677\nhow I wanna present it to you guys.\n\n96\n00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:12.665\nAnd one of the professors said that about\n90% of his students get it wrong when\n\n97\n00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:15.280\nit comes to one of\nthe first things you do.\n\n98\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.790\nLike one student said,\nI'm gonna turn a monitor around so\n\n99\n00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.800\nI can see what's going on.\n\n100\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.420\nWell, just turning that monitor around,\n\n101\n00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.900\nyou've damaged the crime scene area,\nright?\n\n102\n00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.670\nAnd you might've disrupted basically,\nthere's a lot of documentation that comes\n\n103\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.640\ninto play beforehand, before we even\nstart doing things like data acquisition,\n\n104\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.000\nso you have to remember that you have\nto do things like securing the area.\n\n105\n00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.468\nNow when you secure the area,\n\n106\n00:05:35.468 --> 00:05:39.365\nit could be difficult if you got things\nlike victims that are present, right.\n\n107\n00:05:39.365 --> 00:05:42.417\na lot of times we're talking about\ncybersecurity but that doesn't\n\n108\n00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:45.735\nmean that there couldn't be some kind\nof victims in the situation like for\n\n109\n00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.160\ninstance, I think of\nthe ICS systems right.\n\n110\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.570\nIndustrial control systems, so\n\n111\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.060\nwe talk about SCATA and\ndistributed control systems.\n\n112\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Scary stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.760\n&gt;&gt; It really is and if it's somebody\nthat's attacking a system like that,\n\n114\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.030\nyou might talk about opening floodgates,\nright?\n\n115\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.480\nCausing some disruption\nin a nuclear power plant.\n\n116\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.120\nNow I'm talking on a massive scale here,\n\n117\n00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.380\nthat's as far right as\nyou can get with it.\n\n118\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.730\nBut you gotta understand that\nthere could be victims present and\n\n119\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.470\nobviously the priority is gonna be\nthe victims before anything else, right.\n\n120\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.930\nWe're not gonna, at that point we need to\nmake sure that they have any kinda medical\n\n121\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.200\nattention, and that's where it\ngets difficult to secure the area.\n\n122\n00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:25.620\nSo also keep in mind, again your first\nresponders could be forensic examiners\n\n123\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.860\nversus cyber incident responders.\n\n124\n00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.740\nAnd you have to make sure that\nthey communicate so that,\n\n125\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.480\nwhen you're securing the area,\nyou're not tampering any evidence.\n\n126\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.450\nThey also say escalate when necessary.\n\n127\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.740\nMaybe I'm a manager, and\nI'm just supposed to make a call, right?\n\n128\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.830\nAnd it's my job to make a call to the team\nthat's actually gonna go in there.\n\n129\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.150\nSo you might do escalation\nto a third party.\n\n130\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.890\nAnd you need to be aware of that as well.\n\n131\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.560\nNow they talk about things like for\ninstance,\n\n132\n00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.000\ndocumenting the scenes, all right?\n\n133\n00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.630\nWhen we, in fact let's kinda look at some\nof the things that you can do when it\n\n134\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.200\ncomes to documenting and\nagain these are more of common things.\n\n135\n00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.880\nThis is not an outline that says this\nis exactly how you have to do it.\n\n136\n00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.850\nThere are standards,\nbodies out there like NIST and\n\n137\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.110\nSANS that can give you good\ndocumented procedures to follow.\n\n138\n00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.340\nBut it's a framework, right.\n\n139\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.080\nSo we're just mentioning some\nof the commonalities here.\n\n140\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.390\nSo for instance,\nwhen we talk about documenting the scenes.\n\n141\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.570\nWe can take a look at my computer, we talk\nfor instance the internal storage, right.\n\n142\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.940\nIf I'm documenting scenes I need to know\nwhat is the current configuration of\n\n143\n00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.510\nthe system before I even do anything\nto it, before I touch it, right.\n\n144\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.620\nI need to know what's the make,\nmodel, the location.\n\n145\n00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.210\nRight, if it's an internal storage I\nneed to know what is the drive type.\n\n146\n00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.060\nA lot of times today, that's gonna\nbe something like the serial ATA or\n\n147\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.390\nSATA if you're talking\nabout workstations but\n\n148\n00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.640\nif you're talking in server environments,\nthese could be SAS drives.\n\n149\n00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.676\nIt could be entire fiber\nchannel switched fabric, so\n\n150\n00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:56.380\nyou have to know what\nthe interface type is too.\n\n151\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.324\nWe talk about documenting the scene, not\nonly locations that you find things and\n\n152\n00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:03.920\ntaking pictures and making sure that\nyou're thoroughly documenting But\n\n153\n00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.703\nalso looking at things like for\ninstance your internal components, right?\n\n154\n00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:12.020\nWhat is the current configuration\nthe video cards, network adapters.\n\n155\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.760\nThings like your random access memory,\nBIOS configuration.\n\n156\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.150\nAlso documenting the same could\nbe things like witnesses, right?\n\n157\n00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.020\nYou have internal employees\ncould be contractors.\n\n158\n00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.080\nIt could be things like\nyour customers as well.\n\n159\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.070\nWe need to make sure that we\ndocument that thoroughly.\n\n160\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.570\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, you mentioned different types\nof frameworks that are available for\n\n161\n00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.030\nus to use as guidelines.\n\n162\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.650\nAnd it's kind of interesting with that\nexample that you gave about maybe a SCADA\n\n163\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.380\nsystem being hacked and\ncausing bodily harm to individuals.\n\n164\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.910\nAnd it's kind of we can have all these\ndisaster recovery plans in place and\n\n165\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.240\nall these policies, but sometimes\nthey just kinda go out the window or\n\n166\n00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.120\nyou kinda have to modify and\nevolve as these incidents are occurring.\n\n167\n00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou couldn't state that any better.\n\n168\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.270\nEspecially with the fact\nthat it's technology and\n\n169\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.630\ntechnology is always changing, right.\n\n170\n00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.950\nWe know that proverbial joke,\nyou just got a computer?\n\n171\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.370\nWell, in six months it's out of date, but\nthat's just the way technology moves.\n\n172\n00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.630\nSo we do have to adapt.\n\n173\n00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.380\nWe have to do things like, for instance,\nif we are documenting the scene and\n\n174\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.240\nwe're taking that case apart for\nthe first time and\n\n175\n00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.320\nwe wanna make sure that we\nknow what make and model is.\n\n176\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.790\nYour ESD wrist wrap on, right?\n\n177\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.000\nElectrostatic discharge could damage,\nright, could corrupt anything that it is,\n\n178\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.140\nthat we're trying to acquiesce during this\nprocess when we go through forensics.\n\n179\n00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.780\nWe have to identify all the storage\nmedium that we're using,\n\n180\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.510\nmaybe it's not just internal drives, which\nis typical, it isn't just internal drives,\n\n181\n00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.860\nmaybe we have removable media, right?\n\n182\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.200\nWe have things like your flash storage,\nthe USB thumb drives,\n\n183\n00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.310\nexternal devices, archives,\nlogs, if you will.\n\n184\n00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.469\nSo all different things that\nwe have to keep in mind.\n\n185\n00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:50.753\nNow the other thing that they\nalso talk a little bit about is\n\n186\n00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:53.850\nsomething known as eDiscovery.\n\n187\n00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.963\neDiscovery, when we look at eDiscovery,\nreally what that boils down to,\n\n188\n00:09:57.963 --> 00:10:02.150\nguys is that basically in computer\nforensics what kind of format are we\n\n189\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.690\ndealing with when it comes to what\nit is that we're examining, right.\n\n190\n00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.060\nWell, it's an electronic format.\n\n191\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.090\nThat's why they call it eDiscovery\ncuz what we're looking at\n\n192\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.530\nIs some kind of electronic format.\n\n193\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:21.300\nThe goals of eDiscovery is essentially to\nidentify, collect, preservation, right?\n\n194\n00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.045\nWe need to preserve the information\nto make sure that it's not modified.\n\n195\n00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:26.435\nAnd then, finally,\nthe presentation, right?\n\n196\n00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:29.005\nThe presentation is typically\ninside a court of law.\n\n197\n00:10:29.005 --> 00:10:31.785\nWell, what are some of the formats\nthat we have out there?\n\n198\n00:10:31.785 --> 00:10:35.165\nI've mentioned some of them, but we also\nhave different types, data types, right?\n\n199\n00:10:35.165 --> 00:10:38.585\nWe have things like emails,\ntraditional documents, right?\n\n200\n00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:40.845\nIt could be a text file,\nit could be a Word doc, right?\n\n201\n00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:45.640\nIt could be Open Office,\nit could be Microsoft Office if you will,\n\n202\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.590\ndatabases, right.\n\n203\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.710\nIf you think your team or\nyour company's been hacked or something.\n\n204\n00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.430\nOr maybe the company has suffered\nfrom a SQL injection attack.\n\n205\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.670\nWell, then my database might be some of\nthe information that we're collecting and\n\n206\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.870\nwe're trying to gather, as well.\n\n207\n00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.020\nThings like your voice messages,\nvoicemail,\n\n208\n00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.370\nvoice messages might be some of\nthe data types that we need to look at.\n\n209\n00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.970\nOther things like social media, right?\n\n210\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.300\nSocial media is so prevalent today but it\nhas its goods and it has its bads, right?\n\n211\n00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.290\nWhen it comes to a business\nusing social media,\n\n212\n00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.370\nthey can use social media to\nannounce a new product, right.\n\n213\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.180\nAnd within moments it's\nout to 500,000 people,\n\n214\n00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.590\nwhere that's a lot of legwork\nbefore we had social media.\n\n215\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.350\nBut like everything when you\nhave something that is good,\n\n216\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.160\nit also has the potential\nto be bad as well.\n\n217\n00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.410\nBecause not only getting that information\nout on a new product to 500,000 people,\n\n218\n00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.690\nwhat happens if somebody\nworks in your patent section.\n\n219\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.660\nRight, where you're\ndoing private research.\n\n220\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.560\nThey get on that social media site and\nthey say, yeah we got that bearing for\n\n221\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.660\nthat new unmanned spy planes\nthat we're working on.\n\n222\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.770\nNow you got a problem.\n\n223\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.710\nYou got a violation of a security\npolicy that could lead in some civil\n\n224\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.250\naction or penalty.\n\n225\n00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.590\nSo we definitely have to work that.\n\n226\n00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.150\nI don't know why I got\nvoice messages just twice.\n\n227\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.470\nApparently, voice messages,\nyou just have to really worry about.\n\n228\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.770\nNo, just kidding, guys, looks like I\ngot a little typo in my diagram there.\n\n229\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.850\nBut social media is also something\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n230\n00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.809\nThe other one I didn't put up here, logs.\n\n231\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.100\nYou always have some kind of audit trail,\nright?\n\n232\n00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.670\nLogs are a good place that, we might have\nto grab those logs and see things like\n\n233\n00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.660\naudit logs, security logs, right, syslog,\nso many different logs out there.\n\n234\n00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.610\nThe other one's metadata.\n\n235\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.360\nMeta data is a very important tool because\nit tells me the last time a file was\n\n236\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.110\naccessed, last time it was modified.\n\n237\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.060\nThat might be important information that\nwe have to preserve cuz I need to know\n\n238\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.880\nthat somebody accessed this document\nthey shouldn't have accessed and\n\n239\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.000\nI need to know what time they did it.\n\n240\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.450\nIf it's happening inside of business\nhours it could be some kind of malicious\n\n241\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.230\nInsider, right?\n\n242\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.120\nAnd I need to know that.\n\n243\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.980\nOr if it's happening outside of\nbusiness hours, it could still be\n\n244\n00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.270\nthe malicious insider but it might be\nan external threat, an external attack,\n\n245\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.370\nthat gives us the information about where\nthis type of attack is coming from, right?\n\n246\n00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.330\nSo that's also something\nthat you have to consider.\n\n247\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.580\nWhen it comes down to it,\ncomputer forensics.\n\n248\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.550\nIt's one of your most common\ntypes of form of eDiscovery.\n\n249\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.400\nIt's a highly specialized and\nfocused type of eDiscovery, but\n\n250\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.670\nit's eDiscovery nonetheless.\n\n251\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.110\nAnd that brings us into data collection,\nright?\n\n252\n00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.740\nWhen it comes to data collection, Cherokee\nmentioned something called earlier called\n\n253\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.230\nthe order of volatility, right.\n\n254\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.110\nRight, in data collection, we have to\nfollow departmental guidelines, right?\n\n255\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.710\nWe might have multiple departments,\nso they're gonna be\n\n256\n00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.320\ninterdepartmental guidelines and we\nhave to make sure that they're followed.\n\n257\n00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:36.190\nThe other thing too, we have to do things\nin evidence and data collection and this\n\n258\n00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.440\nis one I didn't consider until reading\nsomething like your National Institute of\n\n259\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.090\nStandards and Technologies documentation\nwhere how about the examiner's station?\n\n260\n00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.190\nA lot of times you have to have a security\nbaseline for that examiner's station so\n\n261\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.790\nyou know what the configuration\nof the examiner station.\n\n262\n00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.505\nBecause in chain of custody, it's about\nthe preservation of that information as\n\n263\n00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:58.925\nit goes through the different departments\nuntil it's finally led into or\n\n264\n00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:01.125\npresented inside a court of law.\n\n265\n00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:05.232\n&gt;&gt; An interesting little phrase\nthat I heard from you know Dr.\n\n266\n00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:08.890\nTerra Stern with project management she\nteaches a lot of lean and agile but\n\n267\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.480\nshe always says,\nmeasure your measurement tools.\n\n268\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.810\nSo to make sure that your devices, your\nmachines, your stations are calibrated and\n\n269\n00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.670\nit just kind of resonated with me\nbecause hey that actually makes sense.\n\n270\n00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.840\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, you know the other\nthing too, I talked about taking system\n\n271\n00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.030\nimages, when you are gathering data,\nyou're taking pictures, you're\n\n272\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.560\nalso taking things like system images and\nrunning things like hash values.\n\n273\n00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.800\nHashing algorithms across the data that\nyou are bringing into collections so\n\n274\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.070\nthat we know that if that information is\npresented in a court of law we can run\n\n275\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.650\nthose same algorithms across it and when\nwe do that, we can compare those values.\n\n276\n00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.370\nAnd if those values haven't changed, we\ncan say that the data is the same that it\n\n277\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.770\nwas when we gathered it\nnow as we've analyzed it,\n\n278\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.190\nwe processed it, and\nwe've presented it in a court of law.\n\n279\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.250\nAnd we don't have to to\nworry about things like, for\n\n280\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.240\ninstance, being considered\nnegligent on our part.\n\n281\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.730\nChain of custody, again,\n\n282\n00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:05.570\nis all about the preservation and evidence\nhandling when it comes down to it.\n\n283\n00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.760\nNow, in data collection,\nyou do have something known, and\n\n284\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.780\nI know I'm kinda dragging this\none out here order of volatility.\n\n285\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.350\nWhen we look at the order of volatility,\nwhat we're talking about is\n\n286\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.310\nwhere is the data located that\nwe need to collect, all right.\n\n287\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:23.140\nIf you think about volatile memory\nlocations, that means that these locations\n\n288\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.770\nwhen the power is gone, the data that's\ncontained within is erased as well, right?\n\n289\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.140\nCaching systems, right?\n\n290\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.300\nI think the things like L1 cache,\nL2, L3 cache,\n\n291\n00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.060\nthink about your network\nadapters have a caching system,\n\n292\n00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.760\nthat's why we use things like ICMP, when\nthat buffer that cache starts to fill up.\n\n293\n00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.990\nRemember ICMP says hold on a second,\nI'm gonna start dropping data\n\n294\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.690\nif you don't start slowing\ndown your communications here.\n\n295\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.690\nWell, the information is how in that\nbuffer could be valuable information.\n\n296\n00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.840\nSo you look at the order\nof volatility here.\n\n297\n00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.423\nLook at how fast is\nthe data gonna disappear.\n\n298\n00:15:53.423 --> 00:15:56.230\nHow fast is that data just\ngonna be eradicated and\n\n299\n00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.564\nwe can't gain any access to it anymore.\n\n300\n00:15:58.564 --> 00:16:03.066\nSo again, you can see at the highest\npoint of this list here is cache, right?\n\n301\n00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.765\nUnder data are things like RAM, right?\n\n302\n00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:09.626\nCuz if I pull the power on a computer\nthat we're supposed to be collecting\n\n303\n00:16:09.626 --> 00:16:10.399\nevidence on.\n\n304\n00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:14.558\nAnd that's evidence inside of RAM, when I\npull the power because I'm gonna take that\n\n305\n00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:16.545\nstatement, just like that it's gone.\n\n306\n00:16:16.545 --> 00:16:17.449\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:18.938\n&gt;&gt; And now you've maybe corrupted your\n\n308\n00:16:18.938 --> 00:16:20.610\nwhole entire investigation process.\n\n309\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.204\nNow when you look at things like\nthe paging file, you might say well,\n\n310\n00:16:23.204 --> 00:16:24.335\nwait a second, paging file?\n\n311\n00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:27.329\nIf you know what the paging file is,\nif you don't let me go ahead and\n\n312\n00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:28.570\ntell you a second here.\n\n313\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.228\nNow RAM,\n\n314\n00:16:29.228 --> 00:16:34.670\npaging files are used in situations\nwhere you're running out of main memory.\n\n315\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.440\nAnd your applications still need that\nmemory, still need a portion of memory.\n\n316\n00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.440\nWell if you didn't have a paging\nsystem when you ran out of memory,\n\n317\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.030\nyou couldn't open up\nany other applications.\n\n318\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:48.070\nSo the paging file,\nwhat it does is it says hey,\n\n319\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.870\nwe can take portions of\nthat volatile information.\n\n320\n00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.160\nWe can write it to the hard drive and\n\n321\n00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.620\ntreat a portion of hard\ndrive like it is memory.\n\n322\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.540\nAnd it can swap it in and\nout of that physical memory.\n\n323\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.742\nThat's written to the hard drive,\nall right.\n\n324\n00:17:00.742 --> 00:17:04.631\nHowever you have to keep in mind\nwhen your computer reboots,\n\n325\n00:17:04.631 --> 00:17:07.236\nthat page file's cleared, all right.\n\n326\n00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:11.430\nNow it's not volatile memory but\nthe file itself is gonna be clear.\n\n327\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.620\nSo we also have to keep that in mind\nwhen we do things like reboots.\n\n328\n00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.780\nSo we have to worry about that too.\n\n329\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.060\nOther storage mediums,\nI put hard disk drives up here.\n\n330\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.410\nYou could say solid state drives too.\n\n331\n00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.764\nAgain because it's magnetic storage or\nelectronic storage.\n\n332\n00:17:25.764 --> 00:17:30.570\nBut it stays since it's not nonvolatile\nand the fact that while it's slowed access\n\n333\n00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.840\nif I pull the power on it I can still\ngain access to that information later.\n\n334\n00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.054\nThen you look at things like we've\nalready talked about logs and\n\n335\n00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:38.040\neven your archive, right.\n\n336\n00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.487\nWe've talked about archives back ups,\nright.\n\n337\n00:17:40.487 --> 00:17:42.130\nWe can back up information.\n\n338\n00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.252\nWe typically back up information, so\nyou can see things like CD's, DVD's,\n\n339\n00:17:46.252 --> 00:17:47.390\ntapes, right.\n\n340\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.390\nThat would be the lowest\norder of volatility, right.\n\n341\n00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.485\nCuz I'm not gonna lose\naccess to that information,\n\n342\n00:17:52.485 --> 00:17:56.250\nI just need to go wherever it's\nbeing stored, on-sight or off-sight.\n\n343\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.153\nGrab that information, and make sure\nthat I'm running captures screen,\n\n344\n00:17:59.153 --> 00:18:01.148\nnot screen captures,\nyou should do that anyways.\n\n345\n00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:02.946\nBut system images and checks and so\n\n346\n00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:07.200\non to make sure that it maintains its\nintegrity and doesn't get corrupted.\n\n347\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.550\n&gt;&gt; Well of course, we never wanna actually\nperform the analysis on the original\n\n348\n00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.310\nequipment that has been part\nof that particular crime.\n\n349\n00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.110\nThere's a process called\ndiscovery where both\n\n350\n00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.452\nparties of that litigation have to\npresent their evidence to each other.\n\n351\n00:18:22.452 --> 00:18:26.518\nSo they have time to review and kind of\ncreate their own rebuttals and so forth.\n\n352\n00:18:26.518 --> 00:18:30.146\nBut something also to keep in mind is\nwe're not talking about just the direct\n\n353\n00:18:30.146 --> 00:18:33.950\nmachines that where involved but\nalso your networking equipment.\n\n354\n00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.680\nWhen you're looking at certain\naccess logs and things like that.\n\n355\n00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.950\nIt can also be used as supplemental\nevidence or just as evidence in general.\n\n356\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.095\nI'm just the kind of strengthen\nyour case in that situation.\n\n357\n00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:47.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because if you look at\nwhat does a good attacker or\n\n358\n00:18:47.598 --> 00:18:49.250\ngood hacker trying to do?\n\n359\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.343\nThey try to cover their trails.\n\n360\n00:18:50.343 --> 00:18:51.143\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; That's one of\n\n361\n00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:53.427\nthe things on the way out of your\nnetwork that they're trying to do,\n\n362\n00:18:53.427 --> 00:18:54.920\nis they're trying to\nget rid of those logs.\n\n363\n00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.000\nBut even the most studious hacker\nsometimes leaves some kind of trace or\n\n364\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.580\nevidence, right?\n\n365\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.800\nIf we're doing tracing, then we\ncould probably get that information.\n\n366\n00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.960\nAnd that's why it's good to make sure\nthat you know where those logs are.\n\n367\n00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.990\nThe amount of logs,\n\n368\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.950\nthe type of information that you're\ngonna find within those logs.\n\n369\n00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.500\nNow I didn't mention chain of custody.\n\n370\n00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.930\nIf you've never seen this before,\nagain, just remember that it is\n\n371\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:22.140\nevidence is handled and\nit's passed through different departments.\n\n372\n00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.016\nAnd what we need to make sure is that as\nit's passed through different departments.\n\n373\n00:19:26.016 --> 00:19:30.650\nWe had each department head signing off\non it saying this is the way I found it.\n\n374\n00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.580\nIt hasn't changed and\n\n375\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.310\nI'm gonna pass it off to the next\nperson and they're gonna do the same.\n\n376\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.045\nIn fact, I went ahead and\nI did a little Google search here,\n\n377\n00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:39.913\nwhere you look at my computer and\nthis has a very good one here.\n\n378\n00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:43.161\nI'm gonna go ahead and download this real\nquick and hopefully it's not a virus or\n\n379\n00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:44.420\nthis will be a very short show.\n\n380\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.780\nBut it is the National Institute Institute\nfor Standards and Technology.\n\n381\n00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.010\nAnd they've got a really good\nsample here of this information.\n\n382\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.343\nSo if we open up our\nlittle Word document here.\n\n383\n00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:56.670\nAnd let me change that view here.\n\n384\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.890\nWhere is that?\n\n385\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.770\nYeah, one page, there we go.\n\n386\n00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.970\nMake it a little easier to see.\n\n387\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.440\nAnd you can kinda see\nAnywhere Police Department.\n\n388\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.480\nI don't know where that is,\nprobably anywhere, right.\n\n389\n00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.176\nBut you can see case number, what is\nthe offense, the submitting officer,\n\n390\n00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:11.697\nwho's the victim, suspect.\n\n391\n00:20:11.697 --> 00:20:14.170\nBut notice they have things like\ndescription of evidence and\n\n392\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.280\nthen we get into the chain of custody.\n\n393\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.590\nNotice the chain of custody.\n\n394\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.852\nItem numbers, date and time,\nreleased by, a signature and\n\n395\n00:20:21.852 --> 00:20:25.958\nidentifier, and\nthen who did I hand it off to, all right.\n\n396\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:30.128\nIf Cherokee hands me this information,\nshe's going to sign it first to say this\n\n397\n00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.446\nis the way the information\nwas when I had it.\n\n398\n00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:34.165\nI'm gonna sign off, date and time.\n\n399\n00:20:34.165 --> 00:20:39.409\nAnd when I hand it to you you're gonna\nsign that you took it into your custody as\n\n400\n00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:45.400\nit presents it's way through the overall\nchain on it's way into a court of law.\n\n401\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.706\n&gt;&gt; It is really important to keep track\nof every single that timeline and\n\n402\n00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.646\nevery hand that this evidence touches.\n\n403\n00:20:50.646 --> 00:20:53.980\nBut I know you watched,\nwhat was the name of that show?\n\n404\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.530\nBreaking Bad, that series.\n\n405\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.803\nYou remember that episode\nwhere- [CROSSTALK]\n\n406\n00:20:56.803 --> 00:20:57.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n407\n00:20:57.369 --> 00:21:01.290\n&gt;&gt; And Jessie gets the giant magnets\nto go ahead and destroy that evidence.\n\n408\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.600\nI mean certain things that\nare outside of our control.\n\n409\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.211\nBut as long you follow and\nlike you mentioned before,\n\n410\n00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:09.820\nyou exude some kind of due diligence but\nthat's we're looking for here.\n\n411\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, and one of those\ndocumentation that I was reading is.\n\n412\n00:21:14.814 --> 00:21:18.518\nIf you shut power to a machine,\ncuz you wanna gain,\n\n413\n00:21:18.518 --> 00:21:22.300\nor you just wanna take\nit into your custody.\n\n414\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.870\nWhat happens if a hacker's got\nsome kind of shut down script that\n\n415\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.450\ncompletely erases the drives?\n\n416\n00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.020\nAnd again that's why you have to be very\ncareful on how you collect this evidence\n\n417\n00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.910\nin documenting everything\nright to beginning to end.\n\n418\n00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.310\nAnd that's one of the most\nimportant things.\n\n419\n00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.590\nRather, they're all important, but\n\n420\n00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.300\nthis is definitely a very\nimportant part of the process.\n\n421\n00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.170\nSome of the last things that\nthey talk about, data transport.\n\n422\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.660\nI think that's kinda covered inside\nof things like chain of custody,\n\n423\n00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.730\nas it's being passed through\ndifferent departments.\n\n424\n00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.239\nRemember data transport, ultimately\nit's gonna end up in Court of law.\n\n425\n00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:58.400\nAnd we have to make sure that, they talk\nabout things like legal hold, all right.\n\n426\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.412\nWe have to be mindful of that, right.\n\n427\n00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:04.227\nBecause what can happen if you're\nnot following chain-of-custody,\n\n428\n00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:06.175\nyou can get things like data spoliation,\nright.\n\n429\n00:22:06.175 --> 00:22:09.507\nWe can get things like for instance\nthe destruction of the information.\n\n430\n00:22:09.507 --> 00:22:12.850\nAnd that means that when we\npresent it in the Court of Law,\n\n431\n00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.808\nthe defense attorney whoever it might be\nwill say that's a negligence on your part.\n\n432\n00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:21.560\nAnd it's a failure, you preserve the data,\nso then what happens?\n\n433\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.667\nIt's thrown out to court\nit's no longer evident,\n\n434\n00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:25.286\nit's just useless data at this point.\n\n435\n00:22:25.286 --> 00:22:28.840\nBecause the defense attorney can say, hey\nthat's, I don't know who you're talking\n\n436\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.020\nat, that's not the same data that was\non the computer when you brought it in.\n\n437\n00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.107\nThat's your information, you've\nmodified your, this is entrapment and\n\n438\n00:22:35.107 --> 00:22:36.223\nyou're putting it there.\n\n439\n00:22:36.223 --> 00:22:37.644\nAnd there's really no way for you to tell.\n\n440\n00:22:37.644 --> 00:22:39.970\nSo keep in mind legal hole first and\n\n441\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.877\nforemost about things like presenting or\npreservation of data itself.\n\n442\n00:22:44.877 --> 00:22:48.330\nAnd reducing that possibility\nof data spoliation.\n\n443\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.720\nNow I know that this are some of\nthe more fun topics sometimes but\n\n444\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.640\nkeep in mind that it is.\n\n445\n00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.943\nAnd you could be in a situation\nwhere maybe you're not heading\n\n446\n00:22:58.943 --> 00:23:02.196\nup the security team but\nmaybe you're an employee, right.\n\n447\n00:23:02.196 --> 00:23:06.106\nWell this is important for you to\nunderstand what could potentially go\n\n448\n00:23:06.106 --> 00:23:10.980\non if there is some kind of, again some\nkind of crime scene, cyber crime scene.\n\n449\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:11.890\nAnd maybe you're a part of it.\n\n450\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.860\nSo keep in mind these technologies.\n\n451\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.632\nKeep in mind they're not gonna ask you\nto be a forensic examiner inside of the,\n\n452\n00:23:17.632 --> 00:23:19.187\nthis test I wouldn't believe.\n\n453\n00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:22.620\nBut they're definitely gonna ask you\nthings like, what is the chain of custody?\n\n454\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.583\nAnd you need to know that as\na preservation of that data.\n\n455\n00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:29.121\nTo maintain it's integrity as it goes\nthrough different departments on its way\n\n456\n00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:30.810\nto being presented in a court of law.\n\n457\n00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.780\nSo that it can be\nconsidered valid evidence.\n\n458\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.565\nIt is very, very important that we keep\nthat information in its pristine state.\n\n459\n00:23:38.565 --> 00:23:40.720\nSo it doesn't get thrown\nout of the court of law.\n\n460\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.160\n&gt;&gt; That is so true, because if we look\nat even just the forensics report.\n\n461\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.526\nEverything that Wes was talking about.\n\n462\n00:23:45.526 --> 00:23:49.421\nAnd all those extreme precautions\nthat we wanna take take is so that,\n\n463\n00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:53.800\nthat forensics report can be submitted\nin the court of law to help us out here.\n\n464\n00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.159\nSo just remember be detailed,\nfollow your procedures, remain objective.\n\n465\n00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:01.000\nAnd I don't know,\ndo you have any other final thoughts Wes?\n\n466\n00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mentioned the after forensics\nreport, that is something very important.\n\n467\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.334\nI almost forgot about that,\n\n468\n00:24:05.334 --> 00:24:08.215\none is the fact that this really\nis kind of like a details.\n\n469\n00:24:08.215 --> 00:24:13.101\nThe chronological steps that are of\nthe data acquisition acquisition.\n\n470\n00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:17.141\nWhen analyzation is performed on them\nby the forensics examiner, usually\n\n471\n00:24:17.141 --> 00:24:21.800\na detailed documentation of the chain of\ncustody, again so we can verify that.\n\n472\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.120\nAnd then at the end, you might\nhave something like, for instance,\n\n473\n00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.353\nthe summary of the overall report.\n\n474\n00:24:25.353 --> 00:24:28.320\nThe summary of the results of\nyour forensics investigation.\n\n475\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.870\nSo definitely know not only about things\nlike your data transport and legal hole.\n\n476\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.830\nAlso know some of the components that you\nmight find inside of your forensic report.\n\n477\n00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.480\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, I think we at least\nhave a good idea as to where to start if\n\n478\n00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.260\nwe're going to be involved\nwith a particular incident.\n\n479\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.930\nBut thank you so much for\njoining us today, Wes.\n\n480\n00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:47.920\nAnd thank you ladies and\n\n481\n00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.670\ngentlemen, but stay tuned we do\nhave more net plus headed your way.\n\n482\n00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.740\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your show host.\n\n483\n00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:54.500\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n484\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.450\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n485\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.142\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here in ITProTV.\n\n486\n00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:05.101\n[MUSIC]\n\n487\n00:25:05.101 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:14.863\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network+ show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:16.860\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.740\nNow I'm gonna go out on a limb here and\nassume that you've had some\n\n6\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970\nkind of computer or computer related\nissue, network issue, in your past.\n\n7\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.550\nWell, just because networking is\none letter away from not working.\n\n8\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.110\nSo with us today,\nwe have Mr Wes Bryan in studios to cover,\n\n9\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.550\nwell, the network troubleshooting model.\n\n10\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.830\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.721\nIt's not a good day in the office\nwhen the network isn't working.\n\n13\n00:00:40.721 --> 00:00:42.095\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I got to tell you,\n\n14\n00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.690\nwhen the network is working you\ndon't ever hear anything about it.\n\n15\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.220\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; It's only when it stops working\n\n16\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.670\nthat of course you're\ngonna hear all about it.\n\n17\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.750\nI used to do commercial painting and one\nof the things I would say is that if you\n\n18\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.530\ndidn't notice the paint job\nthen I've done it right.\n\n19\n00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.758\nIt's when you notice it that I have to\ngo back and apparently fix something.\n\n20\n00:00:56.758 --> 00:01:00.350\nSo we're gonna look at network\ntroubleshooting in this episode,\n\n21\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.500\nand if you're coming over, let's say,\n\n22\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.470\nfrom A+, you've probably seen this\ntroubleshooting model before.\n\n23\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.640\nAnd I want to give you a heads-up.\n\n24\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.530\nIf you're going into\nthings like Security+, and\n\n25\n00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.590\neven on into Server+ as well.\n\n26\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.150\nYou're gonna see this troubleshooting\nmodel more then once.\n\n27\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.250\nSo one of the things that I like to tell\npeople is whether you're studying for A+,\n\n28\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310\ndoesn't matter if it's the first or\nsecond exam.\n\n29\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.890\nAnd you're studying for Net+,\nif you're studying for Security+,\n\n30\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.650\nor if you're studying for Server+,\nas well, know this troubleshooting model.\n\n31\n00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.420\nNow that's gonna help you\non the certification exam.\n\n32\n00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.020\nThis is a good troubleshooting model,\n\n33\n00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.170\nbut what troubleshooting\nmodel should you apply?\n\n34\n00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.050\nWell if you take it to\ncertification I would hope\n\n35\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.360\nyou'd apply network troubleshooting model.\n\n36\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.260\nBut let's just make sure that\nif you are going to apply or\n\n37\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.500\nyou're gonna be working in the industry\nthat you're applying some kind of\n\n38\n00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.620\nsystematic approach that really comes\ndown to just a few things, right?\n\n39\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.200\nThe detection of a problem, right?\n\n40\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.960\nThe diagnosis of the problem and\nthen the elimination, the remedy, right?\n\n41\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.520\nAnd then finally we always have to\nhave a fourth one in there that's\n\n42\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.490\ndocumentation as well.\n\n43\n00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.860\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes you mentioned about the,\nknowing about the troubleshooting model\n\n44\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.950\nfrom A+ but in A+ not everyone may have\nbeen familiar with the OSI model, so\n\n45\n00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.740\nnow it brings another level of experience\nto this troubleshooting process.\n\n46\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.650\n&gt;&gt; It sure does.\n\n47\n00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.506\nAnd that's kind of interesting that\nyou say that, because you're right,\n\n48\n00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.650\nin A+ we don't really care too\nmuch much about the OSI model.\n\n49\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.410\nAnd I'll give you another\ncomparison to that.\n\n50\n00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.090\nWhen you move into the Server+, they\nadd another small feature than Server+\n\n51\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.320\nthat you don't see here in Network+ and\nthat's called root cause analysis.\n\n52\n00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.970\nHowever, I would say that root cause\nanalysis is important no matter what\n\n53\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.870\ntroubleshooting model cuz we always say,\nyou gotta get to the root of the issue.\n\n54\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.730\nWell, when you're troubleshooting it\ndoesn't really matter what model you're\n\n55\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.130\napplying that's what you're trying to do.\n\n56\n00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.050\nSo it is interesting that you mentioned\nthe OSI model in the fact that if\n\n57\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.660\nyou are coming from A +, you're gonna see\na bit of padding here that wasn't here\n\n58\n00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.670\nwhen you took that exam and\nlearned that troubleshooting model.\n\n59\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.480\n&gt;&gt; So it's kind of funny when you mention\nfinding that root cause, because I\n\n60\n00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800\nhave been in situations where it wasn't\nas important to find the root cause, but\n\n61\n00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.330\nto get that person up and\nrunning, and then just put it, put\n\n62\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.970\nthat old computer in the IT department,\nand we'll find the problem later.\n\n63\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.837\nGive them another thin client, or so.\n\n64\n00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:13.347\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; And just keep them functional.\n\n65\n00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:14.193\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIn fact,\n\n66\n00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.045\nI've heard it before where it says,\nif it takes any more than five minutes,\n\n67\n00:03:17.045 --> 00:03:19.495\nit's time to just reinstall your\noperating system and move on.\n\n68\n00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:22.730\n[LAUGH] Unfortunately sometimes we can't\ndo that when they're production level\n\n69\n00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.970\nservers.\n\n70\n00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.720\nOr, for instance,\n\n71\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.460\nmaybe it's a network device like\na Cisco device that you're running.\n\n72\n00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.885\nI don't think Cisco says, yeah just wipe\nthe iOS out there and Install it but\n\n73\n00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:32.955\nwho knows?\n\n74\n00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:34.425\nMaybe you can apply that.\n\n75\n00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:37.355\nBut so let's go ahead and\nlet's look at this process.\n\n76\n00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:38.975\nNow there's quite a few\nsteps in here guys and\n\n77\n00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:41.525\nwhat we're gonna do is we're just gonna\nbreak them down individually here and\n\n78\n00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:43.055\nwe're gonna talk about each one.\n\n79\n00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:46.155\nAgain I want you to know before we even\nget started with the trouble shooting\n\n80\n00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:52.750\nmodel whatever situation you're attacking,\napply a systematic approach.\n\n81\n00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.810\nIf you're in an exam endeavor I\nwould hope that you apply CompTIA so\n\n82\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.520\nyou'll be successful on the exam but\nalso after you leave and\n\n83\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.100\nmaybe move on to additional\ncertifications or\n\n84\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.000\npursue your IT career make sure that you\nare applying a troubleshooting model.\n\n85\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.700\nAll right, so\nhere I got my screen here just\n\n86\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.530\nto diagram here it's never the most\nglorious stuff that we'll be doing, right?\n\n87\n00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.350\nWhen it comes to networking it's\nnice to diagnose problems, right?\n\n88\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.760\nUse utilities to fix them or grab our\ncable, our cable tester and stuff so\n\n89\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.440\nthis really is not the most glorious stuff\nbut it is definitely one of the most\n\n90\n00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.900\nimportant concepts you can learn inside\nof your Network+ certification endeavors.\n\n91\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.660\nIn fact so I call these a, what is it?\n\n92\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.630\nOne, two, three, four, five, six,\n\n93\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.140\nseven, eight I was gonna say seven by\nI'd be off by one, eight step model.\n\n94\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.670\nAnd you can see that every, we start\nwith identification of the problem,\n\n95\n00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.630\nmoving all the way down to documentation.\n\n96\n00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.460\nSo let's go ahead and what will do is\nwe'll just take these one at a time.\n\n97\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.660\nThe very first one here that we\ntalk About is identification of\n\n98\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.670\nthe problem, all right?\n\n99\n00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.900\nSo even though this is Net+'s\ntroubleshooting model,\n\n100\n00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.710\nkeep in mind,\nwe have to know what the problem might be\n\n101\n00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.780\nbefore we can even dive\ninto the next steps.\n\n102\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.810\n&gt;&gt; So Wes if we get like a ticket\nfrom a ticketing system would\n\n103\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.710\nthat kind of just fall right here under\nthat category because that's our end\n\n104\n00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.880\nuser stating that there\nis in fact a problem?\n\n105\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it absolutely can.\n\n106\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.810\nIt could be something the users like\nto bypass the ticketing system,\n\n107\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.940\nso it could be somebody sitting\nthere yelling in your ear.\n\n108\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.540\nExactly.\n\n109\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.360\nYelling in your ear\nthat something's wrong.\n\n110\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.190\nBut yes,\nabsolutely the ticketing system could be.\n\n111\n00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.410\nThat could be your first avenue of\nidentifying that a problem come in.\n\n112\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.470\nNow let's step back just\na little bit more and\n\n113\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.960\nlet's say how did the person that wrote\nthat ticket find out the problem, right?\n\n114\n00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.090\nI've got a ticket, somebody must\nhave done hopefully a few steps.\n\n115\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.160\nThey didn't say Internet's slow and\npass it over to me.\n\n116\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.430\nWell, I can't fix the Internet,\nso let's see.\n\n117\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.399\n&gt;&gt; Do I have 100 browsers open?\n\n118\n00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.040\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And that's right.\n\n119\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.730\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll talk about the very first one.\n\n120\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.230\nWhen they talk about the identification of\nthe problem, they talk about things like,\n\n121\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.430\nfor instance,\ngathering of information, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.240\nOne of the things I want you to keep in\nmind is that where are your information\n\n123\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.400\nsources?\n\n124\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.250\nThere isn't really,\nwithin this first step,\n\n125\n00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.390\nthere isn't a right or wrong way on how or\nwhere you gather that information from,\n\n126\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.720\nlike for you'll see for\ninstance questioning the users.\n\n127\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.280\nNow if you're coming from A+, you might\nhave heard that questioning the users.\n\n128\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.550\nAll right, well maybe you're\njust starting out in Net+ so\n\n129\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.660\nlet's talk a little bit about that.\n\n130\n00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.110\nWhen I'm questioning the users, how can I\ngather information from them in the most\n\n131\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.100\neffective manner possible, if you will.\n\n132\n00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.840\nOne of the best ways you can do that\nis to ask open ended questions.\n\n133\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.000\nI don't wanna ask yes and no statements.\n\n134\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.390\nIf I ask those yes and no statements\nstatements and if I say something for\n\n135\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.690\ninstance like Cherokee\nis your computer on?\n\n136\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n137\n00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.795\n&gt;&gt; Yes right.\n\n138\n00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:49.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The only answer is yes or no right?\n\n139\n00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.240\nThat doesn't really help me\ngather additional information so\n\n140\n00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.120\none of the things that we need to remember\nis that when we are asking questions of\n\n141\n00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.950\nour users that we ask them\nopen ended questions, right?\n\n142\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.050\nSee the simple fact of the matter\nis people want to be heard, right?\n\n143\n00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.630\nSo ask them questions that give them\n\n144\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.310\nthe ability to tell you a little\nbit about what the problem is.\n\n145\n00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.130\n&gt;&gt; All right and\njust I guess it also depends.\n\n146\n00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.950\nWes, have you ever had an end user\nwhere they just kind of keep going\n\n147\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.630\nabout irrelevant things and\nyou kind of have to just use\n\n148\n00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.720\nthese close-ended questions to really get\ndown and drill down to the actual problem.\n\n149\n00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.450\nEspecially if you're working for\na call center and you've got several calls\n\n150\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.020\nwaiting in queue and-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say I've never actually\n\n151\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.730\nthought about it that way but I know I've\ndone it many time [LAUGH] so now I'm being\n\n152\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.700\ntaught about what I was already doing but\nthat's right, you're like yeah okay.\n\n153\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.130\nSally really, we really don't need to\nknow about the cat, yeah the cat's great.\n\n154\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.420\nThe cat's probably still in the house,\n\n155\n00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.150\ndon't worry about the door being open,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n156\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Or the fact\n\n157\n00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.440\nthat you spilled coffee on\nyourself before you got here.\n\n158\n00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.152\nSo, that's one of the ways that\nwe can gather information.\n\n159\n00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:51.957\nAgain, it's just\nquestioning your end users,\n\n160\n00:07:51.957 --> 00:07:54.167\nmaking sure you're asking\nopen ended questions, right?\n\n161\n00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:59.837\nWe wanna say, when you got to your\ncomputer, what was it that you're seeing.\n\n162\n00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:04.430\nThat made you call in a support ticket,\nright?\n\n163\n00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.850\nSo we can ask multiple questions as well.\n\n164\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.590\nThe other thing that we also want to do\ntoo is to duplicate the problem if we can.\n\n165\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.860\nAnd one of the things that is\nreally easy is, for instance,\n\n166\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.030\nlet me give you an example.\n\n167\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.120\nLet me step back for a second here.\n\n168\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.550\nIf I have an end user that's having\na problem, if I can recreate the problem,\n\n169\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.740\nit helps me to establish\nthe scope of the problem.\n\n170\n00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.880\nIf somebody can't access the Internet,\n\n171\n00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.370\nis it one person that\ncan't access the Internet?\n\n172\n00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.720\nCuz if it's one person,\n\n173\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.460\nthat might be something telling me\nsomething's wrong on a specific computer.\n\n174\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.870\nHowever, if we got maybe an entire group\nof people that can't access the Internet,\n\n175\n00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.900\nis it an ACL?\n\n176\n00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.530\nMaybe I've got an entire subnet.\n\n177\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.980\nI've got something configured wrong.\n\n178\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.990\nDid I misconfigure For instance a DHCP\n\n179\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.940\nleasing out a gateway, gave the wrong\naddress now people can't connect.\n\n180\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.780\nSo we've also got to kinda\nestablish the scope and\n\n181\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.040\nthat's one of the things that gathering\nthe information can do for us.\n\n182\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.520\n&gt;&gt; Well you mentioned a really\ngood point there Wes because not\n\n183\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.350\neveryone is gonna have the same\nskill set that you have.\n\n184\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.530\nSo if you're talking to a layperson and\nyou mentioned\n\n185\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.840\ntry to have them articulate the problem\nto you, they may not be able to.\n\n186\n00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.020\nSo asking them to replicate the problem\nis a really good tip you have.\n\n187\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.670\n&gt;&gt; It is, and now that you\nmention it another thing to avoid\n\n188\n00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.740\nwhen your asking your end users questions.\n\n189\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.864\nJargon, right, that's a-\n&gt;&gt; Right!\n\n190\n00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:25.590\n&gt;&gt; That's a great point.\n\n191\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.926\nYou guys that are following along with\nus throughout these series in Net+,\n\n192\n00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:33.260\nyou guys know that we're\nhitting you with alphabet soup.\n\n193\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.280\nI mean information overload, acronym city.\n\n194\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.060\nAnd if you've got to think about it it\ndoesn't really translate well unless you\n\n195\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.100\ngot a Google browser open at\nthe time that we're talking.\n\n196\n00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.120\nYou're learning a different\nlanguage right?\n\n197\n00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.530\nWell that language doesn't always\n\n198\n00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.660\ntranslate over into\nthe end user experience.\n\n199\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah sometimes it comes off a little\ncontrived or a little egotistical.\n\n200\n00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.170\nAnd we don't want to come across, at least\nI don't want to come across that way.\n\n201\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly because if you come\nin as a pretentious help desk person\n\n202\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.670\npeople end up closing down and you're\nnot really gonna get get information and\n\n203\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.660\nit's gonna end up becoming more\nof a hassle than anything.\n\n204\n00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.340\nHere's the big one that I like\nto talk about as well and\n\n205\n00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.070\nthat's the identification of symptoms.\n\n206\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.950\nNow when we talk about symptoms keep in\nmind that what we're talking about is\n\n207\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.380\naddressing a problem, right?\n\n208\n00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.330\nBut we've gotta make sure that when\nwe identify symptoms we understand\n\n209\n00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.350\nthe difference between a symptom and\nwhat is the cause of the symptom, right?\n\n210\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.050\nFor instance, I can't connect to\nan application on our internal network,\n\n211\n00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.030\nsome web application.\n\n212\n00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.170\nThere's the firewall blocking it.\n\n213\n00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.860\nOkay, Well turn off the firewall.\n\n214\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.730\nDid that fix it?\n\n215\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.410\nOkay.\nWhen you turned off the firewall,\n\n216\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.080\nthat fixed the symptom, but\nthat didn't fix the problem.\n\n217\n00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.470\nMaybe all it needed was a simple entry in\nan ACL that would fix the problem itself.\n\n218\n00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.720\nIt was blocking that\noutbound communication.\n\n219\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.550\nBut what you did was you\ntreated the symptom.\n\n220\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.980\nKeep that in mind as well.\n\n221\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.950\nFor instance, our connection is slow.\n\n222\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.240\nThat's a symptom that doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's the cause.\n\n223\n00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.360\nCould it be bandwidth consumption.\n\n224\n00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.530\nCould we be working in peak hours where\n\n225\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.900\nthat's gonna be something that\nwe have to deal with, right.\n\n226\n00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.990\nAgain that is the the symptom,\nthat is not the cause.\n\n227\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.060\nThe other thing to keep in mind\ntoo is things like malware.\n\n228\n00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.490\nMalware can cause a connection to be slow,\nmalware could be the cause but\n\n229\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.170\nagain the connection being\nslow is the symptom.\n\n230\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.970\nCould be operating system issues, right.\n\n231\n00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.400\nIf an operating system is having all kinds\nof problems, it could be perceived by\n\n232\n00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.790\nthe end-user that it's acting really\nslow when the network is just fine.\n\n233\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.650\nSo again, remember to identify symptoms\nbecause the symptoms can point you back,\n\n234\n00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.800\nkinda like all roads lead to Rome.\n\n235\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.830\nEventually leading you back into\nthe whatever the cause might be.\n\n236\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.760\n&gt;&gt; And I think,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong here but\n\n237\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.430\nI don't know if you've ever had\nsomeone try to throw multiple symptoms\n\n238\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.937\nunrelated actually while\nyou're already there.\n\n239\n00:11:47.937 --> 00:11:49.460\nThey're like hey,\nWes is here I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n240\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.540\npick his brain, but\nfrom a CompTIA standpoint and so\n\n241\n00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.890\nyou know for the exam they really\njust want you to focus and\n\n242\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.160\non one particular issue at a time separate\nticket for a separate issue right?\n\n243\n00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.720\n&gt;&gt; Definitely because you\nguys might see this at times,\n\n244\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.170\nthat you're gonna be wearing more than\none hat in your networking careers.\n\n245\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.580\nAnd again, when you have\nsomebody that's in the know and\n\n246\n00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.950\nthey're right there just like\nCherokee said, they're in the spot.\n\n247\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:14.150\nThey're like, well, let me go ahead and\nlet me show you this.\n\n248\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.870\nYou know what?\n\n249\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.380\nMy webcam, it's been kicking out on me or\nturning off and it's like, no, no, no.\n\n250\n00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.720\nI'm here to address the issue.\n\n251\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.140\nLike Cherokee said,\nyou can always call and complain.\n\n252\n00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.960\nNo, don't do that.\n\n253\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.510\nYou could always open another ticket.\n\n254\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.810\n&gt;&gt; They usually have a triage or some\nsort of algorithm that'll prioritize or\n\n255\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.490\nmaybe it's not even you that's\nprioritizing and it's your manager,\n\n256\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.020\nyour IT manager, someone else\nthat's making that judgement call.\n\n257\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.030\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n258\n00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.450\nLet me give you another example\ntoo of a symptom, right.\n\n259\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.800\nI can't access a resource,\nwhatever the resource is.\n\n260\n00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.850\nMaybe it's a file server that we have and\nup there on that file server,\n\n261\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:50.210\nwe got shared out different resources,\nwell that's a symptom.\n\n262\n00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.950\nI can't access the resource.\n\n263\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.290\nWell you say, no, no,\nno, that's the problem.\n\n264\n00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.790\nWell it's The problem but\nit's not the cause.\n\n265\n00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.030\nAgain, things like user name and\npassword, it's very easy.\n\n266\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.460\nI don't know how many times a day\nI fact figure the keyboard and\n\n267\n00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.810\ncan't even log into my own laptop, right?\n\n268\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.840\nSo user name and\npassword if you're not entering those,\n\n269\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.180\nthose could be the cause that's\nleading to the symptom, right?\n\n270\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.340\nThings like the LDAP server,\n\n271\n00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.830\nthe directory server that does\nthe authentication on our network.\n\n272\n00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.440\nI can't communicate with it or\nit's offline.\n\n273\n00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.140\nThat'll cause a resource access problem,\nagain causing what the symptom is.\n\n274\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.200\nHow about the FTP server?\n\n275\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.240\nMaybe it's offline, right?\n\n276\n00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.720\nAgain, making sure that we\nidentify the symptom and\n\n277\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.710\nthen that'll lead us ultimately\nback to what the cause is.\n\n278\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.800\nNow there's another thing that we\nalso have to do too, all right and\n\n279\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.750\nthat is determining if\nanything has changed, right.\n\n280\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.240\nChanges can happen.\n\n281\n00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.465\nSome of the smallest changes can\ncause some of the biggest problems.\n\n282\n00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:46.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Literally really quick.\n\n283\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.000\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying not to laugh right here but\nyes.\n\n284\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.808\nAll the time even this weekend.\n\n285\n00:13:50.808 --> 00:13:56.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so for instance,\nright, it could be unintentional.\n\n286\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.370\nIt could be a user just trying to help.\n\n287\n00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.100\nAnd well, it didn't really help.\n\n288\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.720\nIt could be intentional, right?\n\n289\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.240\nPeople that bypassed change management,\nright?\n\n290\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.980\nCheck change management logs.\n\n291\n00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.080\nHas a change been submitted\nthat maybe wasn't approved and\n\n292\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.630\nsomebody decided,\nit's just a flip of a switch.\n\n293\n00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.820\nWell, these could be enterprise level\ncompanies and most likely will be and\n\n294\n00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.620\nyou don't just change things because\nyou felt like changing them.\n\n295\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.690\nUsually, you'll have some kind of\nchange management process where you\n\n296\n00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.340\nsubmit a change to a change advisory\nboard, the advisory board reviews it,\n\n297\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.650\ntries to understand what the purpose\nis and what this is gonna do.\n\n298\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.480\nAfter the review process,\nthey approve it, then you test it,\n\n299\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.350\nthen you implement it, and\nthen you document it, right?\n\n300\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.860\nSo you could check things like your\nchange management documentation as well.\n\n301\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.560\nAnd again, these are all intentional.\n\n302\n00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.030\nPatch management, right?\n\n303\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.010\nDid somebody accidentally turn automatic\nupdating on on one of our servers?\n\n304\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.560\nWhen we have a WSUS server\nin the background or\n\n305\n00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.950\nwe have an administrative staff that that\nis their job to oversee patch management.\n\n306\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.800\nAnd to apply them in an offline\nnon-production environment and only then\n\n307\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.780\nuntil we've reviewed them do they get\napplied to our production systems.\n\n308\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.390\nAnd somebody just flipped the switch.\n\n309\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.210\nYour patches are out, you're out of date.\n\n310\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.640\nWell, I'll help you out.\n\n311\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.910\nI'll turn them on for\n\n312\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.880\nyou, not realizing that maybe there was an\nupdate that was already reviewed, right?\n\n313\n00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.965\nAnd we said no, you'd better keep that out\nof our systems because because it'll break\n\n314\n00:15:20.965 --> 00:15:22.915\nor cause problems with\nanother application.\n\n315\n00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:24.245\nSo again-\n&gt;&gt; Another thing is\n\n316\n00:15:25.545 --> 00:15:29.215\neven if it was a textbook situation,\nand you're a developer and\n\n317\n00:15:29.215 --> 00:15:32.995\nyou've tested in multiple environments,\nmultiple platforms, interactive and\n\n318\n00:15:32.995 --> 00:15:37.405\ndifferent software, there may always be\nthat one particular environment that that\n\n319\n00:15:37.405 --> 00:15:39.235\npiece of software hasn't seen before.\n\n320\n00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:42.339\nSo being able to foresee all of that,\nit's not always gonna happen,\n\n321\n00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:45.708\nand sometimes you are even though you\nhave a great, well thought out plan,\n\n322\n00:15:45.708 --> 00:15:47.870\nyou've gone through all\nthe change document.\n\n323\n00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.558\nThere might be situations where you\nencounter that, and so it is what it is.\n\n324\n00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:52.262\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n325\n00:15:52.262 --> 00:15:55.211\nAdditional things we\nhave to worry about is,\n\n326\n00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:59.022\nMaking sure we approach it\nfrom multiple vantage points.\n\n327\n00:15:59.022 --> 00:16:01.520\nI already gave you some examples, right?\n\n328\n00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.581\nFor instance, going back to some\nof the examples I wrote down here,\n\n329\n00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:06.430\nI write connection is slow.\n\n330\n00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.940\nAll right, that's the symptom, but\n\n331\n00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.300\nwe're gonna try to approach it\nfrom multiple avenues, right.\n\n332\n00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.680\nAgain, that's why I say,\nall roads lead to Rome.\n\n333\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.540\nOne road is going to be lead you\nback to actually what the cause is.\n\n334\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.120\nBut if you apply it to\nmultiple different avenues,\n\n335\n00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.240\nyou can attack these ones individually.\n\n336\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.650\nAgain, is it a bandwidth consumption?\n\n337\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:26.310\nIs it malware?\n\n338\n00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.260\nIs it an OS issue,\nsomebody turned off the firewall.\n\n339\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.210\nDid somebody disable\ntheir antivirus software?\n\n340\n00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.330\nDid somebody disable the update\nto their antivirus software?\n\n341\n00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.630\nAgain, multiple approaches individually.\n\n342\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.780\nThings like, and again, gathering\ninformation, documentation and logs,\n\n343\n00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:47.595\nis something that we also\nhave to keep in mind as well.\n\n344\n00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:51.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, if we get five calls\nwithin one week from Sally, and\n\n345\n00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.900\nshe keeps forgetting her password,\nthen she calls up, and\n\n346\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.130\nlike Wes you had mentioned,\nthe Internet's broken.\n\n347\n00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.370\nSally says she can't get online.\n\n348\n00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.620\nBut then you're looking at\nyour documentation, and\n\n349\n00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.670\nyou're like hey Sally, let's check and\nsee if the Caps Lock button is on.\n\n350\n00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.800\nYou know what I mean?\n\n351\n00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.620\nBefore you start getting stressed out\nabout some of the, you know worrying about\n\n352\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.850\nif your DHCP server is down or\nsome kind of internet connection so.\n\n353\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:18.090\n&gt;&gt; I might end up checking on our security\npolicy after that if Sally's been\n\n354\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.450\nforgetting her password all week and\n\n355\n00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.470\nall of a sudden she doesn't\nforget her password anymore.\n\n356\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.850\nI might be checking her cubicle for that\nshe wrote it down on the most secure place\n\n357\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.780\nin the world to put a password, right,\nPost-it note on the side of the monitor.\n\n358\n00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.830\nSo that is some of the things that we have\nto do inside of identifying the problem.\n\n359\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.940\nNow the next one that we have here is, the\nsecond step that they talk about here on\n\n360\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.190\nmy screen here is establishing\na theory of probable cause.\n\n361\n00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.950\nWell, what is one way we can do this?\n\n362\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.610\nOne of the easiest ways,\nquestion the obvious.\n\n363\n00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.290\nCherokee gave you a good example,\ncan't log in.\n\n364\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.200\nIs your Caps Lock on?\n\n365\n00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.430\nQuestion the obvious.\n\n366\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.270\nSimple fixes first, right?\n\n367\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.100\nWe might wanna think we\nhave to reinvent the wheel.\n\n368\n00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.200\nWe wanna have to take\nwind calculations and\n\n369\n00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.660\nastronomical alignments, when it was\nreally nothing more than a cable that was\n\n370\n00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.240\nkicked out of the back of the computer\nbecause somebody was stretching, right?\n\n371\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.360\nSo again, simple fixes first,\nalways question the obvious.\n\n372\n00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.460\nAnd I cannot stress enough\nconsider multiple approaches.\n\n373\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.160\nThe other thing to keep in mind\nis that is there a common element\n\n374\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.230\nthat's causing multiple problems?\n\n375\n00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.900\nFor those of you that may be in A+,\nmaybe computer technicians,\n\n376\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.100\nthink about memory problems, right?\n\n377\n00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.179\nThat could cause a myriad of issues.\n\n378\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.570\nIt's only a single like component\nthat's causing the problem.\n\n379\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.300\nBut do keep that in mind\nthat you could have\n\n380\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.590\none common element that's\ncausing multiple issues.\n\n381\n00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.620\nI'll give you an example,\na Directory server.\n\n382\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.210\nDirectory server not only authenticates\nme to getting into the domain,\n\n383\n00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.090\nbut it also allows me access\nto different resources.\n\n384\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.150\nAll right, it also provides,\nat some point, like for instance,\n\n385\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.190\nActive Directory inside\nof the Microsoft world.\n\n386\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.770\nIt could provide DNS and\nDHCP on the same server.\n\n387\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.680\nSo right, if we talk about, for\ninstance, a common element,\n\n388\n00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.150\nif that server is offline,\nI don't have DNS.\n\n389\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.160\nProvided in a larger environment, we\nprobably have multiple domain controllers.\n\n390\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.140\nBut just my domain controller being\noffline can cause authentication issues,\n\n391\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.960\nname resolution issues, you know.\n\n392\n00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.250\nSo again, just multiple multiple problems.\n\n393\n00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.070\nAll right,\nnow the next one's kind of interesting.\n\n394\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.830\nWhen we look at this one, this one is\nwhere we start to go back to our theory.\n\n395\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.630\nAnd this was one that Cherokee mentioned\nright at the beginning of the episode.\n\n396\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:37.460\nAnd this is different than, all of\nthe other CompTIA based troubleshooting\n\n397\n00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.510\nmodels, right, and this is talking\nabout the OSI model more specifically.\n\n398\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.790\nIn fact, I kind of left that out.\n\n399\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.440\nLet me go ahead and just finish my\nslide here and quit being lazy.\n\n400\n00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.110\nHere we go, OSI model right, is do we\nuse a top to bottom, bottom to top?\n\n401\n00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.270\nAll right, we'll talk about those\nfirst two and then we'll come back and\n\n402\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.030\ntalk about this confusing third\none here in a second, right.\n\n403\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.016\nWell I want you to think\nabout the OSI model.\n\n404\n00:20:00.016 --> 00:20:03.610\nRemember in other episodes, some of\nthe things that we mentioned were don't\n\n405\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.460\nforget this OSI model\nafter you pass an exam.\n\n406\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.490\nMost people think well it's just theory,\n\n407\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.540\nonce I know the theory I'm good,\nforget it, right?\n\n408\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.610\nThrow the books and notes in the dumpster\nand move on to the next certification.\n\n409\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.770\nThat is a very very bad mindset to\nhave when it comes to the OSI model.\n\n410\n00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.660\nWhy, because it tells us where\nwe should start looking.\n\n411\n00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.950\nIf I think I have a DNS issue,\nwhere does that start?\n\n412\n00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.150\nWell that's a top to bottom, right,\ncuz that's an application layer protocol.\n\n413\n00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:36.180\nIf I think that I have a communication\nissue that's via protocol SMTP or\n\n414\n00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.970\nPOP3 or IMAP, right, FTP,\nall of those are application issues.\n\n415\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.720\nSo if I'm gonna start,\nI'm gonna work with the OSI model, and\n\n416\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.370\nI'm gonna start working top to bottom.\n\n417\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.610\nHowever, remember we told\nyou simple fixes first.\n\n418\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.500\nSimple fixes usually start\nat the physical layer.\n\n419\n00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.005\nNot always, not always, but\na lot of times they do.\n\n420\n00:20:53.005 --> 00:20:57.330\nWhy, because simple fixes or\nthe physical environment,\n\n421\n00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.880\nthis can usually happen just\nfrom damaged components, right,\n\n422\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:06.520\nversus a misconfiguration of an IP\naddress or a subnet mask, right.\n\n423\n00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, how long does it take\nto check those things, Wes?\n\n424\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.781\n&gt;&gt; Well, that really depends\non the technician, I guess.\n\n425\n00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:12.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can config.\n\n426\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.769\nI mean, those are really quick tools that\nyou have and try to ping your loopback\n\n427\n00:21:16.769 --> 00:21:20.230\naddress, try to ping someone else on your\nsubnet, try to ping an external address.\n\n428\n00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.780\nThose can happen relatively fast, so\n\n429\n00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.280\nyou're kinda just like checking\nthem off your list real quick.\n\n430\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.870\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, link status,\nyou look at the network adapter.\n\n431\n00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou don't even have to do anything.\n\n432\n00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Is it blinking?\n\n433\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.645\nI wanna see highly\ntechnical exam prep here.\n\n434\n00:21:32.645 --> 00:21:35.710\nBlinkety-blinkety-blinky, it's not,\nit's broke.\n\n435\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.650\nNo, just kidding.\n\n436\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:38.290\nWe know that it's at\nthe data link layer right,\n\n437\n00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.170\ncuz that's where the network\nadapter is sitting, right.\n\n438\n00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.970\nIf my cable modem isn't working,\nif my dial up modem isn't working, right,\n\n439\n00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.460\nand I did say dial up modem, I went there.\n\n440\n00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.750\nWell then I know that's probably gonna\nbe somewhere between that physical and\n\n441\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.810\nthe second layer right over\nthe OSI model cuz that's where\n\n442\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.370\nthey sit at the second layer.\n\n443\n00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.110\nBut I've got physical\nconnections running into them.\n\n444\n00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.070\nSo again, you can see the top to bottom or\nbottom to top right?\n\n445\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.035\nIn fact one of our other\nshow hosts Ronnie,\n\n446\n00:22:05.035 --> 00:22:08.590\nyou've maybe have seen him in some\nof the other episodes that we have.\n\n447\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.190\nIt's the first thing he asked me,\nhe said where did you start?\n\n448\n00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.090\nNow, what do you mean, he said did\nyou start at the physical layer?\n\n449\n00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.070\nSo we do use this.\n\n450\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:21.570\nNow the last one, when they talk about the\nOSI model, is this third one in the line.\n\n451\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.460\nThis one's that divide and conquer.\n\n452\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.220\nAnd I was kinda joking around with\nCherokee before we started here.\n\n453\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.980\nDivide and\nconquer in the networking protocol stack.\n\n454\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.460\nIt's not Sparta, but\n\n455\n00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.520\nwhen we say divide and conquer--\n&gt;&gt; It may feel like it if you've been\n\n456\n00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.850\nbanging your head against the wall\ntrying to solve a problem.\n\n457\n00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I didn't think about\nit that way, that's right.\n\n458\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.330\nWell this could be exactly,\ndid you notice what Cherokee said?\n\n459\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.790\nRun an IP config, or run a ping.\n\n460\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.770\nWell, is that starting at the physical\nlayer or is that starting at the top?\n\n461\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.880\nNeither, right in the middle,\ndivide and conquer, right.\n\n462\n00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.940\nI need to test the things\nthat are doing IP routing.\n\n463\n00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.130\nThat's the network stack,\nright, IP config,\n\n464\n00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.990\npinging another device\non our network by IP.\n\n465\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.040\nTesting things like name resolution,\n\n466\n00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.320\nright, moving on there and\nmoving up to the OSI model, back up to.\n\n467\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.940\nEventually what we'll get to maybe you\nfind out when you do your divide and\n\n468\n00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.850\nconquer, that it wasn't layer\none through seven at all.\n\n469\n00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.540\nMaybe it was the hidden layer eight,\nright,\n\n470\n00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.880\nthe user that interacts was layer seven.\n\n471\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.100\nSo joking aside,\nwe do have to keep that in mind.\n\n472\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.060\nAs we move down this list\nthe next thing that we have is,\n\n473\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.550\ntesting a theory to determine the cause.\n\n474\n00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.400\nAgain, testing the theory,\na couple of things on this one.\n\n475\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.300\nIf you're testing the theory\nonce the theory is confirmed,\n\n476\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.060\ndetermine what the next steps are so\nthat you can resolve the problem.\n\n477\n00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.940\nThe other one might be that if\nthe theory is not confirmed,\n\n478\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.770\nreestablish a new theory or escalate.\n\n479\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.940\nNow what do we mean by that?\n\n480\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.598\nWell we mean that you might be\ngoing back to the drawing board.\n\n481\n00:23:48.598 --> 00:23:51.465\nYou've heard the term go back\nto the drawing board, and\n\n482\n00:23:51.465 --> 00:23:54.759\nyes we might be banging our heads\non the desk by the end of the day,\n\n483\n00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:57.140\nbecause we get to this\nlevel We've tested it.\n\n484\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.720\nIt didn't work so\nwe gotta go back up a step or two.\n\n485\n00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.650\nAll right, what's escalation about?\n\n486\n00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.940\nWhat does that mean?\n\n487\n00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.454\nWell, if I'm trying to figure\nout a server problem and\n\n488\n00:24:06.454 --> 00:24:09.313\nwhy the server is having this issue and\nI can't figure it out.\n\n489\n00:24:09.313 --> 00:24:10.517\nMaybe I need to call on Cherokee.\n\n490\n00:24:10.517 --> 00:24:13.026\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I need to escalate it to somebody\n\n491\n00:24:13.026 --> 00:24:16.755\nthat's got the experience in\nwhatever the technology is.\n\n492\n00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:17.760\nIn this case I use server,\n\n493\n00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.019\nbecause I know Cherokee has\na lot of experience in server.\n\n494\n00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:22.925\nI'm going to say Cherokee,\nI can't do it, I don't have the skills,\n\n495\n00:24:22.925 --> 00:24:24.076\ncan you take a look at this?\n\n496\n00:24:24.076 --> 00:24:26.750\nSo escalation is not a bad thing.\n\n497\n00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.360\nAll right, you are responsible for\nwhat you say you know.\n\n498\n00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.695\nYou say, what do you mean?\n\n499\n00:24:31.695 --> 00:24:34.570\nWell, did you say, I know how to\nfix that server when you didn't?\n\n500\n00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.115\nWell now you're responsible for\nwhat you said you are.\n\n501\n00:24:37.115 --> 00:24:39.914\nBut it's more responsible if you say,\nyou know what?\n\n502\n00:24:39.914 --> 00:24:40.779\nI'm not sure.\n\n503\n00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.869\nThere's a reason we have\nupper level tiers, right?\n\n504\n00:24:43.869 --> 00:24:46.425\nThat's why we have a multi-tiered\nhelpdesk type system.\n\n505\n00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:50.700\nSo that if you don't have the experience,\nyou can escalate it to somebody that does.\n\n506\n00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.545\n&gt;&gt; It really is great to\nhave a dial a friend.\n\n507\n00:24:52.545 --> 00:24:57.328\nAnd also I've been in situations\nwhere it was a particular issue.\n\n508\n00:24:57.328 --> 00:25:01.883\nThat not even the developer for the piece\nfor the mail server had even seen before.\n\n509\n00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:04.676\n[LAUGH] So how would I know\nhow to fix the problem for\n\n510\n00:25:04.676 --> 00:25:06.666\nthe coding that they had created?\n\n511\n00:25:06.666 --> 00:25:09.318\nI'm not at that level, so\nwe get on the phone with the developer.\n\n512\n00:25:09.318 --> 00:25:11.280\nGo ahead and create a ticket with them.\n\n513\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.553\nAnd you might not solve the issue\non the first go around.\n\n514\n00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:17.510\nSo save that person's direct information.\n\n515\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.669\nSo you're saving time when you have\nto get back on the phone with them.\n\n516\n00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:21.430\nTo let them know, look,\nthis didn't work or whatever.\n\n517\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.518\nI don't know what kind of support you\nhave, depending on your service contract.\n\n518\n00:25:24.518 --> 00:25:26.822\nSo things of that nature, but-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n519\n00:25:26.822 --> 00:25:27.963\nAnd the other thing, too,\n\n520\n00:25:27.963 --> 00:25:31.025\nis don't think that you might\njust have to escalate it up.\n\n521\n00:25:31.025 --> 00:25:32.785\nYou might have to escalate out.\n\n522\n00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:34.185\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n523\n00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:35.415\nWell, I'll give you an example.\n\n524\n00:25:35.415 --> 00:25:36.595\nOne of the other show hosts and\n\n525\n00:25:36.595 --> 00:25:41.795\nI used to work at another company and\nwe had a printer issue.\n\n526\n00:25:41.795 --> 00:25:45.275\nAnd this printer issue, my gosh,\ntalk about, I don't know,\n\n527\n00:25:45.275 --> 00:25:47.320\nthe ghost in the darkness or something.\n\n528\n00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.190\nIt would join a directory, and\nthen you'd go to print, and\n\n529\n00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.310\nyou'd lose it of the directory.\n\n530\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.810\nAnd it'd unjoin the directory.\n\n531\n00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.440\nIt was the weirdest thing.\n\n532\n00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.000\nBut I should know how to\ntroubleshoot a printer, but\n\n533\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.210\nI couldn't find what the problem was.\n\n534\n00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.100\nSo we escalate it to the person\nsitting next to me, right?\n\n535\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.070\nEnded up finding that\nit was a driver issue.\n\n536\n00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.140\nAnd everybody says well,\nof course it's a driver issue.\n\n537\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.070\nThat's what we always say about hardware.\n\n538\n00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.619\nBut it was a point in the manufacturing\nprocess that their model numbers,\n\n539\n00:26:12.619 --> 00:26:14.005\ninternally, had changed.\n\n540\n00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.118\nAnd they were using different drivers for\n\n541\n00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:18.963\nwhat appeared on the outside\nas the same exact printer.\n\n542\n00:26:18.963 --> 00:26:20.278\nBut we didn't know So again,\n\n543\n00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:23.340\ndon't think that escalating always\nhas to be to a higher level tier.\n\n544\n00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.749\nIt could be to your peers who've\ngot more experience than you do.\n\n545\n00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:30.465\nEven though you're sitting at\nthe same level as them, if you will,\n\n546\n00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:32.630\non the food chain of helpdesk.\n\n547\n00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.783\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n548\n00:26:34.783 --> 00:26:36.585\nAll right, so where are we at next?\n\n549\n00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:40.515\nSo the next thing we've got is establish\na plan to resolve the problem,\n\n550\n00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:41.245\nand all right.\n\n551\n00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:43.277\nAnd then identify possible effects, okay?\n\n552\n00:26:43.277 --> 00:26:47.527\nOkay and they don't talk about this here.\n\n553\n00:26:47.527 --> 00:26:50.405\nI'm going to go ahead and\nadd something here that is not for\n\n554\n00:26:50.405 --> 00:26:51.951\nthe certification purposes.\n\n555\n00:26:51.951 --> 00:26:56.952\nAll right they say,\nidentify possible side effects, okay.\n\n556\n00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:01.310\nWhat happens if something goes wrong?\n\n557\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.870\nI want you to put here too in\nyour minds a rollback plan.\n\n558\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.704\nPlan for rollback.\n\n559\n00:27:05.704 --> 00:27:08.640\nCuz if you're gonna identify\npossible effects, and\n\n560\n00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.605\nyou think there might be an effect.\n\n561\n00:27:10.605 --> 00:27:12.600\nMake sure that you can\nundo the changes as well.\n\n562\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.690\nI will tell you up until this point, if\nyou notice, we haven't touched the system.\n\n563\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.686\nWe haven't made a single change here.\n\n564\n00:27:20.686 --> 00:27:22.501\nThe other thing that I would\ntell you at this point.\n\n565\n00:27:22.501 --> 00:27:24.821\nIf you're going to\nestablish a plan of action,\n\n566\n00:27:24.821 --> 00:27:27.870\nthe very first thing you\ndo is take back ups.\n\n567\n00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.890\nNotice we haven't changed anything yet.\n\n568\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.030\nUp until this point, nothing's changed.\n\n569\n00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.440\nBecause if we change it,\nwe just skip ahead,\n\n570\n00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.520\nthen we could be the source\nof the problem to begin with.\n\n571\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.660\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n572\n00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:44.660\nAll right, next one we have is\nimplement a solution or escalate.\n\n573\n00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.600\nAgain, there's no problem with saying,\nI'm not sure, all right?\n\n574\n00:27:50.855 --> 00:27:54.130\nUtilize the talents of the people\nthat you have around there.\n\n575\n00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.430\nBe willing to say, I don't know.\n\n576\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.784\nNow implementing the solution,\nwe know what that is.\n\n577\n00:27:58.784 --> 00:28:01.290\nBut I do want you to understand this.\n\n578\n00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.800\nCherokee, I don't know if you've done\nthis, and I'm guilty of this guy.\n\n579\n00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.480\nSo do as I say not as I do,\nI'm guilty of this.\n\n580\n00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.080\nHave you ever made two or\nthree changes to something and\n\n581\n00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.680\none of those changes fixed it?\n\n582\n00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.076\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But you couldn't figure out which one\n\n583\n00:28:12.076 --> 00:28:12.850\nof those changes?\n\n584\n00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.815\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why it's broken,\nI don't know why it's fixed.\n\n585\n00:28:15.815 --> 00:28:17.530\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Exactly,\n\n586\n00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.060\nnow as much as we're joking\naround it does happen.\n\n587\n00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.430\nSo here's one thing that I would say and\ntake this piece of advice.\n\n588\n00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.360\nI've learned to do it now [LAUGH] but\n\n589\n00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.039\nI wish I would have\nlearned it a lot earlier.\n\n590\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.690\nMake one change, test.\n\n591\n00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.920\nDid that fix it?\n\n592\n00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.900\nIf it fixed it, document it right there\nthat that change is what fixed it.\n\n593\n00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.390\nIt didn't fix it?\n\n594\n00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.130\nUndo that change and\nmove to the next one and\n\n595\n00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.810\nimplement that solution if\nyou think it's a solution.\n\n596\n00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.210\nDid that change fix it?\n\n597\n00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:48.010\nWell, if it did again document it and\nwe'll move to the next step.\n\n598\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.206\nMake one change and then find out.\n\n599\n00:28:51.206 --> 00:28:52.389\nDon't make a series of changes.\n\n600\n00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:55.308\nAnd then at the end, like Cherokee said,\nI don't know what the problem was.\n\n601\n00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:57.850\nAnd, even worse,\nI don't know what the solution is either.\n\n602\n00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.571\nThat's not gonna be\na good day at the office.\n\n603\n00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.091\nAll right,\n\n604\n00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:03.160\nthe other thing too is you might have\nto reverse that change too again.\n\n605\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.912\nIf you go through that process and\nit doesn't fix it, all right?\n\n606\n00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:09.024\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat leads us into our next step here.\n\n607\n00:29:09.024 --> 00:29:12.484\nWhat if you experience that same\nproblem on someone else's computer and\n\n608\n00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.683\nnow you have to fix that?\n\n609\n00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:15.387\nAnd you're like, hm,\nI don't know what I did.\n\n610\n00:29:15.387 --> 00:29:16.715\nNow I have to fix that again.\n\n611\n00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:19.039\nOr worse,\nwhat if your partner has to fix it and\n\n612\n00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.851\nyou don't have anything documented for\nthem, right?\n\n613\n00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:24.115\n&gt;&gt; Documentation is definitely key.\n\n614\n00:29:24.115 --> 00:29:26.408\nHowever we do have one more\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n615\n00:29:26.408 --> 00:29:27.728\n&gt;&gt; Did I skip one?\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n616\n00:29:27.728 --> 00:29:28.641\n&gt;&gt; Man.\n[LAUGH]\n\n617\n00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:29.915\n&gt;&gt; It's in the myriad, and\n\n618\n00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:32.710\nthis is one that I would\nsay is very important.\n\n619\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.300\nAnd I'm gonna change it\nup just a little bit too.\n\n620\n00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.020\nVerify full system functionality, and\nif possible, applicable they like to say,\n\n621\n00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.970\nsounds like insurance terms.\n\n622\n00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.504\nAnd preventative measures, right?\n\n623\n00:29:43.504 --> 00:29:46.356\nSo, if we know that it\nwas an overheating issue.\n\n624\n00:29:46.356 --> 00:29:50.390\nWe didn't have enough circulation in our\nserver closet because somebody closed off\n\n625\n00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:51.878\nthe back of the server closet.\n\n626\n00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:54.220\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n627\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.120\nCan we implement a preventative measure\nthat says, don't do that again?\n\n628\n00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.700\nDon't do that.\n\n629\n00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500\nIs it the fact that our climate\ncontrol system was failing?\n\n630\n00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.550\nPreventative measures?\n\n631\n00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.430\nImplement one that's not, [LAUGH] right?\n\n632\n00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.850\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n633\n00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.690\nThe other thing too, again,\nI'm gonna add this one right here more for\n\n634\n00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:09.849\nyour own sake than really for the test.\n\n635\n00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.453\nA fix is never a fix or\n\n636\n00:30:12.453 --> 00:30:16.100\na solution to a problem until\nthe end user tells you it is, right?\n\n637\n00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.746\nBecause you might know that\nyou fixed the problem.\n\n638\n00:30:17.746 --> 00:30:19.999\nBut until that end user verifies.\n\n639\n00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:21.337\nAnd you might not be\ndealing with end users.\n\n640\n00:30:21.337 --> 00:30:25.520\nThis might be something that is\njust your coworkers next to you.\n\n641\n00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.980\nWhen you verify the full system\nfunctionality, all right.\n\n642\n00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.500\n&gt;&gt; It's so ironic that I actually skipped\nthat one because a lot of people tend to\n\n643\n00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.680\nskip that particular step.\n\n644\n00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.409\nAnd like you said,\njust interacting with that person,\n\n645\n00:30:35.409 --> 00:30:37.221\nwith the printer issue that you had.\n\n646\n00:30:37.221 --> 00:30:41.324\nIf you would have asked that end user\nto go ahead and print something,\n\n647\n00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:43.536\nit almost solidifies that process.\n\n648\n00:30:43.536 --> 00:30:46.215\nBecause there, yep,\nthis is exactly what I needed to print.\n\n649\n00:30:46.215 --> 00:30:47.686\nThank you so much, Wes, have a great day.\n\n650\n00:30:47.686 --> 00:30:48.903\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n651\n00:30:48.903 --> 00:30:52.432\nAnd then you can get to your documentation\nwhich says, happy birthday to me,\n\n652\n00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:53.586\nthe customer was happy.\n\n653\n00:30:53.586 --> 00:30:55.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But document everything.\n\n654\n00:30:55.292 --> 00:31:00.223\nDocument steps that you took, your\nfindings, the information that you gather,\n\n655\n00:31:00.223 --> 00:31:02.600\nwhere you got the information.\n\n656\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.890\nAnd keep that on record.\n\n657\n00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:08.509\nNow you might have to, this might be part\nof your company's procedures and policies.\n\n658\n00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:11.630\nAgain a trouble ticketing system,\nchange management,\n\n659\n00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.108\npatch management, however it falls under.\n\n660\n00:31:14.108 --> 00:31:16.349\nIt could all be under some kind of policy.\n\n661\n00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:17.964\nBut if you are doing this for yourself.\n\n662\n00:31:17.964 --> 00:31:21.168\nMaybe you're getting a certification\nexam because you wanna go out,\n\n663\n00:31:21.168 --> 00:31:22.808\nmaybe do some of this for yourself.\n\n664\n00:31:22.808 --> 00:31:25.147\nStill document, document and document.\n\n665\n00:31:25.147 --> 00:31:29.462\nBecause what happens is over time, just\nlike Cherokee was alluding to earlier.\n\n666\n00:31:29.462 --> 00:31:31.259\nThis happens on somebody else's computer.\n\n667\n00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:34.900\nWouldn't it be nice to just say okay,\nI've got my documentation right here.\n\n668\n00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.870\nOkay, I did this, x, y, z, okay, fixed.\n\n669\n00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.670\nOr do you wanna start out from\nthe beginning and start all over again?\n\n670\n00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.586\nAnd I have before, too.\n\n671\n00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:43.910\nI don't know how many times [LAUGH]\nI've done that in the past.\n\n672\n00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.500\nSo make sure that you document\nyour settings as well.\n\n673\n00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.560\nDocument all the findings,\nthe actions, and the outcomes.\n\n674\n00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.243\nKeep in mind all of the resources\nthat you've utilized as well.\n\n675\n00:31:55.243 --> 00:32:00.826\nMake sure that your end user also confirms\nthat whatever the problem might be.\n\n676\n00:32:00.826 --> 00:32:04.095\nThat they believe that you\nhave solved it as well.\n\n677\n00:32:04.095 --> 00:32:05.185\n&gt;&gt; I hate to cut you off, Wes.\n\n678\n00:32:05.185 --> 00:32:07.385\nBut we are out of time,\nand we have covered a lot.\n\n679\n00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:08.395\nBut thank you so much for\n\n680\n00:32:08.395 --> 00:32:13.565\ntaking the time to provide us with\na methodical approach to troubleshooting.\n\n681\n00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.335\nAnd we're not just gonna be approaching\nour issues haphazardly here.\n\n682\n00:32:16.335 --> 00:32:17.930\nSo thank you so much for that.\n\n683\n00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.100\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\ntuning in, but stay tuned.\n\n684\n00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.430\nWe do have more Net+ heading your way.\n\n685\n00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.910\nBut for this episode, I'm gonna sign\noff as your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n686\n00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:27.637\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n687\n00:32:27.637 --> 00:32:30.860\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n688\n00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:36.636\n[MUSIC]\n\n689\n00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:40.061\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:12.218\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:14.127\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:16.803\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:20.531\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are moving\n\n7\n00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:23.376\non with more on our CompTIA And\nWork Plus series and\n\n8\n00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:27.870\njoining us back in the studio is the man\nyou know as Wes Bryan, it’s Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.890\nWelcome back to the show man,\nhow’s it going today?\n\n10\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.140\n&gt;&gt; It’s going great,\ngreat to be here, it’s fun as always.\n\n11\n00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.444\nThat’s right,\nwe are moving into our next topic here,\n\n12\n00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:41.030\ntalking about some of the trouble\nshooting tools that we’re gonna be using.\n\n13\n00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.486\nAnd the output,\nwhen I used like a command line utility,\n\n14\n00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:47.450\nwhat the heck is it even\nshowing me on the screen?\n\n15\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.090\nAnd even some hardware based\ntroubleshooting tools we'll talk about\n\n16\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.010\nas we get it later into this episode here,\n\n17\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.490\nwe'll talk about things\nlike the lineman's test.\n\n18\n00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.630\nAlways got a funny name,\na butt set if you will.\n\n19\n00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.920\nIt gets the name from where a lineman\ncould butt into a conversation.\n\n20\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.940\nWe'll look at things like our cable\ntester as well as multimeter.\n\n21\n00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.210\nSo, we'll look at some physical\nhardware tools as well.\n\n22\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.500\nBut we're gonna start out\nmore in the logical realm.\n\n23\n00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.230\nSpecifically, in some of the command line\nutilities that they call out on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.080\nAnd one of the very first ones that\nthey call out is IP configuration and\n\n25\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.412\nIF configuration.\n\n26\n00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:28.310\nSo, Ipconfig inside of Windows,\nand Ifconfig for\n\n27\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.040\ninterface configuration inside of your\nLinux Well, in fact even in Mac as well.\n\n28\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.201\nAnd so, we have to understand\na little bit about those.\n\n29\n00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.189\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right into Ipconfig, and\n\n30\n00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.962\nwhat does that mean for us.\n\n31\n00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:49.978\nWell Ipconfig, as you've probably guessed,\nstands for IP configuration.\n\n32\n00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:54.388\nAnd what it allows us to see on our\nWindows based machines is the current\n\n33\n00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:58.053\nTCP/IP, IP address configuration for\nthe machine, and\n\n34\n00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:01.821\nsome other additional\nconfiguration parameters as well.\n\n35\n00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.662\nIn fact let's go ahead and show you.\n\n36\n00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:07.690\nI'm here on a Windows server machine\nhere and I'm gonna go ahead and.\n\n37\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.391\nI'll just launch up our PowerShell here.\n\n38\n00:02:10.391 --> 00:02:12.635\nAnd let me go ahead and\nclear the screen a little bit,\n\n39\n00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.590\ngive us a little bit more real estate.\n\n40\n00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.992\nVery first one that I\ncall out is Ipconfig.\n\n41\n00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:21.123\nNow, Ipconfig can do quite\na few different things.\n\n42\n00:02:21.123 --> 00:02:26.146\nBut again, if I just run it just by\nitself, it gives me a very basic,\n\n43\n00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:32.144\nsome very basic information about the IP\nconfiguration of the network adapter or\n\n44\n00:02:32.144 --> 00:02:35.340\nnetwork adapters that are in the machine.\n\n45\n00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.810\nFor instance, I can see right here the\nEthernet adapter, I can see whether it is\n\n46\n00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.800\nplugged in or whether disconnected,\nthis actually has two networks adapters.\n\n47\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.270\nIn fact, if you were to right click\ndown on the little monitor icon in\n\n48\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.860\nthe notification area,\ngo to The network and sharing center, and\n\n49\n00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.610\nthen adapter settings you could see\nthat I do have Ethernet0 and Ethernet1.\n\n50\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.847\nSo, this is the graphical user\ninterface and then inside of the output\n\n51\n00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:07.197\nif you will for ipconfig, I can see\nthat more in your text base, right.\n\n52\n00:03:07.197 --> 00:03:10.977\nWe're talking about text based\ncommand line interface and\n\n53\n00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:13.479\nyou can see Ethernet1 in Ethernet0.\n\n54\n00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.735\nWell,I can see that Ethernet1 or Ethernet0\nexcuse me, is disconnected, right,\n\n55\n00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:23.337\nand if I take a look at what that looks\nlike in the graphical user interface.\n\n56\n00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:27.580\nWe can go here to Network and Sharing\nCenter again, change adapter settings and\n\n57\n00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.013\nI can see right here, the little x, again\nkind of relationships between the GUI and\n\n58\n00:03:32.013 --> 00:03:35.220\nwhat were seeing here inside\nof the Command Prompt.\n\n59\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.310\nOr in this case PowerShell.\n\n60\n00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.040\nNow, I can also see some\nadditional information too.\n\n61\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.960\nSo, for instance for the adapter that we\nare, that is currently connected, right?\n\n62\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.130\nI can look and I can see that ethernet\nadapter 1, I can see the what would be\n\n63\n00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.680\nthe connection specific DNS Suffix if I\nhad one of those applied in the machine.\n\n64\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.386\nA lot of time such as see is the domain\nname and then with just the means is that\n\n65\n00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:03.243\nif you are inside of this domain and you\nsearch for do like a single name you look\n\n66\n00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:08.022\nup it will say, okay, so, you're in\nlet's say demo dot net dot plus, so,\n\n67\n00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:13.327\nyour computer's SRV01, so, if you search\nfor somebody, let me just go ahead and\n\n68\n00:04:13.327 --> 00:04:17.812\nI'll append that connection specific\nDNS Suffix until the end of it and\n\n69\n00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:21.230\nit becomes your fully\nqualified domain name search.\n\n70\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.930\nYou could also see things like,\nfor instance, in other episodes,\n\n71\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.730\nwe talked a little bit about IPv6 and\nwhat a link- local address is, and\n\n72\n00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.740\nI can see that fe80 address right there.\n\n73\n00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.690\nThat shows me my IPv6 information.\n\n74\n00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.720\nAnd that's good to understand.\n\n75\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.180\nCuz IP configuration, right.\n\n76\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.675\nWe have IPv4 and we have IPv6.\n\n77\n00:04:38.675 --> 00:04:41.980\nAnd you can see here, well,\nI can see the 4 address.\n\n78\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.315\nAnd I can see the 6 address.\n\n79\n00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:45.547\nI can also see things like my subnet mask.\n\n80\n00:04:45.547 --> 00:04:49.333\nAnd I can see things like the default\ngateway, if I had one assigned, and\n\n81\n00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.453\na couple of the other adapters here too.\n\n82\n00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:56.421\nSo if you happen to be tunneling IPv6\ninformation over an IPv4 network on\n\n83\n00:04:56.421 --> 00:05:00.760\nyour LAN, you might see that you\nhave not a media disconnected.\n\n84\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.330\nBut you could see that you might possibly\nhave your ISATAP Information here.\n\n85\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.690\nA lot of times,\nyour ISATAP information or 6 to 4,\n\n86\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.710\nyou'll see things like IPv6 addresses\nlike 2002 colon and whatever's behind it.\n\n87\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.300\nBut very basic information.\n\n88\n00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.260\nNow, you can also do this\ninside of your Linux machines.\n\n89\n00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.090\nI'm actually on a Mac here and\nunderneath, it's Unix-based so,\n\n90\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.010\nI can do this here as well and\nthat's ifconfig and\n\n91\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.730\nifconfig is a little bit different\nbecause it's not just about IP, right?\n\n92\n00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.450\nIt's interface configuration,\nso, there's more information\n\n93\n00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.460\nthan just IP configuration here but\nI can see that information here too.\n\n94\n00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.650\nI can see the IP address,\nI can see what the subnet mask is.\n\n95\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.432\nAnd what I like,\nis really cool about this,\n\n96\n00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:49.852\nI can even see what the broadcast\naddress is on the network.\n\n97\n00:05:49.852 --> 00:05:55.080\nSo again, it's Interface configuration and\njust look how detailed it goes into.\n\n98\n00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.970\nAgain, not just about the IP address but\n\n99\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.960\nit even tells me what the media\nis that we're running.\n\n100\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.880\nSo that's really cool so,\nifconfig, it does have its place.\n\n101\n00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.695\nAnd again,\nit's inside of things like Linux and\n\n102\n00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:09.250\nthat you might even have\nto help me out on this one.\n\n103\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.810\nI believe ifconfig is actually\nnot what you use too much today.\n\n104\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.770\nI mean, you still can, but I think\nthey prefer IP Add today, don't they?\n\n105\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, IPAddr.\n\n106\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.427\n&gt;&gt; Addr, that's it.\n&gt;&gt; A-D-D-R, yeah,\n\n107\n00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:23.560\nyou'll see that probably\na little more prevalently.\n\n108\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.130\nAt least ifconfig is still around,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n109\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.650\nIt's gonna be here for a little while.\n\n110\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.510\nBut Operating systems like\nCintas are depreciating.\n\n111\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.030\nThey're not even installing it, you have\nto go in and say I want to download and\n\n112\n00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.670\ninstall the net tools so,\nthat I have config and\n\n113\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.980\nall its brethren show up as well.\n\n114\n00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, okay gotcha.\n\n115\n00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.850\nAnd that's good to know.\n\n116\n00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.090\nAnd the great thing is that they're\nnot gonna ask you about IP addr,\n\n117\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.650\nbut guys you very well are gonna be in\nsome kind of Linux based system and\n\n118\n00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.540\nit's just good to know that.\n\n119\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.810\nDon't worry about IP addr for\nthe exam, but good information for\n\n120\n00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.770\nyou to know regardless.\n\n121\n00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.330\nSo, ifconfig here is also here as well.\n\n122\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.030\nNow, I said that ipconfig\nif I just run it by itself,\n\n123\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.640\nthat it gives a very basic\namount of information.\n\n124\n00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.184\nYou give more detailed information\nif you want cuz we can do what\n\n125\n00:07:10.184 --> 00:07:14.745\nis known as the IPCONFIG /ALL and\nI get a lot more information.\n\n126\n00:07:14.745 --> 00:07:17.605\nIn fact, let me do that\na little bit different here,\n\n127\n00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:21.080\nlet’s me make it a little bit easier\nto kind of read this line by line.\n\n128\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.400\nI'll run that and pipe that into more.\n\n129\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.190\nThere we go.\n\n130\n00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.632\nAnd then it just makes it\na little easier to see here but\n\n131\n00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:29.310\nnotice that I get a little bit\nmore detailed information.\n\n132\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.616\nI find out what the hostname is.\n\n133\n00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:34.814\nI can see what my hostname\nis Primary Dns Suffix here,\n\n134\n00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:39.350\nremember I told you, your Dns Suffix\na lot of time is your domain name.\n\n135\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.250\nThat means, I can tell also what my\nfully qualified domain name is, right?.\n\n136\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.756\nWe've talk about in another\nepisodes what an FQDN is,\n\n137\n00:07:46.756 --> 00:07:49.543\nthat's the combination of a hostname and\nyour domain name.\n\n138\n00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:54.541\nSo, I can tell by looking at\nthe all with the all switch that\n\n139\n00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.840\nthis is SRV02.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n140\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.870\nThat's my fully qualified domain name.\n\n141\n00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.394\nWe can see things like the.\n\n142\n00:08:01.394 --> 00:08:02.671\nIP routing enabled.\n\n143\n00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:06.846\nIf we happen to be using some\nkind of WINS technology.\n\n144\n00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:07.496\nA lot of time for\n\n145\n00:08:07.496 --> 00:08:10.205\nnot using WINS technology anymore\ndon't mean that you won't.\n\n146\n00:08:10.205 --> 00:08:13.712\nYou won't come across it but\nit's more of a legacy technology and\n\n147\n00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:18.090\nreally there are other technologies\nthat work better today that we use.\n\n148\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.850\nBut it is still there and\nI can see again media disconnect,\n\n149\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.480\nnow notice it's a little\ndifferent here too.\n\n150\n00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.720\nBecause with media dis,\nthat's all I got in the last one,\n\n151\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.510\nI got media disconnected, but\nnow I can actually see a little bit more.\n\n152\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.410\nI can tell, well,\nthis is an Intel gigabit card.\n\n153\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.090\nI can also see the Mac address.\n\n154\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.130\nThat 48 bit address there that here.\n\n155\n00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.985\nAnd notice for\nthe test just as a randomness.\n\n156\n00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:43.690\nMost people call it back addresses.\n\n157\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.123\nWindows calls it a physical address.\n\n158\n00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:46.210\nAnd it's not a bad thing.\n\n159\n00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.448\nIt's a hardware burned in hardware\naddress, so I can understand that.\n\n160\n00:08:49.448 --> 00:08:53.149\nBut just to understand the physical\naddress is also the Mac address here in\n\n161\n00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:54.767\nWindows they're synonymous.\n\n162\n00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.380\nAnd then we can save some\nadditional information, right?\n\n163\n00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.350\nWe talk about in fact,\nlet me do the more option here.\n\n164\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:05.270\nNotice with my Ethernet1,\nright were we had our IP address,\n\n165\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.570\nwe had our subnet mask.\n\n166\n00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.053\nWe've seen the link-local address.\n\n167\n00:09:08.053 --> 00:09:14.040\nNow I can find out is this a static\naddress or is it a DHCP assigned address?\n\n168\n00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.010\nWell guys, I know your sharp out there,\nso you don't need me to repeat that.\n\n169\n00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.560\nBut if we kinda highlight that, you can\nsee whether I've statically assigned it or\n\n170\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.045\nwhether DHCP is provided this for me,\nin this case, you can see, no, it did not.\n\n171\n00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:29.650\nAll right, what else can we see here,\nDHCPv6, all right,\n\n172\n00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.900\nmaybe we are using a V6 server.\n\n173\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.910\nNow with a V6 and DHCP server,\n\n174\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.250\na lot of times what they’re doing is\nhanding out configuration parameters and\n\n175\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.430\nyou’re falling back on what's\nknown as an EUI64 address.\n\n176\n00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.760\nMost of the times,\n\n177\n00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.610\nour IPv6 addresses are gonna be what's\nknown as statelessly configured.\n\n178\n00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.860\nIt means the device itself, in this case,\n\n179\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.860\nthis Windows server can\nsign its IPv6 address.\n\n180\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.500\nAll right, and then again some of\nthe other kinda like translational\n\n181\n00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.020\ntechnologies, Isotap and Teredo, but I\nwouldn't worry about those too much unless\n\n182\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.492\nyou wanna know a little\nbit more about Teredo.\n\n183\n00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:06.120\nWe do have some episodes\nabout that as well.\n\n184\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.520\nAll right, so that's viewing\nyour configuration information.\n\n185\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.647\nBut there's other things that you\ncan do with IPConfig as well.\n\n186\n00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:20.980\nLike for instance, viewing and managing\nthings like your DNS resolver cache.\n\n187\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.350\nLike for\ninstance if I was to do an ipconfig.\n\n188\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:32.764\nLet's see, ipconfig space /displaydns,\nall right.\n\n189\n00:10:32.764 --> 00:10:36.000\nWell, I can see that I have\nsome records here, all right.\n\n190\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.640\nIn fact, I know what this record is.\n\n191\n00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.069\nThis record is my domain controller,\nall right?\n\n192\n00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:44.880\nAnd remember DNS records.\n\n193\n00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.455\nIf you don't know what DNS records are,\nwe have an episode that we talk pretty\n\n194\n00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:51.992\nextensively about the different records,\nyou would see in a DNS database.\n\n195\n00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:54.790\nI can see that this is an a record, right?\n\n196\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.010\nAnd at one point my computer\nreached out to a DNS server.\n\n197\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.130\nAnd said hey, I've got this name.\n\n198\n00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.314\nThis SRV01.demo.itpro.tv,\nwhose IP address is it,\n\n199\n00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:10.700\nand then it gives me the IP address and\nthen I cache it.\n\n200\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.671\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\nlet's switch over,\n\n201\n00:11:14.671 --> 00:11:19.488\nI'm gonna go ahead and switch over\nto that server that we just seen,\n\n202\n00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:22.805\nthe record, we're gonna go to SRV01 here.\n\n203\n00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:26.560\nAnd let's see if it,\nlet's see if I can remember my password.\n\n204\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.050\nThat would help.\nWe're not going to see anything.\n\n205\n00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.120\nWould be a very short episode,\n[LAUGH] And we'll go ahead and\n\n206\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.850\nlaunch up our PowerShell here and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n207\n00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.880\ngive us a little bit\nmore real estate there.\n\n208\n00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:45.145\nAnd then we'll do an ipconfig\n/displaydns here as well.\n\n209\n00:11:45.145 --> 00:11:53.310\nAll right, and notice that well we got\nsome records here likewise, right?\n\n210\n00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:58.100\nSo I can see When my computer and\ncalls out to a DNS server and says hey,\n\n211\n00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.540\nwhat's this IP address, or what's the IP\naddress of you know associated with this\n\n212\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.870\nname, i'm let me go ahead and\ncash that information.\n\n213\n00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.764\nNow next time I have to go to that\nsame location, I don't have to ask for\n\n214\n00:12:09.764 --> 00:12:12.602\nthe DNS server,\nall I can do is just look locally and\n\n215\n00:12:12.602 --> 00:12:14.991\nit speeds up the name resolution process.\n\n216\n00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:18.212\nBut there are times when manipulation or\n\n217\n00:12:18.212 --> 00:12:23.137\nmanagement of your DNS records\nin a local resolver cache can be\n\n218\n00:12:23.137 --> 00:12:28.170\nsomething that helps you in\ncertain problematic situations.\n\n219\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.250\nLet me give you an example, for\ninstance, let's do, I'll tell you what,\n\n220\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.040\nlet's use our ipconfig that\nwe've already kinda learned.\n\n221\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.671\nAnd we'll do If I could type it.\n\n222\n00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:37.950\nWe'll do just the basic here.\n\n223\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.330\nRNX CD IP address.\n\n224\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.920\nI think what I'm gonna do\nhere is I'm gonna simulate.\n\n225\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.568\nAll right, so there's my IP address, okay?\n\n226\n00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:50.070\nHere's one of the things that I wanna do.\n\n227\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.470\nI wanna go ahead.\n\n228\n00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.381\nAnd let me ping this computer.\n\n229\n00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:58.345\nAll right, so we're gonna go to srv01 and\nwe're gonna do a ping.\n\n230\n00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:06.100\n10.10.10.150, all right, and I can see\nI can communicate with it, all right.\n\n231\n00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.882\nIf I wanted to do,\nlet's say, ping by name.\n\n232\n00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:13.470\nLet's try ping by name,\nsrv02 looks like I can ping.\n\n233\n00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.180\nNow there's a reason I did that, notice\nthe second time I didn't ping with an IP\n\n234\n00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.470\naddress but I ping with the name and\nlook what I did here Dan.\n\n235\n00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.830\nNotice the result that name there right,\nsame thing we've been talking about,\n\n236\n00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:30.424\nwe talked about another episodes I've got\nmy AFQDN, it's an you mean 10.10.10.150.\n\n237\n00:13:30.424 --> 00:13:34.330\nNow it knows that ip address.\n\n238\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.210\nIn fact it's not gonna have to check\nwith DNS again for that ip address.\n\n239\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.850\nRight it's not gonna check to\nthe DNS server because if I look\n\n240\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.810\nnow locally somewhere on\nhere I should there it is.\n\n241\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.592\nThere we go.\n\n242\n00:13:47.592 --> 00:13:49.270\nWait a second I know it\nshould be there somewhere.\n\n243\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.435\nNotice that I've got now\nthat in the cache all right.\n\n244\n00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:59.280\nWhat happens if the IP address of the\nserver that I just pinged, say server O2.\n\n245\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.340\nWhat happens if the IP address changes?\n\n246\n00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.870\nCould that be problematic.\n\n247\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.740\nIn this case I don't know.\n\n248\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.610\nLet's find out.\n\n249\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:05.460\nAll right.\n\n250\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.960\nSo let's go over, and we're just gonna\ndo a basic changing of the IP address.\n\n251\n00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.784\nOkay?\nAnd we'll get into our ethernet adapter or\n\n252\n00:14:13.784 --> 00:14:15.200\nproperties.\n\n253\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.313\nV4 properties here and\nwe'll change this to I don't know 110.\n\n254\n00:14:19.313 --> 00:14:20.469\nAll right.\n\n255\n00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:23.270\nAnd we'll choose okay.\n\n256\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.219\nWe'll choose close.\n\n257\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.430\nAll right so now let's just verify\nthat we have a new ip address.\n\n258\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.700\nYou can confirm that for me Dan.\n\n259\n00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.870\nThat is a 110 not a 150 anymore.\n\n260\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.676\n&gt;&gt; That no longer exists as 150.\n\n261\n00:14:34.676 --> 00:14:36.400\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH] Very good.\n\n262\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.686\nSo now let's go ahead, let's go back\nhere and let's do a ping by name.\n\n263\n00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:44.620\nRemember not only the ping.\n\n264\n00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.160\nPing is a specific utility that\ncan rely on name resolution.\n\n265\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:54.060\nBut you have applications and programmes\nwithin your building within your company\n\n266\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.295\nthat result rely on name resolution.\n\n267\n00:14:56.295 --> 00:15:00.112\nSo what I'm about to show you will be\nno different than an application that's\n\n268\n00:15:00.112 --> 00:15:02.750\ntrying to use name to result and\nwatch what happens.\n\n269\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.448\nIf I do a ping SRVO2.\n\n270\n00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.670\nWhat's happening here?\n\n271\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.319\nAll right.\n\n272\n00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:13.730\nFirst of all, I want you to see\nthat its trying to resolve a name.\n\n273\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.808\nAll right, okay, so wait a second,\nmaybe, maybe I had a problem.\n\n274\n00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:21.990\nMaybe the DNS hasn't updated, right.\n\n275\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.053\nWe can do things like DNS registration.\n\n276\n00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:28.124\nIn fact, let me show you that, that's one\nof the things you can do with IP config so\n\n277\n00:15:28.124 --> 00:15:29.970\nnotice I can't communicate.\n\n278\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.120\nBut also notice that it's still trying\nto resolve that old IP address and\n\n279\n00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.360\nthat's problematic for me, right?\n\n280\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.820\nSo let's go ahead and let's do\nsomething that's kind of interesting.\n\n281\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.480\nLet's reach out to the DNS server and\nsay hey, you got to update.\n\n282\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.056\nI've got to change here, so\nI need you need to be aware of it so\n\n283\n00:15:47.056 --> 00:15:49.385\nyou'll update your records DNS zone.\n\n284\n00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:56.330\nSo we'll do an ipconfig, and\nwe will do a /registerdns.\n\n285\n00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:56.867\nAnd we'll run that.\n\n286\n00:15:56.867 --> 00:16:02.111\nAn this takes a second, and then what it's\ngonna do, is, it usually will give you\n\n287\n00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:07.297\nthis kind of warning, it will say, okay\nCheck your event viewer for any errors.\n\n288\n00:16:07.297 --> 00:16:10.290\nRegistration will happen\nwithin a few minutes, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:15.260\nBut let's go ahead, since this is a small\nvirtualized network, I can probably\n\n290\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.620\ndrop down here to my server manager\nwhere the DNS, this is the DNS server.\n\n291\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.230\nAnd let's look at our DNS zone file,\nall right?\n\n292\n00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.670\nLet's find out,\nas a part of troubleshooting,\n\n293\n00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.730\nwhy I can't resolve that name.\n\n294\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.600\nMaybe it's not in the DNS database\nanymore, that update, right?\n\n295\n00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.060\nSo, we go over to our zone file here.\n\n296\n00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.216\nWe open it up, and we look.\n\n297\n00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:43.560\nAnd, Dan, it does look like SRV02\nwith the DNS registration updated.\n\n298\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.700\nBut wait a second.\n\n299\n00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.370\nOkay, so now, DNS is updated, DNS knows\nthat that computer just had an IP address\n\n300\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.980\nchange, so we should be good there.\n\n301\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.690\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's rerun the ping.\n\n302\n00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.290\nIt's still not working.\n\n303\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.220\nAnd here's the problem.\n\n304\n00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.890\nAlthough this is not something that's\ngonna happen commonly all over the place,\n\n305\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.890\noccasionally it can happen.\n\n306\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.900\nSee, what's happening with the local\nresolver cache is we're looking there, and\n\n307\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.980\nif I have an answer, even if it's\na wrong answer, I stop, right?\n\n308\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.710\nIf I ask Dan a question, right?\n\n309\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.560\nAnd I believe Dan's given\nme the honest answer,\n\n310\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.490\nthere's no reason to walk\nto somebody else and ask.\n\n311\n00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.120\nI've got my answer, all right?\n\n312\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.140\nSo how do I get the right answer?\n\n313\n00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.270\nNow, you might say don't ask Dan.\n\n314\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.070\nNo, just kidding, Dan [LAUGH].\n\n315\n00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.770\nHow do I get the right answer, then?\n\n316\n00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.080\nWell, here's what you have to do.\n\n317\n00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:40.830\nNotice that when we do our IP\nconfig Again, we'll run this again.\n\n318\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:41.920\nDisplay DNS.\n\n319\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.130\nYou're going to notice that it\nstill has what's now considered,\n\n320\n00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.750\nthey call in the DNS slang,\na stale record.\n\n321\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.740\nThe record's invalid,\nit is no longer good.\n\n322\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.350\nAnd the problem is the time to live,\nhow long before I discard this record,\n\n323\n00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.580\nwe still got a little bit of time to go.\n\n324\n00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.050\nSo how do I help that, all right?\n\n325\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.160\nAnd that's where another\noption in IP config comes in.\n\n326\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.535\nYou can do an IP config space\nforward slash Flushdns.\n\n327\n00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:16.309\nAnd we hit Enter.\n\n328\n00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:17.750\nAnd notice what's happened here.\n\n329\n00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:23.200\nNotice that it says you just successfully\nflushed the DNS resolver cache.\n\n330\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.928\nOkay, so let's rerun our ping and\nsee what happens.\n\n331\n00:18:28.806 --> 00:18:32.960\nAnd all of a sudden like that,\nwe've got communication.\n\n332\n00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.910\nWe've also got an updated record.\n\n333\n00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.070\nIn fact, I could probably verify that\njust by doing a display DNS and looking.\n\n334\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.170\nAnd sure enough,\nnow I have an updated record.\n\n335\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.540\nSo, one of the good things, all right,\nthat we've seen about ip config is not\n\n336\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.450\njust showing you what your\nip configuration is, but\n\n337\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.350\nyou can also view those\nrecords that you've resolved.\n\n338\n00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.560\nAnd in this situation, in a scenario where\nyou're caching one of those records and\n\n339\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.900\nthe IP address has changed,\nwe can also flush those old records.\n\n340\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.430\nSo what did it do?\n\n341\n00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.360\nIt went back through\nthe DNS resolution process.\n\n342\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.880\nIt says, I looked locally,\nI don't have my answer.\n\n343\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.050\nDNS server, what do you got?\n\n344\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:18.061\nAnd when it reached out to the DNS server,\nwhich essentially is itself in this case,\n\n345\n00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:21.542\nit checked the DNS zone\nfile that we were just at.\n\n346\n00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:24.520\nIt looked at it, it said, okay, I see.\n\n347\n00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.850\nWrong one, that's the domain there.\n\n348\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.266\nIt says, okay,\nhere is the answer you need.\n\n349\n00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:34.746\nSRV02 is at 10.10.10.110.\n\n350\n00:19:34.746 --> 00:19:36.520\nAnd now I've got the right answer.\n\n351\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.280\nThey map, and I can communicate.\n\n352\n00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.820\nSo keep in mind if that ever happens\nwhere you're relying on name resolution,\n\n353\n00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.320\nyou can see it in areas like where we've\njust seen it where it's resolving a name,\n\n354\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.880\nit's just not resolving it correctly.\n\n355\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.790\nYou use the ip config space forward slash\nflush DNS, you clear the slate, and\n\n356\n00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.810\nnow you're gonna ask the DNS server, and\n\n357\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.300\nit's up to the DNS server to\nhave the updated information.\n\n358\n00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.010\nIf you reach out to the DNS server\nafter you flushed the cache and\n\n359\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.460\nit's still not communicating, well, now\nyou have to do like we're doing here, and\n\n360\n00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.780\nlook at the zone file and make sure\nthat the record truly does exist.\n\n361\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n362\n00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:17.610\nWell, Wes, another great software command\nline network utility that it does pay for\n\n363\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.350\nyou to be able to decipher the output of,\nis one called Netstat.\n\n364\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:26.270\nAnd it's in just about every kind of host\noperating system that you'll run across.\n\n365\n00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.790\nMac, Linux, Windows,\nthey all have a version of it.\n\n366\n00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.350\nAnd like I said, it really pays off\nto be able to use that tool in so\n\n367\n00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.330\nmany switches and\nfigure out what the heck it's telling you.\n\n368\n00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.330\n&gt;&gt; Man,\nI couldn't have said it better myself.\n\n369\n00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.230\nIt is really one of the overlooked\nnetworking utilities.\n\n370\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.650\nAnd like you said, the versatility, the\nfact that it's built into every operating\n\n371\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.130\nsystem, I don't have to say, where could\nI get a good open source software?\n\n372\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.590\nThat's proprietary,\ncuz it's Windows or it's Mac.\n\n373\n00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.490\nNo, we don't have to worry about it.\n\n374\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.150\nIt's across all platforms.\n\n375\n00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.900\nSo what is the, what is Netstat for us?\n\n376\n00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.430\nWell, Netstat is actually short for\nnetwork statistics.\n\n377\n00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.560\nIt's a network statistics utility.\n\n378\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.740\nAnd it's actually really, really powerful.\n\n379\n00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.970\nIn fact, if we just run it by itself,\nwe might get a little bit of information,\n\n380\n00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.190\nbut it could take a second here.\n\n381\n00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.790\nSo, I'll let, or\nwe don't get any information.\n\n382\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.476\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n383\n00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:17.557\nlet's generate a little\nbit of traffic here.\n\n384\n00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:20.590\nThere we go.\n\n385\n00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.900\nNow, that I'm connected, so\nI got a share in the background.\n\n386\n00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.660\nHopefully, this will actually\nshow us something here.\n\n387\n00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.930\nThere it goes,\njust cuz it's taking a second.\n\n388\n00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.810\nI know it's looking.\n\n389\n00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.510\nSo, Netstat, if I run it by itself,\nwhat it's doing is it's determining\n\n390\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.180\nwhat connections I have open\non this machine currently.\n\n391\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.620\nNow, it's taking a second cuz it's\ngoing through a lot of different ports.\n\n392\n00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.000\nI'm going to show you those\nports here in a second.\n\n393\n00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.240\nSo it's really good to find out,\ndo I have connections established?\n\n394\n00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.480\nAnd if so, where am I connected to, right?\n\n395\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.470\nIn this case,\nI can see that this machine here, and\n\n396\n00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.070\njust so you can see we've got BG info\nin the background, this is SRV02.\n\n397\n00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.350\nIt has a connection to SRV01.\n\n398\n00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.170\nWhat's that connection?\n\n399\n00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.020\nWell, you guys might have seen in the\nbackground, I have Windows Explorer open.\n\n400\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.490\nI'm actually, if you look, actually,\n\n401\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.330\nit's probably easier to do it this way,\nthere we go.\n\n402\n00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.460\nI'm actually connected to\na share that's on SRV01.\n\n403\n00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.980\nAnd it's seeing that,\nit's displaying that fact, okay?\n\n404\n00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.980\nWell, what if I wanna find out, well,\nwhat ports do I have open on this machine?\n\n405\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.630\nWell, I can tell you,\nthere's easier ways and\n\n406\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.270\nbetter utilities like EnMAP to do this,\nbut at least this is built in, right?\n\n407\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.670\nIt's already in your operating system.\n\n408\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:37.870\nSo, if I decide I want to find\nout the state of every port that\n\n409\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.489\ncould potentially be listening,\nwhether it's an established\n\n410\n00:22:43.489 --> 00:22:47.975\nconnection or not,\nI can run Netstat, all right?\n\n411\n00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:49.437\nIt's gonna take a second here.\n\n412\n00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:53.620\nBut the good thing is while this\nis running, all right, I can see,\n\n413\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.284\nand I know from the configuration\nof this server that I've\n\n414\n00:22:57.284 --> 00:23:01.350\ngot a few services that are being\noffered by this machine.\n\n415\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.290\nSorry about that, guys.\n\n416\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.380\nLet's kind scroll back up there and\nI'll tell you what we can see,\n\n417\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.980\nwhat we're seeing down there\nat the bottom as well.\n\n418\n00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.210\nAll right, if I look at these ports,\n\n419\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.650\nthese are the ports that\nare currently open and listening.\n\n420\n00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.650\nThese high level ports could have been\nearlier TCP communications that we're\n\n421\n00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.390\nstill waiting on some kind of syn packet\nor a reestablishment of a communication.\n\n422\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:27.840\nBut the ones that I'm really concerned\nare these few right here, right?\n\n423\n00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.820\nThat's because on SRV02,\nwhat we're running this on, guess what?\n\n424\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.950\nI'm running an FTP server.\n\n425\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.960\nThere's port 21, it's open and\nwaiting for commands.\n\n426\n00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.390\nI'm running IIS, right?\n\n427\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.260\nWeb server for Microsoft.\n\n428\n00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.070\nWell, guess what?\n\n429\n00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:47.840\nHTTP open and listening, waiting for\nthe incoming communication, right?\n\n430\n00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.800\nThat's why it says state listening,\nand it's letting me know that.\n\n431\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.430\nPort 134 and port 445, all right.\n\n432\n00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.820\nWhat are these ports?\n\n433\n00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.151\nPorts like SMB and net bios.\n\n434\n00:23:57.151 --> 00:24:00.920\nAll right, well, what's port 443?\n\n435\n00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.614\nEncrypted web traffic, right?\n\n436\n00:24:03.614 --> 00:24:08.010\nSo I've got HTTPS that's out there going,\nyeah, I'm listening.\n\n437\n00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.590\nI'm sitting here listening.\nI'm just waiting.\n\n438\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.664\nBut then I've also got things like\nport 1723, what's that all about?\n\n439\n00:24:13.664 --> 00:24:17.280\nWell, I can tell right away\nthis is a remote access server.\n\n440\n00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.490\nWhy?\nCuz that is pptps.\n\n441\n00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.080\nPoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n442\n00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.096\nIf I see 1701 here, I know it's an server.\n\n443\n00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:28.900\nStill, it's doing some kind of VPN\ncommunications with a tunneling protocol.\n\n444\n00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.330\nWhat's this last one here?\n\n445\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.530\nOr actually,\nthis one right here is a common one.\n\n446\n00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.460\nThat's remote desktop protocol.\n\n447\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.470\nBut I can also see, for instance,\nthat I've got PowerShell remoting set up.\n\n448\n00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:38.980\nThat's a weird one there.\n\n449\n00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.170\nI had to actually look that one up.\n\n450\n00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.250\nI was like, well,\nI have no clue what that port is.\n\n451\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.490\nAll right, in another episode, we showed\nyou guys remote log management, right?\n\n452\n00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.220\nI had to set up PowerShell remoting,\nand guess what?\n\n453\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.210\nNow it's waiting for\nan incoming communication.\n\n454\n00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.350\nSo you can see some of the ports\nthat are here, all right?\n\n455\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.440\nNow, what is going on?\n\n456\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.100\nWhy do we have a bunch of TCP\nports that show information, and\n\n457\n00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.940\nwe have UDP ports that show\nabsolutely nothing, all right?\n\n458\n00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.910\nWhy is that?\n\n459\n00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.700\nUDP is connectionless service.\n\n460\n00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.350\nThere's no state to monitor.\n\n461\n00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.670\nThat's why it's got the asterisk here.\n\n462\n00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.700\nThere's no state to monitor.\n\n463\n00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.490\nSo, maybe that's not efficient for me.\n\n464\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.990\nWell, guess what?\n\n465\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.470\nI can also filter my protocol.\n\n466\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.760\nIf I know that I don't care about\nthe UDP communications, that's okay.\n\n467\n00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.680\nWe'll just do Netstat.\n\n468\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.770\nAll right, -p for protocol.\n\n469\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.440\nAnd I'll just do tcp, all right?\n\n470\n00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.180\nAnd we'll rerun it.\n\n471\n00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.090\nAnd it's gonna take a second,\nand it'll do the same thing.\n\n472\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.050\nBut what it shouldn't\ndo anymore is wait for\n\n473\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.990\nthe time that it takes to output\nthe udp information, all right?\n\n474\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.050\nCuz when it comes down to it,\n\n475\n00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:48.030\nit looks like I only got one transmission\ncontrol protocol established right now.\n\n476\n00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.890\nSo I can get to the information fast.\n\n477\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.580\nBut you can do this even\nfaster if you want, all right?\n\n478\n00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.760\nSee, what's going on here, and\nwhat takes a little bit, too,\n\n479\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.830\nis it's also doing things like\nname resolution in the background.\n\n480\n00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.350\nMaybe I don't want name resolution.\n\n481\n00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.340\nI just need quick,\neasy information, all right?\n\n482\n00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.650\nWell, rather than forcing,\nI can force it, if I want to.\n\n483\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.280\nI can do a Netstat -f, and I'm not\ngonna run that cuz it could take a bit.\n\n484\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.370\nBut what if I wanna optimize the output,\nall right?\n\n485\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:17.590\nI wanna get it a little quicker.\n\n486\n00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:19.730\nWell, I can choose n, right?\n\n487\n00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:23.200\nAnd when I run this,\nnotice how quickly that came up.\n\n488\n00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.240\nIt's cuz it's not trying\nto do name resolutions.\n\n489\n00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.780\nIt says here's the IP, here's the port.\n\n490\n00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.350\nIt's established.\n\n491\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.670\nThat's really good if you don't wanna wait\nfor all that other information to go off.\n\n492\n00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:33.367\nSo that's another thing that you can do,\ntoo.\n\n493\n00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:35.932\n&gt;&gt; Plus,\nit shows the port that it's connecting on,\n\n494\n00:26:35.932 --> 00:26:38.401\nwhereas with the name resolution,\nit does not.\n\n495\n00:26:38.401 --> 00:26:39.630\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.\n\n496\n00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.980\nNow, how about this?\n\n497\n00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.630\nHow about if I want a lot of information,\nbut I want it on per protocol, right?\n\n498\n00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.600\nWell, you can also do things\nlike per protocol statistics.\n\n499\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.766\nAnd this one here is one\nthat I really like, so\n\n500\n00:26:52.766 --> 00:26:56.136\nmuch that I'm about to throw my notes\nright off the table, all right?\n\n501\n00:26:56.136 --> 00:27:03.071\nLet's do Netstat space dash s.\n\n502\n00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:06.976\nAnd when I run this,\nI get per protocol statistics.\n\n503\n00:27:06.976 --> 00:27:08.110\nAnd these are really cool.\n\n504\n00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.510\nI like these because I\nsee IPv4 statistics.\n\n505\n00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:16.250\nI see things like, for instance, failed in\nfragmentation, kind of shows you we don't\n\n506\n00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.430\nhave any of that, that's actually\na really good thing, right?\n\n507\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.640\nI can see errors.\n\n508\n00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.220\nI can see discards, right?\n\n509\n00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.010\nIPv6 statistics.\n\n510\n00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.420\nICMPv4, right?\n\n511\n00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:31.410\nMaybe I find that for\nsome reason I look in here and I see TCP.\n\n512\n00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.280\nNotice that it says re-transmitted, right?\n\n513\n00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.640\nI've got what, 332?\n\n514\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.438\nWell, that's not bad out of 600,\nno 10,000.\n\n515\n00:27:39.438 --> 00:27:42.690\n10,961 segments received.\n\n516\n00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.423\nSo, TCP's doing its job because\nit only had to say woah, woah,\n\n517\n00:27:46.423 --> 00:27:49.688\nwoah about 332 of these\nneeded to be retransmitted.\n\n518\n00:27:49.688 --> 00:27:57.120\nBut what if it says 10,000 received, and\nit says 6,000 discarded or re-transmitted?\n\n519\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.350\nWell, that might be a sign that I've\ngot corruption going on somewhere, and\n\n520\n00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.200\nI've gotta figure it out.\n\n521\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.320\nWe've gotta start our\nprocess of elimination.\n\n522\n00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.030\nIs it a cable that's maybe on a high\nspeed network that isn't certified for\n\n523\n00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.120\nthe speeds and\nit's giving me errors, right?\n\n524\n00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.708\nIs it memory failing on this device?\n\n525\n00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:14.963\nI don't know.\n\n526\n00:28:14.963 --> 00:28:17.827\nBut it would give me some kind of\nindication that I need to look into it\n\n527\n00:28:17.827 --> 00:28:18.694\na littlbe bit more.\n\n528\n00:28:18.694 --> 00:28:22.547\nSo, there are reasons for\nthese individual statistics.\n\n529\n00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:27.217\nAnd it is another one that I really,\nreally like, alright?\n\n530\n00:28:27.217 --> 00:28:30.145\nNow, there's other things that you\ncan do as well, like for instance,\n\n531\n00:28:30.145 --> 00:28:31.932\nlet me do a little manipulation here, Dan.\n\n532\n00:28:31.932 --> 00:28:37.063\nI usually lock my machine down to where\nI don't give them network access,\n\n533\n00:28:37.063 --> 00:28:41.303\nbut I'm gonna play a little\nbit dangerous here, all right?\n\n534\n00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:47.000\nI'm gonna go ahead and we're gonna give\nthis machine just Internet access.\n\n535\n00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.500\n&gt;&gt; What's the IP address again?\n\n536\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.406\n&gt;&gt; Well, I'm not telling you.\n\n537\n00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:54.720\nAll right, so guys, the next thing\nI'm about to do, first of all,\n\n538\n00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.110\nwhen you got a live environment, you\nreally shouldn't give it network access.\n\n539\n00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.550\nAnd I can also tell you,\nyou shouldn't really be doing this, right?\n\n540\n00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.480\nBrowsing to the web from your server.\n\n541\n00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.100\nBut I want to be able to show you Netstat.\n\n542\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.720\nSo, I want to show you some of the\nconnections cuz it can do some other cool\n\n543\n00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.470\nstuff, too.\n\n544\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:13.663\nAll right, so for instance,\n\n545\n00:29:13.663 --> 00:29:18.863\nlet's go ahead and we'll do HTTPS,\n\n546\n00:29:18.863 --> 00:29:24.090\nwe'll go to ITPro.tv, all right?\n\n547\n00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.870\nAnd apparently I am not connected.\n\n548\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.542\nLet me see here real quick.\n\n549\n00:29:30.184 --> 00:29:34.460\nLet's just change that up\njust a little bit there.\n\n550\n00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.002\nThere we go.\n\n551\n00:29:35.002 --> 00:29:37.776\nGotta use some DHCP on the network for\nthat to help.\n\n552\n00:29:40.884 --> 00:29:44.740\nAll right, once that's done,\nlet me go and refresh that.\n\n553\n00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.510\nAnd we'll make that connection.\n\n554\n00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.640\nNow, here's something that I,\nwe we're connected, all right?\n\n555\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.760\nHere is another thing, all right?\n\n556\n00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.933\nWhen you have a connection\nthat's established,\n\n557\n00:29:55.933 --> 00:29:59.790\nand maybe you're doing application\ntrouble shooting, right?\n\n558\n00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:05.500\nEvery time an application makes\na connection to another computer,\n\n559\n00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.260\nit has something that'll show up.\n\n560\n00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.208\nIt has a connection that's\ngonna show up in Netstat.\n\n561\n00:30:09.208 --> 00:30:13.910\nBut, as you've seen,\nthe output is just a generic line.\n\n562\n00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.990\nIt shows us the source,\nthe foreign address, and\n\n563\n00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.730\nthen it shows us whether it's established.\n\n564\n00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.060\nWouldn't it be nice to have\na breadcrumb trail to go track and\n\n565\n00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.230\nfind out what application\nis making the connection?\n\n566\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.300\nWell, we can do that.\n\n567\n00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.822\nLet's go ahead this time,\nand let's run Netstat- 0.\n\n568\n00:30:31.775 --> 00:30:33.970\nAll right, now,\na little bit more information here.\n\n569\n00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.300\nBut what I really care\nabout more than anything\n\n570\n00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.410\nis that little process\nidentifier right there.\n\n571\n00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.140\nWhy does this help?\n\n572\n00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.680\nWell, maybe I'm a network technician\nthat's troubleshooting why\n\n573\n00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.460\nan application's using or\nnot using too many resources.\n\n574\n00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.750\nSo, what I can do is I can\ntake that process identifier,\n\n575\n00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.680\nI have no clue what this application is,\nI don't know.\n\n576\n00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.464\nBut what I can do is come over here, and\n\n577\n00:30:59.464 --> 00:31:04.075\nI can fire up something like\nTask Manager and go to Details, and\n\n578\n00:31:04.075 --> 00:31:09.295\ntake the information that I found\ninside of Netstat, come down here and\n\n579\n00:31:09.295 --> 00:31:14.603\nlook for, what was it, 1784, I think,\nand see if we could find it.\n\n580\n00:31:16.303 --> 00:31:17.837\nAnd maybe I can, maybe I can't.\n\n581\n00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:23.020\nOkay, so it's the sv host.\n\n582\n00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.770\nAnd that really tells me a lot\nwith 17 other sv hosts running.\n\n583\n00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:32.010\nAll right, but I will show you, let's see,\nwas there another one in there?\n\n584\n00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.670\nYeah, 4092.\nI would almost bet that that's the process\n\n585\n00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:36.890\nidentifier for Internet Explorer.\n\n586\n00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.030\nLet me test that theory, all right?\n\n587\n00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.620\nWhat was that again, Dan, that was 4092?\n\n588\n00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.670\nLet's see where 4092 is in this list.\n\n589\n00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:50.180\nAnd, sure enough, I can find out that\nthe application that's consuming\n\n590\n00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.100\nthe resources in that connection, in this\ncase, as example, is Internet Explorer.\n\n591\n00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.100\nBut if this is another application that's,\nmaybe it's a headless application.\n\n592\n00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.510\nNo, I'm not talking about\nthe headless horseman.\n\n593\n00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.620\nI'm just saying it doesn't\nhave a CGI front end.\n\n594\n00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.980\nYou're only on the back\nend with the server.\n\n595\n00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:10.210\nI might not have a nice pretty GUI to look\nat and say, I need to do a tweak here,\n\n596\n00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.650\nI need to do something here,\nI can find that service.\n\n597\n00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:17.840\nWell, with Netstat, I can correlate\nthe process identifier that I found here\n\n598\n00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.870\nwith the process identifier\ninside of Task Manager.\n\n599\n00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.130\nAnd I can start to narrow down\nthe source based on its connection and\n\n600\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.710\nstart to do some more research.\n\n601\n00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:32.320\nSo you can see in situations like this\nwhere Netstat can be very powerful.\n\n602\n00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.960\nOne last thing I'd like to say on Netstat,\nI will tell you guys, we typically don't\n\n603\n00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.690\ndo this with Netstat, but let me just\nshow you something that's kinda cool.\n\n604\n00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.920\nNetstat -r shows you the routing table.\n\n605\n00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:44.110\nThat's pretty cool.\n\n606\n00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.830\nI mean, let's be honest guys, honestly,\n\n607\n00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.300\nif I'm gonna show the routing table,\nI'm going to do a route print, and\n\n608\n00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.230\nI'll probably filter it and\njust say show me the IPv4 information.\n\n609\n00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:59.100\nYes, you can do that with Netstat,\nbut the only limitation to it is\n\n610\n00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.740\nshow me the whole routing table\nincluding the IPv6 route.\n\n611\n00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.130\nYou don't get to filter it.\n\n612\n00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:07.330\nBut it just shows you that there's a lot\nof functionality built into the network\n\n613\n00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.810\nstatistics utility.\n\n614\n00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.940\nYou just have to make sure that\nyou understand those switches,\n\n615\n00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.580\nlike Dan mentioned earlier, so\nthat you can use this for troubleshooting.\n\n616\n00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.780\nIt’s not just for the exam purposes.\n\n617\n00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.710\nWe really like this utility, and you\nguys gotta use it, be familiar with it.\n\n618\n00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.460\nBe familiar with some of the switches and\n\n619\n00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.330\nsome of the scenarios that you might\nuse it like we've shown you here so\n\n620\n00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.670\nthat you can pretty much pass\nany question that they ask you.\n\n621\n00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.490\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nIt's a really good tool to be able to find\n\n622\n00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.740\nmalware connections on your machine,\n\n623\n00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.310\ncuz they like to hide themselves as\ndifferent system looking processes.\n\n624\n00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.670\nYou find that process ID, what's this?\n\n625\n00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.385\nGo check it out, see where it's looking,\nsee what it's doing.\n\n626\n00:33:43.385 --> 00:33:45.930\nAnd you see,\nit's got high utilization on our network.\n\n627\n00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.330\nLet me kill that real quick and\nsee what happens.\n\n628\n00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:51.040\nAnd then you can continue the process\nof troubleshooting from there.\n\n629\n00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.490\nBut it's a really cool tool.\n\n630\n00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.568\nWes, you've done a great job of walking\nus through a lot of the functionality in\n\n631\n00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:57.470\nNetstat.\n\n632\n00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.320\nIt's really an unsung hero\nof the networking world.\n\n633\n00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.020\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n634\n00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.610\n&gt;&gt; So get comfortable with using it.\n\n635\n00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.910\nThat being said, I know we have\nmany more things to go through.\n\n636\n00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:08.660\nBut we have so little time to, actually,\n\n637\n00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.420\nwe have no time in this episode\nanyway to make that happen.\n\n638\n00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.200\nSo it looks like we're staring\ndown the barrel of a part two.\n\n639\n00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.570\nThe being said, we do thank you for\njoining us and we thank you for watching.\n\n640\n00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.670\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n641\n00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.370\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n642\n00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.190\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:11.993\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:15.082\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ theories.\n\n5\n00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:15.863\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:20.290\nIf you have been following along, you will\nnotice that this is actually a part two,\n\n7\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.212\na continuation where we would be\nanalyzing different types of output from\n\n8\n00:00:24.212 --> 00:00:25.880\ndifferent tools.\n\n9\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.868\nIn the previous episode, you were able to\nsee tools such as ipconfig, ifconfig, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:32.430\nalso netstat.\n\n11\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.300\nIn this show, we're going to pick\nup right back in that command line.\n\n12\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.120\nWes Bryan in studios to help us with that,\nthank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.330\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, thank you for being here\nand thank you for standing in for Dan,\n\n15\n00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.300\nwe do appreciate it.\n\n16\n00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.124\nThat's right, so we're coming back.\n\n17\n00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:48.075\nRemember the first part,\nlike Cherokee said,\n\n18\n00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:50.970\nwe looked at the various things that\nyou can do with ipconfig, right?\n\n19\n00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.412\nBecause one of the first\nthings we think of,\n\n20\n00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:57.769\nif you're familiar with that utility is\nthat it allows us to do things like view\n\n21\n00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.030\nthe IP configuration of our interface.\n\n22\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.150\nRemember, if config,\n\n23\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.630\nif you're in the Linux world, they even\ngot a version of it here in Mac as well.\n\n24\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.660\nRemember that it's a little bit different,\nit shows your entire interface statistics,\n\n25\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.412\nwhere the statistics of ipconfig\nreally just deal with IP in general,\n\n26\n00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:16.210\nIP configuration.\n\n27\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.280\nBut we also showed you\nhow ipconfig is good for\n\n28\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.640\ntesting things like name resolution or\nthe lack of name resolution, right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460\nShowing you your local resolver cache,\n\n30\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.980\nas well as doing things like\nflushing that local resolver cache.\n\n31\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.410\nThen we did get into,\nfor instance, netstat.\n\n32\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.340\nSo if those don't sound familiar with you,\ngo ahead and go back and\n\n33\n00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700\nwatch those and then came back and\njoin us for part two.\n\n34\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.190\nNow we mentioned a little briefly and\nI know I was using it on and\n\n35\n00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.860\noff in the first part of this episode,\nwe talked about a utility called ping and\n\n36\n00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.400\nthat's what we're gonna start out with.\n\n37\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.410\nPing, the packet internet groper.\n\n38\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.810\nI can't tell you for the life of me\nwhere they come up with these names,\n\n39\n00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.240\nbut ping, ping has been a utility\nthat has been around for awhile.\n\n40\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.640\nIt's in all of your\nmajor operating systems.\n\n41\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.100\nDoesn't matter if you're on a Windows box,\nif you're on a Linux machine,\n\n42\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.490\nif you're in a Unix machine, if you're on\nMac if you will, ping has been around.\n\n43\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.440\nIt is a very good utility, it allows us to\ntest the communications between two end\n\n44\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.240\npoints on an IP-based network.\n\n45\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.060\nSo let's go ahead and let's kinda\ntalk about how we would utilize ping.\n\n46\n00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.870\nNow ping, a lot of times we'll\njump in a we'll just try to see,\n\n47\n00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.760\nhey, can we reach a system?\n\n48\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.300\nFor instance, here on my Mac\nif I fire up a terminal, and\n\n49\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.650\nI decide that, well, let's make that\na little bit bigger so you guys can see.\n\n50\n00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130\nAnd I do, let's say ping, and\nI want to find out if I can hit,\n\n51\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.630\nI think it's level three's,\nDNS servers out there in Atlanta, right?\n\n52\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.280\nI just fire off a ping and\nsee it gives me replies back,\n\n53\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.880\nlet's me know that I'm connected.\n\n54\n00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.790\nBut is that an accurate\nway to really use ping?\n\n55\n00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.450\nMaybe at times it is, but\nsometimes the problem\n\n56\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.220\ndoesn't resolve itself as fast, so\nwe have to use ping in a series of steps.\n\n57\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.720\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and\nstop this ping here.\n\n58\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.420\nAnd I wanna talk about those steps and\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n59\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.500\nAll right, when we use ping, I like to\ntell people to start from the inside or\n\n60\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.030\nfrom as close to your system that you're\nusing the ping utility with and work to\n\n61\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.440\nthe way to the edge of your network and\nthen if you can, beyond your network.\n\n62\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.825\nSo, for instance, if I wanna use ping and\nwe've got this machine.\n\n63\n00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:24.210\nAnd I've got a couple of networks here.\n\n64\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.760\nAnd I'm just gonna kind\nof move this to the side.\n\n65\n00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.058\nIt's gonna get in the way, but I've got\nthis machine and it can't communicate.\n\n66\n00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:32.186\nI don't know why it can't communicate,\nbut it can't communicate.\n\n67\n00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:37.586\nI suspect that I can use the ping\nutility maybe to diagnose the problem or\n\n68\n00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:41.500\neven kind of tell me where\nthe issue might resolve.\n\n69\n00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.922\nSo how do I go about using ping if\nit is something like this machine?\n\n70\n00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:50.233\nAll right, well, we start as locally\nas we can from this machine, and\n\n71\n00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:54.030\nthen what we do is we work our way\nto the edge of our network, and\n\n72\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.174\nthen maybe beyond the network\nto another network or\n\n73\n00:03:57.174 --> 00:04:01.809\nin this case like you see me do,\njust setting a ping out to 4.2.2.1.\n\n74\n00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.900\nIt's a top level domain\nDNS server out there.\n\n75\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.330\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna work as close\n\n76\n00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.240\nto our computer as we can and\nthen we're gonna step our way out and\n\n77\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.610\neventually progress off\nof our network as well.\n\n78\n00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.540\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying, Wes,\nis basically we're gonna be testing to see\n\n79\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.000\nwho or whom this individual system can or\ncannot communicate with?\n\n80\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n81\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.960\nSo how do we go about doing that?\n\n82\n00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.560\nWell, the very first thing I'm gonna do,\nhow local can you ping, right?\n\n83\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.480\nWhen we say start with yourself and work\nyour way out to the edge of your network.\n\n84\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.690\nWell, how do we do that?\n\n85\n00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.170\nWell, the first thing we do is we\nping what's known as the loopback\n\n86\n00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.890\naddress, right?\n\n87\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.310\nWe have an address that we've talked about\nin other episodes as we've gone through\n\n88\n00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.640\nthe Network+ series.\n\n89\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.820\nAnd one of those addresses is\ncalled the loopback address, right?\n\n90\n00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.180\nWhen we showed you guys the classical\nsystems and the IP ranges,\n\n91\n00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.610\nwe told you that 127.0.0.0 network,\n\n92\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.910\nthe whole entire network range is\nreserved for loop back processing.\n\n93\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:11.110\nNow some systems will allow you to\nping other addresses within that\n\n94\n00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.880\nnetwork other that is traditionally is\nknown as the loop back, 127.0.0.1, right?\n\n95\n00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.860\nNow what does that actually do for us?\n\n96\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.320\nWell, it's called the loop back,\n\n97\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.477\nthey talk about it being there for\ntesting the software, right?\n\n98\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.500\nWell, it's called loopback cuz what\nhappens is if you look at the OSI model,\n\n99\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.630\nwhat it does is it goes down the layers,\ndown to the network stack and\n\n100\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.030\nit loops back up and it gives your\noutput back at the application layer.\n\n101\n00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.030\nThat's why they call it a loopback.\n\n102\n00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.720\nIf you look at the OSI model, it's\nlooping, going down the layer looping back\n\n103\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.150\nto the network and looping back up\nto the application layer, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.120\nSo what is it actually doing for\nus when we say testing software?\n\n105\n00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.230\nWell, it's testing the ability\nof my operating system to speak\n\n106\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.245\nthe TCP/IP protocol stack, right?\n\n107\n00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:57.580\nSo very first thing I need to know,\nif I can't speak with the network,\n\n108\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.270\ndoes my operating system even\nknow how to speak that language?\n\n109\n00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.340\nAnd that's what we're testing.\n\n110\n00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.190\nSo, for instance, if I'm in,\nwhat am I on here?\n\n111\n00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.260\nThis is a Windows machine?\n\n112\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.400\nYeah, well, its a Windows machine but\nit's a client, right?\n\n113\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.040\nAnd it doesn't matter if\nwe're on client or server,\n\n114\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.930\nI'm going to do this,\ncouple different machines here, all right.\n\n115\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.930\nBut we'll go ahead, and\nwe'll get logged into this machine here.\n\n116\n00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.580\nAll right, now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna just fire up a command prompt.\n\n117\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.450\nIn this case I'm gonna use a PowerShell.\n\n118\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.308\nI pretty much stick with PoowerShell cuz\nI can run command prompt in it, guys,\n\n119\n00:06:29.308 --> 00:06:33.500\nthis will work with traditional command\nprompt like it will with PowerShell.\n\n120\n00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.220\nSo let's go ahead and do that,\nlet's test the software and\n\n121\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.370\nmake sure that this operating system\nhere does know how to speak, well,\n\n122\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.260\nTCPIP protocol stack lingo here.\n\n123\n00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.950\nSo we're gonna do a ping and\nwe're gonna do a 127.0.0.1.\n\n124\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.100\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nrun this ping.\n\n125\n00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.715\nNow you'll notice what's happening here,\nright?\n\n126\n00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:55.905\nWe're sending four messages out, right?\n\n127\n00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:57.765\nNot technically, and\nI'll get to that point in a second.\n\n128\n00:06:57.765 --> 00:07:02.945\nBut we're sending four messages out and\nwe're hoping to get replies back, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:04.330\nSo what is going on here?\n\n130\n00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.190\nPing the loop back address.\n\n131\n00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.100\nWell, this is actually\ntesting the software.\n\n132\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.690\nDoes the operating system know how\nto speak TCP/IP and, in general,\n\n133\n00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.010\nthe protocol suite?\n\n134\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.040\nAnd this lets me know that,\nyes, it does, all right?\n\n135\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.320\nThis didn't send any\nelectrical communications.\n\n136\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.430\nRemember, we didn't go down\nto the physical layer.\n\n137\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.370\nWe quite literally, as loop back implies,\n\n138\n00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.770\nwent to the network layer and\nback up, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.620\nBut now,\nwe have find out a little bit more.\n\n140\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.850\nSo we're gonna start to work our way\nout onto the network and then beyond.\n\n141\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.680\nSo the next thing that we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna do something like pinging\n\n142\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.030\nthe local IP address.\n\n143\n00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.600\nNow, I'm pretty sure you can do this.\n\n144\n00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.685\nJust say ping localhost and it'll work but\n\n145\n00:07:44.685 --> 00:07:48.803\nit kinda translates it into\nthe IPv6 loopback address.\n\n146\n00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.465\nYou might as well know that too, right?\n\n147\n00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:55.076\nPing six, we can also do a ping v6,\nping-6 in For\n\n148\n00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:58.096\ninstance, let me show you here.\n\n149\n00:07:58.096 --> 00:08:01.000\nI have somewhere around here.\n\n150\n00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.030\nI have my CentOS box.\n\n151\n00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.710\nOne of these.\n\n152\n00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.240\nOkay.\nSo for instance if I get in here,\n\n153\n00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.290\nI got ping.\n\n154\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:14.590\nI could do a ping 127-0-0-1 here,\nand notice down here.\n\n155\n00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.360\nI don't know if I'll be\nable to do this real good.\n\n156\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.060\nOkay, there we go.\n\n157\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.660\nNotice that it's also pinging here, too.\n\n158\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.010\nOne of the differences that you'll notice\nright away between the Windows environment\n\n159\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:31.180\nping and the Linux World is that\nthe Linux world is persistent.\n\n160\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.180\nThat's why it keeps going here.\n\n161\n00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.150\nAnd you'll notice that when we were in\nthe server here it stopped after four.\n\n162\n00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.370\nI could, if I want,\nI could make this a persistent ping\n\n163\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.410\nif I wanted inside of Windows\ntoo I could do a 127.0.0.1.\n\n164\n00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.710\nAnd I didn't make it persistent,\nnothing changed.\n\n165\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.810\nAnd I can put a /t at the end of it,\nand again,\n\n166\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.900\nit just makes sure that it keeps going.\n\n167\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.590\nI don't think you're gonna have to worry\nabout that for the exam but I want you to\n\n168\n00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.600\nshow you that the ping utility is in both\nyour Linux systems, your Mac systems.\n\n169\n00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.640\nIn fact, we can switch over to the\nterminal on my Mac and we can show ping.\n\n170\n00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.070\nI also want you to know that\nyou could ping IPP version six.\n\n171\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.500\nSo I will show you that here in\na second here but let me go ahead and\n\n172\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.380\nshow me the next thing that\nwe would need to ping.\n\n173\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.810\nNow that I know that the IP address, or at\nleast the loopback address, is responding,\n\n174\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.420\nI know that the operating system knows\nthat link, or knows that language.\n\n175\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.900\nThe next thing I have to figure out is,\n\n176\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.780\nwhat happens if my network\nadapter's called upon?\n\n177\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.000\nHe say, Wes how do they call\non your network adapter.\n\n178\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.960\nWhat do you mean there?\n\n179\n00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.720\nWell, when somebody's gonna send me some\ninformation on my network, guess what?\n\n180\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.580\nThat's a call.\n\n181\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.110\nI'm calling you by your IP address and in\n\n182\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.640\nthis case it's probably the intermediate\ndevices between source and destination.\n\n183\n00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.050\nCould be the routers but\n\n184\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.390\nit's essentially can your network\nadapter respond when it's called upon?\n\n185\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.850\nWell, how do we find that out?\n\n186\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.710\nWell, let's go ahead, and let's jump\nback to my Windows machine here.\n\n187\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.970\nGive us a little more real\nestate on the screen.\n\n188\n00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.890\nAnd what we're gonna do here\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n189\n00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.130\nwe're gonna use ipconfig.\n\n190\n00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.890\nAnd I'm gonna use the short\nversion of ipconfig and\n\n191\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.660\nI'm gonna find out what my IP address is,\nand I can see, it's right there.\n\n192\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.640\nSo now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nping the IP address of the local machine,\n\n193\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.800\nthis local machine here, and\nI'm gonna run that ping.\n\n194\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.630\nNow, what I wanna know,\ncan I get replies back?\n\n195\n00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:21.870\nAnd if I get replies back what this means\nis that my network adapter can respond\n\n196\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.060\nto its IP address, it knows and\nit understands its IP address, so\n\n197\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.760\nI now know at least from the stand\npoint of this computer right,\n\n198\n00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.030\nwe take that comparative back\nto my network diagram here.\n\n199\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.920\nI know that from the point\nof this computer right here\n\n200\n00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.034\nthat it is communicating with the network,\n\n201\n00:10:40.034 --> 00:10:45.430\nall right it knows TCPIP built\ninto the DNA of the software.\n\n202\n00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.470\nIt can speak it.\n\n203\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.930\nIt knows how to respond\nto its own ip address.\n\n204\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.640\nSo what's the next portion?\n\n205\n00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.240\nHow do we get a little bit closer\nto the edge of our network?\n\n206\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.750\nWell now I might ping maybe\nanother device within the network.\n\n207\n00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.630\nRight, and I want to find,\ncan I communicate with other devices on my\n\n208\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.920\nnetwork and the answer is well, there's\na big line on the screen, I'm not sure.\n\n209\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.570\nLet's find out, all right.\n\n210\n00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.320\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\n\n211\n00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.125\nyou know I don't know honestly what\nthe the IP address of my sent boxes.\n\n212\n00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:14.705\nLet's try that.\n\n213\n00:11:16.265 --> 00:11:20.785\nLet's do an IP adder, and let me find out.\n\n214\n00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:23.275\nOkay, 10.0.14.221, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:23.275 --> 00:11:25.972\nSo, let me find out if I can ping\nanother device within my network.\n\n216\n00:11:25.972 --> 00:11:27.111\n10.0.\n\n217\n00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:31.110\nWhat was that?\n\n218\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.129\n14.251, okay.\n\n219\n00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:35.724\nSo .14.251.\n\n220\n00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:38.680\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nput the persistent thing here so\n\n221\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.620\nI can,\nyou actually got to run ping by the way.\n\n222\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.330\nThat does help.\n\n223\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.330\n&gt;&gt; And this is gonna be really helpful\nbecause sometimes you have intermittent\n\n224\n00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.690\nproblems so\nyou'll get a larger sample window there.\n\n225\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.770\nAnd I've actually had a situation\nbefore where there was a correlation,\n\n226\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.390\nwhenever the cubicle was\nbeing bumped by the neighbor,\n\n227\n00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.050\nthen they would lose that connection and\nit was due to a simple cable being bent.\n\n228\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.410\nSo this is such an easy tool that you\ncan use to help identify the problems.\n\n229\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.060\n&gt;&gt; And those intermittent connectivities\nI'm sure as you probably bang your head\n\n230\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.230\nagainst the wall trying to\nfigure out what was going on.\n\n231\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.350\nThey can be really difficult.\n\n232\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.780\nAnd you might not even notice it in\nfour pings, so great point there.\n\n233\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.160\nNow, at this point,\n\n234\n00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.960\nI know that this server in this case\nis talking to the other server right.\n\n235\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.930\nI got a Windows machine talking to a Cent\nOS box here and they are communicating.\n\n236\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.820\nSo from the perspective of our network,\n\n237\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.990\nlet's say I can see that there\nis another line in there.\n\n238\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.840\nYou know what I'm just going to\nget rid of that circle there.\n\n239\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.520\nI know that this machine can talk\ndirectly to that machine, right?\n\n240\n00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.170\nSo I know that I have\ncommunications within my network.\n\n241\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.520\nNow, how about this?\n\n242\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.220\nHow far off our network can we get?\n\n243\n00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.600\nSo for instance,\ncan I communicate with the router right?\n\n244\n00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.040\nThat is the edge of my network right?\n\n245\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.720\nThat's why we call it the gateway.\n\n246\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.530\nSo the next thing I have to do once I\nknow that I can ping a device within my\n\n247\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.030\nnetwork.\n\n248\n00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.700\nNow I have to figure out can I talk to the\ndoorway that leads off of my network in\n\n249\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.500\nthis case the gateway?\n\n250\n00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.240\nAnd that's where we would\nrun the next ping all right.\n\n251\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.310\nSo with the next ping go ahead and\ncontrol c this.\n\n252\n00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.050\nWe'll use our ip config utility that\nwe used in the first part of this\n\n253\n00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.710\nseries here, and we'll find out\nwhat are default gateway is, boy,\n\n254\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.995\nthat default gateway makes it,\nI can probably retype that.\n\n255\n00:13:23.995 --> 00:13:26.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I can see my default gateway and\n\n256\n00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.340\nlet me not just take this for granted\nguys that you know what I'm looking at.\n\n257\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.000\nSorry, let me kinda, just to remind you,\nremember what we're doing with ipconfig.\n\n258\n00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.420\nI'm looking at the IP properties\nof the network adaptor, right?\n\n259\n00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.580\nIn this case I'm looking\nat the default gateway.\n\n260\n00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.610\nSo now what we'll do is we'll go ahead and\n\n261\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.780\nwe'll see if we can ping\nthe default gateway.\n\n262\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.500\nIn this case, the router, or I happen to\nknow that this is a layer three switch in\n\n263\n00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.830\nthe background and\nwe'll ping that, all right.\n\n264\n00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.100\nSo at this point,\n\n265\n00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:55.150\nwhat I can see is that yes, I can\ncommunicate with the default gateway.\n\n266\n00:13:55.150 --> 00:14:01.010\nSo from the perspective of this computer,\nits communications are just fine.\n\n267\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.370\nSo let's say if you were troubleshooting.\n\n268\n00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.120\nLet me give you a scenario.\n\n269\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.230\nMaybe I'm troubleshooting why I can't\ncommunicate with a website, right,\n\n270\n00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.100\nthat's out there on the Internet.\n\n271\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.340\nAnd this point,\nyou wouldn't tell anything is wrong.\n\n272\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.150\nWhy?\n\n273\n00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.930\nWell because inside of my network\nI've communicated with another,\n\n274\n00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.800\nmyself, I talked to myself to\nget the best answers, right?\n\n275\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.310\nI talked to a device within my network and\n\n276\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.850\nthen I talked to\nthe gatekeeper essentially.\n\n277\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.800\nSo now what do we have to do?\n\n278\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.320\nWell, the last step that I'll like to\ntell you is to ping beyond your get\n\n279\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.280\nway, all right?\n\n280\n00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.710\nIn this case if we are trouble\nshooting why I can't communicate with\n\n281\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.960\na website out there, I need to find out.\n\n282\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.990\nCan I communicate with a device on\nthe other side of my network all right?\n\n283\n00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.520\nNow here's where something could\nget a little bit tricky on you.\n\n284\n00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.150\nNotice I've been using ip addresses.\n\n285\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.540\nYes you could do this by name all right.\n\n286\n00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.000\nBut when you start doing it by name now\nyou're troubleshooting a couple of things.\n\n287\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.200\n&gt;&gt; You're introducing\nadditional variables Wes.\n\n288\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nthe more variables you introduce,\n\n289\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.630\nthe more problems you introduce,\na good point there.\n\n290\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.260\nSo I'm just doing this by IP address.\n\n291\n00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.000\nIn fact let me show you what I mean here.\n\n292\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.560\nIf I did a ping, let's say if I can\nfind it on the network, I'm not sure.\n\n293\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.560\nSo I did a ping srv02.\n\n294\n00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.880\nAnd I'm not sure if it's going to\nresolve that name, there we go.\n\n295\n00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.780\nWe'll do something that I\nknow that is out there.\n\n296\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.960\nWe'll ping good old Google, or something\nlike that, if I can spell Google.\n\n297\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:34.470\nAll right, now notice that the name\nhere is resolved to an IP address.\n\n298\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.070\nIf you'll see, well, boy,\nyou can definitely see that.\n\n299\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.090\nAll right,\nnotice how it resolved the name here.\n\n300\n00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.850\n&gt;&gt; Even I can see that.\n\n301\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.080\n&gt;&gt; So like Cherokee said,\nI'm introducing another variable here,\n\n302\n00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.170\ncuz I'm, now is DNS working over here?\n\n303\n00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.600\n&gt;&gt; You're hoping DNS is working properly.\n\n304\n00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.450\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n305\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.579\nSo guys just for\nthe sake of the this example,\n\n306\n00:15:51.579 --> 00:15:54.003\nyes you could use ping to\ntest DNS name resolution.\n\n307\n00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:57.161\nWe can also use another utility\nthat we'll talk about nslookup, but\n\n308\n00:15:57.161 --> 00:15:59.128\nI'm trying to keep DNS\nout of the mix here.\n\n309\n00:15:59.128 --> 00:16:01.257\nSo that's why I'm using IP addresses.\n\n310\n00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:06.910\nSo I could use something like Google\nto ping past my gateway, right?\n\n311\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.420\nSo I could turn around and say, okay,\nping, if I happened to just memorize one\n\n312\n00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.742\nof their hundreds of addresses,\nI'm sure they've got, 4.59.90.221, right?\n\n313\n00:16:15.742 --> 00:16:20.440\nAnd if I get replies back, but I probably\ndon't and I don't, I'll tell you.\n\n314\n00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.933\nEven having it written down,\nI don't know what that number is.\n\n315\n00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:25.218\nSo there are some numbers that I use.\n\n316\n00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:27.344\nI'll tell you one that Google\nhas that I do know, right?\n\n317\n00:16:27.344 --> 00:16:30.100\nPing, 8.8.8.8, right?\n\n318\n00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.820\nWhen I run that ping,\nthat's one of their public DNS servers.\n\n319\n00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.220\nIt returns replies.\n\n320\n00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.190\nSo now what that's letting me know\nin relationship to this little map\n\n321\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.740\nI got going here is that I can\nping talking, in this case,\n\n322\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.560\nthrough the switch to the router.\n\n323\n00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.170\nAnd that the router can communicate\nout here to the Internet and\n\n324\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.870\nit can reply back to me.\n\n325\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:55.420\nSo now I know that from the perspective\nof my network, that what happen?\n\n326\n00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.840\nI could communicate with myself,\nI can talk to myself essentially,\n\n327\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.390\nI can communicate with\nsomebody else on my network,\n\n328\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.330\nI could communicate with the gatekeeper,\nand\n\n329\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.290\nnow I can go past the gatekeeper,\nthe default gateway in this point.\n\n330\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.730\nSo from the perspective of this computer,\ncommunications are just fine.\n\n331\n00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.480\nSo if you still have problems,\nyou can pretty much guarantee that your\n\n332\n00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.260\nproblem probably isn't with\nthe IP addresses themselves.\n\n333\n00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.880\nNow it could still be name resolution,\nright?\n\n334\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.190\nWe could put that into play as well, but\nthat's one of the great ways to use ping.\n\n335\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.780\n&gt;&gt; And you'll also be showing\nus a tool here shortly, netstat,\n\n336\n00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.420\nwhich can help us identify issues that\nare happening outside of our control or\n\n337\n00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.800\nout on the Internet there.\n\n338\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.720\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n339\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.970\nSo let's go ahead and the next one\nthat we're gonna talk about is, well,\n\n340\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.580\nthis one's also been around and this\none is a utility as well as a protocol.\n\n341\n00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.680\nWe don't have a protocol called ping,\nwe have a utility called ping.\n\n342\n00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.570\nHowever, the next one is not only\na protocol, it's also a utility and\n\n343\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.170\nit's called ARP.\n\n344\n00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.920\nNow ARP is in your systems and\nwhy would we use ARP?\n\n345\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.430\nWell, ARP,\nunderstand what ARP does, right?\n\n346\n00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:02.180\nIf you remember, that's one of those weird\nprotocols that sits between the networking\n\n347\n00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.430\nlayer and\nin between the data link layer, right?\n\n348\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:11.760\nAnd basically since IP knows nothing about\nMAC addresses, it hands the IP address to\n\n349\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.140\nARP and ARP calls out on the network and\nsays all right, who has this IP address?\n\n350\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.520\nI need the MAC address, right?\n\n351\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.038\nAnd that's called an echo, or\nthat's called an ARP request.\n\n352\n00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:26.230\nAnd then an ARP reply is the broadcast\ncommunication received by everybody is\n\n353\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.210\nalso received by the person, or\nthe device that has the IP address.\n\n354\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.840\nAnd says, yeah, that's my IP address,\nyou can find me at this MAC address and\n\n355\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.740\nit reports that back.\n\n356\n00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.800\nBut sometimes you might have one of those\ngratuitous ARPs where it's not a request\n\n357\n00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.880\nat all, it's just a reply.\n\n358\n00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.750\nThey do things like ARP poisoning attacks,\nand\n\n359\n00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.570\nit doesn't necessarily have to be\nsecurity of [INAUDIBLE] either.\n\n360\n00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:51.910\nAll right, you could want to\nmaybe statically map IP to MAC\n\n361\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.170\naddress maybe you're connecting to an IP\ncamera that you don't know its IP address.\n\n362\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.550\nAnd you don't have the ability to\ncommunicate with any other work but\n\n363\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.200\na crossover cable, I could put a static\nentry inside of my ARP table and\n\n364\n00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.320\nconnect right to the IP camera.\n\n365\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.270\nLet me show you ARP here, by the way.\n\n366\n00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.220\nSo if I'm running this utility, and I've\nbeen running in here on Windows, guys.\n\n367\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.110\nWe could be running in Unix or\nLinux as well.\n\n368\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.650\nI just chose Windows here,\nand I run ARP, all right?\n\n369\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.520\nIf you run it by itself, it just gives\nyou the output and the options, right?\n\n370\n00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.290\nIf I wanna, for instance, to display the\nARP, I almost said the routing table, but\n\n371\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.817\nthe ARP table, I guess it would be\nLAN routing, [LAUGH] ARP table.\n\n372\n00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:34.470\nI can do something like this,\nI can do an ARP -a, and\n\n373\n00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.540\nit shows me all of the ARP,\n\n374\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.320\nor actually IP to MAC address mappings,\nthat my computer is aware of, all right?\n\n375\n00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.760\nNow, dynamic, notice this,all right,\ndynamic, dynamic, dynamic.\n\n376\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.260\nWhat that means for us inside of this\nARP table is that these addresses,\n\n377\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.250\nI say addresses, IP addresses to MAC\naddress mappings, have been put in this\n\n378\n00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:03.120\nARP table because at one point\nthe router called out to the network and\n\n379\n00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:10.430\nsaid who's this MAC address or\nwho's this IP to MAC address on my behalf.\n\n380\n00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:15.340\nAnd then, when I got the response back,\nI stored it in my ARP table, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:21.190\nNow, the problem is maybe one\nof these dynamic entries,\n\n382\n00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.770\nmaybe you don't want that in there.\n\n383\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.300\nMaybe it's somebody doing ARP poisoning\nattack on your network, where they're\n\n384\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.040\ntelling you, I know what that MAC address\nis, that's the legitimate MAC address.\n\n385\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.530\nBut every time somebody calls out and\n\n386\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:38.190\nasks IP address, I'm gonna give you bogus\ninformation that says it's my MAC address.\n\n387\n00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:43.990\nAnd now every time people think they're\nsending it to Cherokee's computer,\n\n388\n00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.330\nit's actually being rerouted\nto my computer, all right?\n\n389\n00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.450\nSo you can also do things like,\nfor instance,\n\n390\n00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.720\nclearing the ARP cache if you want to.\n\n391\n00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.569\nAnd I can't remember,\nI wanna say it's just arp -d and\n\n392\n00:20:56.569 --> 00:20:59.720\njust like if you're in Linux, right?\n\n393\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.740\nYou're gonna be an administrator\nprivileges you'd have to do your sudo.\n\n394\n00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.320\nI got to remember manipulation\nof the ARP table does require\n\n395\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.900\nadministrative level privilege.\n\n396\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.490\nSo, my bad on that one.\n\n397\n00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.980\n&gt;&gt; All right, so you're just gonna\nbe deleting your ARP cache here?\n\n398\n00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.120\nAnd like you had mentioned, someone\ncould even add in those static entries,\n\n399\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.990\nto go ahead and poison that information.\n\n400\n00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.700\nSo, for instance, you could put,\nif I think I'm communicating with my\n\n401\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.570\ndefault gateway,\nI could put my Cherokee's laptop.\n\n402\n00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.420\nAnd then I get to be sinister here,\nand look at all that traffic as it's\n\n403\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.290\ntraversing my laptop instead of\nthat legitimate network device.\n\n404\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.220\n&gt;&gt; And that would be the ARP\npoisoning attack, yeah.\n\n405\n00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.220\nBecause you're getting, essentially bogus\ninformation in somebody else's cache, for\n\n406\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.660\nthe purposes of redirecting them.\n\n407\n00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.170\nNow again, like I said,\n\n408\n00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.030\nit doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a security implementation.\n\n409\n00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:52.180\nYou could say, hey,\nI wanna make sure that I statically map,\n\n410\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.190\nlet's say for instance,\nI got a VPN communication.\n\n411\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.520\nI've got two default gateways,\nand one goes to the VPN,\n\n412\n00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.740\nand one just goes out to the Internet.\n\n413\n00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.080\nWell, how do I map two default gateways\non one system that only has one entry for\n\n414\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.550\nthat property?\n\n415\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.810\nI put a static entry in there and\nI say this traffic.\n\n416\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.703\n&gt;&gt; Legitimate.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this time it's legitimate though.\n\n417\n00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:10.073\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, thank you for\n\n418\n00:22:10.073 --> 00:22:11.325\ncorrecting me on that one.\n\n419\n00:22:11.325 --> 00:22:12.635\nNow I just deleted the r table.\n\n420\n00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:13.625\nIn fact let me show here.\n\n421\n00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.865\nIt's probably rebuilt some of it already.\n\n422\n00:22:15.865 --> 00:22:19.085\nIn fact if I do, arp -d, deletes it.\n\n423\n00:22:19.085 --> 00:22:21.705\nAnd now that I'm in\nadministrative privileges here,\n\n424\n00:22:21.705 --> 00:22:23.727\nit's not giving me a hard time.\n\n425\n00:22:23.727 --> 00:22:26.707\nLet me go ahead, and I'm just curious\nhere, if it's rebuilt something, and\n\n426\n00:22:26.707 --> 00:22:28.057\nit has, all right?\n\n427\n00:22:28.057 --> 00:22:29.347\nSo what has it rebuilt?\n\n428\n00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:33.358\nWell, first of all it's rebuilt the\ncomputer that I was talking to, all right?\n\n429\n00:22:34.637 --> 00:22:39.417\nAnd in this case,\nI believe that's a domain controller.\n\n430\n00:22:39.417 --> 00:22:41.747\nNo, actually,\nno that's the domain controller.\n\n431\n00:22:41.747 --> 00:22:45.140\nSo my computer is communicating in\nthe background with a domain controller.\n\n432\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.330\nThis is my default gateway, right?\n\n433\n00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.380\nIn the background I've got a connection\nto a webpage, so even though I\n\n434\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.140\ndeleted the cache, it's still sending\nthat information out my default gateway.\n\n435\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.540\nSo even though I cleared the ARP table,\nit still had to say, hey,\n\n436\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.050\nwho's got this 10.0.0.1, all right?\n\n437\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.360\nAnd then ARP receives the MAC address\nfrom the router, matches the two,\n\n438\n00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.900\nand that ends up as an entry\ninside of my ARP table.\n\n439\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.600\nNotice the last one there,\nwhat is that about?\n\n440\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.950\nIt's a static entry.\n\n441\n00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.860\nStatic entries are typically things\nlike your multicast addresses, right?\n\n442\n00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.090\nYou can see this is\na multicast address here, 224.\n\n443\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.540\nAnd apparently I might be a part\nof a multicast group, right?\n\n444\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.840\nAnd at some point the router said,\nhey, everybody out there.\n\n445\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.780\nThis is multicast group,\nhere's the IP address, right?\n\n446\n00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.714\nIP, doesn't know anything\nabout the MAC address, so\n\n447\n00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:36.120\nit's still got to do an ARP resolution and\nit puts a static entry in there for me.\n\n448\n00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.720\nAgain, static entries are ones that\nyour computer will put there by default.\n\n449\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:47.670\nNow I did say that you\ncould delete the ARP table.\n\n450\n00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.470\nI will tell you there are other ways too.\n\n451\n00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.600\nAnd this one really isn't on the exam but\nI'll just put this one in here.\n\n452\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.970\nYou could also do a netsh interface ip,\nand\n\n453\n00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:04.610\nI believe we'll do a delete,\nand all one word, arpcache.\n\n454\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.340\nAll right, and then if you notice\nif I run that same arp -a,\n\n455\n00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.180\nthe only thing it's giving me now,\nagain, is that multicast.\n\n456\n00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.160\nAgain, dynamically,\nnow my computer is gonna try to finds it.\n\n457\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.460\nAnd again,\nmy computer can call out with our ARP too.\n\n458\n00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.690\nIt doesn't need to send\nanything to the router.\n\n459\n00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.010\nI didn't call out on the network and\nsaid I've got an IP address and\n\n460\n00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:25.040\nI have no clue where it is.\n\n461\n00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.840\nAnd the computer that's listening says,\nyeah,\n\n462\n00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.020\nthat's my MAC address, send it to me.\n\n463\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.102\nSo great thing to have with ARP there.\n\n464\n00:24:32.102 --> 00:24:35.739\n&gt;&gt; And then knowing that it's\nIP to MAC address, and if just,\n\n465\n00:24:35.739 --> 00:24:38.970\nI know Wes is giving you alphabet soup\nwith all these different acronyms.\n\n466\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.400\nBut from the exam perspective,\n\n467\n00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.810\nit has to be in that order because that's\nessentially what's happening here.\n\n468\n00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.598\nSo the way I always thought about\nit was it's two acronyms IP to MAC,\n\n469\n00:24:49.598 --> 00:24:51.369\nwhich is three letters.\n\n470\n00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:55.603\nSo two comes before three sequentially,\nand if you reverse that,\n\n471\n00:24:55.603 --> 00:24:58.860\nthen you have your MAC to IP,\nwhich is RARP, okay?\n\n472\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.873\nSo just throwing that out there,\nyou might see it, you might not, but\n\n473\n00:25:01.873 --> 00:25:02.970\nat least you know.\n\n474\n00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is a reverse\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n475\n00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.300\nAnd that one that's kinda interesting\nbecause that one's one that says, well,\n\n476\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.300\nI already have a MAC address,\nI need you to resolve it to an IP address.\n\n477\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.590\nSo the reverse address\nresolution protocol as well.\n\n478\n00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.930\nAll right, Cherokee,\nit looks like I've got quite a few more.\n\n479\n00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.431\nBut I know that I'm looking at the time.\n\n480\n00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:21.086\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And boy,\n\n481\n00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:22.962\nI'm not getting through\nthese bullet points quick.\n\n482\n00:25:22.962 --> 00:25:23.612\nBut again,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n483\n00:25:23.612 --> 00:25:25.800\nI think we're gonna have a part three,\nWes.\n\n484\n00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n485\n00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.810\n&gt;&gt; But that's all right because\nthere is a lot of information and\n\n486\n00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.070\nwe don't want to rush through it so\nthank you for joining us today.\n\n487\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.820\nAnd I know you'll be back because we\ndo have some more information to cover.\n\n488\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.040\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen as well.\n\n489\n00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.290\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n490\n00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:40.710\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n491\n00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n492\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.890\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.029\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.700\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Plus series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.200\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.060\nIf you've been following along,\n\n8\n00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840\nyou'll notice that this is actually\na Part 3 where we will continue to\n\n9\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.560\nanalyze different type of output\nfrom our troubleshooting utilities.\n\n10\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.960\nWe've been trucking right along\nin that command line interface.\n\n11\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.855\nIn the last episode we were\nlooking at ping,ping6 and ARP.\n\n12\n00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:34.645\nWe're gonna pick right up from\nthat command line interface.\n\n13\n00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:37.555\nAnd with us today we have Mr.\nWes Bryan to show us how it's done.\n\n14\n00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:39.135\nThank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n15\n00:00:39.135 --> 00:00:40.515\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nThanks for having me here Cherokee.\n\n16\n00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:42.525\nAlways great to be with the ITProTV staff.\n\n17\n00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.780\nThat is right, we are just moving along\nand you kind of reminded me that, yeah,\n\n18\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.340\nwe did talk a little bit\nabout ping in the last one.\n\n19\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.560\nAnd I kind of mentioned ping6,\nbut I really didn't show it.\n\n20\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.710\nSo, I think that really all I'm gonna\ndo is, even though I mentioned it,\n\n21\n00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.060\nI wanna show you just a little\nbit more about it too.\n\n22\n00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.670\nBecause we focus so much on ping, and\na lot of times when we're using ping\n\n23\n00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.220\neven though we don't say,\nwe're pinging by IPv4 address.\n\n24\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.460\nSo I do wanna just mention it here,\nand just basically,\n\n25\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.780\nshow you that you can use it.\n\n26\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.150\nIn fact, it depends on what\nkind of machine you're on.\n\n27\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.660\nIf this is a CentOS box here if you will,\nI just.\n\n28\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.520\nRed Hat if you're out there and\nthe commercial endeavors if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.450\nAnd you can do like a ping6.\n\n30\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.670\nAnd let me see if I can zoom in there so\nyou could see it.\n\n31\n00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.410\nAnd depending on what machine you're in,\n\n32\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.020\nit could be a ping with a space\nwith delimiter and a -6.\n\n33\n00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.373\nAnd what you're doing is,\nyou're just telling ping hey,\n\n34\n00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:41.210\nI wanna use IPv6 rather than IPv4,\nwhich it typically defaults.\n\n35\n00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.565\nSo if I don't put anything in here and\nI just do let's say, ping www.\n\n36\n00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:52.870\nAnd I'm gonna ping by name here,\nit will default, as you can see, to IPv4.\n\n37\n00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.880\nRight?\nBut,\n\n38\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.640\nif I do decide that I want to try IPv6,\nI can.\n\n39\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.360\nNow I will tell you that it really\ndepends on if your, if the path\n\n40\n00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.690\nbetween your computer and the destination\ncomputer all of the intermediate hops that\n\n41\n00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.350\nit goes through support IPv6 as to whether\nyou'll get any output back on this.\n\n42\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.840\nSo if you don't that\nmight just be the case.\n\n43\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.210\nIn fact I here I know it's not gonna\nactually run thought a full ping.\n\n44\n00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.260\nBut what it will do me, is at least\nshow me the IPv6 address, so for\n\n45\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.030\ninstance if I do a ping here -6.\n\n46\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.870\nAnd I do, www.google.com.\n\n47\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.805\nWhat you'll notice here, is that it does\ntell me that the network is unreachable.\n\n48\n00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.325\nAnd that's okay, I'm fine with that.\n\n49\n00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:44.215\nI kinda figured that going\nover multiple hops like that\n\n50\n00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:48.155\nmaybe they're not doing six to four\ntranslational technologies and\n\n51\n00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:51.805\nencapsulating IPv6 traffic\nover your IPv4 network.\n\n52\n00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:57.120\nAnd I'm okay with that But you can\nsee that right here it did resolve to\n\n53\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.990\nthe IPv6 address and\nthat's really what I know about the IPV6.\n\n54\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.330\nLet me go ahead and stop this.\n\n55\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.420\nFor instance if you're in, around here\nsomewhere I've got a Mac's terminal here.\n\n56\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.760\nMac on the other hand,\nthey do have what's known as ping6.\n\n57\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.510\nAnd if I do a --help here,\n\n58\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.920\nyou could see that there are some\ndifferent options for ping6.\n\n59\n00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.370\nBut notice that the sixth option,\nor ping6 is the actual utility.\n\n60\n00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.510\nNotice it isn't a ping space dash six.\n\n61\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.640\nInside of Windows here,\nlet me go ahead and clear this up.\n\n62\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.900\nNo telling what I was doing last time.\n\n63\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.560\nIf I run my forward slash\nquestion mark after ping.\n\n64\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.330\nIf you scroll down here to the bottom\nyou'll see that it forces using IPv4,\n\n65\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.280\nwell I've always thought that's a kinda\ninteresting one because it does it by\n\n66\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.790\ndefault.\n\n67\n00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.580\nSo what am I doing,\n\n68\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.430\nforce it to do its defaults, these\nare not the droids you're looking for.\n\n69\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.450\nBut I do see IPv6 here, and again this is\nmore just like you've seen in the Linux\n\n70\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.790\nwhere it would be ping and a space,\ndelimiter there and then dash six up.\n\n71\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.322\nAgain, depending on how they're supporting\ntheir networks out there yo might not,\n\n72\n00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:09.413\nit might not work for you.\n\n73\n00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:14.403\nIn fact let me show you here if I drop\nback to the Mac terminal here which\n\n74\n00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:18.209\nunderneath is just bash,\nit's a UNIX derivative.\n\n75\n00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.367\nI can do ping6 www.google.com.\n\n76\n00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:27.260\nAnd notice that basically\njust means no route to host.\n\n77\n00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.560\nSo it's not, it doesn't work for\nme on this one.\n\n78\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.647\nBut I want you to know\nthat it is there and\n\n79\n00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:36.130\nthey certainly ask you\nit about it on the exam.\n\n80\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.900\nNow I did tell you that from\nsource to destination, right,\n\n81\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.934\nyou might see that the request times out.\n\n82\n00:04:46.934 --> 00:04:49.585\nSo what is happening there?\n\n83\n00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:53.115\nWell if I'm using a ping in an IPv6\naddress, this case it might just be\n\n84\n00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:58.175\nthe fact that they're not supporting IPv6\nall the way from source to destination.\n\n85\n00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:02.420\nBut what if I need to find out\na little bit more information?\n\n86\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.310\nInformation from source to destination.\n\n87\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.400\nIf I wanna find out is that the case?\n\n88\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.940\nIs that path, if it's not being supported\nby IPv6 and that's the problem,\n\n89\n00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.670\nthat's okay, but how about IPv4?\n\n90\n00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.030\nWell, we have a utility\nthat allows me to track\n\n91\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.750\nthe path the packet takes\nfrom source to destination.\n\n92\n00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.420\nAnd it's also got a couple\ndifferent names depending on what\n\n93\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.070\noperating system you're in.\n\n94\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.110\nSo for instance,\nin a Windows machine here,\n\n95\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.250\nif we go back to my machine,\nwe what is known as the Tracert.\n\n96\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.960\nNow a lot of times, and let me go ahead\nand clear the screen again, there we go.\n\n97\n00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.230\nMake it easier for you guys to see.\n\n98\n00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.270\nNow Tracert, sometimes its just\ncalled trace route, right?\n\n99\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.370\nIf you are in a Mac environments, right?\n\n100\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.920\nSo for instance I could use Trace Route.\n\n101\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.790\nSo a couple different names for\n\n102\n00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.900\nessentially a utility that's\ndoing the same thing.\n\n103\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.600\nFor whatever reason, inside of\nWindows they abbreviated it TraceRT.\n\n104\n00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.550\nMake it easier for Wes to mistake\nthe spelling on it, misspell it.\n\n105\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.940\nBut what does it do?\n\n106\n00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.670\nAll right, well let me show what it does.\n\n107\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.150\nAll right, if I do that same thing,\nwww.Google.com, remember before we were\n\n108\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.510\nusing the ping utility, it would say\nno host to route, or request timed out.\n\n109\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.720\nRequest timed out depending on\nwhich machine you did it from.\n\n110\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.490\nIf I run it this time what it's\ngonna do is it's gonna use those\n\n111\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.330\nsame type of a requests that\nwe send when we send ping.\n\n112\n00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.950\nPing essentially is just sending what's\nknown as the ICMP Echo Request messages.\n\n113\n00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.810\nAnd what you get back\nfrom the machine that is\n\n114\n00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.139\nlistening is an ICMP Echo Reply message.\n\n115\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.250\nWell we can also send those same type\nof messages with TraceRT, all right.\n\n116\n00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.000\nAnd it sends, I believe by default,\nit's like ten messages per router and\n\n117\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.410\nthen those routers will\ncommunicate back with my machine.\n\n118\n00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.830\nAnd it'll take all of those statistics and\nit'll calculate it really fast and\n\n119\n00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.000\nit'll give me a little basic information.\n\n120\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.020\nThat hey, you might be having issues\nfrom sending that, in this case,\n\n121\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.100\nfrom my machine all\nthe way out to Google's.\n\n122\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.750\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlook at this information here.\n\n123\n00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.850\nI can see, right here is our\npublic IP address, right.\n\n124\n00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.850\nSo, that's where it started.\n\n125\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.800\nIt's on the other side.\n\n126\n00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.200\nWe're doing that\nwork/address translations.\n\n127\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.170\nSay, on the this side of the gateway.\n\n128\n00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.440\nAll right, then I can see that in\nthe second hop it hopped out on to\n\n129\n00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.450\nour local ISP, in this case GRUCom, G-R-U.\n\n130\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.860\nAnd you can see it's still at this point\non GRUCom, my local ISP's network.\n\n131\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.490\nAnd then it dumps it down in Miami,\nlevel 3.\n\n132\n00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.990\nMajor network operation\ncenter down there in Miami.\n\n133\n00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.010\nIt's basically ties our a lot\n\n134\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.490\nof the continents together\nwith communications there.\n\n135\n00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.220\n&gt;&gt; And that's a backbone.\n\n136\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.690\n&gt;&gt; That's right this is one\nof the IVP's absolutely.\n\n137\n00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.160\nThe top dogs of the Internet.\n\n138\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.630\nAnd what's kind of interesting is\nI notice that there is a series.\n\n139\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.450\n&gt;&gt; A large delay.\n&gt;&gt; A good delay here right?\n\n140\n00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.570\nSo it looks like our local ISP with just\none or two maximum millisecond delays.\n\n141\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.053\nThey're doing really good.\n\n142\n00:07:53.053 --> 00:07:56.374\nIt kinda scares me that it's,\nit's the top of the stack so,\n\n143\n00:07:56.374 --> 00:07:58.342\nwhat information am I seeing here?\n\n144\n00:07:58.342 --> 00:07:58.846\nAll right?\n\n145\n00:07:58.846 --> 00:08:03.036\nI'm seeing the information returned by\nthe routers from those ICM echo request\n\n146\n00:08:03.036 --> 00:08:04.890\nmessages that I've sent it.\n\n147\n00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.850\nMy computer gives me an output based\non what it found from those and\n\n148\n00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.510\nsays I can see, here's the latency.\n\n149\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.450\nAll right, here's the roundtime latency\nthat it took to get that information to\n\n150\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.450\nyou and back.\n\n151\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.610\nAnd I can see that well,\n\n152\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.820\nlooks like there's a pretty good\ndelay in the communication,\n\n153\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.940\nat least from the perspective of\nlevel three down there in Miami.\n\n154\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.060\nSo, how can I use this information\nto troubleshoot my network?\n\n155\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.030\nAll right,\nwell if I get some of these for instance.\n\n156\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.610\nThese requests timed out, all right.\n\n157\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.380\nNow there's a couple things\nthat could be happening here.\n\n158\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.600\nAll right, for security purposes,\nwhat they might be doing is blocking ICMP.\n\n159\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.340\nSee, ICMP is exploitable so\none of the things that you'll see is,\n\n160\n00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.520\na lot of companies might disable ICMP\nsending you back any information.\n\n161\n00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.320\nSo that right there\ncould just be the fact.\n\n162\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.660\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't necessarily mean\nthat that machine is down.\n\n163\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.960\nIt just means hey,\nthis request timed out or destination now\n\n164\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.450\nunreachable sometimes you'll also see-\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say it was the destination\n\n165\n00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.950\nunreachable because, and\nthe only reason I would say that,\n\n166\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.260\nis because it continued the path, right?\n\n167\n00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.280\nIt would've probably just\ndropped off right there.\n\n168\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.210\nThat router would've\nprobably just dropped it.\n\n169\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.900\nIt would've never gone any farther.\n\n170\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.480\nHowever, with the request timed out and no\ninformation it tells me that most likely\n\n171\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.110\nwhat it did is it said,\nI'm not giving you any information.\n\n172\n00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.880\nFor security purposes we've\ngot that information blocked.\n\n173\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.530\nNow, what if it does?\n\n174\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.900\nWhat if it does give me the request\ntimed out, request timed out and\n\n175\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.990\nit keeps doing that?\n\n176\n00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.840\nAt that point I would say that's\na destination unreachable because I can't\n\n177\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.120\ncommunicate to the other side.\n\n178\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:39.250\nSo, if I'm wanting to for\ninstance find out, is this my local ISP?\n\n179\n00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.110\nIs this my computer?\n\n180\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.170\nWe started with ping, I can reach\nthe default gateway, but sending in\n\n181\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:50.010\ninformation from myself to over across\nthe Internet, now we've got a problem.\n\n182\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.070\nHere's the other thing.\n\n183\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.803\nIf you're gonna use tracert,\n\n184\n00:09:53.803 --> 00:09:58.890\nI wouldn't just stop with\ntraceRT using one endpoint.\n\n185\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.840\nSo, for instance, I did Google here.\n\n186\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.940\nMaybe I might do tracert if I'm getting\nthese requests timed out, and doesn't seem\n\n187\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.580\nlike it's giving me any information back,\nor the information is not getting there.\n\n188\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.130\nI might just do something like www,\n\n189\n00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.160\nand I'm just picking on the big guys here,\nmicrosoft.com, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.200\nAnd I'll run that, and I can see that\nname resolution is happening here so\n\n191\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.410\nI can tell that that's not a problem.\n\n192\n00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.570\nI got a named and IP address and\n\n193\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.420\nnow I can start seeing that here again\nit's going across our local ISP's network.\n\n194\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.325\nDidn't give me much Information, a\nresolving a host name on that point, maybe\n\n195\n00:10:31.325 --> 00:10:35.405\nthat's security purposes, and then I can\nsee that finally it made it down there.\n\n196\n00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:38.125\nWhat's that, akamai,\nI believe is their big CDN,\n\n197\n00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:40.825\ntheir content distribution\nnetwork that Microsoft uses.\n\n198\n00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:45.195\nSo I can see that, yes,\nit went to my local ISP.\n\n199\n00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:48.155\nI'm not exactly sure where that is.\n\n200\n00:10:48.155 --> 00:10:52.385\nI'm gonna say it's probably another one of\nthose IBPs, and then I wouldn't surprise\n\n201\n00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:56.210\nme if these are both akamais or\nakamai, however you say that.\n\n202\n00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.840\nAgain I believe that's the CD\nend that Microsoft uses.\n\n203\n00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.690\nAll right,\nnow what happens if I'm using tracert and\n\n204\n00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.250\nwe start getting a request timed\nout In this location, all right.\n\n205\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.480\nOr maybe I get a request timed out and\nI never even got to my public IP address.\n\n206\n00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.170\nWell what could that be?\n\n207\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, wouldn't that tell me that I need\nto investigate at that particular device?\n\n208\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n209\n00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.720\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned it in the previous episode,\nbut I sent the wrong command.\n\n210\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.750\nSometimes it happens.\n\n211\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.050\nThe brain thinks one thing,\nthe mouth says another but\n\n212\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.250\nthis is what I was talking about,\nwhere you could really narrow in, right?\n\n213\n00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.090\nThat's what we'd be using this tool for.\n\n214\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n215\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.450\nAnd here's where I would think,\nCherokee, on this one.\n\n216\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.730\nI would think, first of all,\nam I blocking ICMP?\n\n217\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.360\nI've had some,\nin fact at the place I used to work for\n\n218\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.840\nI tried to use a tracert in the middle\nof class to show a student.\n\n219\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.280\nAnd it would just time out,\n\n220\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.430\nit'd sit there and time out, and\nit'd time out, and time out.\n\n221\n00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.200\nAnd I know it's not because\nwe can't communicate.\n\n222\n00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.760\nCuz I'm sitting there\ntalking to the student,\n\n223\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.270\nthe same online platform that I'm\ntrying to ping against or do a tracert.\n\n224\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.450\nSo what that was letting\nme know is that for\n\n225\n00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.280\nsecurity purposes the firewall setting or\nthe ACL within the router was saying,\n\n226\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.990\nI see that outbound ICMP\ninformation I want you to dump it.\n\n227\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.900\nInternal ICMP is just fine, ping somebody\ninside of your network that's okay.\n\n228\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.260\nBut if it goes off the network,\njust drop it.\n\n229\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.570\nSo that could just be an ACL that's\nset a little bit too strict.\n\n230\n00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.330\nHowever, if I do make it there and,\n\n231\n00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.040\nlet's say, it starts timing out on this\narea, well, what can I do about that?\n\n232\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.540\nWell, one of the things that I can do\nabout that is I can call my local ISP.\n\n233\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.720\nThat is my local ISP.\n\n234\n00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.870\nI could say okay, I could see that\nI'm not getting your network.\n\n235\n00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.240\nWhat's going on?\nAll right, and\n\n236\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.740\nthey could tell you what's going on or\nmaybe they've got an outage or not.\n\n237\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.670\nBut what happens if I get up to like for\ninstance, these guys here?\n\n238\n00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.720\nLevel3 right?\nWhat can I do there?\n\n239\n00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.580\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\n240\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.580\nAnd the reason I say that is because\nthese internet backbone providers,\n\n241\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.630\nif you're seeing the problems,\nthey already knew about it.\n\n242\n00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.170\nThese are the best trained\nnetwork engineers in the world.\n\n243\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.870\nThese are the graduates from\nthe high end colleges, right?\n\n244\n00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.730\nThey know what they're doing, and\nthere's nothing really that you can do.\n\n245\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.690\nNow, it at least lets you identify\nthat it's not your local ISP.\n\n246\n00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.250\nIt's not your local router, if you will,\nbecause you're making it off your network.\n\n247\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.946\nSo tracert is a great utility for\ntroubleshooting end-to-end communications,\n\n248\n00:13:12.946 --> 00:13:16.150\nsource-to-destination, all right?\n\n249\n00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.330\nAnd that's one of the great\nthings to use it for.\n\n250\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.520\nNow there are a couple of things that you\ncan do, you know I'll showed you tracert.\n\n251\n00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.350\nI'll tell you what?\n\n252\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.310\nLet's go ahead,\nlet me show you trace route.\n\n253\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.530\nAnd guys,\nit really is the same thing in fact,\n\n254\n00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.320\nlet me make this one a little bigger so\nyou guys can see out there.\n\n255\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.930\nSo, I do a trace route, www.google.com,\n\n256\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.394\ngot to say it that way so\nI can spell it right.\n\n257\n00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n258\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.130\nnotice that trace route\nis doing the same thing.\n\n259\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.280\nAgain guys, keep in mind.\n\n260\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.870\nWow, that's interesting, level 3.\n\n261\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.140\nI wonder, I got to jump out to\nthe Internet health report and\n\n262\n00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.720\nfind out what's going on with level three.\n\n263\n00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.650\nBut at least it gives me that information.\n\n264\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.800\nIt lets me know that my local ISP's just\nfine between the source and destination.\n\n265\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.662\nNow I can see some of these timed out,\nthese request timed out,\n\n266\n00:13:57.662 --> 00:14:01.430\nthat might be again ICMP being blocked and\ntrace route isn't\n\n267\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.160\nbeing allowed to collect that information\nto know information coming back to it.\n\n268\n00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.690\nAnd it might keep doing that,\nwe'll let this go ahead and run but\n\n269\n00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:12.190\nyou can see that tracert, trace route if\nyou will or even trace route 6, right?\n\n270\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.460\nWe can force it to do IPv6 but\n\n271\n00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.250\nthen just like we showed you in ping 6,\nyou might not get any communications,\n\n272\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.440\nand that doesn't necessarily mean that\nthe endpoint can't communicate with you.\n\n273\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.230\nIt just means that it can't communicate\nover IPV6 because internet for what we\n\n274\n00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:33.130\nknow is still largely IPV 4, even though\nIPV 6 has been out for a very long time.\n\n275\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.660\nMaybe I don't want to wait so long, right?\n\n276\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.970\nSo you could see here it's\ndoing name resolution.\n\n277\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.910\nLet me jump over on my\nWindows machine here.\n\n278\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.330\nClear the screen up.\n\n279\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.290\nIf I could spell clear.\n\n280\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.370\nI swear if I slow down I\ncould spell the word clear.\n\n281\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.106\nYou can do things like for\ninstance speeding up tracert.\n\n282\n00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:56.060\nNotice how I took a little bit to do that,\nbut if I do a -d and\n\n283\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.090\nI do that same www.google.com, I'm still\ninterested in level 3 now it's kinda\n\n284\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:08.800\ngotten me kind of interested, and I say\nyou know what, I want a fast result back.\n\n285\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.810\nWell what i just did with the dash d\nsays don't put the name resolution in,\n\n286\n00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.700\nI don't wanna waste time\nname resolving the name\n\n287\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.720\nI just need to see can it get\nfrom source to destination?\n\n288\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.820\nDon't bog me down in the details.\n\n289\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.150\nMight be a way that you\nmight want to run it.\n\n290\n00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.500\nSo, source to destination,\nkeep in mind it's tracert.\n\n291\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.390\nIf I need to just Ping, or I just need\nto figure out if I can communicate with\n\n292\n00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.570\none computer, I do a ping.\n\n293\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:36.130\nIf I have a long path that I need\nto send information across, and\n\n294\n00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.840\nI wanna test it source to destination,\nthat's gonna be traceroute or tracert.\n\n295\n00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.700\nWe had an interesting\nquestion in the chat room.\n\n296\n00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.669\nAnd I wanna go ahead and throw it in here,\nguys, because it is pertinent for\n\n297\n00:15:46.669 --> 00:15:48.058\nthe certification exam.\n\n298\n00:15:48.058 --> 00:15:51.531\nI don't know that you're gonna need to\nknow all the individual switches for\n\n299\n00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:53.376\nthe different V6 versions of this, but\n\n300\n00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:55.887\nI would at least know that\nthey're out there, right.\n\n301\n00:15:55.887 --> 00:16:00.871\nMaybe they give you a question that\nsays that you Whatever the question is\n\n302\n00:16:00.871 --> 00:16:05.607\nsets you up in an IPv6 environment,\nknow that you might use ping6,\n\n303\n00:16:05.607 --> 00:16:09.080\nor ping-6 or traceroute6 or traceroute-6.\n\n304\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.800\nRight so know the scenarios\nlike the exam objective does.\n\n305\n00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.950\nGiven a scenario,\nanalyze the output of these tools.\n\n306\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.610\nThat's one of the things that\nyou might have to do here.\n\n307\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.270\nSo, I would definitely\nknow those scenarios.\n\n308\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.842\n&gt;&gt; Like Wes said, even the simple minutias\nof tracert versus the whole word,\n\n309\n00:16:25.842 --> 00:16:30.240\ntraceroute being completely spelled out,\nI would be able to identify that\n\n310\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.100\nbeing in like a Mac or\nLinux environment versus Windows for sure.\n\n311\n00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\n\n312\n00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.650\nso we've got a few more to look at and\nI talked about name resolution, right.\n\n313\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.580\nAnd I've been using ping and\nkinda talked about resolving the names.\n\n314\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.090\nAnd I just said, hey, if you wanna speed\nup tracert, don't resolve the names.\n\n315\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.820\nBut sometimes, we have to test name\nresolution because just like DHCP,\n\n316\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.140\nIP addresses, it's one of the most\nimportant services on your network.\n\n317\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.920\nSo it is important to understand\nhow we can test name resolution.\n\n318\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.550\nSo how do we do this?\n\n319\n00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.890\nWell, there's a couple different ways.\n\n320\n00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.900\nNslookup is a utility that's\nbeen around for a long time.\n\n321\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.770\nI'm pretty sure it might still be in Mac.\n\n322\n00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.280\nI think it's still in Linux\nif you get the net tools.\n\n323\n00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.652\nIt's still kept around in Windows, and in\nfact, let me go ahead and dive in this and\n\n324\n00:17:14.652 --> 00:17:16.225\nshow you guys nslookup here.\n\n325\n00:17:16.225 --> 00:17:19.631\nIf I need to do something like name or\nresolution and I wanna find out,\n\n326\n00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:22.179\nif I have this name can it\nresolve to the IP address?\n\n327\n00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:27.929\nI can do a nslookup here, and\nfor instance, www.google.com.\n\n328\n00:17:27.929 --> 00:17:29.074\nLike I said, you gotta say it that way.\n\n329\n00:17:29.074 --> 00:17:29.665\nYou can't spell it.\n\n330\n00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:31.360\nWow!\n\n331\n00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.180\nIt gives me a lot of answers back.\n\n332\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.350\nSo what it did is it told me,\nI said ns lookup www.google.com.\n\n333\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.050\nI gave it a name, an FQDN, fully qualified\ndomain name, remember what we said.\n\n334\n00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:48.050\nHost name plus domain name combined,\nFQDN, fully qualified domain name.\n\n335\n00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:51.960\nRemember, DNS is taking that name and\nresolving it to an IP address.\n\n336\n00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.630\nIf that doesn't happen, this is\nthe utility that we try to test and\n\n337\n00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:56.730\nfigure out what's going on.\n\n338\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.954\nIn this case, Google's got a ton of IP\naddresses because this is not a single\n\n339\n00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:04.590\nserver there that is just waiting\nto serve you up your web pages.\n\n340\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.910\nProbably a very,\nvery large server farm, and\n\n341\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.790\nthen there's servers behind\neach one of these IP addresses.\n\n342\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.630\nSo It also gave me IPv6\ninformation back too.\n\n343\n00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.180\nSo when it resolved the name,\nnot only did it say,\n\n344\n00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.920\nhey let's look at the A host records.\n\n345\n00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.860\nYou got a AAAA record in there too?\n\n346\n00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.823\nIf you do, we can resolve that as well.\n\n347\n00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:23.829\nAnd that's great, right?\n\n348\n00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:27.607\nAnd if you don't remember what that\nis guys, keep in mind that we did do\n\n349\n00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.970\na DNS episode that showed you\nwhat these different records are.\n\n350\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.215\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes,\nyou're on a Windows machine, right?\n\n351\n00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:34.820\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And you are just\n\n352\n00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.120\nmentioning the different platforms.\n\n353\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.460\nIs there another type of command\nthat would work inside of\n\n354\n00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.640\na Linux environment that\nwould be comparable?\n\n355\n00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.730\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nthat's something known as Dig.\n\n356\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.790\nDig is the domain Internet Groper [LAUGH],\nand\n\n357\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.380\nagain, just like ping, domain internet?\n\n358\n00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.310\nYeah I got that right.\n\n359\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.480\nI don't know why they make up\nthese names this way, [LAUGH] but\n\n360\n00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.950\nit's been around for a while.\n\n361\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.750\nAnd Dig is a very powerful utility.\n\n362\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.027\nIn fact, inside of the Linux world,\n\n363\n00:19:00.027 --> 00:19:04.287\nthat's what you should be using is\nDig over nslookup cuz technically\n\n364\n00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:08.849\nnslookup is old, and it really,\nI don't know, it's still kept there.\n\n365\n00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:11.232\nWindows, it's all you can use,\nbut I would use Dig.\n\n366\n00:19:11.232 --> 00:19:13.360\nIn fact, let me show you that.\n\n367\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.440\nI'll-\n&gt;&gt; Actually, weren't we talking about\n\n368\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:14.970\nthis, Wes?\n\n369\n00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.030\nCan't we install Dig\non a Windows platform?\n\n370\n00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:17.924\nDid they have that available or\n[CROSSTALK]?\n\n371\n00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:19.622\n&gt;&gt; You do have that ability,\nbut for the exam purposes,\n\n372\n00:19:19.622 --> 00:19:21.561\nI don't think they're gonna\nask you any questions on that.\n\n373\n00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:23.755\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna say,okay,\n\n374\n00:19:23.755 --> 00:19:25.480\nwhat do you have in Windows?\n\n375\n00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.100\nCuz we can install Linux\nbinaries in Windows too.\n\n376\n00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.300\nBut I'm not really sure\nif they'll ask you.\n\n377\n00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.160\nBut, yeah, you can.\n\n378\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.190\nYou can download, I think it's BIND?\n\n379\n00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.950\nOr isoc.org,\nI think is the Internet Society.\n\n380\n00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.480\nI believe you can go out there, isoc.org,\nand you can get, just like Cherokee says,\n\n381\n00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.990\nall the binaries that support Dig, and you\ncan have it right on your Windows machine.\n\n382\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.120\nSo even though it's not on the exam,\n\n383\n00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.110\nthat's a great thing to have because now\nyou can start using both utilities and\n\n384\n00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.570\nyou really understand what's going\non in two different platforms.\n\n385\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.150\nI guess three platforms if\nyou include the UNIX systems.\n\n386\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.582\nLet's go ahead and run a Dig here\nreal quick, what are we gonna do?\n\n387\n00:19:58.582 --> 00:19:59.798\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll just keep it simple.\n\n388\n00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.295\nWe'll do Dig.\n\n389\n00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:03.598\nI say simple for Wes's typing skills here.\n\n390\n00:20:03.598 --> 00:20:06.686\nAnd we'll just do Google\nbecause I didn't sound it out.\n\n391\n00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:07.239\n&gt;&gt; Google?\n\n392\n00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.550\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I didn't spell it right.\n\n393\n00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.330\nAnd you know what?\n\n394\n00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.060\nIt is not in, I tell you what.\n\n395\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.370\nI wonder if it's in Bash here.\n\n396\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.040\nLet me clear this out.\n\n397\n00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.397\nI know what's in Bash, Dig.\n\n398\n00:20:21.351 --> 00:20:22.600\nThere we go.\n\n399\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.820\nAll right, now here's why I say one\nof the things that I say it's really,\n\n400\n00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.240\nreally powerful.\n\n401\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.620\nAll right, when I ran nslookup,\nI don't see, yeah,\n\n402\n00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.120\nit just gave me a series of information.\n\n403\n00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.050\nIt did exactly what it was supposed to do.\n\n404\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.450\nBoy, I tell you what, when you run Dig, it\ngives you all kinds of information, right.\n\n405\n00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.200\nIt tells you your query, it tells\nyou your answer, I got 16 answers.\n\n406\n00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.040\nAnd it tells me whether it was something\nknown as an authoritative answer.\n\n407\n00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.250\nDid it come from the server\nthat owns this domain?\n\n408\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.210\nNow what I think is kind\nof interesting in here.\n\n409\n00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:56.150\nI will say that it says it's\nnonauthoritative but yet it's 8.8.8.8,\n\n410\n00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:01.527\nit's Google servers replying with\nGoogle records so go figure here.\n\n411\n00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:04.341\n[LAUGH] But\nnotice that I got a lot more information.\n\n412\n00:21:04.341 --> 00:21:06.549\nI can see, for instance,\nthe type of class,\n\n413\n00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.827\nthey're really on\nthe internet class today.\n\n414\n00:21:08.827 --> 00:21:11.350\nI can see the type of record,\nthe A record here.\n\n415\n00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.005\nI could see the answer section.\n\n416\n00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:16.744\nAnd I could see the IP addresses and\nI believe the TTL there, 101,\n\n417\n00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:18.758\nis the time to live on these records.\n\n418\n00:21:18.758 --> 00:21:20.638\nSo, a lot of information.\n\n419\n00:21:20.638 --> 00:21:23.931\nNow, just when I say it, it sounds like\nI'm picking on nslookup and you say,\n\n420\n00:21:23.931 --> 00:21:25.460\nwell nslookup, why would I use it?\n\n421\n00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.670\nIf you look, it didn't really do too much.\n\n422\n00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.590\nWell, I used nslookup in what's\nknown as noninteractive mode,\n\n423\n00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.700\nexcuse me, noninteractive mode\nwhere you just do nslookup and\n\n424\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.750\nthen you do a space and\nthen whatever the record is in this case.\n\n425\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.870\n&gt;&gt; So you're just querying for\none individual record.\n\n426\n00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.410\n&gt;&gt; One individual record.\n\n427\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.935\nand it gives me that answer back.\n\n428\n00:21:47.935 --> 00:21:49.759\nActually, that gave me\na lot of answers back too.\n\n429\n00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:52.080\nYou could see IPv6 there for Microsoft.\n\n430\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.760\nBut I could go a little bit farther,\nright?\n\n431\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.270\nI could go into what's known as\ninteractive mode just by doing\n\n432\n00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:04.110\nan nslookup, and now, notice that\nthe courser changes a little bit, right?\n\n433\n00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.300\nAnd when I do the interactive mode,\n\n434\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.610\nnow I can start to set things like\nwhat kind of records do I want right?\n\n435\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:13.090\nIn this case, I didn't want IPv6 records.\n\n436\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.260\nI just want the IPv4 records.\n\n437\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:21.691\nI could go in here and\nI could do a set, type=a, right?\n\n438\n00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:22.610\nAnd I can run that.\n\n439\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.263\nNow boy, gotta love it when it\nshows you absolutely nothing.\n\n440\n00:22:26.263 --> 00:22:28.055\nYou just gotta trust\nwhat you set that right.\n\n441\n00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:30.614\nAnd now, all I have to do run that again.\n\n442\n00:22:30.614 --> 00:22:33.680\nIn fact, let me run that against Microsoft\ncuz I that was the last one that\n\n443\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.194\nI just did.\n\n444\n00:22:34.194 --> 00:22:39.970\nAnd notice that it gave me the IPv6,\nthe AAAA records, right?\n\n445\n00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.370\nNow notice the difference, right?\n\n446\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.620\nNotice that here,\nI don't have the AAAA records.\n\n447\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.170\nNo IPv6 answers back.\n\n448\n00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.080\nIt's because in interactive mode,\nyou can do a lot more.\n\n449\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.220\nI could if I want.\n\n450\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.730\nI could do set type=, and\nI can do AAAA, right?\n\n451\n00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.305\nAnd again, if it does nothing,\nit's absolutely amazing, [LAUGH] and\n\n452\n00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:05.180\nI could re-run that same thing,\nand now look.\n\n453\n00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.220\nNow what I've done is I said,\ndon't give me IPv4, just give me IPv6.\n\n454\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.350\nOr maybe I want a lot more information\nthan that, and I do something like, for\n\n455\n00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:18.760\ninstance, set Debug, all right.\n\n456\n00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.030\nAnd I run that same command and whoa.\n\n457\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.600\nI hope you got all that information there,\nCherokee.\n\n458\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.110\nBoy, did it give me a lot\nmore information, right.\n\n459\n00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.370\nIt tells me what the TTL is, right.\n\n460\n00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:33.700\nIt tells me even what the canonical\nname is, the cname, for www.\n\n461\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:40.032\nIt says, yeah well, what you really meant\nwas probably this long server name, right?\n\n462\n00:23:40.032 --> 00:23:42.270\nBut thank goodness I don't\nhave to type that in.\n\n463\n00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.580\nBut you can see you get a lot more\ninformation than just what we had before.\n\n464\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.199\nSo and then, but the problem is,\nyou have to remember to turn it off.\n\n465\n00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:53.695\nSo you would do a set, no.\n\n466\n00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:57.785\nI belive it's all one word, nodebug.\n\n467\n00:23:57.785 --> 00:24:02.209\nThere we go it liked that and if I rerun\nit back to the basics, okay, good.\n\n468\n00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:04.826\nSo you can do that as well,\nbut we can do that in dig too.\n\n469\n00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:08.560\nI can say, you know what, I want a\nspecific name in digs so I can do this for\n\n470\n00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.183\ninstance.\n\n471\n00:24:09.183 --> 00:24:14.400\nI can do dig www.google.com, like I said,\nthat's the way you gotta say it.\n\n472\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.113\nAnd I can do CNAME and I can hit Enter.\n\n473\n00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:20.730\nAnd now what I've done is not only\nhow I've got the start of authority.\n\n474\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.390\nAll right, but notice what\nthe name type is, the record type.\n\n475\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.798\nRemember how earlier that was, oops in,\nyes, thank you, it defined in for me.\n\n476\n00:24:29.798 --> 00:24:32.856\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice before it said A,\n\n477\n00:24:32.856 --> 00:24:37.674\nnow it says CNAME, so it's telling me\nthat Google.com is actually mapping in\n\n478\n00:24:37.674 --> 00:24:39.580\nthis case to this server here.\n\n479\n00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.870\nSo you could say that would dig, well,\n\n480\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.980\nthings like dig and things like NS Lookup\nI can resolve try to test name a solution.\n\n481\n00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.200\nAnd that is very very important\nwhen you start to have DNS issues.\n\n482\n00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.790\nKeep in mind dig, keep in mind NS Lookup\ninside of the Windows environment and\n\n483\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.390\nhonestly NS Lookups and\nthe Linux environment too.\n\n484\n00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:00.739\nBut in Linux industry you really should\nbe using dig as the power that it has.\n\n485\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.790\nAll right, the other things that we have\nto, some of the other ones here that.\n\n486\n00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.370\nI know we're running a little\nbit low on time here.\n\n487\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.660\nWe got a couple of other ones here and\nlet me exit.\n\n488\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.560\nI believe quit will get me out of there,\nout of interactive mode.\n\n489\n00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.417\nThe other ones,\nwe talked about name resolution and DNS.\n\n490\n00:25:19.417 --> 00:25:24.868\nWell, we have a 25-year-old,\n30-year-old technology out there that.\n\n491\n00:25:24.868 --> 00:25:28.077\nWe've been saying now for the last ten\nyears it's not gonna be in the next\n\n492\n00:25:28.077 --> 00:25:31.567\nServer Edition, not gonna be in the next\nServer Edition and that's NetBIOS.\n\n493\n00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:34.703\nNetBIOS is a flat naming space,\na flat name space, and\n\n494\n00:25:34.703 --> 00:25:39.491\nit's single labeled names that relied on\nthings like broadcast communications.\n\n495\n00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:41.550\nAnd it couldn't really\nbe used on the internet.\n\n496\n00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.100\nBut it's still in our Windows systems and\n\n497\n00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.890\nmaybe occasionally you might\nhave to troubleshoot that BIOS.\n\n498\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.950\nProbably not likely anymore, but it is\non the exam sheet, you have to know it.\n\n499\n00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.290\nSo if, know about it.\n\n500\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.380\nSo if I need to test things like NetBIOS,\nwhat do I do?\n\n501\n00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.900\nI run nvtstat, and\nlet me show you here, guys.\n\n502\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.490\nIf I ran nvt,\nthat's NetBIOS over TCP-IP statistics\n\n503\n00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.796\nis what that's supposed to stand for.\n\n504\n00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:13.046\nAnd I do a -r, I can see my NetBIOS names,\n\n505\n00:26:13.046 --> 00:26:18.599\nright, the names that have been resolved.\n\n506\n00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.370\nWe'll make our own contribution\nto the English language here.\n\n507\n00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.383\nAnd what that means is,\nnotice it's by broadcast.\n\n508\n00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:28.137\nAll right, and that's essentially\nsomebody saying, hey, who's got the mini,\n\n509\n00:26:28.137 --> 00:26:30.078\nwhat does that say, Mac Mini Pro, right?\n\n510\n00:26:30.078 --> 00:26:32.999\nAnd it resolves that name and\nit says, it's at this MAC address and\n\n511\n00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:34.470\nit puts it in my NetBIOS table here.\n\n512\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.190\nSo you can also see the NetBIOS table.\n\n513\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.946\nAnother one that we have as well is\nPathping, Pathping is actually a really,\n\n514\n00:26:41.946 --> 00:26:43.076\nreally cool utility,\n\n515\n00:26:43.076 --> 00:26:46.652\ncuz it takes the It takes two utilities\nand really bonds them together.\n\n516\n00:26:46.652 --> 00:26:50.714\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nI always feel like it's the baby [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:26:50.714 --> 00:26:52.004\n&gt;&gt; It really just,\n\n518\n00:26:52.004 --> 00:26:54.683\nit is.It's kind of like, yeah.\n\n519\n00:26:54.683 --> 00:26:58.960\nI need ping, the results from ping, and\nI need the results from Traceroute.\n\n520\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.050\nOr TraceRT, if you will.\n\n521\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.220\nAnd we're gonna combine them together.\n\n522\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.600\nWell, why are you gonna do that?\n\n523\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.156\nWell, because now we're gonna go\nfrom sending 10, I believe it's 10\n\n524\n00:27:06.156 --> 00:27:10.007\nICMP messages by default and what TraceRT\ndoes, and I believe it goes to 100.\n\n525\n00:27:10.007 --> 00:27:13.876\nWe're gonna ask each one of these routers\nfrom source to destination like we did in\n\n526\n00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:14.880\ntracert.\n\n527\n00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.740\nWe're gonna ask them a bunch of questions,\na lot more than tracert does, all right?\n\n528\n00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:25.435\nSo I can do something like for\ninstance, I can do a pathping and\n\n529\n00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:28.405\nI could do www.google.com.\n\n530\n00:27:28.405 --> 00:27:33.425\nNow this will do the same thing that\nTRACERT is doing, but it probably is gonna\n\n531\n00:27:33.425 --> 00:27:37.715\ntake a little bit on this one, because\nwhat it does is it calculates statistics.\n\n532\n00:27:37.715 --> 00:27:42.065\nIt takes all of that extra, all the extra\nquestions, same types of messages, but\n\n533\n00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:43.510\nthere's a lot more of them.\n\n534\n00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.354\nAnd it can gather that information and\nit could compute the statistics,\n\n535\n00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:48.936\nin this case 100 seconds.\n\n536\n00:27:48.936 --> 00:27:51.440\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was just going to say, don't\nbe in a rush whenever you're doing this.\n\n537\n00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.385\nJust be patient [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n538\n00:27:53.385 --> 00:27:57.733\nBecause I've seen it before where it says\ncomputing the statistics over 100 seconds,\n\n539\n00:27:57.733 --> 00:28:00.017\nso run it, go grab a coffee,\nand come back, and\n\n540\n00:28:00.017 --> 00:28:02.554\nhopefully by the time you\nget back with your coffee.\n\n541\n00:28:02.554 --> 00:28:05.760\n&gt;&gt; This isn't a command you wanna use when\nyou have your boss breathing over your\n\n542\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.510\nshoulder there.\n\n543\n00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.210\nYou're like, hold on, okay, calm down.\n\n544\n00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.967\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess definitely\nnot something you wanna do.\n\n545\n00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:13.171\nSo we'll let this one go ahead and\n\n546\n00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.950\nrun because I've got a couple other\nthings that I wanna talk about.\n\n547\n00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.960\nAnd now we're kinda steering away from\n\n548\n00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.510\nsome of the logical utilities\nthat we've talked about.\n\n549\n00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.940\nAnd they do mention some other ones here.\n\n550\n00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.160\nFor instance, they talk about\nthe light meter, all right?\n\n551\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.371\nWhen we talk about light meters guys,\n\n552\n00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:33.036\nwe're talking about things like\ntime domain reflectometer,\n\n553\n00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:37.407\noptical time domain reflectormeters\nOTDR if I can get that acronym right.\n\n554\n00:28:37.407 --> 00:28:40.461\nAnd what that does is it measures\nthe intensity alive when you're\n\n555\n00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:42.193\ndealing with fiber optics, right?\n\n556\n00:28:42.193 --> 00:28:46.114\nPeople think, well, fiber optics we don't\nhave to worry about the attenuation or\n\n557\n00:28:46.114 --> 00:28:49.643\ndegradation of that signal as it gets\nfurther and further from its source,\n\n558\n00:28:49.643 --> 00:28:50.218\nbut you do.\n\n559\n00:28:50.218 --> 00:28:53.982\nIt's just the fact that Light can\nattenuate over a 40 kilometer distance\n\n560\n00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.601\nversus 100 meters, right?\n\n561\n00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:57.800\nSo we still need that and\nthat's one of the things that it does.\n\n562\n00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.040\nThese things are very,\nvery expensive and are used for testing.\n\n563\n00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.727\nFor instance,\nyour fiber optic communications.\n\n564\n00:29:04.727 --> 00:29:07.810\nAnd some of the other things that they\nalso talk about, they talk about, for\n\n565\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.090\ninstance, something known\nas looking glass servers.\n\n566\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.470\nIn fact I kinda pulled one up.\n\n567\n00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.800\nWe've been kind of joking around,\nand also not joking around,\n\n568\n00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.600\nabout Internet backbone providers.\n\n569\n00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:21.100\nA lot of these backbone providers\nprovide you a way that you can look for,\n\n570\n00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.440\nlook into the routes that they have\nacross the backbone of the internet.\n\n571\n00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.850\nThey're called looking glass servers and\nyou can peer into them.\n\n572\n00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:29.870\nYou can see routers,\nyou can test information, or\n\n573\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.440\nyou can test things like for instance,\ndoing tracert, doing pings against them.\n\n574\n00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.150\nAnd I might find that doing a tracert\njust from myself to Google, right?\n\n575\n00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.880\nI'm not getting a communication somewhere.\n\n576\n00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.710\nThere's a breakdown.\n\n577\n00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:46.590\nWell I can actually test and look and\nsee where that breakdown is by using these\n\n578\n00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.530\nlooking glass servers in order to see\nthings like BGP information as well.\n\n579\n00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.525\nSo you also have that ability likewise.\n\n580\n00:29:54.525 --> 00:29:58.445\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I love how they let you use\ntheir equipment to run these tests and\n\n581\n00:29:58.445 --> 00:29:59.515\nperform these tests.\n\n582\n00:29:59.515 --> 00:30:02.405\nBut they also, usually on these sites,\nthey'll throw out that disclaimer\n\n583\n00:30:02.405 --> 00:30:07.070\nthat says, not to be used to\ncompare service level agreement.\n\n584\n00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.250\nIt's whenever you're looking\nat those statistics.\n\n585\n00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.231\nBecause they don't wanna\nget brought into all that.\n\n586\n00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:16.039\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, what I didn't\nshow you guys is I actually went okay on\n\n587\n00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.790\nthat EULA prior to logging the site.\n\n588\n00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.953\nI was hoping that it would\nshow it to to you but\n\n589\n00:30:19.953 --> 00:30:22.951\nit looks like I got some browser\nhistory being cached there.\n\n590\n00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:24.189\nSo that's some of them.\n\n591\n00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:28.067\nThey've got other ones too that they\nalso call out, like for instance,\n\n592\n00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:29.660\nwireless analyzer.\n\n593\n00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.150\nThey also talk about speed test websites.\n\n594\n00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.190\nGot a couple here that I've brought up.\n\n595\n00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.420\nThis one i really like, this is speakeasy.\n\n596\n00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.850\nSpeakeasy, I don't have a new version of\nflash, so I gotta upgrade apparently.\n\n597\n00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.897\nBut this is a good one,\n\n598\n00:30:42.897 --> 00:30:46.757\nbecause it allows you to test rather than\njust doing a basic generic test, you can,\n\n599\n00:30:46.757 --> 00:30:50.416\nbut you can also pick which servers which\nside of the country you're going to.\n\n600\n00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:54.740\nSo maybe I'm not having\ncommunications to one website, but\n\n601\n00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.510\nI know it's in the East Coast versus\none that's on the West Coast.\n\n602\n00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:05.460\nWell, again, I can test based on\nlocation as well, that's a good one.\n\n603\n00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.300\nSpeedtest, there's another one\ncalled Speedtest out there as well.\n\n604\n00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.670\nYou can go to this website and\nrun a speed test.\n\n605\n00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.220\nAnd you can see that it's\nfinding here that word GRU and\n\n606\n00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.530\nit asks me what server I wanna ping,\nrun a speed test against.\n\n607\n00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:25.140\nSo, that's good to see what\nyour current speed is.\n\n608\n00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.750\nAnd maybe gives you a chance to\nchallenge the SLA of your ISP.\n\n609\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:29.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm just kidding.\n\n610\n00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.530\nSo that's something that they have.\n\n611\n00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.010\nThey also call out things like for\ninstance, Wire,\n\n612\n00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.900\nwe talked about protocol analyzers before,\nI'll mention a couple of them here.\n\n613\n00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.460\nLike for instance,\nWireshark is one of them.\n\n614\n00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.073\nProbably one of the most famous,\nand one of the best.\n\n615\n00:31:43.073 --> 00:31:46.706\nBut if you like flavor here,\nI've also got a website pulled up for\n\n616\n00:31:46.706 --> 00:31:48.631\nMicrosoft's Message Analyzer.\n\n617\n00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:53.298\nAnd this is one that replaced the earlier\nnetwork monitor that's no longer\n\n618\n00:31:53.298 --> 00:31:54.637\nsupported anymore.\n\n619\n00:31:54.637 --> 00:31:57.271\nSo we have a couple of those as well.\n\n620\n00:31:57.271 --> 00:31:59.823\nLet's go ahead and\nswitch back over to our path ping and\n\n621\n00:31:59.823 --> 00:32:01.390\nsee if that gave us information.\n\n622\n00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.120\nOkay, there we go.\n\n623\n00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.538\nSo notice I got a lot\nmore information here.\n\n624\n00:32:04.538 --> 00:32:06.020\nThings like round-trip time,\n\n625\n00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.310\nhop count, the percentage\nlost from the source to here.\n\n626\n00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.160\n&gt;&gt; So we're seeing that statistical\ninformation coupled with those hop counts.\n\n627\n00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.650\nI'm checking each individual machine,\nso that's why it took so long.\n\n628\n00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.582\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n629\n00:32:18.582 --> 00:32:22.236\nSo it sent a lot more of those ICMP\nrequests to each hop rather than just\n\n630\n00:32:22.236 --> 00:32:25.764\na basic one that trace RT does and\nwe got even more basic cuz we said,\n\n631\n00:32:25.764 --> 00:32:27.610\ndon't even do name resolution.\n\n632\n00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.640\nSo you also have that.\n\n633\n00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.565\nNow, we do have just a handful of\n\n634\n00:32:32.565 --> 00:32:37.110\nhardware-based utilities\nthat they also call out.\n\n635\n00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.070\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n636\n00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.610\nthat's probably the last thing that\nwe'll go ahead and take a lot at here.\n\n637\n00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.020\n&gt;&gt; All right.\nSo what do you think, Wes?\n\n638\n00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.550\nWe have time for show-and-tell?\n\n639\n00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.460\n&gt;&gt; I think we've got just\na few more minutes for that.\n\n640\n00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.230\nI mean, because who didn't\nlike show-and-tell in school?\n\n641\n00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.460\nSo the first one that they\ncall out is a line tester.\n\n642\n00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.870\nAnd these aren't gonna be in\nany specific order here, guys.\n\n643\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.000\nAnd you can see this one right here.\n\n644\n00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.950\nLine tester, it's also got\na name called butt set, right.\n\n645\n00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.700\nBecause the, it would the line man or\n\n646\n00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.510\nthe line technician butt\ninto the phone call, right?\n\n647\n00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.510\nSo if you're testing the traditional\nthings like PSTN lines\n\n648\n00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.700\nyou can use that and you can see\nthe probes that are on that as well.\n\n649\n00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.520\nSo that's one of the things we have too.\n\n650\n00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.730\nWe also have things like certifiers, and\nI don't really have a certifier here but\n\n651\n00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.365\nI can kinda mention that it really\ndoesn't look too much different than.\n\n652\n00:33:22.365 --> 00:33:26.860\nThan this one right here,\nthis is not a certifier.\n\n653\n00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.298\nThis is just a regular kit,\ntwisted pair and coaxial cable tester.\n\n654\n00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:36.650\nHowever, let me tell you the difference\nhere because again just looking at them\n\n655\n00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:39.930\nmaybe the price can show\nyou their difference.\n\n656\n00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:44.760\nRemember that with a cable meter,\nexcuse me, a cable tester all it\n\n657\n00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.770\ndoes is test whether you have an\nelectrical continuity inside of the cable.\n\n658\n00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.470\nMake sure that it's\nterminated appropriately.\n\n659\n00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:56.480\nDoesn't matter if you're doing\ncoaxial cabling, or in this case,\n\n660\n00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.730\nanother coaxial cable.\n\n661\n00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.280\nHow about this one?\n\n662\n00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.080\nThere we go.\n\n663\n00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.110\nNow we're using something like\ntwisted pair implementations.\n\n664\n00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.370\nAnd all you do is plug one end in,\nthen you turn it on and what you'll end up\n\n665\n00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:09.200\nseeing, in fact we can kind of show\nyou here since we've got the cable.\n\n666\n00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.900\n&gt;&gt; And no joke.\n\n667\n00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.270\nThese are not that expensive.\n\n668\n00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.090\nYou can pick them up online for\npretty cheap.\n\n669\n00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n670\n00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.380\nif I turn this around what we wanna\nsee is what we see right here.\n\n671\n00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.610\nNotice that it's telling me one and\ntwo are good.\n\n672\n00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:25.110\nThree and four, right,\nthose are my transmit and receive lines.\n\n673\n00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.640\nAnd then four and five, and\nseven and eight for ground as well.\n\n674\n00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.110\nAnd if it happened to be a shielded coax,\n\n675\n00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.630\nit would let me know that I have\nelectrical communication, basically,\n\n676\n00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.040\nelectrical signal could\nbe sent across the wire.\n\n677\n00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.990\nNow, if you add to that the fact\nthat maybe I'm doing 10G, right?\n\n678\n00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:46.088\nWe have the 10G based T networks\nthat we have to implement.\n\n679\n00:34:46.088 --> 00:34:49.500\nWell if it's a certifier which\nagain guys I can't stress enough,\n\n680\n00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.040\nthis is not a certifier.\n\n681\n00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.380\nWhat it would also do is tell me,\ndoes the cable meet the TE standard?\n\n682\n00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:02.180\nIf it says it's a CAT6 cable, okay,\nI know I should be able to get 10g speeds,\n\n683\n00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.540\nat least to 55 meters, and\nif I put that on a certifier,\n\n684\n00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.410\nI should know whether that\nis going to happen or not.\n\n685\n00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:14.100\nThe other thing too,\nif I've got a six A, six augmented,\n\n686\n00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.060\nyou're gonna pay a good price for\nthat cable, and\n\n687\n00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.830\nthat cable should give you 10g\nspeeds to an entire 100 meters.\n\n688\n00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.840\nAnd that's what separates\nthe certifier from the cable tester.\n\n689\n00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.700\nThe certifier certifies\nthat it will give you\n\n690\n00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.950\nthose transmission speeds\nthat you expect to see.\n\n691\n00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.500\n&gt;&gt; So it's housing a database\nof that information.\n\n692\n00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.250\n&gt;&gt; That’s right.\nSo, those, please understand,\n\n693\n00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:40.060\nthat is the difference between the cable\ntester and the cable certifier.\n\n694\n00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.530\nThe certifier makes sure\nthat the speeds are there.\n\n695\n00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:47.180\nNot just the fact that we've got\nthe termination appropriate.\n\n696\n00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.740\nNow this one is actually a cable locator,\nright?\n\n697\n00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.540\nThese have all different shapes and sizes.\n\n698\n00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.800\nIt's a real cheap one here.\n\n699\n00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.030\nYou might see other ones typically\ncalled the fox and the hound.\n\n700\n00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:08.430\nRight, and what it does is, essentially\nwhat I'd do is I would turn this on and\n\n701\n00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.290\nI would touch the end of the cable.\n\n702\n00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.310\nAnd if I could see\nthe transmit light come on,\n\n703\n00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.080\nI know that I've found the right cable.\n\n704\n00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.630\nCuz if you think about it,\nif I've got 200 CAT cables coming through\n\n705\n00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.620\na ceiling going into a closet into\nthe back of a patch panel, and\n\n706\n00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.250\nI need to trace one of those, chances\nare it's gonna be pretty difficult.\n\n707\n00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.340\nSo you put the cable on one end\nto use the locator on the other,\n\n708\n00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.250\nin this case I'm not sure that\nit doesn't audible sound.\n\n709\n00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.060\nLike the traditional fox and\nthe hound does or a tone generator.\n\n710\n00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.970\nWhich is why it's none a tone generator,\nand a tone locator.\n\n711\n00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:41.310\nThis would just, as you can see, emits\na light, rather than an audible sound.\n\n712\n00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:46.030\nBut that would be the example\nof one of those as well.\n\n713\n00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.750\n&gt;&gt; We got a comment in the chat here Wes,\nit says to always test every single one of\n\n714\n00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.300\nyour cables,\nwhich I think is a great rule to live by.\n\n715\n00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.830\nBecause it's better to fix the problem as,\n\n716\n00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.820\ndo the job right instead of having\nto go back and rework it, right?\n\n717\n00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.620\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it.\n\n718\n00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:04.080\nBecause if you wire it like I do,\nyou don't use 568B, you use 568W.\n\n719\n00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.000\nI'm kidding.\n\n720\n00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.900\nWiring cables,\nthen you might be in for a tough time.\n\n721\n00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.630\nSo yeah, always, always,\ncheck your cables.\n\n722\n00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.570\nEspecially if you're setting\nup your networks fresh.\n\n723\n00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.470\nBecause, you know,\nif you've got a cat6 cable,\n\n724\n00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:20.060\ncat6a cable it might be in there for\nanother 15 years, so you wanna\n\n725\n00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:24.990\nmake sure that at least that cable is\nready to go when you first implement it.\n\n726\n00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.576\nLast thing that we have\nhere is a multimeter.\n\n727\n00:37:28.576 --> 00:37:32.916\nAnd pretty much I'm sure you guys\nhave seen one of these before.\n\n728\n00:37:32.916 --> 00:37:37.193\nAgain, we've got the ability\nto measure amps,\n\n729\n00:37:37.193 --> 00:37:39.757\nvoltage and-\n&gt;&gt; So sometimes you might even hear that\n\n730\n00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:40.418\nbomb for-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n731\n00:37:40.418 --> 00:37:42.553\n&gt;&gt; Bolt- [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, boltameter, that's it,\n\n732\n00:37:42.553 --> 00:37:43.345\nthat's it, yeah.\n\n733\n00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:48.348\nAnd multimeter, again, guys,\ntomato tomato for sure.\n\n734\n00:37:48.348 --> 00:37:50.530\nBut meter is another thing.\n\n735\n00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.200\nBut keep in mind this is the way we can\ntest things like power supplies as well.\n\n736\n00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.720\nAnd this is really what I use this for,\nbut who knows.\n\n737\n00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.441\nYou guys might be using this for\n\n738\n00:37:58.441 --> 00:37:59.538\nadditional purposes\ninside of your network.\n\n739\n00:37:59.538 --> 00:38:00.345\n&gt;&gt; All sorts of things.\n\n740\n00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:01.817\nYou could even around your house too.\n\n741\n00:38:01.817 --> 00:38:02.393\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n742\n00:38:02.393 --> 00:38:07.865\nSo a handful of those hardware based\ntools that we've been looking at,\n\n743\n00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:10.519\ndefinitely know them on the exam.\n\n744\n00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:13.938\nI did kinda mention the time\ndomain reflectometer,\n\n745\n00:38:13.938 --> 00:38:16.510\nthat can be a $20,000 machine.\n\n746\n00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.555\nIt could be all the way up to a couple\nhundred thousand dollars just because\n\n747\n00:38:20.555 --> 00:38:24.797\nthese things are detecting things that\nare microns, a millionth of a meter so\n\n748\n00:38:24.797 --> 00:38:25.790\nvery expensive.\n\n749\n00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.430\nDon't expect, unless you're working for a\ncompany that that is what they specialize\n\n750\n00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.230\nin that you might have one\nof these in the field but\n\n751\n00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.960\nat least you see some\nof the field utilities.\n\n752\n00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.140\nThe hardware based utilities as well as\nsome of the software based utilities and\n\n753\n00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.860\nwe hope that you're prepared for the exam.\n\n754\n00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.225\nBut other than that, Cherokee,\nI think that's about all I got.\n\n755\n00:38:42.225 --> 00:38:44.749\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're joking right?\n\n756\n00:38:44.749 --> 00:38:45.560\nThat's it.\n\n757\n00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.219\n&gt;&gt; No. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n758\n00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:47.950\n[LAUGH] No, But thank you so much.\n\n759\n00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.200\nWe did have a good mix of\nthose software-based and\n\n760\n00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.380\nalso our hardware-based tools.\n\n761\n00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.510\nYou guys are gonna find out\nthat your network tool kit will\n\n762\n00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.610\nbe a lot larger than what you might\nhave started out with your A- Plus.\n\n763\n00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.960\nYou're gonna start just collecting\nthings as you go along.\n\n764\n00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.160\nSo just keep that in mind and\nthank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n765\n00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:04.980\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n766\n00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.990\n&gt;&gt; And thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n767\n00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.650\nBut stay tuned.\n\n768\n00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.590\nWe do have more net plus headed your way,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n769\n00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.180\nSo I'm gonna sign out as your host.\n\n770\n00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.380\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n771\n00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.270\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n772\n00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.671\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV\n\n773\n00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:24.682\n[MUSIC]\n\n774\n00:39:24.682 --> 00:39:27.944\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.227\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:11.999\n&gt;&gt; You are watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.353\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network Series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:16.970\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.439\nIn this episode we'll be looking how to\nresolve common wireless network issues.\n\n8\n00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.049\nWith us today we have Mister Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:24.532\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:25.728\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.010\nAlways great to be with the ITProTV crew.\n\n12\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.808\nThat's right we're gonna be look at,\nwell, like Cherokee said, wireless issues.\n\n13\n00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:35.634\nAnd this is one of those things that\nyou're gonna probably have to deal with\n\n14\n00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:39.230\nmore and more and more because\nwireless is very, very popular today.\n\n15\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.652\nAnd it is something that we do have\nto consider I know, for instance,\n\n16\n00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:48.534\nI have launched up a WiFi explorer app\nthat I've got and I know in my apartment\n\n17\n00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:53.370\ncomplex I probably see like 50 access\npoints just right in my proximity.\n\n18\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.440\nSo it is a very,\nvery popular technology and like you\n\n19\n00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120\nprobably already know one of the reasons\nwe use wireless technology is cuz when we\n\n20\n00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.740\ncan't implement things like physical\ncabling, we have some kind of limitation.\n\n21\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.093\nThis at least gives us the ability to have\nmobility the ability to have mobility-\n\n22\n00:01:11.093 --> 00:01:12.261\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I like it.\n\n23\n00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:15.780\n&gt;&gt; And to get around some of the physical\nlimitations of wired-bounded media.\n\n24\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.540\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna jump right in.\n\n25\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130\nAnd one of the first things that they call\nout is something known as signal loss.\n\n26\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820\nAll right, well signal lost can\nbe many different reasons, right?\n\n27\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.380\nThis doesn't necessarily have to\nbe a fault of the access point,\n\n28\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.310\nthe wireless network,\nor the device, right?\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.910\nThis could be a fact that somebody\nis just getting a little bit too\n\n30\n00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.430\nfar outside of that access point\nof that wireless network range.\n\n31\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.219\nCould be a something to simple as that.\n\n32\n00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.660\nNow it could be the thing that you know\nmaybe you don't have the right antennas.\n\n33\n00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.260\nMaybe your access point\nplacement if you will,\n\n34\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.860\nthe AP placement isn't\nin the right location.\n\n35\n00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.990\nThis is why it's important that when you\nare going to design your wireless network.\n\n36\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.890\nYou do things like wireless\nsite surveys that those\n\n37\n00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.020\nthings come in ver very handy\nwhen you have to determine.\n\n38\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.180\nWhat is the placement of my access point,\nwhat is the coverage,\n\n39\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.590\nwhat is the signal strength.\n\n40\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.230\nSignal lose again could be\na failing access point, right?\n\n41\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.320\nIt could be that the access\npoint itself is just,\n\n42\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.020\nit needs to be replaced it\ncould be other things too.\n\n43\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.950\nIt could be the wireless adapter\ninstead of the client or the station\n\n44\n00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.140\nthat's trying to connect to the wireless\naccess point that's failing too.\n\n45\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.370\nI've seen where sometimes we get signal\nloss because we have things like\n\n46\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.890\ninterference as well.\n\n47\n00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.100\nPay attention to signal loss,\npay attention to many other factors.\n\n48\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.790\nAnd some of the other factors\nthat I've already mentioned,\n\n49\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.510\nthat we're gonna talk about\na little bit more in depth,\n\n50\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.000\ncould be the reason that\nyou do have signal loss.\n\n51\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.198\nOne of the things that you might have to\ndo is increase the power, the power of\n\n52\n00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:43.595\nthe signal too and we'll tell you where\nthat can actually get you into trouble,\n\n53\n00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.319\nit can be good and it can be bad.\n\n54\n00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.944\nJust increasing the power levels on\nyour machine or on your access point,\n\n55\n00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:52.977\ndoesn't necessarily mean it's going to\ngive you a better coverage area and I know\n\n56\n00:02:52.977 --> 00:02:56.892\nthat might sound a little bit confusing\nif you've never seen these scenarios or\n\n57\n00:02:56.892 --> 00:03:00.477\nissues before, but we'll hopefully\nexplain those as we move forward.\n\n58\n00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:04.479\nAnd then speaking of which,\nwe talk about things like interference.\n\n59\n00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.848\nAnd when it comes to interference,\nthere could be many different reasons.\n\n60\n00:03:07.848 --> 00:03:11.030\nOne of the things that they call other\nthings like environmental factors, right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.480\nIt could just be something\nlike obstructions.\n\n62\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.365\nThey call out things like concrete walls,\nconcrete walls can cause problems.\n\n63\n00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:20.539\nThey also call out things like window\nfilm, right if we have film on\n\n64\n00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.487\nthe outside of the window that\nusually some kind of metallic or\n\n65\n00:03:23.487 --> 00:03:25.600\nmetal base material could cause problems.\n\n66\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.526\nCould cause like bounce,\nsignal reflection as well.\n\n67\n00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:29.559\nThese could cause problems.\n\n68\n00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.060\nMetal studs right, metal studs\ninside of your commercial buildings.\n\n69\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.800\nAgain any kind of metal or metallic type\nsubstance can cause signal reflection or\n\n70\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.780\nbounce, or\njust basic interference in general.\n\n71\n00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.680\nThe other thing we have to think about too\nis that when it comes to wireless networks\n\n72\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.074\nwe're talking about irradiated energy.\n\n73\n00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:50.110\nSo we've other radiated energies that\nare going on near the access point,\n\n74\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.390\nthis can cause interference as well.\n\n75\n00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.136\n&gt;&gt; Now you've mention in previous show,\nbut when we're talking about\n\n76\n00:03:55.136 --> 00:03:57.928\nsite surveys and getting on to\nthe physical location to go and check for\n\n77\n00:03:57.928 --> 00:03:59.560\nthese things that you're mentioning.\n\n78\n00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.536\nBecause blueprints are fine and\ngood for certain implementations but\n\n79\n00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:07.441\nthey might not include every little\ndetail like the tint on windows or\n\n80\n00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:11.718\neven if it's a big medal filing cabinet or\nsome kind of obstruction there.\n\n81\n00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:14.640\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely because like you're\nsaying in blueprints right it doesn't tell\n\n82\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.390\nme what the electrical schematics are and\nI might have a junction box in an area\n\n83\n00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.632\nthat on a blueprint really only\nshows me that there's a wall and\n\n84\n00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:20.606\na little box right there and\n\n85\n00:04:20.606 --> 00:04:23.567\nif you don't have any electrical degree,\nyou might not know that that's there.\n\n86\n00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:27.205\nSo yeah blueprints by themselves\naren't gonna do you a lot of justice,\n\n87\n00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:31.146\nand that's why the software for\nthings like site surveys, are just really,\n\n88\n00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.710\nreally just they're worth\ntheir weight in gold.\n\n89\n00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.540\nAnd it's one of the reasons that\nyou might have to sell some\n\n90\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.920\ngold in order to afford them cuz\nthey can get kind of expensive.\n\n91\n00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.630\nThe other things interference like I said,\n\n92\n00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.920\nradiated energy if you have things\nlike radio frequency interference,\n\n93\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.590\nmaybe you can do things like place\nyour access points in other locations.\n\n94\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.420\nBut that might not always be the case,\nright.\n\n95\n00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.970\nIf we have high voltage power lines\nthat are outside of a building,\n\n96\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.890\nthere's really not much that\nwe can do about that, right.\n\n97\n00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.728\nWe just have to try to figure\nout how we can work around it.\n\n98\n00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:04.834\nHowever, if your access point is placed in\nthe break room next to the microwave and\n\n99\n00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:07.638\nyou noticed at 12:00PM every day your,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n100\n00:05:07.638 --> 00:05:09.069\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Speed just tanks,\n\n101\n00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.928\nchances are it might be the microwave\nthat's causing the problem and\n\n102\n00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:12.570\nyou need to-\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n103\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.352\nwhen you're like an elevator shaft\nwhenever people are going up whoop.\n\n104\n00:05:15.352 --> 00:05:15.986\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n105\n00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.201\n&gt;&gt; Definitely or a cold morning, right.\n\n106\n00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.665\nWhen everybody turns the heating elements\non, so there's a lot of factors.\n\n107\n00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:22.747\nElectro-magnetic interference,\n\n108\n00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:26.379\nadditional radio frequency\ninterference can cause problems.\n\n109\n00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.430\nNow, I've also talked about access\nplacement too, with interference.\n\n110\n00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.479\nHow about placing your\naccess point on the floor.\n\n111\n00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.840\nI want you to think of your access\npoint as being like a light bulb.\n\n112\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.693\nYou don't put the light\nbulb under the desk, right?\n\n113\n00:05:37.693 --> 00:05:39.150\nAnd expect to be able to see, right?\n\n114\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.700\nWell the same thing with an access point.\n\n115\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.826\nYou don't put it on the floor and\nexpect to get good coverage, right?\n\n116\n00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:46.229\nIt should be, at least five\nto seven feet off the ground.\n\n117\n00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.408\nIf not you're using like maybe one of\nthose I think they're the blister antennas\n\n118\n00:05:50.408 --> 00:05:52.360\nor a dome antenna right?\n\n119\n00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.220\nAnd there again,\nare you using the right antenna?\n\n120\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.131\nDo you need a highly directional antenna,\n\n121\n00:05:57.131 --> 00:05:59.367\nmaybe to cover a certain\nportion of the building.\n\n122\n00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:01.839\nDo you need a semi-directional antenna?\n\n123\n00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.748\nOr do you need something like\nan omnidirectional antenna placed right in\n\n124\n00:06:04.748 --> 00:06:07.740\nthe center of the building, to make\nsure that you get the best coverage.\n\n125\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.364\nAgain, when it comes back to it,\n\n126\n00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:12.264\nit's like survey maps they're\ngonna be worth their wait.\n\n127\n00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:16.162\n&gt;&gt; And placement is pretty important,\nespecially when it comes to common sense,\n\n128\n00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:20.056\nthat you know what Wes I saw a mim online\nthe other day, and it had some shelves and\n\n129\n00:06:20.056 --> 00:06:23.896\nunderneath the nice pretty decorative\nplant was the access point and it said,\n\n130\n00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.222\nwhat could go wrong here?\n\n131\n00:06:25.222 --> 00:06:28.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely, and\n\n132\n00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.930\nanother thing that we kinda forget about,\nright is open Windows.\n\n133\n00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.800\nIf I have an access point that is\nplaced right next to a series of open\n\n134\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.885\nWindows in an office, how much of your\nsignal is going out those windows and\n\n135\n00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:39.835\ninto the parking lot.\n\n136\n00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:43.239\nI'm not talking about, we've talked about\nepisodes where it's security based, and\n\n137\n00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:45.734\nwe certainly don't want anybody\nscraping information for us.\n\n138\n00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:49.937\nSo we get our directional antennas\nto point back into the building, but\n\n139\n00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:54.698\nthat could be a lot of your signal itself\nthat's just kind of bleeding out through\n\n140\n00:06:54.698 --> 00:06:59.318\nthe windows off into the parking lot, and\njust going off into the sunset and you\n\n141\n00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:03.830\nnever actually see any of the performance\nbenefits or the coverage as well.\n\n142\n00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.630\nSome of the other things that they call\nout, what else do we got out here?\n\n143\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.609\nNow, they do call out\na couple of different things.\n\n144\n00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:15.461\nThey call out overlapping channels,\nand then with overlapping channels,\n\n145\n00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.540\nthey turn around and\nthey put mismatched channels in there.\n\n146\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.480\nNow, when it comes to a mismatch\nchannel a lot of times your\n\n147\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.820\naccess points are on auto,\nauto channel selection.\n\n148\n00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.043\nIn fact I'm pretty sure that\nthe 5 gigahertz AC range,\n\n149\n00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:33.571\nit has to have auto switching turned on\nbecause it could interfere with radar,\n\n150\n00:07:33.571 --> 00:07:35.167\nadopt the radar and stuff.\n\n151\n00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:39.005\nSo it has to be able to do\ndynamic channels hopping,\n\n152\n00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:42.666\nbut if the Access Point is\non an auto switching and\n\n153\n00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:47.337\nmay be your client isn't\nchanging it's a mismatch channel.\n\n154\n00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:51.501\nThat could be something as simple as\ncorrupted drivers,you might wanna\n\n155\n00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.090\nuninstall drivers that are for the Network\nAdapter and reinstall the drivers.\n\n156\n00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.477\nCould be the fact that maybe\nthe network adapter itself is failing.\n\n157\n00:08:00.477 --> 00:08:02.170\nCould be the access point is failing.\n\n158\n00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.860\nAlways pay attention to the things\nlike firmware updates too.\n\n159\n00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.970\nNow, when it comes to\noverlapping channels,\n\n160\n00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.710\nthis is something that we\ndefinitely have to worry about\n\n161\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.630\nbecause a lot of these access points\nthey'll default to certain channels.\n\n162\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:18.120\nI know a lot of the home access\npoints default to like channel six.\n\n163\n00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.990\nSo you have to make sure that they're\nnot in overlapping channels, and\n\n164\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.590\nI'll show you that here in a second.\n\n165\n00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's the perfect example\nthat you were giving about in your\n\n166\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.440\napartment or condo.\n\n167\n00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.280\nSay, I have the same issue, right?\n\n168\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.200\nIt's just that the bandwidth is being so\nsaturated in these\n\n169\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.950\ndensely populated areas that that's where\nyou run into one of those problems.\n\n170\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.090\nEveryone's gonna pick after you\nnone ever left in channels,\n\n171\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.380\nbut really,\nwhich channels are gonna be less crowded?\n\n172\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.640\nThat's the key thing here.\n\n173\n00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.890\nAnd a lot of these devices\nhere in Gainesville,\n\n174\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.050\njust those standard one that I rented,\nit came with the auto-detect.\n\n175\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.360\nSo sometimes I guess it just\ndepends on your provider, but\n\n176\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.660\nthey do have different options.\n\n177\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.450\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n178\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:02.460\nAnd when you have a lot of people,\nthey don't really steer from the defaults.\n\n179\n00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.880\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nThe default is already configured.\n\n180\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.850\n&gt;&gt; You plug it in.\nYou plug and go.\n\n181\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.390\nYeah, we always talk about that simplicity\n\n182\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.780\ndoesn't necessarily mean you're\ngonna get the best configuration.\n\n183\n00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.130\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; It just means it's gonna be easier.\n\n184\n00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.810\nRight, so some people might never ever\nwanna be burdened with learning how or\n\n185\n00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.050\neven wanna know how to\nget into the interface,\n\n186\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.982\nmake sure that it's on\nnon-overlapping channels.\n\n187\n00:09:18.982 --> 00:09:20.138\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Not these guys.\n\n188\n00:09:20.138 --> 00:09:21.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah, not these guys.\n\n189\n00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:22.248\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In fact,\n\n190\n00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:24.280\nI can kinda show you an example of that.\n\n191\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:29.305\nI've got WiFi Explorer open on my\nmachine here and you can see that quite\n\n192\n00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:34.773\na lot of these access points around\nhere all defaulting to like channel 11.\n\n193\n00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:37.942\nYou guys can see here,\nchannel six and channel one.\n\n194\n00:09:37.942 --> 00:09:40.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; What's important about one, six and 11?\n\n195\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.186\nWell, if you look here, I have got\nthe channels for the industrial,\n\n196\n00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:48.746\nscientific or medical band here,\n2.4 Ghz spectrum.\n\n197\n00:09:48.746 --> 00:09:53.672\nIt is heavily saturated to begin\nwith because this is what we have\n\n198\n00:09:53.672 --> 00:09:57.778\nbeen using for\na longtime as the unlicensed band, but\n\n199\n00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:01.537\nif you notice that we got one,\nsix and 11 here.\n\n200\n00:10:01.537 --> 00:10:04.979\nYour channels usually take around 20,\nit's 20 MHz,\n\n201\n00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:09.406\nsometimes you are here 22 MHz, but\nif you notice that one, channel one,\n\n202\n00:10:09.406 --> 00:10:14.482\n22 MHz apart, a little bit more than 22\nMHz apart is channel six and channel 11.\n\n203\n00:10:14.482 --> 00:10:18.969\nHowever, if I have a device,\nall these devices here for instance,\n\n204\n00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:23.771\nare in let's say, we'll take channel 11,\nwe got a whole bunch of them\n\n205\n00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:28.730\nhere that you can see are on channel 11 or\nchannel 6 here, and some of them\n\n206\n00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.890\nlooks like one's manually defaulted or\nprobably been put on channel eight.\n\n207\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:38.410\nWell that can cause a problem because if\nI put something on channel one, right?\n\n208\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.130\nAnd then I say, okay,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n209\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.950\nI'm not gonna go with\nthe auto configuration.\n\n210\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.740\nI'm gonna put my device\nmanually on channel two.\n\n211\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.220\nWell, that's where we get that overlap and\n\n212\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.920\nthe problem has that we get\na channel congestion, right?\n\n213\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.110\nWe already have channel congestion cuz got\na lot of devices that are all ready on\n\n214\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.120\nthis default non-overlapping channels.\n\n215\n00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.730\nBut then I'd say,\nI'm gonna try to solve that problem.\n\n216\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.920\nAnd I see everybody is on channel six.\n\n217\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.800\nSo what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna go ahead\nand I'm gonna put mine on channel five.\n\n218\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.280\nWell, that really doesn't\nhelp you much because, again,\n\n219\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.440\nyou still have the channel\noverlap here as you can see.\n\n220\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.030\n22 MHz frequencies here and\nthey are overlapping and\n\n221\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.380\ncongest with other people or\nother access points.\n\n222\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.060\nSo definitely,\n\n223\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.760\nsomething that you have to worry about\nwhen it comes to channel mismatches.\n\n224\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.580\nAll right.\n\n225\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.240\nNow, the next thing we're gonna look at\n\n226\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.216\nis something known as\nthe signal to noise ratio.\n\n227\n00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:32.980\nRemember, signal to noise.\n\n228\n00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.470\nYou want that ratio to be higher, right?\n\n229\n00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.350\nWith higher signal, less noise.\n\n230\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.520\nAnd if that isn't happening, right, you're\ngetting more noise than you are signal.\n\n231\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.300\nSo, what are we talking about?\n\n232\n00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.370\nSignal is wanna you send.\n\n233\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.740\nNoise is anything else that's\nnot being sent by you, right?\n\n234\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.190\nAnd it could be due to interference.\n\n235\n00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.240\nIt could be electromagnetic interference\nthat's causing the problem as well.\n\n236\n00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.710\nSo remember, a greater signal\nto noise ratio is what you want.\n\n237\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.970\nIf you have less than that,\n\n238\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.990\nthen chances are you have some kind\nof electromagnetic interference.\n\n239\n00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.320\nYou've got the channel congestion.\n\n240\n00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.060\nYou've got channel overlap, if you will,\nand it might be causing problems.\n\n241\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.840\nNow, some of the other things that\nwe talk about too are things like,\n\n242\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.370\nfor instance, device saturation.\n\n243\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.250\nNow, with device saturation, you can\nhave your network set up perfect, right?\n\n244\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.860\nAnd you have plenty of bandwidth,\nall right?\n\n245\n00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.540\nAnd what's causing the device saturation?\n\n246\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.050\nWe'll look at our computer, most of these\nwireless access points here are supposed\n\n247\n00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.510\nto supposed to support something\nknown as WiFi roaming.\n\n248\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.980\nAnd when you have an extended service set\nor you have a distributed wireless system.\n\n249\n00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.870\nThen what should happen is your network\nadapter should be sending out a P\n\n250\n00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.270\ncommunications, right?\n\n251\n00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.460\nWhen they send out a P communications,\n\n252\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.920\nyou'll start to see as the signal\nstrength is lowered and\n\n253\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.120\nlowered and lowered, eventually what\nhappens is this computer here where\n\n254\n00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.840\nshould start to release, all right,\nthe access point if you will.\n\n255\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.880\nShould hand off the controlling of this\ndevice, let's say, for instance to AP2.\n\n256\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.980\nIf that hand off process,\nWiFi roaming is enabled or\n\n257\n00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.300\nit isn't happening correctly\nthen what you should have,\n\n258\n00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.140\nis a single device that is\nunfortunately not being handed off.\n\n259\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.670\nAnd we've got a single access point in\na distributed system like this that is now\n\n260\n00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:21.250\ntrying to service all of these computers\nat one time, cuz it's not properly roaming\n\n261\n00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.780\nbetween the multiple access points and\nthat can cause a device saturation.\n\n262\n00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.350\nNow, this could be something as\nsimple as the fact that your\n\n263\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.130\naccess point can't handle all\nthe devices that you're on, or\n\n264\n00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.880\nmaybe you don't have a set up like this,\nwhere you have,\n\n265\n00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.578\nmaybe you have two access points and\nnow you have to add a third one.\n\n266\n00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:37.980\nSo, device saturation, again,\n\n267\n00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.920\nthis could just be the fact that you have\na series of APs in an extended server set\n\n268\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.550\nof a single access point might\nnot be performing the hand off.\n\n269\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:52.175\nLike for instance you have\nthe ubiquity access points.\n\n270\n00:13:52.175 --> 00:13:55.315\nThey typically manage something like\nthis transparent to the end user, right?\n\n271\n00:13:55.315 --> 00:13:57.605\nAnd that's what we're supposed to have.\n\n272\n00:13:57.605 --> 00:14:00.505\nOnce we set it up,\nonce WiFi roaming is enabled,\n\n273\n00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:05.310\none access point again if that signal\nstrength, I think it's the RSSI\n\n274\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.220\nthat is sent between the access point and\nthe adaptor on the device.\n\n275\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.870\nOnce they realize the signal strength\nisn't so great, then what it does is\n\n276\n00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:19.100\nit releases the control from that\nmanaging AP and it picks up another one.\n\n277\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.230\nAnd again, the 2nd AP or 3rd or\n4th AP end up controlling the device.\n\n278\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.730\nSo definitely, you check to see if\nthe hand off process is happening or\n\n279\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.390\nmight not be happening correctly.\n\n280\n00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.810\nSo, that's one of the things\nthat you could do.\n\n281\n00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.600\nThe other thing they call-out are things\nlike for instance bandwidth saturation.\n\n282\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.645\nNow with bandwidth saturation,\n\n283\n00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:39.840\nit might not be anything that\nyou could do about that either.\n\n284\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.080\nAnd what I say about that is bandwidth,\nand\n\n285\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.230\nthat's the theoretical\ncapacity of your network.\n\n286\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.070\nIf I could take all of\nthe traffic at once, and\n\n287\n00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:52.330\njust throw everything on the network at\none time, that's your bandwidth, right?\n\n288\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.590\nVersus something like throughput right,\n\n289\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.660\nthroughput's what's\nactually happening right?\n\n290\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.800\nI might end up having I think\nof a garden hose, right?\n\n291\n00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.410\nIf I turn that garden hose just about\n25% up, right, well you could see\n\n292\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.530\nthat the water's just barely trickling\nout of it right, that's the through put.\n\n293\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.880\nThe circumference of that hose if I\nwas to turn it up all the way and\n\n294\n00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.730\nget as much water as I can get through\nthat hose that's bandwidth right.\n\n295\n00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.040\nSo with bandwidth you might\nbe limited to what your ISP,\n\n296\n00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.730\nwell you typically are limited\nto what your ISP, gives you.\n\n297\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.760\nSo a bandwidth saturation is\na problem on your internal network,\n\n298\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.610\nit might be the fact that you need\nto maybe move to higher standards.\n\n299\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.680\nAs far as newer standards that can\nhandle that kind of bandwidth.\n\n300\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.420\nIt could be something else though, right?\n\n301\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.120\nIt could be the fact that you have to\nprocure a little bit more bandwidth from\n\n302\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.280\nyour ISP, right?\n\n303\n00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.610\nMaybe you have an older device that\nsupports something like MIMO, multiple in,\n\n304\n00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.260\nmultiple out.\n\n305\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.471\nLike from the N standard, and\n\n306\n00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:47.760\nmaybe you need something\na little bit greater, right?\n\n307\n00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.453\nMaybe you need something\nlike multi user MIMO,\n\n308\n00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:54.169\nthat we get in things like\nthe 802.11AC base networks too.\n\n309\n00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:55.489\nThis can help.\n\n310\n00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:59.743\nKeep in mind, one of the things that you\nmight notice When it comes to bandwidth\n\n311\n00:15:59.743 --> 00:16:02.199\nsaturation is that it's a gradual process.\n\n312\n00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:07.230\nIt starts that over time you\nstart to ge increased latency.\n\n313\n00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.120\nYou might see that you start to\nget increased packet loss, right?\n\n314\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.020\nThat's something that might help too and\n\n315\n00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.840\nit's usually you start to notice\nit as more devices connect as\n\n316\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.980\nwell that the performance of the overall\nwireless network starts to degrade.\n\n317\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:25.030\nNow as you mentioned the term throughput\nand now if you look at the term goodput.\n\n318\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.264\nThat's kind of not examine or including\nthose dropped package, you're only looking\n\n319\n00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:33.050\nat the useful data that's actually\nsuccessfully submitted to that link.\n\n320\n00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm always sure that term goodput\nis gonna be interesting term cuz it's very\n\n321\n00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:37.311\nhard to see, right?\n\n322\n00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:41.016\nI can I can measure all throughput just\nby the bytes that are travelling across\n\n323\n00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:41.871\nthe network, but\n\n324\n00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.127\nhow do I know which of those bits\nare actually application, right?\n\n325\n00:16:45.127 --> 00:16:48.960\nLayer seven application layer data,\nand that's where good put comes in.\n\n326\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.930\nIt's the data that you want minus all\nthe manage and control information.\n\n327\n00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.119\nIt typically takes a piece of\nsoftware to allow you to see that.\n\n328\n00:16:57.119 --> 00:17:00.444\nSo again just with bandwidth saturation,\nit could be if it's on\n\n329\n00:17:00.444 --> 00:17:04.149\nyour internal network it's something\ntypically that you can handle.\n\n330\n00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:07.626\nIf it's going out to the Internet and\nyou've done your tests right, and\n\n331\n00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.051\neverything's set up right.\n\n332\n00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.155\nIt might just be the fact that you need to\ncall the ISP and maybe pay a little bit\n\n333\n00:17:13.155 --> 00:17:17.500\nmore money for a little bit more\nbandwidth, that is always an option.\n\n334\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.120\nThey also call out things\nlike untested updates.\n\n335\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.899\nAnd guys when it comes down to it we've\ntalked in other episodes about patch\n\n336\n00:17:22.899 --> 00:17:23.437\nmanagement.\n\n337\n00:17:23.437 --> 00:17:26.099\nThis comes down to bad patch management,\nright?\n\n338\n00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.543\nIn a production environment,\n\n339\n00:17:27.543 --> 00:17:30.270\nyou should never be deploying\nuntested updates, right?\n\n340\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.720\nIt's why we have patch\nmanagement systems right,\n\n341\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.240\nthat go through a process\nof reviewing the updates,\n\n342\n00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.780\ntesting them in a lab environment,\nnon production environment.\n\n343\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.150\nAfter the review process,\nthen we submit maybe a changed document.\n\n344\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.979\nAnd it's a fairly a good\nreview process that has go,\n\n345\n00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:52.470\ncuz we don't wanna bring down\nthe production network, right?\n\n346\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.618\nSo when it comes to untested updates, that\njust goes down the bad patch management.\n\n347\n00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.674\nWhether you're talking\nabout updating clients or\n\n348\n00:17:58.674 --> 00:18:02.171\nyou're talking about updating the network\ndevices, such as like a firmware update.\n\n349\n00:18:02.171 --> 00:18:07.323\nSo implement things like good patch\nmanagement, that always helps.\n\n350\n00:18:07.323 --> 00:18:08.618\nLet's see some of the other things too.\n\n351\n00:18:08.618 --> 00:18:11.550\nThey talk about wrong SSID.\n\n352\n00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.810\nNow I'll tell you one of the first things\nthat I think about when I think about\n\n353\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.700\na wrong service set identifier,\nis the fact that it's a typo.\n\n354\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.651\nIt just boils down to,\nmaybe you didn't type the SSID, right?\n\n355\n00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.677\nMaybe you're configuring an access point\nand you have configuration documentation.\n\n356\n00:18:27.677 --> 00:18:30.343\nAnd you didn't typed the SSID\nright in when you were\n\n357\n00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:32.820\nconfiguring the access point.\n\n358\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.316\nNow when it comes to\nthe client side on this, so\n\n359\n00:18:35.316 --> 00:18:37.819\nthe wrong SSID like I\nsaid is typically a typo.\n\n360\n00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:42.120\nBut this can happen a lot of times\nwhen you turn beakening on, right?\n\n361\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.600\nWhen we talk about beaconing, and\n\n362\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.270\nbeaconings turned off that's like\ntaking the SSID and turning it off.\n\n363\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.628\nNow what ends of happening, right?\n\n364\n00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:52.995\nWell if you're not familiar with what\nbeaconing is, just keep in mind,\n\n365\n00:18:52.995 --> 00:18:54.995\nit's just the continuous transmission.\n\n366\n00:18:54.995 --> 00:18:58.710\nSmall frames that are sent out that\nbasically advertise the presence\n\n367\n00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.220\nof the access point, we just\ntypically call it an SSID broadcast.\n\n368\n00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.980\nNow for security purpose, one of\n\n369\n00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.130\nthe security implementations that you can\ndo to try to straighten your network.\n\n370\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.461\nThey say is to turn off\nthe SSID broadcast.\n\n371\n00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:12.927\nBut when you do that,\n\n372\n00:19:12.927 --> 00:19:18.150\nyou have to do a manual entry of the SSID\nin order to join the network, right?\n\n373\n00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.660\nWhen you are doing the SSID broadcast,\n\n374\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.880\nyour computer goes through a station AP\nprobe and says, hey, who's out there?\n\n375\n00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.870\nHey, who's out there, right?\n\n376\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.520\nAnd the access point,\nif you're broadcasting the SSID says,\n\n377\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.590\nhere I am, and this is the network name.\n\n378\n00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.769\nSo now I can see the network,\nI just click on that network.\n\n379\n00:19:32.769 --> 00:19:35.940\nAnd I put in whatever the passphrase\nis in order to join the network.\n\n380\n00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.708\nWell when you turn that off it's\nnot broadcasting to you have\n\n381\n00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:39.745\nto manually enter it.\n\n382\n00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.990\nAnd those manual entries can\nlead to the misconfiguration.\n\n383\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.709\nSo definitely check if you got\nbeaconing turned off whether or\n\n384\n00:19:46.709 --> 00:19:51.400\nnot you've typed the SSID, excuse me,\nright in on the client side.\n\n385\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.468\n&gt;&gt; And to note, if you are changing that\ninterval, you also on the flip side,\n\n386\n00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:59.409\ndon't wanna increase it to the point\nwhere it's just blasting out these\n\n387\n00:19:59.409 --> 00:20:02.590\nbroadcast transmissions and\nbogging your network down.\n\n388\n00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.328\n&gt;&gt; Because then that leads to\nmore bandwidth saturation.\n\n389\n00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:06.242\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:06.811\n&gt;&gt; Why are you saturated?\n\n391\n00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:09.722\nwell I sent 100,000 beacons\nout in the less five seconds.\n\n392\n00:20:09.722 --> 00:20:10.614\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n393\n00:20:10.614 --> 00:20:13.658\nyou give yourself your own denial\nservice attack, and at that point,\n\n394\n00:20:13.658 --> 00:20:16.456\nit's probably on you more than it\nis anybody else or the vendor.\n\n395\n00:20:16.456 --> 00:20:18.311\nSo yeah, good point.\n\n396\n00:20:18.311 --> 00:20:23.599\nI get a lot of times, that one's gonna\nbe just the fact that it's a typo.\n\n397\n00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:28.550\nNow they talk about power levels and I\nmentioned earlier on, I said power levels,\n\n398\n00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.658\nyou might think increase the power level,\nright?\n\n399\n00:20:31.658 --> 00:20:35.978\nThat's gonna increase your coverage area\nand that's technically not the way it is.\n\n400\n00:20:35.978 --> 00:20:37.644\nKeep in mind, higher frequencies,\n\n401\n00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:41.200\nwhen we talk about higher frequencies\nit's more reflective signal, right?\n\n402\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.540\nSo if you need to bounce off of\nthings you could reflect back.\n\n403\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.470\nA lower frequency has a little\nbit more obstacle penetration, so\n\n404\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.900\nagain you do have to consider that.\n\n405\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.440\nI want you to understand that when\nyou turn the power levels up on your\n\n406\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.205\naccess point.\n\n407\n00:20:53.205 --> 00:20:56.756\nIt just means your access point can\nyell out to the rest of the world, hey,\n\n408\n00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:57.339\nI'm here.\n\n409\n00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:02.290\nThat signal from your access\npoint to the clients increases.\n\n410\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.407\nWhat does it do for\nthe client's side, right?\n\n411\n00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:07.048\nYou didn't increase anything\non the client side, so\n\n412\n00:21:07.048 --> 00:21:09.991\nthe client still needs to talk\nto the access point, right?\n\n413\n00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:14.069\nSo just because you've increased the power\nlevel on the access point itself,\n\n414\n00:21:14.069 --> 00:21:17.467\nall you're doing is increasing\nthe ability to the access point to\n\n415\n00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:19.950\ncommunicate outbound to the stations.\n\n416\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.430\nYou didn't do anything from\nthe station's abilities\n\n417\n00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.280\nto communicate back to the access point.\n\n418\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.391\nSo not necessarily does increasing\nthe power level give you the advantage\n\n419\n00:21:29.391 --> 00:21:34.760\nof a greater coverage area or improve\nthings like lowering your signal loss.\n\n420\n00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.359\nSo it is something to keep in mind.\n\n421\n00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:39.887\nIt doesn't really help\nwith the station itself,\n\n422\n00:21:39.887 --> 00:21:42.829\ncommunicating back to the access point.\n\n423\n00:21:42.829 --> 00:21:46.474\nNow they called out a couple other things\nthat we've been talking about too, and\n\n424\n00:21:46.474 --> 00:21:49.110\nwe talked about these when it\ncomes to security concerns.\n\n425\n00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.428\nWe've talked about things\nlike open networks, right?\n\n426\n00:21:51.428 --> 00:21:55.536\nAnd an open network can be a problem\nif you are the one that is supporting\n\n427\n00:21:55.536 --> 00:21:56.658\nthe open network.\n\n428\n00:21:56.658 --> 00:21:59.835\nIt can also be a problem if you're the one\nconnecting to it, so let's go ahead and\n\n429\n00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:01.720\ngo both sides of the tracks on here.\n\n430\n00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.570\nIf you're the onesupporting\nthe open network and\n\n431\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.590\nyou're allowing people to connect and\nthey don't have to authenticate,\n\n432\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.120\nwell whatever they do,\nit's gonna be your fault.\n\n433\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.272\nIf it end up being malicious or\nmalicious intent,\n\n434\n00:22:11.272 --> 00:22:14.864\nbecause you are the one that's providing\nthe access and that network and paying for\n\n435\n00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:18.320\nthat Internet connection, then you\nare the one that's gonna be liable for it.\n\n436\n00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:23.368\nSo you have to make sure that If you\nare I wouldn't do an open network period.\n\n437\n00:22:23.368 --> 00:22:27.016\nBut if you are gonna do an open network\nthen you're gonna have to implement other\n\n438\n00:22:27.016 --> 00:22:30.666\nsecurity techniques maybe content web\nfiltering to ensure that people aren't\n\n439\n00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:31.879\ndoing malicious things.\n\n440\n00:22:31.879 --> 00:22:36.521\nPersonally I would say implement a guess\nnetwork that is either has a capita portal\n\n441\n00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.199\npull on it.\n\n442\n00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:40.743\nWe see this a lot or\nlock it down with a password and\n\n443\n00:22:40.743 --> 00:22:46.808\nyou're only giving maybe customers of that\nday, the access to the guest network.\n\n444\n00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:49.667\nAnd maybe you change the password\nevery other day or something.\n\n445\n00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:52.460\nSo somebody doesn't know\nthe password at one time and\n\n446\n00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.458\nyour network anytime that they want.\n\n447\n00:22:54.458 --> 00:22:56.072\nOther things that they call out too,\n\n448\n00:22:56.072 --> 00:22:58.270\nthey call out things like\nthe rogue access point.\n\n449\n00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.950\nNow we've always talked about rogue access\npoints being things like denial service\n\n450\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:02.820\nattacks.\n\n451\n00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.570\nIt could be done for the purposes\nof maliciously gathering your data.\n\n452\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.240\nIf somebody's doing an evil twin attack\n\n453\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.190\nwhere they're making the SSIDs look\nidentical and you accidentally hop on.\n\n454\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.450\nThe one that is the rogue AP,\n\n455\n00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.990\nwhile now somebody could be scraping your\ninformation or gathering that information.\n\n456\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.241\nMaybe waiting for\nyou to try to sign into a bank account and\n\n457\n00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:24.429\ncapturing that information as well.\n\n458\n00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:26.740\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nthey got your username or password.\n\n459\n00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.507\nSo rogue access points can cause all\nkinds of problems, not only just for\n\n460\n00:23:31.507 --> 00:23:37.148\nthe company, but also the people that are\nconnecting to the companies type network.\n\n461\n00:23:37.148 --> 00:23:39.957\nLike I said, for instance just\nsimple as a denial of service attack\n\n462\n00:23:39.957 --> 00:23:43.830\nbecause rogue access points typically\ndon't have an Internet connection.\n\n463\n00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.165\nAnd if that's really what you're\nusing your wireless network for\n\n464\n00:23:46.165 --> 00:23:48.760\nthen now you'll notice that the Internet\nconnection is no longer there.\n\n465\n00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.593\nSo it is something that you can notice,\nand\n\n466\n00:23:51.593 --> 00:23:54.913\nthere are ways that you can stop that,\nall right?\n\n467\n00:23:54.913 --> 00:23:58.877\nLet's see,\nsome of the other things that we have.\n\n468\n00:23:58.877 --> 00:24:01.129\nThey talk about wrong antenna type.\n\n469\n00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:04.510\nI do want you to keep in\nmind which antenna you need.\n\n470\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.070\nDo you need a highly directional antena?\n\n471\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.957\nDo you need a semi directional antena or\ndo you need an omni directional antena?\n\n472\n00:24:10.957 --> 00:24:14.648\nWe've talked about these antena\ntypes in other episodes, but\n\n473\n00:24:14.648 --> 00:24:17.516\ndo keep in mind that\nan omni directional antena.\n\n474\n00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:21.073\nIt's gonna basically it's going\nto broadcast that signal in all\n\n475\n00:24:21.073 --> 00:24:22.180\ndirections right?\n\n476\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:28.376\nSemi directional is gonna be a little\nbit more wider of a signal pattern.\n\n477\n00:24:28.376 --> 00:24:31.326\nAnd then the highly directional's\ngonna be exactly that,\n\n478\n00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:32.920\nit's gonna be highly focused.\n\n479\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:40.331\nSo you could need any of these depending\non coverage area or signal loss.\n\n480\n00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:44.720\nSo pay attention to the AP placement\nwithin your network as well as the type.\n\n481\n00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.460\nNow we've got some other things there,\nCherokee.\n\n482\n00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.935\nI know I'm looking at the list here,\n[LAUGH] but\n\n483\n00:24:49.935 --> 00:24:52.420\nI don't think we have\nenough time on this one.\n\n484\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.430\n&gt;&gt; I think you're right, Wes.\n\n485\n00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.310\nBut that's okay, I think we're used\nto that at this point in time.\n\n486\n00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.860\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up this particular episode.\n\n487\n00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.020\nSo thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n488\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.104\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n489\n00:25:02.104 --> 00:25:03.079\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n490\n00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:06.892\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n491\n00:25:06.892 --> 00:25:12.821\n[MUSIC]\n\n492\n00:25:12.821 -->

00:00:12.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.165\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.335\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:19.875\nThis is actually\na continuation of part two\n\n7\n00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.195\nwhere we were previously examining the\ndifferent types of wireless problems that\n\n8\n00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:25.905\nwe may encounter throughout our networks.\n\n9\n00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.905\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nWes Bryan to help cover this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.075\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:31.505\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:35.360\nThat's right, we've got, well, we've got a\nfew more things that we have to cover but\n\n13\n00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.780\nwe certainly couldn't fit them\nall in in the first half hour.\n\n14\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.150\nSo here in this episode we are going to\nround them off, and we'll go ahead and\n\n15\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.310\nwe'll dive right into the next topic.\n\n16\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.280\nSo you know when we talk about wireless\nissues that could come into play,\n\n17\n00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.980\none of the things that they talk about\nare things like incompatibilities, right?\n\n18\n00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.913\nAnd when it comes to incompatibilities,\n\n19\n00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:56.740\na lot of times this can be things\nlike standards mismatches.\n\n20\n00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.743\nDo you have an 802.11G device\nthat is trying to connect\n\n21\n00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:09.320\nto maybe an 802.11AC base network that's\nrunning in the five gigahertz frequency.\n\n22\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.410\nWell, you have to know their standards in\norder to make sure that these mismatches,\n\n23\n00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.160\nif I can say that doesn't happen.\n\n24\n00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.490\nSo let's go ahead and one other\nthings that we're gonna dive into\n\n25\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.340\nare the 802.11 standards, so that you dont\nworry about these incompatibilities and\n\n26\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.500\nat least you'll know why a device might\nnot be communicating amongst your network.\n\n27\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.390\nNow, some of these statistics,\nor facts, if you will,\n\n28\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.070\nstandards It's gonna be like a lot of\nthe other standards that we talk about.\n\n29\n00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.550\nIt's gonna be really\njust sheer memorization.\n\n30\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.234\nAnd I can tell you guys, I know that\nsometimes the memorization part really\n\n31\n00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:43.518\nisn't the most glamorous because we would\nlike to be setting up the networks, right.\n\n32\n00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:45.916\nWe'd like to be getting into\na command line interface,\n\n33\n00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:47.754\nwhere we're troubleshooting stuff, and\n\n34\n00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:50.370\nnot really worrying about\na whole bunch of specifications.\n\n35\n00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.964\nBut remember, like we've been basically\ngiving you guys the advice throughout this\n\n36\n00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.725\nseries, is that you're\nlearning a new language.\n\n37\n00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:03.153\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into the 802.11 standards.\n\n38\n00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:07.041\nRemember 802.11 is\nthe IEEE working group for\n\n39\n00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.675\nwireless local area\nnetwork implementations.\n\n40\n00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:15.502\nAnd I have a chart here on my screen here,\nif we could take a look at that, and\n\n41\n00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:18.815\nI know guys,\nit's a laundry list of information.\n\n42\n00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:21.857\nBut some of the things that\nwe're gonna be looking at are,\n\n43\n00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.040\nwell the standards themselves, right?\n\n44\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.000\nAnd we have a few different standards,\nright?\n\n45\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.670\nYou can see we have a, b, g, n and ac, and\n\n46\n00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.240\nwe're just gonna go ahead and we'll look\nat these individually, we're also gonna be\n\n47\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.050\nlooking at the characteristics\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n48\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.310\nThe frequency, the speeds, the distance.\n\n49\n00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.700\nWe'll talk about bandwidth,\ncompatibilities and\n\n50\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.320\nsome of the antenna technologies that you\n\n51\n00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.350\nmight come across in two days\nWireless Access Point Communication.\n\n52\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.720\nSo to make a little bit easier,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.670\nwe're gonna kinda shut everything\nelse out of our mind right now.\n\n54\n00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.240\nAnd we will focus on one of\nthe earliest standards now.\n\n55\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.137\nAnd that is the 802.11 a standard.\n\n56\n00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:10.383\nWhen this first came out,\nthis was operating in the five gigahertz\n\n57\n00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:15.170\nfrequencies and\nit is the speeds we could see 54 megabits.\n\n58\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.440\nSo relatively fast speeds, if you will.\n\n59\n00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.040\nDistance, some of this distances, guys,\n\n60\n00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.050\nthey vary depending on what statistic you\nlook at, what manufacturers you look at.\n\n61\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.990\nSo I'm giving you a roundabout here.\n\n62\n00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.960\nOn these at about 10 meters,\naround 30 feet,\n\n63\n00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.270\nyou could see, I've seen some\nsay up to around 50 feet or so.\n\n64\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.130\nBut that was one of\nthe limitations to the a devices,\n\n65\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.550\nthe fact that first of all they're very,\nvery expensive and\n\n66\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.750\nusually the higher frequency that you\nget the shorter the range is, all right?\n\n67\n00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.780\nIt's always a give and take, right?\n\n68\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.370\nThe faster the speed, and usually,\nthe shorter distance you get.\n\n69\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.009\nBandwidth, we're talking\nabout 20 megahertz bandwidth,\n\n70\n00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.960\ndo want you to keep that in mind.\n\n71\n00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.777\nAnd when compatibility, the compatibility\nwould've been with the 802.11n\n\n72\n00:03:59.777 --> 00:04:02.030\ndevices that we're gonna talk about.\n\n73\n00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.770\nNothing really special about\nthe antenna technologies on this one.\n\n74\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.430\nBut you will see as we go\nthrough the standards here,\n\n75\n00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.260\nthere will be some that we\ndo have to worry about.\n\n76\n00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.920\nNow the next one that we have\nis 802.11b standards right?\n\n77\n00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.535\nYou have to understand that when we\ntalk about standards mismatches and\n\n78\n00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:22.075\ncompatibilities, right?\n\n79\n00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:25.115\nNotice that one is operating\non the 5 GHz spectrum.\n\n80\n00:04:25.115 --> 00:04:29.135\nThis one is operating in the 2.4\nGHz spectrum known as ISM band.\n\n81\n00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:32.175\nThat's the Industrial Scientifical and\nMedical band, right?\n\n82\n00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:35.794\nYou can see that the speeds not\nreally that great of speeds, right?\n\n83\n00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:39.730\n11 Mbps, a fairly slow standard,\nif you will.\n\n84\n00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.879\nBut again, now we get that, you kind of\nsee that, we're lowering the speeds, but\n\n85\n00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.613\nwe're increasing the distance.\n\n86\n00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:51.173\nAnd I did put 100m in here, however,\nyou will see in certain implementations\n\n87\n00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:57.630\nwhere you have absolutely no obstructions\nat all, you could get up to 1000 feet.\n\n88\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.663\nWhich is probably one of the things that\nmade the FCC take a look at some of these\n\n89\n00:05:00.663 --> 00:05:03.339\nspecifications and say, hey,\nmaybe we need to think about twice.\n\n90\n00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.042\n&gt;&gt; We don't need to be\ncreating weapons here.\n\n91\n00:05:05.042 --> 00:05:05.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n92\n00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:12.270\nSo about 100 meters, 328 feet, like I\nsaid, these are rough guesstimations.\n\n93\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.549\nYou can see some people that\njust say 150 feet in general.\n\n94\n00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:20.170\nBandwidth here, you would see 20 Mhz.\n\n95\n00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.180\nCompatibility is going to be with g and n.\n\n96\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.886\nAnd I'm wanna come back and recap some of\nthese compatibilities as we look at them,\n\n97\n00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:32.922\nas we look at n we'll come back and\nsee why they're compatible with n and\n\n98\n00:05:32.922 --> 00:05:36.350\nthen as well the next one\nthat we're gonna talk about.\n\n99\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.078\nWhat's kinda interesting with these\nstandards here is some people would think\n\n100\n00:05:41.078 --> 00:05:45.604\nthat, because b actually came out,\nit was released to market in 1999.\n\n101\n00:05:45.604 --> 00:05:47.787\n&gt;&gt; Just a few months, after a, right?\n\n102\n00:05:47.787 --> 00:05:51.492\n&gt;&gt; Well they were actually, and that's one\nof the big misnomers, is the fact that\n\n103\n00:05:51.492 --> 00:05:55.420\nthey were actually [CROSSTALK]\nstandardized identically at the same time.\n\n104\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.130\nIt was 1999 that the IEEE\nstandardized these.\n\n105\n00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.721\nBut here's the problem, b were cheaper\ndevices, so b hit the market and\n\n106\n00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.690\neverybody was buying them up.\n\n107\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.740\nA, It took a while because they're very,\nvery expensive.\n\n108\n00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.560\nSo it was the business class enterprises\nthat could justify the expense to get\n\n109\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.470\nthe speeds, where the commonality,\ncheaper device-slower speeds,\n\n110\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.580\nB, was the one that\nseemed to come out first.\n\n111\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.060\nWhen in actuality they were\nboth standardized in 1999.\n\n112\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.611\nHowever, there would be a delay to\nmarket as far as the growth of aid\n\n113\n00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:33.340\ndevices just based on the fact that\nthey were very, very expensive.\n\n114\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.390\nAll right, so next one that\nwe're gonna be looking at is G.\n\n115\n00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:44.368\nI believe this one came out in I wanna\nsay 2003 ish, is when this one came out.\n\n116\n00:06:44.368 --> 00:06:46.650\nAnd this one kinda did\nsomething interesting.\n\n117\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.605\nIt's stayed in the 2.4 Gigahertz spectrum.\n\n118\n00:06:49.605 --> 00:06:54.372\nSo remember I told you earlier the b\ndevices were also compatible with g if you\n\n119\n00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.350\nlook at again.\n\n120\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.059\nBecause of the fact that they are\noperating In the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n121\n00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:01.210\nIt means that it were\nbackwards compatible.\n\n122\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.400\nAnd that's what really kind of\nsignaled the death blow to G devices,\n\n123\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.730\nbecause if you look, or\nthe A devices, excuse me.\n\n124\n00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.975\nAnd that's because look at the speeds,\nright, we get 54 megabits,\n\n125\n00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:12.335\nwe get 54 megabits.\n\n126\n00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:16.450\nBut yet we have backwards compatibility\nwith already existing devices, and\n\n127\n00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.340\nwe get the cheaper implementation kind of\nsignaled the death a lot of the a devices.\n\n128\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.400\nAnd then we also get the range that we\nwere getting in the earlier b devices.\n\n129\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.477\nSo if you think about it low cost,\nfive times the speed,\n\n130\n00:07:28.477 --> 00:07:33.290\nbetter than five times the speed and\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n131\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.605\nThat made the g devices pretty\nattractive to just about everybody.\n\n132\n00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:42.784\nNow in I wanna say it was 2009,\nthey ratified the next standard,\n\n133\n00:07:42.784 --> 00:07:46.190\nand that would have been the 802.11n.\n\n134\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.952\nAnd with 802.11n now, you'll see\nthat we get what's known as a dual\n\n135\n00:07:50.952 --> 00:07:53.608\nband topology or a dual band technology.\n\n136\n00:07:53.608 --> 00:07:59.096\nIf you look at the 802.11 standard,\nit was actually an amendment\n\n137\n00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:05.233\nto the standard that said backwards\ncompatibility With all legacy protocols.\n\n138\n00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:08.270\nWhat do they mean by legacy protocols?\n\n139\n00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.680\nAt that time when they meant is g,\nb and n.\n\n140\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.040\nSo that means you're 2.4\ngigahertz spectrum would satisfy\n\n141\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.240\nnot only end devices.\n\n142\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.351\nBut they would also satisfy things like\nyour legacy devices at the time that we're\n\n143\n00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:21.793\nrunning b and the g devices.\n\n144\n00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:24.900\nWhere at the same time you're also\nrunning five gigahertz speeds.\n\n145\n00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.901\nAnd the five gigahertz speeds, that\nwouldn't really do anything for the b and\n\n146\n00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:28.502\nthe g devices.\n\n147\n00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:32.490\nBut that would mean that you could also\nimplement things like your a devices\n\n148\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.004\nas well.\n\n149\n00:08:33.004 --> 00:08:38.405\n&gt;&gt; An energy that 11, it kind of\nhas an interesting point for me.\n\n150\n00:08:38.405 --> 00:08:42.915\nI think it came out in February because\nI ended up buying a Valentine's Day gift\n\n151\n00:08:42.915 --> 00:08:44.065\nwith that because I was so excited.\n\n152\n00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.940\nI'm like this is gonna be\nthe greatest gift ever.\n\n153\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.855\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, I tell you.\n\n154\n00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:48.765\n&gt;&gt; Go figure.\n\n155\n00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:50.351\n&gt;&gt; Early adopters, right?\n\n156\n00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:52.530\n[LAUGH] Early adopters and.\n\n157\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.870\nAnd speaking of early adopters,\n\n158\n00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.220\nboth the g and the n devices went\ninto what was known as pre-draft.\n\n159\n00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.085\nAnd what this means is the manufacturers\nfrom the Wi-Fi alliance started\n\n160\n00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:05.776\nreleasing devices that would have\nwhat's known as draft n or draft g.\n\n161\n00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:08.938\nAnd that just means that hey, we're\nalready releasing the devices even if\n\n162\n00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:11.046\nthey're not fully\nimplementing the standard yet\n\n163\n00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:13.530\ncuz the standard hasn't been released.\n\n164\n00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.180\nNow you'll notice that there's a big\ndifference here when we talk about\n\n165\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:17.900\nspeeds, right?\n\n166\n00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.314\nLook at these speeds, 54 megabits and\n\n167\n00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:25.365\ntheoretically the bandwidth on a n device\nis going to go all the way up to 600 Mbps.\n\n168\n00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:28.725\nNow that's the theoretical bandwidth and\n\n169\n00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:34.050\ndoesn't mean that in actual\nperformance you are going to get that.\n\n170\n00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.684\nIn fact, a lot of the manufacturers\nyou would be lucky if you were getting\n\n171\n00:09:37.684 --> 00:09:38.407\n300 Mbps.\n\n172\n00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:43.338\nAnd it implemented a new antenna\ntype that we really didn't have in\n\n173\n00:09:43.338 --> 00:09:45.460\nthe earlier technologies.\n\n174\n00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.910\nThis antenna technology would be known as,\nand\n\n175\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.130\nwe talked about this before,\nis the multiple in, multiple out.\n\n176\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.725\nAnd that would give you\nfour spacial streams.\n\n177\n00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.773\nAnd essentially if you wanna\ntake all the jargon out,\n\n178\n00:09:55.773 --> 00:09:57.952\nwhat multiple in multiple out means.\n\n179\n00:09:57.952 --> 00:10:01.570\nIs now we have antennas that can send and\nreceive information at the same time.\n\n180\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.290\nVersus some of the earlier technologies\nwhere it was more like a half duplex wait\n\n181\n00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.470\nin line communication where you send and\nnow I have to wait to receive.\n\n182\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.170\nYou send and I have to wait to receive or\nI have to wait to send.\n\n183\n00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.920\nNow we have antennas that can send and\nreceive and it did increase the bandwidth.\n\n184\n00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.681\nThe theoretical part of this is that each\nindividual stream should theoretically get\n\n185\n00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.411\n150 megabits, megabits.\n\n186\n00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:26.315\nYeah, make sure I say that right,\n\n187\n00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:29.940\n150 megabit transfer\nspeeds per spacial stream.\n\n188\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.860\nDo the math on there, and\n\n189\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.210\nI'm not really good at math, but\nfour time 150 gets 600 megabits.\n\n190\n00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.385\nBut like I said a lot of your\nmanufacturers were not implementing four\n\n191\n00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:40.470\nspecial streams at the same time.\n\n192\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.835\nAt best what they would be doing\nis three spatial streams, right.\n\n193\n00:10:42.835 --> 00:10:47.140\nIt gives you 450, and one of those streams\nwould also be for control information.\n\n194\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.650\nSometimes they weren't even implementing\nthat it'll be two antennas so\n\n195\n00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.720\nyou were really only getting 300 megabits.\n\n196\n00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.730\nSo it all depends on theoretical versus\nhow they were actually implementing it.\n\n197\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.850\nSo in practicality you probably\nweren't gonna get 600 megabits.\n\n198\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:06.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got kind of like a little\nbit of a sarcasm here in the chat.\n\n199\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.550\nI see that 600 megabits,\nquestion mark, question mark.\n\n200\n00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.570\nBut that's kind of the thing\nwhen it comes to Wi-Fi.\n\n201\n00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:17.570\nYou do see being advertised,\ngenerally at the best case scenario.\n\n202\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that gets me with like,\nI was reading an article one time.\n\n203\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.680\nOr actually just a couple days ago that\nsaid, that's why the manufacturers will\n\n204\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.700\nsay things like extreme, and maximum,\nand advanced and accelerated.\n\n205\n00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.030\nAnd really it's just a marketing gimmick.\n\n206\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.710\n[LAUGH] Because well,\nwhat theory is right,\n\n207\n00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.100\nthey say theoretically you should get\nfive gigabyte transfer speeds on USB 3.0.\n\n208\n00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.879\nIn practicality, you'd be lucky\nto get 250 meg transfer speed.\n\n209\n00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:47.373\nSo again what is theoretical versus\nwhat is actually implemented completely\n\n210\n00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.690\ndifferent.\n\n211\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.590\nNow when it comes to\nbackwards compatibility,\n\n212\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:54.130\nagain I've kind of mentioned this.\n\n213\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.740\nRemember that we're talking about\nbackwards compatible with all of\n\n214\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.040\nthe previous legacy protocols\nup until that point a, b and g.\n\n215\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:12.830\nWhich now backing up here, you can see\nas y, g and n are compatible with b.\n\n216\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.930\nJust like we can see g\nis compatible with b and\n\n217\n00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.730\nn because of that 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n218\n00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.090\nAnd why I told you a is\nonly compatible with n.\n\n219\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:24.500\nAgain, it's that five gigahertz spectrum.\n\n220\n00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.559\nNow what we currently have is a standard\nout that I actually have at my house,\n\n221\n00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:32.730\nand that's what's known as 802.11ac.\n\n222\n00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.691\nNow this one is a very interesting\nstandard, in the fact that we have so\n\n223\n00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:45.170\nmany mobile devices and wireless devices\nthat are hitting networks today.\n\n224\n00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.190\nThe fact that we have things\nlike high definition streaming.\n\n225\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.750\nThat all kinds of multimedia.\n\n226\n00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.750\nWe have real time video conferencing.\n\n227\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.660\nWe need a lot more bandwidth than we've\nneeded in earlier implementations.\n\n228\n00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.390\nAnd AC kinda helps us with that.\n\n229\n00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:04.336\nNow I will tell you that you will\nfind 802.11ac devices that support\n\n230\n00:13:04.336 --> 00:13:08.820\n2.4 gigahertz spectrum and\nfive gigahertz spectrum, right?\n\n231\n00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.340\nBut that's not what the standard says.\n\n232\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.960\nThat's just how the manufacturer\nimplemented it.\n\n233\n00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.042\nThey implement it like with n, so that you\ncan get backwards compatibility on 2.4 and\n\n234\n00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:18.487\nthe five gigahertz spectrum.\n\n235\n00:13:18.487 --> 00:13:23.294\nBut the ac standard for\nits frequency itself, it operates on\n\n236\n00:13:23.294 --> 00:13:28.490\nthe five gigahertz spectrum and\nor five gigahertz frequencies.\n\n237\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.752\nAnd that is because 2.4 gigahertz\nspectrum, the ISM band is so\n\n238\n00:13:32.752 --> 00:13:37.957\nover saturated that they wanted to move\nto something that isn't so saturated.\n\n239\n00:13:37.957 --> 00:13:43.720\nAnd the five gigahertz spectrum\nisn't as saturated, now I say that.\n\n240\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.550\nAnd just like 2.4,\n\n241\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.610\nthere was a time when the 2.4\ngigahertz spectrum wasn't saturated.\n\n242\n00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.380\nAnd as we progressed,\nit got over saturated.\n\n243\n00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.799\nBut what's really cool about this\nis you're talking about gigabit\n\n244\n00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:54.900\nwireless, right.\n\n245\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.520\nThere was a time if you said gigabit\nwireless, somebody would say, yeah,\n\n246\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.270\nyou stand next to the access point.\n\n247\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.860\nBy the time you're done\nwith communicating,\n\n248\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.296\nyou'll have a tan on both sides, right.\n\n249\n00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:06.245\nCuz you'll be fried, but they've got it\ndown to where you can get up to 1,300\n\n250\n00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.320\nmegabit transfer speeds, potentially.\n\n251\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.230\nAnd again that is theoretical,\nkeep in mind.\n\n252\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.660\nDistances on both n and ac, you should get\nabout twice the distance on n than you did\n\n253\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.570\non the earlier legacy protocols.\n\n254\n00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.650\nAnd I just went ahead and again,\n\n255\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.578\nit's one of those things where\nyou have an indoor range.\n\n256\n00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:23.075\nAnd you have an outdoor range, and\n\n257\n00:14:23.075 --> 00:14:26.390\na lot of manufacturers don't like to\nquote ranges, and let me tell you why.\n\n258\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.270\nIf they quote you a range and\nyou don't get it, wouldn't you be upset?\n\n259\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:34.370\nI know I would, right, but they can't\naccount for things like obstructions,\n\n260\n00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:40.520\ninterference, so it's kinda harder\nto say exactly what you might see.\n\n261\n00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.550\nAC is backwards compatible within.\n\n262\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:47.120\nDo not let this five gigahertz\nimplementation make you think that it is\n\n263\n00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.970\nbackwards compatible with a, it is not.\n\n264\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.950\nWhen we look at the speeds,\nthe bandwidth speeds or\n\n265\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:03.320\nbandwidth the bandwidth in general, you'll\nsee that n implements 20 and 40 megahertz.\n\n266\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.750\nLet me kind of talk about that one.\n\n267\n00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.100\nWhy both when these others\nare only doing 20 megahertz?\n\n268\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.900\nWell n, if you're in legacy mode,\n\n269\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.370\nwhich means you're also supporting\nthese older technologies, g, b and n.\n\n270\n00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.762\nWhat it does is it take its bandwidth and\nit splits it in half.\n\n271\n00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:22.360\nAnd it says we're gonna\nreserve 20 megahertz for\n\n272\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.000\nthe legacy devices, and\n20 megahertz for the end devices.\n\n273\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.867\nIf you end up running in only n mode, and\nyou're not supporting those old devices,\n\n274\n00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:33.144\nthat's 40 megahertz\nbandwidth that you get.\n\n275\n00:15:33.144 --> 00:15:36.099\nBecause you're not reserving anything for\nthe older device.\n\n276\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:43.000\nWhen you look at AC,\nAC starts out at 40 and then it doubles.\n\n277\n00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.639\nIt goes to 80 megahertz and\n\n278\n00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:48.785\n160 megahertz bandwidth by multiple\nchannels being used at once.\n\n279\n00:15:48.785 --> 00:15:50.735\nOne time to send a single communication.\n\n280\n00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:55.332\nNow this supports MIMO, right,\nthe multiple in, multiple out.\n\n281\n00:15:55.332 --> 00:16:00.605\nBut even more so than that it supports\nsomething known as multi user MIMO, right?\n\n282\n00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:04.244\nBecause we need higher bandwidth today\nwith the fact that we've got a lot of\n\n283\n00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:07.947\nhigh-definition and real-time\ninformation going across our networks,\n\n284\n00:16:07.947 --> 00:16:10.630\nmulti-user MIMO might be\nwhat you need to implement.\n\n285\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:13.310\nIf you have things like device saturation,\n\n286\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.800\nbandwidth limitations on your internal\nnetwork, you might find now that you need\n\n287\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.020\nto upgrade to something like 8 spatial\nstreams in order to get that performance.\n\n288\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.510\nSo that's a little bit about the\nstandards, you do need to know about them.\n\n289\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.440\nBecause if there is incompatibility,\ncould be just the status mismatch.\n\n290\n00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if you've checked that and\nthat's not what seems to be the problem.\n\n291\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.420\nYou've checked your SSID,\neverything is good to go there.\n\n292\n00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.390\nLikewise mentioned about working\nin environment with older devices.\n\n293\n00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.950\nIf you see we kind of\nbackward compatibility.\n\n294\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.890\nThere is one other thing that\nyou might wanna think about.\n\n295\n00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.060\nAnd that's gonna be encryption and\n\n296\n00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.010\nwhat the device,\nthe access point and the laptop.\n\n297\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.750\nMaybe that particular access point, you\ndon't wanna drop it down to support what?\n\n298\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.900\nBecause well, if you don't know,\n\n299\n00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.040\nwe already talked about\nthat in a previous episode.\n\n300\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.630\nAnd I don't want to risk the security of\nmy other devices, or my entire network,\n\n301\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.160\njust because of a few devices\nI might decide, you know what?\n\n302\n00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.230\nIt's time for\nthese devices to be upgraded.\n\n303\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the things that\nI had a problem with is, not so\n\n304\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.380\nmuch today now because\nI've obviously fixed this.\n\n305\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.490\nBut I tried to put some older Android\ntablets on a network that I bumped it\n\n306\n00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.670\nup to the encryption level.\n\n307\n00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.890\nI went away from TCAP and I went to\nAES CCMP and the device wouldn't connect.\n\n308\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.760\nSo it didn't support\nthat level of encryption.\n\n309\n00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.570\nSo those encryption, using the wrong\nencryption like that might cause legacy\n\n310\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.840\ndevices to not even be able to connect,\nnot even be able to join the network.\n\n311\n00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.845\nBut there again that might be\nsomething that you need to do.\n\n312\n00:17:35.845 --> 00:17:38.775\nSo, just keep in mind what\nthe encryption might be.\n\n313\n00:17:40.145 --> 00:17:43.055\nAll right, so\nthat's pretty much got our standards.\n\n314\n00:17:43.055 --> 00:17:47.745\nDefinitely know those because those could\nbe incompatibility problems, as well.\n\n315\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.930\nSome of the other things\nthat they call out.\n\n316\n00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.270\nThey call out AP configurations,\nand, specifically, they call out.\n\n317\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.850\nLike, we talked about in other episodes,\nwe talked about the light-weight access,\n\n318\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.403\nor, excuse me, light-weight\naccess point protocol, all right?\n\n319\n00:18:01.403 --> 00:18:04.980\nRemember L-W-A-P-P, all right?\n\n320\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.910\nThis is when you have an access point that\nis called what's known as a thin access\n\n321\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.810\npoint, and a thin access point is really\nnothing more than a radio and an antenna.\n\n322\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.980\nIt's in the truest sense\nof an access point,\n\n323\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.790\nit gives access to your wireless network.\n\n324\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.560\nAnd all of the thin access\npoints they communicate back to\n\n325\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.910\na wireless LAN controller.\n\n326\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.520\nAnd it's the wireless LAN controller,\nthe wireless switch, if you will,\n\n327\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.290\nthat controls these thin access\npoints giving wireless devices access\n\n328\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.610\nthat it then controls, right.\n\n329\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.440\nThey also call out the thick,\nsometimes called a fat AP.\n\n330\n00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.840\nAnd essentially what a fat AP or\n\n331\n00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.290\na thick AP is one that is capable\nof managing all the devices.\n\n332\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.310\nSo if you put an access point on a network\nthat you're intending to control and\n\n333\n00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.190\nmanage the devices and it's a thin AP,\nit's not gonna do that.\n\n334\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.770\nAgain, it's looking to communicate\nwith a wireless LAN controller and\n\n335\n00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.590\nunfortunately that's not happening.\n\n336\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.598\nNow the other thing that might happen\ntoo in a misconfiguration of your access\n\n337\n00:18:58.598 --> 00:19:00.354\npoint, whether your talking thin or thick,\n\n338\n00:19:00.354 --> 00:19:02.825\nwhether your talking about\nthe light weight access protocol.\n\n339\n00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:08.014\nAnd usually when you have these devices\nthat are running that light weight\n\n340\n00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:13.704\nAP protocol, a lot of times they need to\ndiscover the wireless LAN controller and\n\n341\n00:19:13.704 --> 00:19:16.715\na lot of the times they\nuse DNS resolution,\n\n342\n00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:19.610\nname resolution to do that, right.\n\n343\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.650\nAnd this is just the normal\nDNS resolution, right?\n\n344\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.420\nThis isn't anything specific or anything\nunique to the wireless access point.\n\n345\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.240\nSo this also goes along with\nDNS issues that we have.\n\n346\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.750\nIf that device says, hey, I'm looking for\n\n347\n00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.410\na Cisco wireless local area\nnetwork controller, right?\n\n348\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.930\nAnd you've gotta name map to\nan IP address, it calls out, and\n\n349\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.810\nyou've got a name resolution issue.\n\n350\n00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:45.550\nThat might course that thin access point\nto not be able to communicate correctly\n\n351\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.270\nwith the wireless LAN controller and\n\n352\n00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.140\nnow you have a communication\nerror on your network.\n\n353\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.300\nAll right so I'm gonna lens a couple of\nthings that we talked about I just wanna\n\n354\n00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.840\nmake sure that we do touch base with that.\n\n355\n00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.780\nThey talk about things like throughput,\n\n356\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.330\nagain remember we talked about\nthe difference between bandwidth and\n\n357\n00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.290\nthroughput, bandwidth is the theoretical\ncapacity of your network, right.\n\n358\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.430\nHow much information at one\ntime could you potentially put?\n\n359\n00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.310\nIf I've got a gigabit Ethernet network,\n\n360\n00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.050\nit doesn't necessarily mean that I\nget gigabit Ethernet speeds, right.\n\n361\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.930\nIt jut means that theoretically if I\ncould saturate the entire network,\n\n362\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.070\nmy bandwidth would give me\nthat ability to do a gigabit.\n\n363\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:27.000\nWhen I run a protocol analyzer, when I run\na speed test on it, I see it's a gigabit,\n\n364\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.340\nbut it's running at 400\nmegabits per second.\n\n365\n00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.810\nWell, that 400 megabits isn't\nthe theoretical bandwidth,\n\n366\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.310\nthat's the throughput,\nthat's what's actually happening.\n\n367\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.040\nRemember, distance,\nwe've talked about that.\n\n368\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.980\nKnow your standards so\nyou know what distances they get.\n\n369\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.350\nKeep in mind that just because you\nincrease the power levels on your access\n\n370\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.500\npoints, doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou're gonna get a greater coverage area.\n\n371\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:52.950\nChannels themselves, remember a lot\nof times they're auto switching.\n\n372\n00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.920\nTo take care of things\nlike channel congestion,\n\n373\n00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.860\nyou might have to manually change\nthe channels in order to combat that.\n\n374\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.970\nAnd frequencies, again, Most commonly\nwhat we use today 2.4 gigaHertz and\n\n375\n00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.720\n5 gigaHertz, know your standard, so you\nknow if your device has been connecting,\n\n376\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.820\nyou might be using the wrong standard.\n\n377\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Well we definitely do see\na wider range of problems that\n\n378\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.730\ncan occur with other wireless\nnetworks versus our wired networks.\n\n379\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.990\nSo thank you Wes for taking the time to\nexplain those and of course our standards.\n\n380\n00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.250\nGotta love those.\n\n381\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.760\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us today.\n\n382\n00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.760\nBut stay tuned,\nwe do have more Net+ headed your way.\n\n383\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.910\nFor this show, I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your host, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n384\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:31.820\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n385\n00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.293\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n386\n00:21:33.293 -->

00:00:11.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.940\n&gt;&gt; All right greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.680\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.080\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.310\nin today's episode we are back\nwith more in our Network+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.975\nAnd of course joining me in\nthe studio again is our good friend,\n\n9\n00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.660\nour guiding star in this endeavor,\nthis is Mr. Wesley Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.100\nWesley, welcome back, how's it going, man?\n\n11\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great thanks for\nhaving me back down.\n\n12\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.850\nIt is a pleasure to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.983\nAnd that's right,\n\n14\n00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:37.254\nwe are going to move through our wonderful\nNet+ series that we have been in.\n\n15\n00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:40.999\nAnd we are gonna be looking at some\nthings that affect copper cablings.\n\n16\n00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.989\nSince copper cabling is one of\nthe most prevalent medias today inside\n\n17\n00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.449\nof local area networks.\n\n18\n00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.283\nIt is something that you could encounter.\n\n19\n00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:51.724\nAnd you might need to know a little\nbit about, much more so for\n\n20\n00:00:51.724 --> 00:00:53.290\nthe certifications exam.\n\n21\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.940\nSo, we're gonna take a look\nat specifically copper.\n\n22\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.844\nThere are some other one that will look\nat things like network devices and\n\n23\n00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:03.352\nlogical problems versus physical problems.\n\n24\n00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.235\nWell I guess this is a physical\nproblem cuz it's the copper media.\n\n25\n00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:09.531\nBut we'll also look at fiber\nin other episodes as well so,\n\n26\n00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:11.763\nthat is what we are gonna look at today.\n\n27\n00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:14.789\nSo one of the first things\nthey call out are shorts.\n\n28\n00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.932\nAnd when it comes to a short, guys,\n\n29\n00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:20.515\nreally that is just the fact\nthat the cable could be broken.\n\n30\n00:01:20.515 --> 00:01:22.315\nAnd it's not receiving a signal.\n\n31\n00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.342\nIt could be something that's intermittent.\n\n32\n00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.125\nAnd that I probably should go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.425\nset the stage that some of these\nissues could be intermittent issues.\n\n34\n00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:33.875\nAnd it might be very hard to\ntroubleshoot if you don't apply\n\n35\n00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.440\nthe right troubleshooting\nmethodology to it.\n\n36\n00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.750\nAnd we're gonna talk about\ntroubleshooting as well, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.380\nthat methodology in another episode.\n\n38\n00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.980\nBut I do wanna kinda bring\nit back to the OSI model.\n\n39\n00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.683\nSee, we talk a lot about the OSI model,\nand\n\n40\n00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:50.931\nwe pretty much just talk\nabout things like theory.\n\n41\n00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.286\nAnd everybody thinks that I need\nto know this for the Net+ exam.\n\n42\n00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:59.291\nBut then once I know that model and\nI've passed the exam.\n\n43\n00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.258\nCan I go ahead and\n\n44\n00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:04.640\njust not think about that theoretical\nseven layer model anymore?\n\n45\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.190\nWell, you got to understand that the OSI\nmodel there can also be used for\n\n46\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.780\ntroubleshooting as well.\n\n47\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.870\nI know that one of our other hosts\nhere that is at ITProTV anytime I say,\n\n48\n00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.720\nhey I'm having an issue with such and\nsuch.\n\n49\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.360\nThe first thing he tells me is he says,\nwell, have you checked the physical layer?\n\n50\n00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.950\nAnd you gotta think.\n\n51\n00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.180\nWell, what is the physical layer?\n\n52\n00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.540\nAnd that's things like your cables, right?\n\n53\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.440\nThe copper media, I can look at things\nlike light status or network adapter.\n\n54\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.970\nIs the network adapter\neven in the machine?\n\n55\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.419\nSo this is definitely gonna be\ntroubleshooting at the physical layer of\n\n56\n00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:35.173\nthe OSI model.\n\n57\n00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:36.444\nAnd it's gonna be very important.\n\n58\n00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:38.304\nAgain, keep in mind things like shorts.\n\n59\n00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:43.079\nShorts might not manifest\nthemselves consistently, so\n\n60\n00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.066\nthey can be kinda hard to diagnose.\n\n61\n00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:49.334\nThe other thing they also call\nout is open impedance mismatches.\n\n62\n00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:53.937\nThis was usually with things like when\nyou have older networks that would\n\n63\n00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:56.282\nsupport things like coaxial cable.\n\n64\n00:02:56.282 --> 00:02:59.278\nOne of the things that could happen is\nthat you could have these impedance\n\n65\n00:02:59.278 --> 00:02:59.877\nmismatches.\n\n66\n00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:02.935\nAnd a lot of the times it's that\nthey were improper termination.\n\n67\n00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:09.928\nAnd when a signal is sent down a medium\nif you will and it's not terminated,\n\n68\n00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:14.930\nthen what you get is that\nabrupt change in impedance.\n\n69\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.170\nAnd what happen is the signal reflects\nback to its originating source.\n\n70\n00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.803\nAnd you can imagine in those earlier\nnetworks that were already contention\n\n71\n00:03:23.803 --> 00:03:25.063\nbased, CSMA-CD.\n\n72\n00:03:25.063 --> 00:03:28.185\nAgain, one person talks, everybody hears.\n\n73\n00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:31.863\nThat any kind of signal reflection on\none of those coaxial cables could be\n\n74\n00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:32.777\na really bad day.\n\n75\n00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:37.619\nAnd it really could bring the whole entire\nnetwork down to a crawl if not completely\n\n76\n00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:38.920\nbring them offline.\n\n77\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.170\nBecause if a signal bounces off,\nright, well then\n\n78\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.740\nit's just gonna stay on that wire and\nit's gonna stay on that wire indefinitely.\n\n79\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.650\nAnd that's the purpose of termination, and\n\n80\n00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.060\nthat's probably something\nthat we should explain.\n\n81\n00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.250\nWhy is this happening?\n\n82\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.280\nWell it really starts with\nthe terminator in itself right.\n\n83\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.340\nThe terminator what does it do?\n\n84\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.400\nWell as that signal, that unprocess signal\ncomes down the end of that cable and\n\n85\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.590\nit hits the resistor essentially,\nwhat does it do?\n\n86\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.230\nWell the resistor just absorbs it,\nright, it just absorbs that signal so\n\n87\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.830\nit doesn't bounce back.\n\n88\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.440\nBut if there's an impedance mismatch,\n\n89\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.140\nthe moment it hits that mismatch,\nit reflects and goes back to the source.\n\n90\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.550\nSo these are things that can\nmanifest themselves in a network\n\n91\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.340\nbasically operating very, very poorly.\n\n92\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.270\nAnd it's one of those things that you\nmight have to get some kind of cable\n\n93\n00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.315\ntester put on it to be\nable to identify it.\n\n94\n00:04:28.315 --> 00:04:29.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Wes,\n\n95\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.320\ntermination of the inside cables can cause\na myriad of different types of problems.\n\n96\n00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.880\nThe fact that you've used\nmaybe a different standard.\n\n97\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.850\nGo down the list, actually, Wes, I think\nyou have an actual list of things that can\n\n98\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.790\ngo wrong when you terminate incorrectly.\n\n99\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.630\n&gt;&gt; Definitely,\nhere's one that Dan's alluding to.\n\n100\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.678\nYou see, a lot of the older networking\ncables, they relied on 50 ohm resistors.\n\n101\n00:04:51.678 --> 00:04:56.387\nMost of the cabling that we have today\nthat's still coaxial are things like the,\n\n102\n00:04:56.387 --> 00:04:59.374\neven though I know it's kinda dated now,\nRG59.\n\n103\n00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:03.370\nAnd we use RG6 more commonly today\nin things like cable television.\n\n104\n00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:10.005\nAnd cable modems,\nthey rely on 75 ohm resistors.\n\n105\n00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.335\nSo there could be an impedance\nmismatch improperly terminating,\n\n106\n00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:17.700\nhappen to be put in a 75 ohm\nresistor on a 50 ohm cable, right?\n\n107\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.570\nSo, your resistance has to match the\nelectrical characteristics of the cable.\n\n108\n00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.850\nNow I say that,\n\n109\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.450\nDan I know that you guys have probably\ngot a cable modem at your house.\n\n110\n00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen the resistors?\n\n111\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.130\n&gt;&gt; I have never seen the resistors, I\nassume they're inside the cable modems and\n\n112\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.080\nthe end devices.\n\n113\n00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.630\n&gt;&gt; You got it.\nKnocked it out of the ball park.\n\n114\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.158\nWe usually don't have to deal with\nthem too much anymore because\n\n115\n00:05:40.158 --> 00:05:42.960\nthe devices themselves do\nthe termination today.\n\n116\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.530\nAgain, if you have some kind of cabling\nthat has some kind of bend in it or\n\n117\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.750\nhas been crimped wrong,\nyou might see this as well.\n\n118\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.881\nSo open impedance mismatches again\nusually cause signal reflection.\n\n119\n00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:58.496\nNow, some of the other things\nthat they talk about, again,\n\n120\n00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:00.049\nunder the incorrect termination.\n\n121\n00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:03.270\nIs more so like, for instance,\nthings that we do today.\n\n122\n00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.765\nYou remember in another episode, we talked\nabout the TIA/EIA-568 building standards.\n\n123\n00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:14.241\nThey define a wiring standard for\nRJ45 jacks.\n\n124\n00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:20.225\nWell we have to make sure that those jacks\nare wired the right way on both sides.\n\n125\n00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:24.624\nImproper termination means that\nyou could have for instance,\n\n126\n00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:29.560\n568A on one side and\n568B wiring scheme on the other side.\n\n127\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.512\nNow if you expect it,\nwe call it a crossover cable, right?\n\n128\n00:06:33.512 --> 00:06:34.741\nIf you are using that,\n\n129\n00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:38.968\nif you are plugging into a device or\ndoing a direct point to point connection.\n\n130\n00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:41.417\nLet's say between your network adapter and\nyour laptop, and\n\n131\n00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.130\nmaybe an IP camera that\nyou're trying to service.\n\n132\n00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.881\nThat's okay,\nthat's not going to cause a problem.\n\n133\n00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:49.478\nBut, if you wire it wrong like that.\n\n134\n00:06:49.478 --> 00:06:52.009\nIf I just happen to grab\none of these cables here.\n\n135\n00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.148\nAnd I have no clue and I don't look,\nand I don't pay attention.\n\n136\n00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.687\nAnd I plug it into the patch panel and\n\n137\n00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:58.954\nmaybe obviously this one's\nnot going to go too far.\n\n138\n00:06:58.954 --> 00:06:59.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But\n\n139\n00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.600\nI plug it into the other device, right?\n\n140\n00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.879\nI don't understand why\naren't I getting any signal?\n\n141\n00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:08.427\nWell that's because one side of\nthis could be wired up for 568A.\n\n142\n00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:11.259\nAnd the other one, if somebody didn't\npay attention to what they're doing.\n\n143\n00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:17.075\nAnd probably more often than not it would\nbe this one would be wired up to 568B.\n\n144\n00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:22.050\nAnd somebody just comes along and\nwires this side up to 568A.\n\n145\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.010\nNow I will tell you something, if you're\nbuying your cables, right, they're precut,\n\n146\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.690\npreterminated for you.\n\n147\n00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.380\nA lot of times you don't\nhave to worry about it.\n\n148\n00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.882\nAll you have to do is look\nat the side of the cable and\n\n149\n00:07:31.882 --> 00:07:36.004\nit usually has some kind of little marking\non it that will tell you how it's wired.\n\n150\n00:07:36.004 --> 00:07:39.395\nAgain a lot of these patch cables and\nstuff, okay.\n\n151\n00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:45.414\nThis one is 568B we can see right\non the side of this cable here.\n\n152\n00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.188\nI know what the standard is.\n\n153\n00:07:48.188 --> 00:07:51.920\nAnd if I'm familiar with the wiring\nstandard than I should be able to\n\n154\n00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.695\nterminate the cable right now.\n\n155\n00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:57.231\nI say sure and I can see Dan over here out\nof the corner of my eye kind of laughing.\n\n156\n00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:02.571\nBecause I have this thing where I kinda\nmade up my own standard, the 568W.\n\n157\n00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.750\n[CROSSTALK] That's right, and\nyou can hear it in the background there.\n\n158\n00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.845\nAnd that's because, well, it's very\neasy to do a wiring mismatch on it.\n\n159\n00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:14.160\nAnd you can't figure out why it is that\nyour cable isn't working correctly.\n\n160\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know a lot of guys that they\njust say you know what, I learned 568A,\n\n161\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.000\nand that's all I'm ever gonna wire.\n\n162\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.465\nIf I do a wiring job it's all 568A.\n\n163\n00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:23.962\nEverybody that works for me uses 568A.\n\n164\n00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:26.290\nThey never deviate for that very reason.\n\n165\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.173\nWes, just a quick question,\nmaybe you know the answer to this.\n\n166\n00:08:29.173 --> 00:08:32.347\nIf I wire 568A on this wire and\nI plug a node in to it and\n\n167\n00:08:32.347 --> 00:08:35.943\nI wire 568B on this wire and\nI plug a different node into it.\n\n168\n00:08:35.943 --> 00:08:37.410\nAre they going to be able to talk?\n\n169\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.140\n&gt;&gt; Well they should be\nable to talk just fine.\n\n170\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.025\nReally, unless it's a networking device.\n\n171\n00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:45.694\nBecause the networking device is expecting\nwhat's known as a straight through cable.\n\n172\n00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:50.291\nAnd it supports a functionality that\nactually does the twist inside for\n\n173\n00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:53.675\nus, doing the forwarding between ports and\nstuff.\n\n174\n00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.992\nSo if I have one of those 568A and\n568B and\n\n175\n00:08:56.992 --> 00:09:01.085\nthey're basically connected\nto two network adapters.\n\n176\n00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:03.175\nYou've created a point-to-point\nconnection, right?\n\n177\n00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.335\nIn the earlier days,\nprior to having our ethernet,\n\n178\n00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:08.795\nwe would use our RS-232 no\nmodem cables to do this, right?\n\n179\n00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:10.926\nAnd that would be a serial\npoint-to-point connection.\n\n180\n00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:14.285\nNow, because we're not using those\nserial connectors for the most part,\n\n181\n00:09:14.285 --> 00:09:16.055\nwe still use console cables and stuff.\n\n182\n00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.104\nBut they're a little bit\ndifferent in how they're wired.\n\n183\n00:09:18.104 --> 00:09:20.120\nWe can make those point\nto point connections.\n\n184\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.250\nAnd I'll tell you like I said in\nan example that I had to use up.\n\n185\n00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.509\nAgain we had,\nin a former company that I worked for,\n\n186\n00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:28.590\nthey got a bunch of these IP cams.\n\n187\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.473\nAnd they got them at a discount\ncuz the company had gone under or\n\n188\n00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:32.536\nsomething like that.\n\n189\n00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.962\nAnd they were selling off a lot\nof their networking equipment.\n\n190\n00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:37.797\nAnd one of them just happened\nto be a bunch of these IP cams.\n\n191\n00:09:37.797 --> 00:09:41.757\nAnd they can get kind of expensive,\nso we had to reset them.\n\n192\n00:09:41.757 --> 00:09:44.986\nThe problem was they were setup for\nstatic IP assignments.\n\n193\n00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:50.009\nAnd there was no way that we could get\nthem a DHCP assignment on our networks or\n\n194\n00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:50.882\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n195\n00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:51.448\n&gt;&gt; Talk to them.\n\n196\n00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:51.950\n&gt;&gt; Exactly what they were.\n\n197\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.140\nWe couldn't talk to them, exactly.\n\n198\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.193\nSo what I did is I wired up\na crossover cable, 568A on one side,\n\n199\n00:09:57.193 --> 00:09:58.905\n568B on the other side.\n\n200\n00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:00.784\nWent ahead, plugged directly into them.\n\n201\n00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:04.558\nAnd then I could communicate directly\nwith that device because I didn't need to\n\n202\n00:10:04.558 --> 00:10:06.260\ngo through a connectivity device.\n\n203\n00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.020\nNow, that's all good if\nwe're expecting it, right?\n\n204\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.390\nIf we know what's going on, then we know\nthat, hey, I've gotta do that, right?\n\n205\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.820\nI know that I'm working at a company like\nDAN that's using 568 all over the place.\n\n206\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.556\nThen if I'm going to make a cross over\ncable I just got to put B on one of\n\n207\n00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:22.495\nthe ends,\nright because there's a standard.\n\n208\n00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:25.661\nBut if you're not aware of that,\nif you're not documenting.\n\n209\n00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:28.828\nOr if you have these fly\nby night administrators.\n\n210\n00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:31.485\nThat are just pretty much\nwiring it any way they want,\n\n211\n00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:33.153\nthey don't document anything.\n\n212\n00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:35.958\nIt can become pretty tricky to\nfigure out what's going on and\n\n213\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.933\nthen you're definitely gonna\nneed one of those cable testers.\n\n214\n00:10:38.933 --> 00:10:41.798\nNow, that being said, that the crossover\ncable might cause problems.\n\n215\n00:10:41.798 --> 00:10:45.152\nWe might not be able to communicate\nstraight through cables.\n\n216\n00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:49.232\nAll right, that's what we use when we\nconnect our network adapter straight into\n\n217\n00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.733\nsome kind of network device.\n\n218\n00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:53.020\nOr a switch if you will or a patch panel.\n\n219\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.980\nNow what if you're doing\nlike I was doing and\n\n220\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.810\nyou're trying to connect\nto that IP camera directly?\n\n221\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.310\nWell, guess what?\n\n222\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.399\nIf I put a straight through cable on it,\nnot gonna communicate.\n\n223\n00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:07.070\nSo it's important to understand what\nthe cable is that you're working with to\n\n224\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.635\nmake sure.\n\n225\n00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:12.020\nIf a network communication isn't happening\nthe way you want, look at the cable.\n\n226\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.510\nFind out what the specification is.\n\n227\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:17.460\nFind out if it's been wired or\nbeen miswired.\n\n228\n00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.000\nAnd that can help you out a lot.\n\n229\n00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.430\nSo those things do happen as well.\n\n230\n00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.910\nPay attention to your\nstraight-through cables and\n\n231\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.360\npay attention to your crossover cables.\n\n232\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.440\nWhen you expect it you use\nthem where you need them.\n\n233\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.000\nIf you're not expecting it it\ncan cause communication problems\n\n234\n00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.820\nacross your network.\n\n235\n00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.455\n&gt;&gt; I know this has actually become kind\nof a little bit of a problem right.\n\n236\n00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:35.142\nBecause it's so easy for\nthese mismatches to occur.\n\n237\n00:11:35.142 --> 00:11:37.798\nThat things like Cisco,\nequipment, Internet of Things,\n\n238\n00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:39.400\nthey're starting to auto detect.\n\n239\n00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.193\nOkay, well I'm expecting this,\nit's not that, they change the pin out.\n\n240\n00:11:45.193 --> 00:11:49.995\n&gt;&gt; They are, it's a technology I'm\ntrying to think, I think it's MDI and\n\n241\n00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:51.500\nMDIX, are those two.\n\n242\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.130\nAnd it's just saying that the device,\n\n243\n00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.700\nlike Dan's saying,\nI expect a straight through cable.\n\n244\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.060\nDon't give me a crossover cable.\n\n245\n00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.400\nI expect a straight through cable\nbecause if you're sending to this port,\n\n246\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.360\nI'm gonna switch the transmit and\nreceive lines.\n\n247\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.620\nI'm gonna receive it obviously\non the transmit lines.\n\n248\n00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.220\nBut then I'm going to send it out.\n\n249\n00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.820\nThe receive line's out that port,\n\n250\n00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.490\nso if your switch isn't configured like\nthat, it'll definitely cause problems.\n\n251\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's nice to have those auto switches.\n\n252\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.170\n&gt;&gt; It sure is.\n&gt;&gt; Where it just says,\n\n253\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.200\nI know what you're doing here.\n\n254\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.590\nI can see this is a crossover cable,\nso I can work with it accordingly.\n\n255\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens all the time.\n\n256\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.481\nDon't worry about it.\n\n257\n00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:25.385\nWe've got you covered.\n\n258\n00:12:25.385 --> 00:12:26.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Definitely.\n\n259\n00:12:26.045 --> 00:12:27.652\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes,\nwhat else do we have to do?\n\n260\n00:12:27.652 --> 00:12:29.443\nCopper cabling issues we might run into?\n\n261\n00:12:29.443 --> 00:12:31.510\n&gt;&gt; We've got, this is a big one.\n\n262\n00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.430\nThis one's called crosstalk.\n\n263\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.630\nCrosstalk, there are a few\ndifferent kinds of them.\n\n264\n00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.610\nSo they do call out\na couple of specific ones.\n\n265\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.620\nThey call out what's known\nas near-end crosstalk and\n\n266\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.720\nwhat's called far-end crosstalk.\n\n267\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.791\nYou might see these abbreviated as next,\nnear, NNE, and\n\n268\n00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:52.208\nthen crosstalk, so NEXT,\nthey don't abbreviate them here.\n\n269\n00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:54.001\nBut if you guys are studying out there and\n\n270\n00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:57.238\nyou want a little bit more information\nabout the electrical mechanics.\n\n271\n00:12:57.238 --> 00:13:01.084\nYou don't need to know that for\nthe CompTIA exam, I'll tell you guys, but\n\n272\n00:13:01.084 --> 00:13:02.070\nif you want.\n\n273\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.361\nJust know that near end\ncross talk is called NEXT.\n\n274\n00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:05.783\nAnd VEXT?\n\n275\n00:13:05.783 --> 00:13:06.776\n&gt;&gt; Vext.\n\n276\n00:13:06.776 --> 00:13:08.870\n&gt;&gt; It's actually a term,\nfar end cross talk.\n\n277\n00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.475\nThose are the two that they call out.\n\n278\n00:13:10.475 --> 00:13:13.349\nAnd I am gonna mention another one\nthat's not called out on the exam.\n\n279\n00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:17.640\nBut we want you to know this one as well\ncuz you might come across it in the field.\n\n280\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.930\nEspecially if you're gonna be one of\nthose ones that's always in cables.\n\n281\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.280\nNow what is up with near end cross talk?\n\n282\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.780\nAll right, I got a little diagram,\na very simplistic diagram.\n\n283\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.828\nAgain, at its most simplistic form,\nnear end cross talk is something that\n\n284\n00:13:31.828 --> 00:13:35.717\nhappens quite literally at\nthe ends of the cables, okay?\n\n285\n00:13:35.717 --> 00:13:40.157\nMore often than not, all right,\nnear end crosstalk is going to be\n\n286\n00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:43.816\nbecause somebody kicked\nthe back of their computer.\n\n287\n00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:46.196\nWe had a rats' nest in\nthe back of that computer and\n\n288\n00:13:46.196 --> 00:13:48.590\nI know we've all got rolling\nchairs next to ours.\n\n289\n00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.540\nWe've got nice cable trays.\n\n290\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.630\nBut not every company's gonna have\nsome of the cool cable management\n\n291\n00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.380\nstuff that we have here in our building.\n\n292\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.970\nAnd I'm sure you guys have seen it, right?\n\n293\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.710\n[LAUGH] You see that big old rats'\nnest on the back of the computer.\n\n294\n00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.740\nA thousand USB ports on there, and\n50 of them are attached, just kidding.\n\n295\n00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.723\nBut you have your network cables as well.\n\n296\n00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:09.759\nWell, when the end of\nthat cable gets damaged.\n\n297\n00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:13.687\nWhat happens is as the electrical\nsignal goes down the end of the cable,\n\n298\n00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.270\nit starts to leak out.\n\n299\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.620\nEssentially bleed right out of the cable,\nright?\n\n300\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.910\nAnd this can cause communication problems.\n\n301\n00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.300\nNear end,\nthis is exactly what it sounds like, guys.\n\n302\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.370\nIt's not really too highly technical.\n\n303\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.470\nYou could always get technical with it,\nit's some kind of electrical engineering.\n\n304\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.105\nAnd you can break out letters and\nmath, and that's beyond me, so.\n\n305\n00:14:31.105 --> 00:14:33.225\n[LAUGH] But no, very basically,\n\n306\n00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:37.711\nit just means that as it's transmitting\ndown to the end of the line.\n\n307\n00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:41.600\nIt meets that typically some kind\nof broken or damaged connector.\n\n308\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Wes, the big devil all the time that\nkinda shows up when you talk about\n\n309\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.910\nMPR problems with cabling.\n\n310\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.450\nRight?\n\n311\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.980\nOne of the big ones that we always get is\ngonna be that electronic interference.\n\n312\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.480\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n313\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Don't stick stuff next to a microwave.\n\n314\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.925\nDon't run cables next to the power cable.\n\n315\n00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:57.123\nBecause we don't want that electronic\n\n316\n00:14:57.123 --> 00:14:58.990\ninterference.\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\n\n317\n00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.848\nlet me go ahead and let me talk\nabout one more, the far end cross.\n\n318\n00:15:02.848 --> 00:15:04.436\nAnd we'll get right back to that.\n\n319\n00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:06.549\n&gt;&gt; I'm just so excited about it.\n\n320\n00:15:06.549 --> 00:15:07.397\n&gt;&gt; That's okay.\n\n321\n00:15:07.397 --> 00:15:08.037\nYou know what,\n\n322\n00:15:08.037 --> 00:15:11.697\nelectromagnetic interference, that's\nexactly what's happening with crosstalk.\n\n323\n00:15:11.697 --> 00:15:13.566\nBecause if you think about it it's\n\n324\n00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:16.283\nbleeding out of the cable\nif the cable is damaged.\n\n325\n00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:17.879\nAnd it could actually send those\n\n326\n00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:21.730\nelectrical signals in to the ground wires\nthat are on the inside of the cable.\n\n327\n00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.218\nAnd now you've got electromagnetic\n\n328\n00:15:23.218 --> 00:15:26.300\ninterference.\nSo it's really right there in the realm.\n\n329\n00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.900\nNow far end cross talk is\na little bit different.\n\n330\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.910\nI want you to think of\nthe point from the transmitter.\n\n331\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.080\nThe transmitter is the starting point,\nright?\n\n332\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.500\nIn the last one when we said near-end\ncrosstalk, it could be the switch, right?\n\n333\n00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.889\nThey're sending signals out that port,\nit's not the switch's fault but\n\n334\n00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:44.213\nthe cable itself is crushed on either end,\nright?\n\n335\n00:15:44.213 --> 00:15:48.378\nOr at this point it could be the computer\nsending information back into the switch.\n\n336\n00:15:48.378 --> 00:15:53.056\nAnd that end of the cable becomes\ncorrupted somehow as well.\n\n337\n00:15:53.056 --> 00:15:56.037\nWhen we talk about far end crosstalk,\n\n338\n00:15:56.037 --> 00:16:02.260\nI want you to think about it is the end\nfrom the transmitting source, right.\n\n339\n00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.880\nWhen it comes to far end crosstalk this is\nessentially a coupling between two or more\n\n340\n00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.450\ntransmitting pairs, and as that signal\npropagates down to the end It impedes\n\n341\n00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.820\nif you will on the signals at the end of\nthe cable, that's far end cross talk.\n\n342\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.890\nAll right now, moving into what Dan\nasked we also have, there's a lot\n\n343\n00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.580\nof things when it comes to electromagnetic\ninterference that we have to worry about.\n\n344\n00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.320\nAnd that's what EMI stands for.\n\n345\n00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.470\nNow, they call out EMI, RFI, so I went\nahead Dan, and I whooped these together\n\n346\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.660\neven though they technically\nthey could be separate concepts.\n\n347\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.200\nBut, when it comes down to it,\n\n348\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.730\nwe're talking about a signal\nto noise ratio, right.\n\n349\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.550\nWhat's noise?\n\n350\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.170\nWell, what's signal?\n\n351\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.700\nThat's, signal's what you want.\n\n352\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.180\nThat's what I'm sending from my computer\nover the network back to Dan's computer.\n\n353\n00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.950\nThat's the signal, right.\n\n354\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.180\nNoise is anything else.\n\n355\n00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.530\nThat's what electromagnetic\ninterference is.\n\n356\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.510\nAnything else other than the signal\nthat you want to send on the wire.\n\n357\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.220\nNow, what are some of the sources\nof electromagnetic interference?\n\n358\n00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.900\nWell, some of the big ones here.\n\n359\n00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.450\nSome of these you can do something about.\n\n360\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.000\nI'm gonna tell you some of them.\n\n361\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.150\nYou might not be able\nto do anything about.\n\n362\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.320\nLike the first one.\n\n363\n00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.360\nPower lines,\nhigh voltage power lines, right.\n\n364\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.610\nDan, if we've got some high voltage power\nlines out back, do you think we can\n\n365\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.300\nreally just start digging things up,\nand moving those power lines?\n\n366\n00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.410\n&gt;&gt; That's probably not the best idea.\n\n367\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.710\n&gt;&gt; Probably not gonna happen.\n\n368\n00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.230\nAnd don't ever try it because we\ndon't want anybody getting hurt with\n\n369\n00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.170\nelectricity.\n\n370\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.340\nBut, what do I have?\n\n371\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.640\nWhat do I have as an option,\nif it is something like that,\n\n372\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.350\nwhere we can't move the building, we\ncan't move the high voltage power lines.\n\n373\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.150\nWell, this is where you implement STP,\nShielded Twisted Pair.\n\n374\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.390\nPreferably something like six or\nsix a, with shielding in it.\n\n375\n00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.540\nNow, is it expensive?\n\n376\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.460\nYou can bet it's expensive.\n\n377\n00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.580\nAny time you add an extra material\nto your twisted pair, like a shield,\n\n378\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.840\nit's gonna add to the cost as well.\n\n379\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.720\nBut, when it comes down to it,\n\n380\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.360\nis that less expensive than\nmaybe implementing fiber?\n\n381\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.130\nProbably, but fiber's also an option too.\n\n382\n00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.280\nIf you're in some kind of medical\nfacility where there's radiation, and\n\n383\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.600\nI didn't even put that one on the list.\n\n384\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.030\nIf you have a lot of radiation,\n\n385\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.770\nlike a radiology department,\nyou might have to run fiber, right?\n\n386\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.730\nBecause then, you don't have to worry\nabout the electromagnetic interference.\n\n387\n00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:11.280\n&gt;&gt; So, interesting thing I was looking\nat your diagram you have up here and\n\n388\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.440\nI seen the EMI and the RFI and\nI'm like man, they've got to be related.\n\n389\n00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.990\nMy limited physics background\nstarted kicking in, so\n\n390\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.080\nI looked it up really quickly,\nthey are the same thing.\n\n391\n00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.030\n&gt;&gt; They are the same as always.\n\n392\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.990\n&gt;&gt; They are the same, yeah.\n\n393\n00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.110\n&gt;&gt; And that's what it boils down too.\n\n394\n00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.510\nThat's why I always say its noise.\n\n395\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's anything that doesn't belong\n\n396\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.970\non that cable.\n\n397\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.150\n&gt;&gt; Why don't they just call it that?\n\n398\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.475\nWhy don't they just say noise,\nlet's just call this noise.\n\n399\n00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:31.975\n&gt;&gt; They should\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n400\n00:18:31.975 --> 00:18:33.765\n&gt;&gt; We really need to wrap this episode up\n\n401\n00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.085\nand say pay attention to your signal and\nnoise ratio.\n\n402\n00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:37.627\nAs your signal and noise ratio goes up,\n\n403\n00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:40.726\nthat means the signal is dropping, and\nthe noise is getting a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:18:40.726 --> 00:18:44.185\nIt means you've got a lot of interference.\n\n405\n00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:45.055\nSo, it\n\n406\n00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:47.190\nis some kind of electro interference.\n\n407\n00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.010\nCuz Ultimately,\nwhat are we looking at, guys?\n\n408\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.570\nWe're looking at electromagnetic\nspectrum either way.\n\n409\n00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.610\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; HVAC system,\n\n410\n00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.800\nHVAC is another one that we have to watch.\n\n411\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.830\nEvery building pretty\nmuch has a HVAC system.\n\n412\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.520\nAnd if you have a datacenter,\nyou probably got a pretty HVAC system too.\n\n413\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.750\nWhat I'm I talking about.\n\n414\n00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.030\nHeating ventilation and AC.\n\n415\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.720\nNow, I went ahead nd put\nheating down here too.\n\n416\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.900\nBecause heating ventilation and\nAC could be the system itself.\n\n417\n00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.470\nBut, any kinda heating element.\n\n418\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.340\nI just put generically heating units,\nany kinda heating element.\n\n419\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.860\nI know my wife,\nmy wife doesn't like cold weather at all.\n\n420\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.910\nSo, if it gets below 75,\n[LAUGH] maybe not that much.\n\n421\n00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.670\n&gt;&gt; She's freezing?\n\n422\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.240\n&gt;&gt; She's freezing.\n\n423\n00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.950\nSo, what does she do?\n\n424\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.840\nShe pulls out the electrical heater,\nshe puts it by her feet.\n\n425\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.641\nWell, there is a twisted pair\nof cable going into the back of\n\n426\n00:19:32.641 --> 00:19:35.290\nher computer that now we have\na heating element next to.\n\n427\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.858\nNow, I'm not really picking on her,\nbut the fact of the matter\n\n428\n00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:40.780\nis that could impede the signal that's\ncoming to us through that wire.\n\n429\n00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.900\n&gt;&gt; And that happens a lot.\n\n430\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.380\nI've worked in plenty of\nbuildings with older people.\n\n431\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.090\nThey don't have as great circulation.\n\n432\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.390\nThey have little heaters.\n\n433\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.170\nWhere do they go?\n\n434\n00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.480\nRight next to their computer.\n\n435\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.170\n&gt;&gt; You better believe it.\n\n436\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.370\nHere's another one if you're up north,\n\n437\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.890\nI know that you guys in the Greater\nNortheast there, I worked there.\n\n438\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:55.760\nI used to be a painter.\n\n439\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.200\nI used to have to take\nthe electrical heating units off.\n\n440\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.980\nOff the wall and paint them.\n\n441\n00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:06.030\nSo, if you've got things like your network\ncables are going across those lines,\n\n442\n00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.480\nor next to those lines,\nthat could cause problems too.\n\n443\n00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.970\nNow HIDs, I put HIDs in here too,\nhigh intensity discharge lamps.\n\n444\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.170\nSo you might say,\n\n445\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.655\nwell why would I have a high intensity\ndischarge lamp in my office?\n\n446\n00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:20.357\nWell, this isn't about your office,\n\n447\n00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:22.523\nwhat do you usually have\noutside of the building,\n\n448\n00:20:22.523 --> 00:20:26.050\nthat needs a network communication, that\na lot of times is right next to a light?\n\n449\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.940\nA camera, and those cameras\nare attached to your network.\n\n450\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.900\nAnd if they're radiated energy,\nthey're wireless camera, or\n\n451\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.050\nwired, you're gonna have all sorts\nof interference with those cameras,\n\n452\n00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.160\nwhen it comes to them communicating\nback to your network, right?\n\n453\n00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.560\nEven it if is some kind of closed circuit\ntelevision, you still have cameras.\n\n454\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.020\nSo, that's where those can come into play.\n\n455\n00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.030\nRF Towers, again radio frequency towers,\n\n456\n00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.450\nthere's nothing we can\ndo about those guys.\n\n457\n00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.065\nBut, we can implement things\nlike shield and twisted pair.\n\n458\n00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:55.530\nTwo-way radios, right.\n\n459\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:56.980\nAnd the good thing is, I mean for\n\n460\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.110\nthe most part they're getting really good\nabout being able to cancel out noise and\n\n461\n00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.470\nstuff like that, but these things could\nstill hinder your overall communication.\n\n462\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.850\nGot cell phones, cell phones.\n\n463\n00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.030\nNow, I'm not an electrician guy so\nbear with me on this one.\n\n464\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.930\nI think they're called junction boxes.\n\n465\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:17.575\nThis is where in a building all the points\nof electrical cables terminate.\n\n466\n00:21:17.575 --> 00:21:23.570\nThere is a lot of electricity flowing\nthrough that junction box and guess what?\n\n467\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.210\nIf you're running cables\nnext to that junction box\n\n468\n00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.820\nit could be breeding over in\nyour network communications.\n\n469\n00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.170\nAll right, access points are another\none right access points they give off\n\n470\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.620\nradio frequency, so\nradio frequency interference likewise.\n\n471\n00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.942\nSo, these are just some of the things\nthat you could see That could overall\n\n472\n00:21:42.942 --> 00:21:44.694\naffect your communication.\n\n473\n00:21:44.694 --> 00:21:47.893\nSome of the other things that\ncan affect your communication,\n\n474\n00:21:47.893 --> 00:21:49.810\nthings like distance limitations.\n\n475\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.510\nRemember copper cable, copper mediums?\n\n476\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.170\nTypically, twisted pair today,\n\n477\n00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:57.670\nwithout needing an amplifier or\ngenerically a repeater.\n\n478\n00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.630\nWe can go 100 meters.\n\n479\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.960\nKeep in mind if you're in 10g speeds,\nthese high speed networks are very\n\n480\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.140\nsusceptible to electromagnetic\ninterference and\n\n481\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.590\nthey have no tolerance for it.\n\n482\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.300\nSo, you might have to implement\nsomething like shielded twisted pair.\n\n483\n00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.550\nWhat else?\n\n484\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.760\nA bad connectors, bad wiring, right?\n\n485\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.240\nWe have twisted pairs that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n486\n00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.270\nSplit pairs.\n\n487\n00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.970\nSplit pairs are interesting,\nbecause we have two pairs for\n\n488\n00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:28.950\ntransmit and, well, we got a pair for\ntransmit and an a pair for receive.\n\n489\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.350\nWhat if I take, let's say,\nthe wires that were supposed to be for\n\n490\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.590\npins 1 and 2, and I take 2, and\nI mix it with the receive lines.\n\n491\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.140\nWell, now we have a split pair.\n\n492\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.500\nThere should be two pairs, or\neight pair for transmit, eight pair for\n\n493\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.200\nreceive, but if I take those and\nI put one of those pairs together,\n\n494\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.810\nnow we have a split pair and it all\ncomes back to a wiring problem, right?\n\n495\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.119\nSo, that's the split pair.\n\n496\n00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:55.616\nAlmost said split pea.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n497\n00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:57.409\n&gt;&gt; Don't want split pea soup in your\n\n498\n00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.954\nin you wiring either [LAUGH].\n\n499\n00:22:58.954 --> 00:23:02.070\nThe other things, too, TX RX reverse.\n\n500\n00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.790\nThis kinda falls under a crossover\ncable I would imagine.\n\n501\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.890\nIf you expect that to be\na straight-through cable,\n\n502\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.860\nyou wire it differently, you wire\nthe different standard on the other side.\n\n503\n00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.090\nThat's what the crossover cable does,\nright?\n\n504\n00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.280\nIt basically crosses over transmit and\nreceive lines.\n\n505\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.350\nWhat else?\n\n506\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.980\nThey talk about attenuation and\ndecibel loss.\n\n507\n00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.140\nThis is gonna happen,\nthere's nothing you can do about it.\n\n508\n00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.310\nAnd it doesn't matter if it's\nfiber optic cabling either, so\n\n509\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.105\nthis Isn't really something that's\njust specific to copper cabling.\n\n510\n00:23:30.105 --> 00:23:33.085\nIt just means the progressive degradation\nof the signal as it gets farther and\n\n511\n00:23:33.085 --> 00:23:34.825\nfarther from its source.\n\n512\n00:23:34.825 --> 00:23:38.265\nIt happens a lot quicker on copper\nwires than it happens on fiber.\n\n513\n00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:40.162\nIt does happen on fiber too guys, so\n\n514\n00:23:40.162 --> 00:23:43.277\ndon't think that fiber cables\nare immune to this either.\n\n515\n00:23:43.277 --> 00:23:47.101\nThat's one of the reasons when they\nuse transatlantic cabling that\n\n516\n00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:48.980\nconnects continents together,\n\n517\n00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.153\nthey have a bundle of trunk fiber with\na series of repeaters in it, right?\n\n518\n00:23:53.153 --> 00:23:54.434\nThey have to the signal,\n\n519\n00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:57.428\nthey have a maximum distance\nthey can transmit, as well.\n\n520\n00:23:57.428 --> 00:24:01.149\nSo, signal attenuation is something\nthat you have to consider.\n\n521\n00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:05.405\nNow, I will tell you, on a fiber-optic\ncable signal attenuation is typically\n\n522\n00:24:05.405 --> 00:24:10.700\ngonna be found through something known\nas a optical time domain reflectometer.\n\n523\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.960\nThat is not something you're just\ngonna go down to the store and buy.\n\n524\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.483\nThese things can be 10s, 20s, $30,000,\nthese are very, very expensive devices,\n\n525\n00:24:17.483 --> 00:24:19.207\nbut that is something that you need.\n\n526\n00:24:19.207 --> 00:24:21.758\nIf you are saying, hey,\nwhere is it attenuating?\n\n527\n00:24:21.758 --> 00:24:23.225\nTen kilometers that way.\n\n528\n00:24:23.225 --> 00:24:24.314\nCould you show me where that is?\n\n529\n00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:27.391\nNo, no, I really can't,\nbut this device can.\n\n530\n00:24:27.391 --> 00:24:30.692\nThat's one of the reasons they\nare kinda very, very expensive.\n\n531\n00:24:30.692 --> 00:24:34.585\nLast one, couple of more there,\ncable placement, right?\n\n532\n00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:38.300\nDo not run your cables across\nthings like fluorescent lighting.\n\n533\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.010\nRight, parallel,\nnot crossed the fluorescent lighting.\n\n534\n00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.528\nI don't know, Dan, if you've ever seen,\n\n535\n00:24:43.528 --> 00:24:45.838\nI know you've been in buildings\nthat have drop ceilings, right?\n\n536\n00:24:45.838 --> 00:24:47.028\nYou look up at that drop ceiling and\n\n537\n00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:49.506\nyou see all of those fluorescent\nlights with their wires hanging down.\n\n538\n00:24:49.506 --> 00:24:53.047\nIt's like, man, I could almost toss that\nlike a football, that roll of cable,\n\n539\n00:24:53.047 --> 00:24:56.031\nright across there, and\nI wouldn't have to do much wiring on that.\n\n540\n00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:58.969\nBut the problem is that\nfluorescent lighting leads to\n\n541\n00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:01.262\nelectromagnetic interference as well.\n\n542\n00:25:01.262 --> 00:25:03.405\nThe other thing power conduits,\n\n543\n00:25:03.405 --> 00:25:08.770\ndon't just zip tie your cables to power\nconduits because they have nice long runs.\n\n544\n00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.464\nNow with that being said, I have\nalways thought its funny that we say,\n\n545\n00:25:11.464 --> 00:25:14.769\ndon't do that, and then we turn around and\nput ethernet over broadband powerlines.\n\n546\n00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:15.937\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a great idea at the time.\n\n547\n00:25:15.937 --> 00:25:23.410\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, the last one that they\ncalled out are bad modules essentially.\n\n548\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.773\nThe SFPs and the GBics, you're not really\ngoing to see to many more GBIGS anymore\n\n549\n00:25:27.773 --> 00:25:31.192\nbecause they are the older ways\nthat we use those connections.\n\n550\n00:25:31.192 --> 00:25:35.864\nBut, the fiber optic connections we see\nin the road, they burn up, they go bad,\n\n551\n00:25:35.864 --> 00:25:40.120\nthey got logic in them as well and\nthat can cause problems.\n\n552\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.720\nAll right, so we've kind of\ntalked about a lot of this, Dan.\n\n553\n00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.320\nI think we might wanna go ahead and\n\n554\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.960\nshow some of the things maybe\nthat we could potentially see.\n\n555\n00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.335\n&gt;&gt; Do a little demonstration of\nsome either good or junky cabling?\n\n556\n00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:52.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n557\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.890\nWell, we don't know because\nI did wire some of these.\n\n558\n00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.420\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna find out.\n\n559\n00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.720\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna find out and\nwe're gonna find out here on camera.\n\n560\n00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.800\nSo, Let me go ahead and\nfirst talk about real quick.\n\n561\n00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.550\nIf we did go to our sky cam here,\nI've a twisted pair.\n\n562\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.150\nRemember that a lot of times,\nwhen it comes down to it, the bad\n\n563\n00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:12.140\ncable it could be through damage or\nimproper termination, bad wiring, right?\n\n564\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.190\nAnd I am the leader when When\nit comes to wiring these wrong.\n\n565\n00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.840\nPut them on the tester and\nthen realize that I have to rewire them.\n\n566\n00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.670\nOkay, so, it does happen guys, but\nthere are some things that we can see.\n\n567\n00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.660\nFor instance,\nthis blue cable here, let's see,\n\n568\n00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.560\nthis was my signal\nmismatch here on this one.\n\n569\n00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.730\nLet me go ahead and get this plugged\nin and show you what you can see.\n\n570\n00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.460\nI've got just a normal cable tester here,\nall right.\n\n571\n00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.670\nAnd what we're gonna do here\nis we're gonna go ahead and\n\n572\n00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:44.090\nplug these in, as you can see right there,\nall right, and we're gonna turn this on.\n\n573\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.410\nNow one of the things that you're\ngonna notice is that I get\n\n574\n00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.330\nsome bad signal right here, right.\n\n575\n00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:53.180\nAnd how can I tell that\nthat's a bad signal?\n\n576\n00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.930\nYou can see that is\nthe reversal right there.\n\n577\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.360\nSo with this one what you\nhave here is a three and six.\n\n578\n00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.580\nThis is a mismatch, right?\n\n579\n00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.740\nYou can see that the mismatch,\n\n580\n00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.160\nit's telling me we've got an issue\nwith this cable here, right?\n\n581\n00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.670\nSo that's one telltale sign if you have an\nissue like that going on with your cable.\n\n582\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.230\nNow let me show you that now\nthat you can see what's bad.\n\n583\n00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.860\nLet me show you what you\nshould be expecting.\n\n584\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.840\nAnd thanks, Dan, as I've dumped\neverything on the ground here.\n\n585\n00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.330\nI believe I have another cable here.\n\n586\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.350\nAnd this will show you what we should\nbe seeing as opposed to what we\n\n587\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.920\nare going to be seeing.\n\n588\n00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.010\nAll right?\nSo I'm going to go ahead.\n\n589\n00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.470\nI'll plug one end of that Cable here,\nwe'll go ahead,\n\n590\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.550\nwe'll plug one into that cable here and\nwe're just kinda let it do its job.\n\n591\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.400\nNow notice what it's doing,\nit's sending down electrical current,\n\n592\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.660\nthis isn't a certifier guys by the way.\n\n593\n00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.450\nCertifiers test to make sure that this,\n\n594\n00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.170\nthe speed of this cable can transmit\nat what TES standards says.\n\n595\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.040\nWhat this doesn't, just sends\nelectrical current down the line and\n\n596\n00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.370\nit says Can I get electrical signal from\none end of the cable to the next and\n\n597\n00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.690\nyou can see, that we're all green here.\n\n598\n00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:05.150\nOne, two, three, six, four, five and\nseven, eight and really in this cable,\n\n599\n00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.120\nwhat I'm looking at are the one,\ntwo and three, six.\n\n600\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.390\nBecause if you remember, one,\ntwo is our transmit pins and three,\n\n601\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:16.850\nsix is going to be Our recipient lines.\n\n602\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.070\nOr our receive lines.\n\n603\n00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.220\nNow there's another thing\nthat they also call out and\n\n604\n00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.300\nthat is the actual reversing of those.\n\n605\n00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.180\nAll right.\n\n606\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.460\nSo let me go ahead and show you that.\n\n607\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.850\nThis is actually an RXTX reverse\nlike they were talking about.\n\n608\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.810\nLet's see if we can get this one here and\nwe plug this one in here and\n\n609\n00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.780\nI'll get this one at the back of\nthe camera for you guys to see.\n\n610\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.290\nNow all right.\n\n611\n00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.990\nNow let's see what this looks like.\n\n612\n00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.900\nAll right, there we go.\n\n613\n00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.050\nYou see right there on three and\n\n614\n00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:53.590\nsix how it's telling me yeah I've\ngot signal, I've got signal.\n\n615\n00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:54.600\nBut notice the red light?\n\n616\n00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.430\nRemember what the red light says?\n\n617\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.460\nIt's a reversal.\n\n618\n00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.270\nIf I get nothing then that\nmeans there's a short, right?\n\n619\n00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.640\nSo we could see that.\n\n620\n00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.610\nNow how can we tell a short?\n\n621\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.435\nWhat's the short all about?\n\n622\n00:29:06.435 --> 00:29:09.265\nWell the short is probably one of\nthe hardest to detect because it is\n\n623\n00:29:09.265 --> 00:29:12.735\nintermittent right,\nit could shorten when, it could short out\n\n624\n00:29:12.735 --> 00:29:16.135\nwhen somebody says alright lets move\nit a little bit and then it shorts out,\n\n625\n00:29:16.135 --> 00:29:21.680\nit falls back into place and its no longer\nshorting out Right, so for instance,\n\n626\n00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:29.880\nthis one could potentially have both\na short and near end crosstalk.\n\n627\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.840\nAnd the reason I say that is I don't know\nif you can see that, but can you see that,\n\n628\n00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.190\nyeah you can see that right?\n\n629\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.770\nThat end is damaged there.\n\n630\n00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.660\nAnd it's been flattened like somebody\nran over it with a car, all right.\n\n631\n00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.460\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's put this back there.\n\n632\n00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.320\nNow, at first, let me get this cable\nout of the way there so you can see it.\n\n633\n00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.100\nWe look good, but\nDan do you see something that's missing?\n\n634\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.740\nJust pay attention to\nthe sequence of lights.\n\n635\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it looks like it's\nskipping that four and five.\n\n636\n00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.950\n&gt;&gt; Yes sir, you got it, and remember,\naccording to this cable tester,\n\n637\n00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.770\nit tells me if I've got nothing\n&gt;&gt; Then I've got a short.\n\n638\n00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:16.810\nNow shorts can also manifest\nthemselves let me see if I can put\n\n639\n00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.460\na little metal on this and make it short.\n\n640\n00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.730\nIt probably won't do it.\n\n641\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:27.520\nThere is an exposed wire here and\nsometimes if you can test it here.\n\n642\n00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.065\n&gt;&gt; Let's pull up into the short.\n\n643\n00:30:30.065 --> 00:30:31.376\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n644\n00:30:31.376 --> 00:30:35.170\nAnd I could do it earlier, but\nit's not gonna shorten out on me.\n\n645\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.660\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that.\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna short on me this time,\n\n646\n00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.290\nbut you can sometimes,\nI can see the signal.\n\n647\n00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.280\nIt almost stopped on.\n\n648\n00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.740\nYep, there we go.\n\n649\n00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.950\nNow I'm shorting two pairs.\n\n650\n00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.810\nYou see that,\nhow it's just got first and second?\n\n651\n00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.610\nAnd the last two aren't even lit at all.\n\n652\n00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.280\nAnd then if I move it back, there,\nwe just got a little bit of a short.\n\n653\n00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.700\nDid you see that?\n\n654\n00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.270\nYou can kind of see it, and again, what's\nhappening is that this cable has been\n\n655\n00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.550\ndamaged towards the end and what we have\nis that electrical signal is going down\n\n656\n00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:08.840\nthe end of it and essentially,\nwe dont have any communication going on.\n\n657\n00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.360\nAll right, so\nthat's what end up happening.\n\n658\n00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.320\nNotice that That the detector\nis what's telling me that.\n\n659\n00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.710\nWho is the detector before\nI put it on this cable?\n\n660\n00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.250\nThe cable tester?\n\n661\n00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.360\nTypically your end users.\n\n662\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.690\nThe network starts running slow.\n\n663\n00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:30.030\nYou start getting some maybe\njust isolated incidents.\n\n664\n00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.670\nIf it's an isolated incident.\n\n665\n00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.610\nIt might be something that's actually\nhappening on just one person's computer.\n\n666\n00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.200\nMaybe the drop cable going\nfrom there to the wall.\n\n667\n00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.540\nHowever, if this happens and\na good portion of your network goes down\n\n668\n00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.530\nI would maybe think,\nmaybe the length between the switch, or\n\n669\n00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.460\nwherever else it's going,\nmight be causing the problem.\n\n670\n00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.860\nBut you don't know until\nyou put the testers on it.\n\n671\n00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.790\nKeep in mind that some of the things\nthat can happen on your copper media so\n\n672\n00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.260\nthat when these problems\narise you can fix them.\n\n673\n00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.810\nYou got to be sure that\nthose organic field testers,\n\n674\n00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.810\ncable testers are the best\none's on the market.\n\n675\n00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.230\nBecause they give you the most feed back.\n\n676\n00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:06.720\nWe also call those users.\n\n677\n00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.270\nThat's what Wes was alitting to.\n\n678\n00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.230\nThat being said we've gone through quite\na few different ways which we might\n\n679\n00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.030\nexperience issues or trouble.\n\n680\n00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.160\nWith our copper cabling and\na few different ways to detect those,\n\n681\n00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.640\nfigure out what's going on so that we can\ntroubleshoot and remediate that problem.\n\n682\n00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.360\nWes, you did a great job, we appreciate\nthe demonstration, we appreciate\n\n683\n00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.540\nthe explanations but looking at the clock,\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n684\n00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.070\nWe do thank you guys for joining us\ntoday but signing off for ITProTV,\n\n685\n00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.160\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n686\n00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:34.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:08.211\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:11.823\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:14.096\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:16.210\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.109\nIn this episode, we're gonna be looking\nat something that happens a lot, and\n\n8\n00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.307\nwe're gonna be looking at network issues.\n\n9\n00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:26.050\nWith us today we have Mr Wes Bryan in\nstudios to help us out with this topic.\n\n10\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.360\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.371\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me here, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.233\nThat's right.\nWe're going to be looking at,\n\n13\n00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.241\nlike Cherokee said, network issues,\nand more specifically,\n\n14\n00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.801\nwe're going to be looking at\nsome of the things that can\n\n15\n00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.180\naffect your fiber optic cabling and\nyour fiber optic communications.\n\n16\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.310\nNow in past episodes we've done a pretty\ngood job at covering the different\n\n17\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.740\nfiber optic standards.\n\n18\n00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.440\nWe've talked about things like our\nthousand base, our base systems and\n\n19\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.490\nstuff so\nthat you're aware of the standards, right?\n\n20\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.076\nAnd it is important to be aware of those\nstandards because when you have to make\n\n21\n00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.442\na choice as to what you're gonna\nimplement, you need to know well what is\n\n22\n00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:03.031\nthe technology that you're implementing\nand you have to make sure that it's\n\n23\n00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:06.101\ncompatible with the devices that\nyou have within your networks.\n\n24\n00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:08.330\nIf you're not familiar\nwith those standards,\n\n25\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.231\nyou're not familiar with the capabilities\nof the media that you're using then you\n\n26\n00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.911\ncould make some wrong decisions and\nunfortunately that can cause a whole bunch\n\n27\n00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:18.620\nof issues when it comes to communications,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.570\nLet's think about it, right?\n\n29\n00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.070\nFiber optic communications is a very,\nvery expensive implementation.\n\n30\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.400\nBut why do we implement fiber?\n\n31\n00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.060\nRight?\nWe implement fiber because,\n\n32\n00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.940\nwell there is couple of things.\n\n33\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.420\nAnd so three things that\nreally come to mind right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.530\nFirst of all it's just sheer speed right?\n\n35\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.800\nThe fact that it is really the fastest\nbounded network communication that we have\n\n36\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.310\non the planet.\n\n37\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.890\nSo fast that the devices can't even\nflash the light pulses fast enough to\n\n38\n00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.100\nreally saturate a fiber optic cable.\n\n39\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.960\nThe other thing that we also you now\nconsider is the distances that you can\n\n40\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.710\nget out of a fiber optic cable, right?\n\n41\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.210\nWe're not talking about the traditional\ncat cables that we use in ethernet\n\n42\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.850\ncommunications that have\nremedies to limitation\n\n43\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.920\nmaximum limitation of a hundred meters\nwithout putting in repeaters, right?\n\n44\n00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.650\nAnd if you're talking about things like 10\ng based networks then you're talking about\n\n45\n00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.570\nwell CAT 5 E cable like 10 meters at\nbest you might get the 10 g speeds.\n\n46\n00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.650\nIf you talk about a CAT 6 cable\nyou're talking 55 meters.\n\n47\n00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.150\nAnd then you gotta really\nimplement something\n\n48\n00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.070\nlike CAT 6 A to really get the hundred\nmeter length if you're talking to 10 g.\n\n49\n00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.490\nHowever if we implement something like\na single mode fiber implementation,\n\n50\n00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.340\nwe can get signals all the way\nout to 40,000 meters, right?\n\n51\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.170\n40 kilometers.\n\n52\n00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.720\nSo those are a couple of the main things,\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.310\nThe bandwidth,\n\n54\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.960\nthe fact that we should get the sheer\nspeed and the transmission distance.\n\n55\n00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.600\nThe other thing that is\nreally good about fiber is\n\n56\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.629\nwe don't really worry too much about\nelectromagnetic interference, right?\n\n57\n00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.640\nThat's one of the things that is really\ngood, so I'm giving you an example, right?\n\n58\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.950\nIf you're running a bounded media and\n\n59\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.210\nit has to go,\nmaybe across to an open area outside.\n\n60\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.460\nWe don't want to run copper media,\nif you're in a school, right?\n\n61\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.110\nMaybe you've got kids and\nyou take them to school.\n\n62\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.600\nAnd you know where you drop them off\nin the morning, that's a big open area\n\n63\n00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.430\nWell maybe they need bounded\nmedia to span that awning, right?\n\n64\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.780\nWell if we think about it,\nif we put copper media out there,\n\n65\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.430\nthat's basically nothing more\nthan a massive lightning rod so\n\n66\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.230\nwe would put fiber optic\ncommunications in there.\n\n67\n00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.370\nAnd not only don't we have to\nworry about the lightning rod but\n\n68\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.660\nwe don't have to worry about\nthe electromagnetic interference.\n\n69\n00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.500\nAnd that's one of the reasons it is\nimportant to understand those standards.\n\n70\n00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.340\nNow some of the first things that\nthey call out when they call out\n\n71\n00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.400\ntroubleshooting common fiber is they talk\nabout attenuation and decibel loss, right?\n\n72\n00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.370\nThink about signal strength.\n\n73\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.820\nIt is something that we have\nto worry about, you know?\n\n74\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.120\nEven if we're using something\nlike single mode fiber,\n\n75\n00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.000\nI think it's the 10G base That got\nthat just crazy long length of\n\n76\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.580\nabout 40km well can you tell where\nthe signals of attenuating at 40km and\n\n77\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.050\nit's kinda hard you usually have to spend\na lot of money on things like optical\n\n78\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.270\ntime to mainly reflectometers\nbecause of the great distances.\n\n79\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.690\nWell how about another thing.\n\n80\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.850\nIs it a break in the cable?\n\n81\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.324\nIs it a bend in the cable\nwhich we'll also talk about.\n\n82\n00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.480\nBut anyways, just keep in mind, is just\nthe progressive degradation of the signal\n\n83\n00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.160\nas it gets further and\nfurther from its source.\n\n84\n00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.420\nYou might have to implement things\nlike repeaters even though we have\n\n85\n00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.110\nthese long distances that we get\nin fiber optic communications.\n\n86\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.810\nWe use fiber optics for\nour trans-atlantic cabling, right?\n\n87\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.210\nConnecting continents together.\n\n88\n00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.840\nNow understand, they're big mass of\nbundles of fiber optic connectors and\n\n89\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.680\nthey have a series of repeaters.\n\n90\n00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.960\nSo if you do get signal attenuation,\nis it the fact that you're trying,\n\n91\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.640\nyou're not paying attention to standards\nthat we've talked about in past episodes?\n\n92\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.000\nWell, maybe, it could be, right?\n\n93\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.940\nIt could be the fact that we tried to\nimplement multi-mode fiber when we really\n\n94\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.760\nshould have been implementing\nsingle mode fiber.\n\n95\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.290\nSo please keep that in mind\nthat with attenuation,\n\n96\n00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.370\nit's hard to tell,\nknowing what it is is a good start.\n\n97\n00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.310\nBut it's hard to tell in fiber,\nwhy is the signal loss happening?\n\n98\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.490\nWhy is that signal degrading?\n\n99\n00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.940\nIt could be just the characteristics and\n\n100\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.100\nthe properties of the cables themselves,\nright.\n\n101\n00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.360\nWe talk about the glass cores that\nare inside of these fiber optic cables.\n\n102\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.050\nWell, they have imperfections in them.\n\n103\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.600\nWe've got to account for\nthose imperfections.\n\n104\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Wes, if you think about\neven just the size, the microns,\n\n105\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.650\nof these particular types of cables,\na single\n\n106\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.430\nspeck of dust could really interfere with\nthat attenuation, that quality of signal.\n\n107\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.380\nJust something to think about.\n\n108\n00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.650\nDifferent manufacturers they have a little\nbit of wiggle room when it comes to\n\n109\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.810\nproducing fiber optic cable and whether\nyou're using the glass or different types,\n\n110\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.460\nthey have different plastics available.\n\n111\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.130\nSome are better quality than others.\n\n112\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you gotta pay attention to it.\n\n113\n00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.880\nAnd there's all different kinds of\nformulas and one of the things that I\n\n114\n00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.160\ndon't believe CompTIA is gonna get in\nis like the engineering qualities.\n\n115\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.110\nYou don't have to know like algebra to be\nable to figure out these cuz they have\n\n116\n00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.330\nsome pretty big mathematical equations\nto figure this out which I have no clue.\n\n117\n00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.160\nI don't even understand it.\n\n118\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.590\nOnce you start putting letters in math,\nI'm out.\n\n119\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.770\nBut just know that attenuation can happen,\n\n120\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.720\nit can happen because of the fact\nthat maybe you are using a cable\n\n121\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.700\nthat you're trying to run past\nwhatever the specification is.\n\n122\n00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.880\nDo make sure of that.\n\n123\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.160\nYeah, one of the other things you need to\nknow about are what are known as the SFPs,\n\n124\n00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.300\nand they do all these out.\n\n125\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.630\nThey also call them out with the gib X2\ntoo,and like in an earlier episodes that\n\n126\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.100\nwe've shot already, we told you that the\ngigabit interface cards, they're pretty\n\n127\n00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.490\nmuch gone by the way side today, because\nwe need a greater port density, and\n\n128\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.620\nwe typically use the small SFP plus\npluggable modules if you will.\n\n129\n00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.270\nAnd a couple of different things they\ncall out, they call out a cable mismatch.\n\n130\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.920\nRemember you have to have the right cable,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.620\nIf you do in single mode, we need\nto be using a single mode SFP Plus.\n\n132\n00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.220\nIf we're using multi-mode, then well we\nneed to be using a multi-mode SFP Plus.\n\n133\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.530\nAnd It can happen, remember that\nthe cables have the same diameter, so\n\n134\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.150\nyou really need to pay attention\nto the specifications too.\n\n135\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.220\nThey also talk about the adapters\nthemselves going bad, and that can happen,\n\n136\n00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.540\njust like any other network adapter,\nyou know, we're talking about high speed\n\n137\n00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.670\ncommunications these things can go bad,\nand that can certainly cause a problem.\n\n138\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.580\nNow if you're gonna resolve\nan issue like that, right.\n\n139\n00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.820\nif it's a cable mismatch,\npay attention to the standard, right?\n\n140\n00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.300\nUsually on the side of the little SFPs,\nthey'll tell you what it is.\n\n141\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.316\nIs it 1,000 based something, SR, right?\n\n142\n00:07:06.316 --> 00:07:10.050\nShort-range multi-mode, right,\nversus maybe an LR, a long range.\n\n143\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.780\nSo again, pay attention to the standard,\nand pay attention to the cable so\n\n144\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.830\nthat they do match.\n\n145\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.000\nIf it happens to be bad,\nwell then what you do is\n\n146\n00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.830\nyou'll typically take one that is good,\nknown good one right.\n\n147\n00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.050\nAnd you'll plug it into the switch,\nand on that same port.\n\n148\n00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.310\nAnd if you get activity out of it then you\ntypically know that it is something wrong\n\n149\n00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.590\nwith that SFP That you're trying to test,\n\n150\n00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.780\nhowever if you put it in that port and it\ndoesn't work, then there might be a port\n\n151\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.660\non the plain within that switch that's\ncausing the problem and it might be bad.\n\n152\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.950\nBecause these components again,\nthey can go bad.\n\n153\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.750\nSo again I do mentioned the jpegs here,\njust for\n\n154\n00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.510\na second completion of\nthe exam objectives,\n\n155\n00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.820\nhowever I don't really think they're gonna\nsee to much of those again, because there,\n\n156\n00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.760\nI won't said they're completely obsolete\ntoday, but today we really are using,\n\n157\n00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:02.720\neven a second rendition of SFP, which\nis SFP+ and that certainly can happen.\n\n158\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.490\nSome of the other things that they call\nout, they call out things like, for\n\n159\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.100\ninstance, wavelength mismatches.\n\n160\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.010\nAnd this is kinda why we talk\nabout the standards, right?\n\n161\n00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.970\nThere's a reason we call out standards.\n\n162\n00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.390\nWe call out the standards so that you're\naware of when you are making a decision\n\n163\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:23.060\nas to what technology needs to be used you\nknow what wavelength goes along with it.\n\n164\n00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.240\nLike in earlier episodes,\n\n165\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.640\nwe talked about the difference between\nsome of the multimode fiber wavelength.\n\n166\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.950\nAnd we also talked about some of\nthe single mode fiber wavelength.\n\n167\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.480\nSo if we can take a look at my\nscreen here, just as a quick recap,\n\n168\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.609\nyou'll see that I've got a few\ndifferent wavelength types here.\n\n169\n00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.350\nNotice that multi mode is using either\n850 on up to 1300 nanometer wavelengths.\n\n170\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.790\nEven if you have multimode\nfiber to multimode fiber,\n\n171\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.390\nif the wavelength mismatch happens\n\n172\n00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.080\nIt's probably because you're not\npaying attention to the standard.\n\n173\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.080\nYou're not paying attention to what\nstandard you need on the switch versus\n\n174\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.910\nwhat cable that you're attaching\nto the SFP and that can happen.\n\n175\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.070\nWe talk about you've got a few\ndifferent wavelengths all\n\n176\n00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.460\nthe way up to almost 1625 nm.\n\n177\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.300\nSo you also have to pay attention even if\nwe're not taking about things like media\n\n178\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.305\nconverters right sometimes you have to\nhave media converters there too and\n\n179\n00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:19.120\nbecause single modifiers\nare different type of light source\n\n180\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.075\nversus multi mode fiber, different type of\nlight source, make sure that you have, for\n\n181\n00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:27.455\ninstance, the appropriate media\nconverters if you are using them.\n\n182\n00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:31.285\nAnd really, what it boils down to\nis knowing the specifications.\n\n183\n00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:34.390\nMake sure that you pay attention\nto specifications on the switch,\n\n184\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.830\nyou know what the demands\nof the network are.\n\n185\n00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.260\nYou know what the cable lengths\nare that you're gonna need, right?\n\n186\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.180\nIf you need long distances, multi-mode\nfiber might not be the choice for you.\n\n187\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.860\nIt might be the more expensive\nsingle-mode fiber as well.\n\n188\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Paying attention to the small details\nis really gonna keep you safe here,\n\n189\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.800\nespecially when you're looking at\nthings like impedance mismatches.\n\n190\n00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.790\nAnd you just wanna have that continuity or\nthat uniform whenever you're designing\n\n191\n00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.340\nyour portion of your network\nthat is gonna be using fiber.\n\n192\n00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.283\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and\n\n193\n00:09:59.283 --> 00:10:02.340\nin fact some of the other things\nthat we can get us in a trouble too.\n\n194\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.530\nI mean the kind that go out\nof order here from our list.\n\n195\n00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.000\nI'm gonna kinda jump around here.\n\n196\n00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.140\nThe other thing that we have to\nworry about are things like bends.\n\n197\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:14.320\nBends in your cable, you have what is\nknow as a radius bend limitation and\n\n198\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.120\nthey have all different ways that\nyou can calculate that again.\n\n199\n00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.660\nI don't think they're gonna make you\ncalculate anything like that just\n\n200\n00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.750\nunderstand that when you do have,\n\n201\n00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.450\nyou typically have two types of\nbends that can get you in trouble.\n\n202\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.800\nYou have what's known as a microbend and\nyou have what's known as a macrobend.\n\n203\n00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.030\nKinda like the name implies, a microbend\nis just a short bend that causes light\n\n204\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.700\nloss, signal loss if you will and\n\n205\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:39.200\nthen a macrobend is a larger bend\nthat could cause total light loss.\n\n206\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.660\nSo yeah, for instance,\nwhen we're talking about multimode fiber,\n\n207\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.570\nwe're talking about total\ninternal refraction.\n\n208\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.270\nAnd it refracts off of the inside of\nthe cable for signal propagation.\n\n209\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.270\nWell, if that bend, like in this\nsituation right here, that bend,\n\n210\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.380\neven a microbend can cause the signal loss\nwhere the propagation of that signal with\n\n211\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.890\nthe internal refraction.\n\n212\n00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.370\nIt doesn't actually refract and\nwe lose one of those signals.\n\n213\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.530\nWhen you talk about something\nlike a macro bend, right,\n\n214\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.000\nthis could be total signal loss.\n\n215\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.310\nBecause of the fact that the bend is so\n\n216\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.050\ngreat that not only do you\nlost just one of the signals,\n\n217\n00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.920\none of the multiple signal sources\nin there, you could be losing more.\n\n218\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.330\nAnd it's not just multimoding too.\n\n219\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.750\nCuz remember we have things like\ndense wavelength multiplexing\n\n220\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.210\nWhere you're taking a cable, and you're\nputting more than one light signal on it.\n\n221\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.530\nWe also have things like\ncoarse wave dense length.\n\n222\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.425\nCoarse wave dense length.\n\n223\n00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:30.910\nI can't even say it.\n\n224\n00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.030\nCoarse wavelength multiplexing.\n\n225\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.650\nAgain, these are two different types of\nmultiplexing that you also have to be\n\n226\n00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.750\nfamiliar with when you're talking\nabout the fiber optic communications.\n\n227\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.230\nAnd again, like Wes said they're probably\nnot gonna call you out on that because it\n\n228\n00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.010\nis gonna be different from\ndifferent manufacturers.\n\n229\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.310\nBut they should provide\nsome sort of documentation.\n\n230\n00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:54.060\nSo if you have, even some of them have\nlike a temporary bend radius versus\n\n231\n00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.850\nlong term, so when you're installing it\nversus where you're gonna place it and\n\n232\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.550\nwhere it's gonna be living for\nthe next However many years?\n\n233\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, in fact I went ahead and\n\n234\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.530\nbrought up a little cable organizer\nbecause Cherokee's right.\n\n235\n00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.660\nYou pay attention to\nthe specifications and you can see,\n\n236\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.590\none of these and in fact,\nlet me kind of back up here.\n\n237\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.780\nI kinda jumped the gun here,\nlet me go back to Google.\n\n238\n00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.070\nI wanna show you guys something,\nthey do have things like your bend,\n\n239\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.870\nactually let me do this.\n\n240\n00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.850\nFiber, yeah, bend radius protection here.\n\n241\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.210\nAnd if we go to like an image search here.\n\n242\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.440\nYou can see here, for\ninstance this is cableorganizer.com.\n\n243\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.120\nNotice this little bend that they have,\nand\n\n244\n00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.720\nyou'll see these in your server closets.\n\n245\n00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.150\nOn the corner of your server closets\nwhen you're bringing fiber in or\n\n246\n00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.090\nout of your networks.\n\n247\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.470\nAgain because you wanna make sure that\nthat fiber optic bend isn't according to\n\n248\n00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.160\nthe ratios that you configured, typically\naround no more than a 90 degree type bend,\n\n249\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.100\nand a lot of times, even less.\n\n250\n00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.350\nAnd like I said, if you actually go\nup to where, let's go shopping here.\n\n251\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.511\nIf we go up to the www.cableorganizer.com,\nyou can see that it tells you that\n\n252\n00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:57.480\nit creates a 90 degree bend to route\nthe traffic and protect the fiber, so\n\n253\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.324\nyou want to make sure that you're\ndoing the bend radius protection, and\n\n254\n00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:05.482\nthat's one of the ways you can do it, one\nof these fast drops where you can put it\n\n255\n00:13:05.482 --> 00:13:09.741\nin your server closet and make sure that\nbend isn't greater than what you need.\n\n256\n00:13:09.741 --> 00:13:11.049\n&gt;&gt; It takes the guesswork out.\n\n257\n00:13:11.049 --> 00:13:16.047\n&gt;&gt; It does, and then ultimately its\ngoal is to stop things that we see like\n\n258\n00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:20.890\nthis that can cause your light loss\ninside of the fiber optic cable.\n\n259\n00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.510\nNow another thing that\nwe have to talk about.\n\n260\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.320\nAnd Cherokee's already\nkind of mentioned this.\n\n261\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.800\nWe talk about the fact that when we\nlook at the class cores inside of\n\n262\n00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.940\nthe fiber optic cable and we talk\nabout the termination, you remember,\n\n263\n00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.660\nthis is not like an Ethernet cable, right?\n\n264\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.170\nI can terminate an Ethernet cable,\nwell sometimes I can, sometimes I can't,\n\n265\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.570\ndepends on what standard I'm following.\n\n266\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.590\nBut for the most part,\nit's relatively easy to terminate,\n\n267\n00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.390\nyou know, an Ethernet cable or even\na coaxial cable if you're doing audio and\n\n268\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.190\nvideo, we don't really see it too much in\nour networking, but we definitely see it\n\n269\n00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.800\nin AV Technologies today, and for\nthe most parts they're fairly easy.\n\n270\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.671\nWhen it comes to terminating these fiber\noptic cables, you usually need an optical\n\n271\n00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:01.680\nfusion splicer and they do have\nfilled optical fusion splicer.\n\n272\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.420\nThey get very, very expensive and\n\n273\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.960\na lot of times sometimes they\nare automated too to where\n\n274\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.520\nyou put two ends of fibre together and you\nclose the lid on the thing and the button.\n\n275\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.800\nPush a button, right, and the machine\nitself kind of arranges the fiber,\n\n276\n00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.420\ncuts it, and then bonds it and\nattaches the connector to it.\n\n277\n00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.590\nIf this happens to be dirty,\n\n278\n00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.950\nagain remember we're gonna lose\nthe optical signal, right?\n\n279\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.900\nThat's one of the reasons they have these\nthings, like these polishing kits, and\n\n280\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.860\nit usually takes a very\nhighly trained technician\n\n281\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.790\nthat's trained specifically in fiber\noptics and fiber optics terminations to\n\n282\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:39.870\nmake sure that we don't have things like\ndirty connectors or improper termination.\n\n283\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.390\nSome of the the other things\nthat they call out to,\n\n284\n00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.600\nwe've kinda almost talked about this,\nthe fiber type mismatch, okay?\n\n285\n00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.280\nKeep in mind that's one of the reasons we\nuse things like your media converters.\n\n286\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.020\nSingle mode is a different light source,\n\n287\n00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.250\ndifferent transmission\nsource than multimode fiber.\n\n288\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:15:00.420\nRemember multimode fiber uses multiple\noptical light pulses Single mode fiber\n\n289\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.290\nkinda kind a light and shut down that\ncenter of that core uses a single light.\n\n290\n00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.035\nSo [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n291\n00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:10.468\nAnd if you talk about the difference\nbetween even like ethernet versus\n\n292\n00:15:10.468 --> 00:15:11.290\nsonet, right?\n\n293\n00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.860\nSonet is a land based technology typically\nis gonna be on the demarcation side that's\n\n294\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.090\nthe ISP, the providers side,\nversus your side of the demarcation,\n\n295\n00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.780\nthe customer's demarcation\npoint is usually Ethernet,\n\n296\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.150\nthen you even need things like Ethernet,\ncopper to fibre, media converters as well,\n\n297\n00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.570\nsome of the other things too\nare core mismatches right?\n\n298\n00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.070\nThey talk about fibre type mismatches,\ncable mismatches if you will\n\n299\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.970\nEven multi-mode,\nwell I'll give you an example here, right?\n\n300\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.850\nSingle mode to multi-mode, right?\n\n301\n00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.630\nThe cores are different, not to mention,\nnot to mention the fact that the whole\n\n302\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.060\ntransmission is different,\nthe cores are different.\n\n303\n00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.320\nBut you can also have that problem too,\n\n304\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.910\neven when you talk about multi-mode to\nmulti-mode fiber optic mismatches, right?\n\n305\n00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.880\nCuz if I have a cable that needs to be\nthe 62.5 microns and I attach it to\n\n306\n00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.150\none that really is rated for the 52 or 50\nmicrons, that's a cable mismatch, right?\n\n307\n00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:05.000\nAgain, the cords are different even in\nmultimode because of the fact that they\n\n308\n00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.280\nhave two different types, right?\n\n309\n00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.710\n50 or 62.5, so you'll also have to make\nsure that those standards match as well.\n\n310\n00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.910\nAnd it is very important if you're gonna\nget the communications that you want.\n\n311\n00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.680\nAll right, so some of the other\nthings that they call out,\n\n312\n00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.620\ntoo, I don't know if I\nput this one in here.\n\n313\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.570\nThey call out things like\ndistance limitations, and\n\n314\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.870\nwe've kind of already talked about\nthe distance limitations, right?\n\n315\n00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.970\nFor instance, if you need shorter range,\nyou can get away with multi-mode fiber.\n\n316\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.100\nIt's cheaper doesn't give you\nthe distances of single mode fiber,\n\n317\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.410\ncertainly doesn't, it could limit\nyour transmission speed, and\n\n318\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.450\nattenuation could be a little bit greater\nif you try to run multi-mode fiber past\n\n319\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:49.140\nwhatever the cable limitation is, so if\nyou need to do things like metro-ethernet.\n\n320\n00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.370\nThen what I would do is I would,\n\n321\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.780\nyou know you should be implementing\nsomething like single mode fiber.\n\n322\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.060\nIf you're talking about a backbone\nconnector inside of like a building,\n\n323\n00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.260\nthen you're gonna be wanting to use\nsomething like multi mode fiber.\n\n324\n00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.900\nI'd say the last thing that they talk\nabout here are connector mismatches, and\n\n325\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:09.880\nagain if you have something like for\ninstance, maybe you have an older switch.\n\n326\n00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.490\nAnd it's using SC connectors, and\nyou try to connect an LC connector to it,\n\n327\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.170\nthe Lucy connector or local connector.\n\n328\n00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.880\nWell they're gonna be completely\ndifferent, and it is gonna mismatch and\n\n329\n00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.590\nit's not gonna be the same thing.\n\n330\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:22.040\nSo you also have to pay attention\nto those specifications as well.\n\n331\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.320\n&gt;&gt; And we were joking a little bit\nbefore the show Wes during our break,\n\n332\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.300\ntrying to just get it to fit in\nthere with a hammer you said.\n\n333\n00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.380\nBut There's so many different\ntypes of connectors out there.\n\n334\n00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.520\nJust kind of do a little homework,\nI guess, and be familiar with your\n\n335\n00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.320\nenvironment and the different types\nof connectors that are out there.\n\n336\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd that's what it boils down to.\n\n337\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.890\nIt's really just knowing the standards,\nknowing the technologies,\n\n338\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.810\nknow the limitations of the technologies,\nknow what you need to provide, and\n\n339\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.170\nthen just make sure that you\nmatch up those specifications so\n\n340\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.030\nthat you don't have to resolve these fiber\noptic issues when it comes down to it.\n\n341\n00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.890\nAnd also keep in mind breaks in the cable.\n\n342\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:57.750\nI don't really seem them talking about\nthat, but this isn't just a simple\n\n343\n00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.230\nsplice a cable and\nput a little electrical tape around it.\n\n344\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.120\nAgain, remember, you're gonna have to\nuse some kind of field fusion splicer.\n\n345\n00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.050\nAnd these things aren't cheap,\n\n346\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.860\nand they certainly aren't\ngonna be done by just anybody.\n\n347\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.890\nIt's typically gonna be some kind\nof a highly trained technician.\n\n348\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.680\nSo remember, know your specifications so\n\n349\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.690\nthat you don't have to\nworry about these issues.\n\n350\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.800\nYeah and any time we're\ndealing with any kind of like.\n\n351\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.460\nWe also were talking about during\nthe break, like our transmit and\n\n352\n00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.390\nour receive mismatches as well.\n\n353\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.270\nSo just make sure you are paying\nattention to how you're plugging that in.\n\n354\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:30.020\nEspecially if you're using\nany kind of adapter or\n\n355\n00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.930\nrepeater device when you're switching for\ndifferent types of media.\n\n356\n00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.690\nThen you wanna think about that too.\n\n357\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good point and\nthat's one that I didn't mention.\n\n358\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.460\nLike for instance,\n\n359\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.920\nwhat we were talking about is like\nthe duplexing Seen connectors, right,\n\n360\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.180\nwhen you have LC to LC connectors,\nyou have one fiber for send,\n\n361\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.690\none fiber to receive, right?\n\n362\n00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.580\nWell if I've got send and\nreceive on one side and\n\n363\n00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:51.740\nI make my fiber optic crossover cable and\nI put that, I, you know, reverse,\n\n364\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.320\ndo a TX/RX reversal,\nwe're not going to get any communications.\n\n365\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.380\n&gt;&gt; It's not working.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n366\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.220\ndefinitely pay attention to those so\nyou are prepared on the exam.\n\n367\n00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.400\nAll right, well I think that's about it\nfor our particular types of fiber issues.\n\n368\n00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.190\nBut there are other issues that we\nneed to resolve, so stay tuned.\n\n369\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.760\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n370\n00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.830\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign of for this show.\n\n371\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.630\nRemember, I'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n372\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n373\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.076\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n374\n00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:22.031\n[MUSIC]\n\n375\n00:19:22.031 -->

00:00:08.266\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.250\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.300\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.620\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.100\nIn this episode, we'll be discussing\nseveral different types of\n\n8\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.339\ncommon networking issues and\nboy are there plenty.\n\n9\n00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.140\nSo with us today, we have Mr.\nWes Bryan in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.353\nThank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:30.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sitting here thinking\nabout that and you are right,\n\n12\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.810\na lot of network issues that can come up.\n\n13\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.118\nAnd, really,\na lot that they call out on the exams.\n\n14\n00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.640\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nlook at some of the issue that you\n\n15\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.290\ncould face inside of your networking.\n\n16\n00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.610\nSome of them we're gonna talk about, but\n\n17\n00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.910\nsome we're gonna take\ntime to kinda describe.\n\n18\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.100\nAnd show you what you\ncould potentially see.\n\n19\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.060\nSo, that if you're given a scenario on\nthe exam, you'll be able to confront it.\n\n20\n00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.510\nRemember, there are many\ndifferent utilities you can use.\n\n21\n00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.800\nAnd it's important to pick the right\nutility when you are diagnosing and\n\n22\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.080\ntroubleshooting different issues.\n\n23\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.530\nSo that's one of the things that we're\ngonna be looking at here in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.610\nThey call out a bunch of them,\nso we're gonna go ahead and\n\n25\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.380\nwe're just gonna kinda\ngo through the list.\n\n26\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.010\nAnd as we do, we'll dive in to showing\nyou a little bit about what you can see\n\n27\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.250\nin these different issues here.\n\n28\n00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.140\nOne of the first one's they call out\nis really a common one that can happen.\n\n29\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.370\nAnd, a lot of times, this happens when\nwe're doing static configuration.\n\n30\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.740\nThey call out things like improper, or\n\n31\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.110\nincorrect IP configuration and\nbad default gateway.\n\n32\n00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.251\nNow, either way you look at this, this is\na misconfiguration of the IP properties.\n\n33\n00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:36.410\nThe TCIP Properties of the network\nadaptor in the machine that you're using.\n\n34\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.060\nNow it could be intentional,\nit could be unintentional.\n\n35\n00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.290\nLet me give you a scenario right, so\nmaybe you've got a laptop that you use.\n\n36\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.920\nAnd your laptop is configured for\n\n37\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.310\nwhatever reason with a static\naddress when you connect to work.\n\n38\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.070\nNot likely because work stations and\nlaptops, we like to use things like DHCP.\n\n39\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.200\nBut, if you do happen to\nhave a static configuration,\n\n40\n00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.045\nI know I've made this mistake myself.\n\n41\n00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:00.370\nAnd I wanna know what my IP address is,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.850\nI know what the scope in in DHCP, and\nmaybe I don't wanna be in that scope.\n\n43\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.980\nSo I manually set or\nstatically assign an IP address and\n\n44\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.020\nall the properties on the network adapter.\n\n45\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.938\nBut then I take my computer home, right?\n\n46\n00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:18.080\nAnd on a home network I don't really care,\nso\n\n47\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.450\nI connect to my wireless network,\nand it's giving out DHCP.\n\n48\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.950\nWell here's a problem right,\nmy static network adaptor or\n\n49\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.150\nconfigurations are configured\nto the IP scheme inside of work.\n\n50\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.770\nSo, for instance, 10., the 10.0.0.0\ntype network where at home my DHCP\n\n51\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.110\nserver that's built into my little home\nrouter is giving out a 192.168 address.\n\n52\n00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.640\nAnd it's doing it through DHCP, so the\nmoment I connect to the wireless network.\n\n53\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.320\nI no longer have communications, right?\n\n54\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.980\nSo that's one of the situations or\nscenarios that can happen.\n\n55\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.300\nLet me show you another scenario.\n\n56\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.730\nIn fact, I got a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n57\n00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.280\nAnd if we drill down into the properties,\n\n58\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.900\nand I know my head's\nkind of covering it up.\n\n59\n00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.700\nBut if we drill down into the properties\nhere of our network adapter,\n\n60\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.160\nwe can kinda see what's going on.\n\n61\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.580\nYou can see, for instance, that it says,\n\n62\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.580\nhey I'm part of a domain-based network,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.960\nWell let's kinda see what\nthe adapter says is going on here.\n\n64\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.930\nIf I look at the properties\nof my network adapter,\n\n65\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.415\nright, I can see that well,\nI've got a static assignment, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:21.010\nI've got a static assignment then for\nme that's okay.\n\n67\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.100\nSo if I do something like this,\nfor instance, let's go ahead and\n\n68\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.020\nwhat we'll do here is we'll\nfire up a command prompter.\n\n69\n00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.410\nIn this case, PowerShell,\nlet's get a little bit more real estate so\n\n70\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.830\nyou guys can see out there.\n\n71\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.830\nAnd I decide to do, for instance,\n\n72\n00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.980\nlet's say I'm gonna ping\nthe domain controller, right?\n\n73\n00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.437\nThis is simulating a work based network,\nright?\n\n74\n00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:42.490\nAnd I do a 10.10.10.100,\njust happens to be my domain controller.\n\n75\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.660\nAnd I kinda know that\nalready going out the gate.\n\n76\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.915\nSo I have communication, but\nlet's go ahead and simulate that fail.\n\n77\n00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:50.590\nYou see the static address\nthat I've assigned here.\n\n78\n00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.470\nLet's go ahead and say,\nlet's kinda force that situation or\n\n79\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.080\nthat scenario where maybe\nI've moved it at home.\n\n80\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.060\nAnd now I'm no longer using\na static configuration, or\n\n81\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.590\nmore importantly, the IP addressing\nscheme is completely changed.\n\n82\n00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.806\nNow let's go ahead and\nlet's try that ping.\n\n83\n00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.782\nAgain, if that would just\nrerun the same command.\n\n84\n00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:14.170\nWell now I have a problem, right,\n\n85\n00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.020\nbecause on this network if I\nchange my adaptor settings.\n\n86\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.640\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ndo that real quick, right.\n\n87\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.320\nIf I change my adaptor settings, notice\nthat there is no static configuration,\n\n88\n00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.170\nbecause I said that we're using DHCP.\n\n89\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.500\nOr it still can be static configuration,\nbut the IP networks no longer match.\n\n90\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.090\nWell, if I change this now to DHCP, right.\n\n91\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.320\nAnd I say, you know what,\nwe'll just call out to the DHCP server.\n\n92\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.820\nAnd we'll let it go through the door\nprocess and let it grab an IP address.\n\n93\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.020\nOnce that happens, we're gonna go ahead\nand see, it could take a second here.\n\n94\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.910\nWe'll drop back down\nto the command prompt.\n\n95\n00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.070\nAnd we'll try to do something like\nmaybe ping the default gateway.\n\n96\n00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.630\nAnd we'll see if we have communications.\n\n97\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.170\nNow, first and foremost, I'll go ahead and\nwe'll drop back down and\n\n98\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.950\nI'll do an IP config.\n\n99\n00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.538\nWell notice that the DHCP server\nis using a 192.168 address, right?\n\n100\n00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:10.710\nSo my static address that I manually\nsigned, says it's not gonna use DHCP ever.\n\n101\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.190\nAnd when I moved it to the home network,\n\n102\n00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.970\nin this case,\nthat static assignment never worked.\n\n103\n00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.240\nSo that's a classic example where\nyou have bad IP configuration.\n\n104\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.520\nNow you can have a bad IP configuration,\nand\n\n105\n00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.439\nit's not really your network\nadapter that's causing the problem.\n\n106\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.943\nNow, there's another time that\nwe could have a problem, right?\n\n107\n00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:38.772\nWhat if I know what the IP address\nscheme is and I statically map it?\n\n108\n00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:42.673\nWell, this is where the other part of that\nscenario comes in when they say something\n\n109\n00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:45.770\nlike, well, there's a bad default gateway.\n\n110\n00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.320\nWhat's a bad default gateway,\nis it acting up?\n\n111\n00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.420\nNo, what we mean here is typically,\n\n112\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.260\nthe IP address for the default\ngateway is configured improperly.\n\n113\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.050\nNow we can see that this is a proper\ngateway, and we can test this, right?\n\n114\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.000\nSo I can do something like, for instance,\njust ping a remote host, right?\n\n115\n00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.850\nAnd if you notice,\nI'm getting replies back, right?\n\n116\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.320\nSo I know that I'm communicating\nacross the network.\n\n117\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.440\nI know that I not only\ncan talk to the gateway,\n\n118\n00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.680\nI can go through the gateway\nto the remote network.\n\n119\n00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.900\nWhat happens though if we drop back down,\nand we do a static configuration?\n\n120\n00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.970\nAll right, and let's do that.\n\n121\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.150\nSo I'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna say I know that this network is\n\n122\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.260\nusing DHCP ,but I still\nwanna control the address.\n\n123\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.866\nSo I do something like this,\n\n124\n00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:41.890\n192.168.45.100, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.720\nAnd instead of giving it the right IP\naddress, what I'm gonna do is gonna give\n\n126\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.630\nit, or the right IP of the gateway,\nI'm gonna give it a bad address here.\n\n127\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.911\nNow, normally you would think\nthe very first address,\n\n128\n00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.619\nright, is going to be the right address.\n\n129\n00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:56.610\nBut that's not always the case, right?\n\n130\n00:06:57.692 --> 00:07:00.980\nAll right, so let's go ahead and in fact\nyou know what we will not go further.\n\n131\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.580\nA lot of times what you'll do is that\nyou'll configure your DNS server\n\n132\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.610\nto be the default gateway too, right?\n\n133\n00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.260\nAnd let me make sure I\nget that right here.\n\n134\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.610\nTyping is not my strong suit,\nas you guys can probably see.\n\n135\n00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.265\nAnd we'll choose close, and\nwe'll let this go ahead and\n\n136\n00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:16.870\nassign that address to\nthe network adapter.\n\n137\n00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, just to clarify or\njust to make sure.\n\n138\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.580\nWe all know here, when we look at those\ntop three fields there, we must have,\n\n139\n00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.829\nif we're gonna use that static IP address.\n\n140\n00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:30.495\nWe'll specify our IP address, we'll also\nspecify that subnet mask for my network.\n\n141\n00:07:30.495 --> 00:07:32.665\nAnd then,\nif I want to leave that subnet mask,\n\n142\n00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:35.165\nthat's where I really\nneed the default gateway.\n\n143\n00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:39.421\nSo if we're having connection issues,\nand I can't reach an external source,\n\n144\n00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:41.720\nbut I'm able to communicate internally.\n\n145\n00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.932\nI really would want wanna\ncheck that information.\n\n146\n00:07:43.932 --> 00:07:45.040\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and how would we do that?\n\n147\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.997\nThat's a great point, one of the ways\nthat we would do that is we would do,\n\n148\n00:07:47.997 --> 00:07:50.741\nlike we talked about in other episodes,\nthe ping utility, right?\n\n149\n00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.513\nWe start locally, basically,\nyou test the software first, right?\n\n150\n00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:59.869\nWhen you test the software You're\nessentially just pinging 127.0.0.1, right?\n\n151\n00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:01.930\nI'm testing the software itself.\n\n152\n00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.842\nIt says my operating system\nknows what TCP/IP is.\n\n153\n00:08:05.842 --> 00:08:08.830\nThe next thing I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to ping the localhost, right?\n\n154\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.241\nAnd when I ping the localhost,\n\n155\n00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:13.490\nthat means my network adapter\nrealizes its IP address.\n\n156\n00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.969\nAnd it can communicate\non the local network.\n\n157\n00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.390\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna ping another localhost.\n\n158\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.200\nOr not the localhost,\nthe local node on the network.\n\n159\n00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.692\nAnd then finally, the last thing\nthat we're gonna do is we're\n\n160\n00:08:22.692 --> 00:08:23.319\ngonna ping a remote host.\n\n161\n00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:27.057\nAnd like Cherokee mentioned, if I know\nthat I can reach that remote host,\n\n162\n00:08:27.057 --> 00:08:29.010\nthen I can at least talk to the router.\n\n163\n00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.640\nAll right, so\nwe've got our incorrect gateway here.\n\n164\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.010\nLet's go ahead and pull that up.\n\n165\n00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.790\nAll right, now I'm gonna try that\nsame ping command that we just did.\n\n166\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.906\nAnd we're not gonna change anything.\n\n167\n00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.520\nIt's the same thing that we just did.\n\n168\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.203\nAll right.\n\n169\n00:08:44.203 --> 00:08:46.600\nAnd we'll go ahead and run that.\n\n170\n00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.660\nNow, something interesting.\n\n171\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.240\nI'm not getting replies back.\n\n172\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.130\nWhy is that?\n\n173\n00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.780\nAnd the reason that is is obviously\nbecause you guys can tell,\n\n174\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.900\nwe just configured\nthe default gateway wrong.\n\n175\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:00.384\nSo this is one of the things that's\na telltale sign that your gateway's not\n\n176\n00:09:00.384 --> 00:09:00.890\nright.\n\n177\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.960\nNow, if it's a bad default gateway,\nit's usually an IP address configuration.\n\n178\n00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.505\nThe other thing that it could be is that\nwell, the router's turned off, right?\n\n179\n00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:11.944\nThat's not gonna be a bad gateway, that's\njust gonna be the fact that you can't\n\n180\n00:09:11.944 --> 00:09:13.930\ncommunicate with it\nbecause it is turned off.\n\n181\n00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:18.240\nSo it is important in this scenario\nthat when you are using the ping utility\n\n182\n00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.910\nthat you start by trying to ping,\nwell, pinging the default gateway.\n\n183\n00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:22.658\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n184\n00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:29.192\nWe'll ping 192.168.45.1.\n\n185\n00:09:29.192 --> 00:09:30.040\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.290\nAnd boy, that's interesting.\n\n187\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.460\nI'm getting replies back.\n\n188\n00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.560\nWhy am I getting replies back?\n\n189\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.450\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, if I wasn't anticipating\na reply, why am I seeing one?\n\n190\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.130\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nthat's an interesting question.\n\n191\n00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.240\nAnd my first thought would be,\nwell, I don't know.\n\n192\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.410\n[LAUGH] But looking at it,\n\n193\n00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.760\nwhat's going on is we've got a node on\nthe network that does have an IP address.\n\n194\n00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.050\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nclear my screen here, guys, real quick,\n\n195\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.820\nand we'll jump back in.\n\n196\n00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.310\nAnd notice that I pinged what I\nthought was the default gateway.\n\n197\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.910\nIn fact, we'll just double check again.\n\n198\n00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.640\nRemember, notice that I've configured\nthis as the default gateway.\n\n199\n00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.900\nAnd we tell you, can you ping the gateway,\ncuz if I can communicate with the gateway,\n\n200\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.060\nit means I can talk to the router, right.\n\n201\n00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:19.178\nSo I'll go ahead and that's what we'll do,\nwe'll try the ping of 192.168 .45 and .1.\n\n202\n00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:22.830\nAnd well, like Cherokee said,\nI'm getting replies.\n\n203\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.800\nBut here's the thing.\n\n204\n00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.930\nRemember it says bad default gateway.\n\n205\n00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.300\nWhat if this is the IP address\nof another node on your network?\n\n206\n00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.800\nWhat if it's not the gateway?\n\n207\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.570\nYou can ping it, it returns replies.\n\n208\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.120\nBut can we get past it?\n\n209\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.930\nAnd that's where the real test lies.\n\n210\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.783\nSo if we try to ping 4.2.2.1.\n\n211\n00:10:38.783 --> 00:10:43.148\nNow you're noticing that, well, I don't\nseem to be getting a lot of information\n\n212\n00:10:43.148 --> 00:10:46.610\nwhen it comes to communicating\nto a remote network.\n\n213\n00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.900\nSo while I am getting replies back from\nthis IP address that, quote unquote,\n\n214\n00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.290\nis our default gateway, I can see\nit's not a valid default gateway.\n\n215\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.940\nIt's just another node on my network.\n\n216\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.270\nAnd it certainly isn't passing\ntraffic to the remote network.\n\n217\n00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.990\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nthat we're seeing this.\n\n218\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.830\nSo if I go ahead and we get out of this,\nlet's reconfigure that and see if,\n\n219\n00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.440\nonce we have the right default gateway, if\nI can ping something on a remote network.\n\n220\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.720\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll drop back\ndown to our network and sharing center.\n\n221\n00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.600\nIn this case, in Windows 10.\n\n222\n00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.180\nWe'll go back to the adapter settings.\n\n223\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.650\nAnd all I'm going to do, and\nthis is where in reality it can happen.\n\n224\n00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.780\nAnytime you're statically\nmapping something,\n\n225\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.150\nnotice that it's just one digit.\n\n226\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.358\nRight?\nBut that matters, right.\n\n227\n00:11:29.358 --> 00:11:33.638\nYou have to have the IP address of\nthe default gateway in order to be able to\n\n228\n00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:36.600\nroute your information\non that remote network.\n\n229\n00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.280\nSo now that we've got that set and\n\n230\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.370\nwe've got the right default gateway, let's\ndrop back down into our command prompt.\n\n231\n00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.220\nAnd let me see.\n\n232\n00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.904\nWell, first of all,\ncan I ping the gateway?\n\n233\n00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:50.339\nAnd we'll do a 192.168.45.2.\n\n234\n00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.300\nAnd at this point, it really\ndoesn't look much different, right?\n\n235\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.620\nOur test looks exactly the same\neven when the IP address was wrong.\n\n236\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.980\nSo now what I have to do is find out,\n\n237\n00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.570\ncan the gateway send my\ntraffic to a remote network?\n\n238\n00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.731\nSo we'll do that ping test again.\n\n239\n00:12:04.731 --> 00:12:07.270\nAnd now I'm getting communication.\n\n240\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.330\nSo keep in mind your ping command, right.\n\n241\n00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.790\nEspecially when it comes to testing\nyour connectivity, your end to end\n\n242\n00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.960\nconnectivity, cuz this obviously,\nas you can see, it causes problems, right.\n\n243\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.313\nThe other thing is to,\ndon't just stop with your default gateway.\n\n244\n00:12:20.313 --> 00:12:23.677\nCuz you're validating the IP address,\nwhat if you have another node like\n\n245\n00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:26.498\nwe've just seen here that you\nthink is your default gateway,\n\n246\n00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:29.264\nwhen in reality it's just another\nnode on your network, and\n\n247\n00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:33.800\nit certainly isn't gonna help you pass\ncommunications off to the remote network.\n\n248\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.645\nSo that's something that\nyou have to keep in mind.\n\n249\n00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:38.950\nNow, some of the other\nthings that they call out.\n\n250\n00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.220\nNow, I don't really have a diagram for\nthis one, but\n\n251\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.568\nare things like switching loops, right.\n\n252\n00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.510\nBroadcast storms, well, what are these?\n\n253\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:47.230\nAll right, well, think about it.\n\n254\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.380\nIn any kind of forwarding or passing\ninformation between end systems and\n\n255\n00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:57.290\nintermediate systems,\nwe don't want this passing\n\n256\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:02.230\nthe information around multiple devices\nand it just stays on our network.\n\n257\n00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.360\nSo when we talk about\nthings like routing loops,\n\n258\n00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.660\nnow, I know routing happens at layer\nthree, right, I understand that.\n\n259\n00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.100\nBut broadcast storms not only\ncan happen at layer three,\n\n260\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.150\nthey can happen at layer two, right?\n\n261\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.260\nSo, switches,\nwe can also have switching loops.\n\n262\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.790\nNow, technically, it's not a routing loop,\nbut it's still a loop in of itself.\n\n263\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.480\nSo that's where we implement things\nlike the spanning tree protocol, right?\n\n264\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.220\nOr spanning tree algorithm\nis what it uses to ensure\n\n265\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.270\nthat we have loop-free forwarding.\n\n266\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.270\nInside of your layer 3 technologies like\nyour routers, when we want to worry about\n\n267\n00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.020\nthings like routing loops, we implement\nthings like split horizons, right, or\n\n268\n00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.800\nsplit horizons with the poison reverse.\n\n269\n00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.920\nAnd that is a concept where it\nsays if you tell me about a route,\n\n270\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.470\nthere's no reason for\nme to turn around and\n\n271\n00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.790\ntell you about the same route that\nI learned from you, all right.\n\n272\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.670\nSo that stops, poison reverse,\nsplit horizons,\n\n273\n00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.640\nthese are ways that we\nstop the routing loops.\n\n274\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.380\nNow, the other thing that can\nhappen on your network as well\n\n275\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.040\nis when you have duplicate IPs.\n\n276\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.390\nNow, duplicate IPs, they could manifest\nthemselves in ways that make it obvious.\n\n277\n00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.050\nThey could manifest themselves in\nways that it isn't so obvious.\n\n278\n00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.980\nLike for instance, there are, in some\nof your older Windows 7 machines, and\n\n279\n00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.630\nI say older by, what, 2017, I know some\nof you guys are still using Windows 7.\n\n280\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.535\nLike, I like it, don't call it old.\n\n281\n00:14:19.535 --> 00:14:21.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n282\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.410\nwhen two network adapters\nare assigned the same IP,\n\n283\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.950\nyou get a duplicate IP warning\non Windows 7 machines.\n\n284\n00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.353\nYou don't always get warnings, though.\n\n285\n00:14:30.353 --> 00:14:31.720\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n286\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.850\nSo I went ahead and l what I did is I\nconnected back to our local network.\n\n287\n00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.800\nSo let's go ahead and\nuse our ipconfig option.\n\n288\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.520\nAnd we'll see that I still\nhave that static assignment.\n\n289\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.610\nSo let me go ahead and\n\n290\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.020\nlet's change the static assignment\nback to the work network.\n\n291\n00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.250\nAll right?\n\n292\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.457\nAnd we're gonna drop back down in to\nthe properties of our network adapter.\n\n293\n00:14:52.457 --> 00:14:57.710\nAnd I'll go ahead and\nreconfigure this for the local network.\n\n294\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.340\nAll right.\n\n295\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.090\nBut what's interesting here is I'm\ngoing to give it the same IP address\n\n296\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.080\nof the domain controller.\n\n297\n00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.325\nAll right.\n\n298\n00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:13.500\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and apply that.\n\n299\n00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.606\nAnd like I said, guys,\nknowing ahead of time,\n\n300\n00:15:15.606 --> 00:15:18.080\nI know what the IP address\nof the domain controller is.\n\n301\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.440\nAnd when I go ahead and choose OK to this\nand choose Close, one of the things that\n\n302\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.720\nyou're gonna notice is that it tells\nme that it's an unidentified network.\n\n303\n00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.260\nNow, on a domain network, right,\nwhen you have a domain computer and\n\n304\n00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.000\nit's attached to that corporate network,\nwhat you should see here is, I should see\n\n305\n00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.780\nthe name of the domain, but I see\nan unidentified network, and why is that?\n\n306\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.990\nWell, let's go ahead and let's drop\nback down to our command prompt,\n\n307\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.445\nin this case, PowerShell,\nand let's run our IPConfig.\n\n308\n00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:49.820\nAnd one of the things that I'm seeing\nis that I've got, it's interesting,\n\n309\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.248\nI've got a subnet mask.\n\n310\n00:15:51.248 --> 00:15:53.518\nBut I've also got a default gateway.\n\n311\n00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:57.393\nAll right, now\n&gt;&gt; If this was a true and it is APIPA,\n\n312\n00:15:57.393 --> 00:16:01.630\nthis is the automatic private IP address.\n\n313\n00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.402\nA lot of times,\nyou hear this in the context of well,\n\n314\n00:16:04.402 --> 00:16:08.560\nI've tried to call out to a DHCP server\nand it's snoozing or it's turned off or\n\n315\n00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.089\nfor whatever reason,\nI'm on another subnet.\n\n316\n00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:12.723\nSo, I get an APIPA address.\n\n317\n00:16:12.723 --> 00:16:16.848\nNow a truly native APIPA address will\nnever have a default gateway and\n\n318\n00:16:16.848 --> 00:16:21.683\nthat tells is something is going on here\nis not a traditional a pip address because\n\n319\n00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:25.737\nyou can't assign a pip address\na default gateways it's reliable So\n\n320\n00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:28.601\nnow I gotta dig a little bit deeper,\nall right.\n\n321\n00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:30.784\nNow in Windows 7 back in the older days,\n\n322\n00:16:30.784 --> 00:16:35.293\nyou would see a warning right away that\nsays, hey, you got a duplicate IP address.\n\n323\n00:16:35.293 --> 00:16:38.755\nSo what's going on here is,\nit's not letting you know.\n\n324\n00:16:38.755 --> 00:16:40.206\nSo, we have to dig a little bit deeper and\n\n325\n00:16:40.206 --> 00:16:41.927\nthat's where things like\nsystem logs come in.\n\n326\n00:16:41.927 --> 00:16:45.801\nSo if I drop down to Event Viewer here and\nI'll go ahead, and open it up, and\n\n327\n00:16:45.801 --> 00:16:49.614\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna\nkinda look at the system log here, and\n\n328\n00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:52.777\nthis is gonna tell me, and\nI could see right there at the top.\n\n329\n00:16:52.777 --> 00:16:53.756\nYou see that Cherokee?\n\n330\n00:16:53.756 --> 00:16:56.143\nIt says, an error and it says, TCP/IP.\n\n331\n00:16:56.143 --> 00:16:59.360\nSo if I select this,\nnotice what's happening here.\n\n332\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.770\nLike I said in Windows 7,\nit would tell you right away.\n\n333\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.091\nIt wouldn't give you all this information,\nbut it'd say, there's a problem here.\n\n334\n00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:09.344\nSo what happened was it said, the system\nhas detected an address IP conflict for\n\n335\n00:17:09.344 --> 00:17:12.645\nwell, this is the IP address of\nnot only now this machine, but\n\n336\n00:17:12.645 --> 00:17:16.925\nthe domain controller and it's letting\nme know that it was a hardware address.\n\n337\n00:17:16.925 --> 00:17:20.765\nLike I said, when I assign an IP address,\nmy computer calls out and it says,\n\n338\n00:17:20.765 --> 00:17:22.633\nmy IP address is at this MAC address.\n\n339\n00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:25.888\nBecause ARP works on broadcast,\nwell, at least in IPv4,\n\n340\n00:17:25.888 --> 00:17:27.980\nmy domain controller was listening.\n\n341\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.466\nIt says, that's my IP address and\nyou can find me at this MAC address.\n\n342\n00:17:33.466 --> 00:17:35.842\nSo what happened,\nwhat did the Windows machine do?\n\n343\n00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:38.728\nWell, the Windows machine says,\nmy bad, that's right.\n\n344\n00:17:38.728 --> 00:17:44.036\nIt's that guy's MAC address and\nit shut the entire TCP/IP stack down.\n\n345\n00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:50.041\nSo, what I need to make sure that I do\nis that I give it a unique IP address.\n\n346\n00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:54.768\nSo let's go ahead and let's bring backup\nthe properties of the network adapter, and\n\n347\n00:17:54.768 --> 00:17:56.553\nsee if we can do that very thing.\n\n348\n00:17:56.553 --> 00:17:59.851\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna open up the properties here.\n\n349\n00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.241\nLet me zoom in, so\nyou guys can see what's going on there.\n\n350\n00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:04.804\nI'm gonna do properties here and\nI'm just gonna change that, and\n\n351\n00:18:04.804 --> 00:18:06.512\nI'm actually gonna make it easy on myself.\n\n352\n00:18:06.512 --> 00:18:13.340\nCuz like I said, guys, you've probably\nseen my typing abilities and now reset.\n\n353\n00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.939\nI'll move all over the place here and I'll\nreset that network adapter with the right\n\n354\n00:18:17.939 --> 00:18:21.393\nconfiguration here, and\nwe'll go ahead, and choose Close.\n\n355\n00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:24.883\nNow, it's gonna go through a process.\n\n356\n00:18:24.883 --> 00:18:26.014\nIt'll do that same thing again.\n\n357\n00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:27.704\nIt'll call out to the network and\nsay, hey.\n\n358\n00:18:27.704 --> 00:18:30.705\nThis is the IP address I can change or\nI'm gonna take.\n\n359\n00:18:30.705 --> 00:18:32.077\nNotice the difference now.\n\n360\n00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.560\nNotice it also resolved.\n\n361\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.390\nThis is through things like NetBIOS and\nname resolution in the background that\n\n362\n00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.595\nare going on that it also said,\nyou're on a domain network.\n\n363\n00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:44.273\nSo, let's go ahead and\nsee what kind of IP address we have now.\n\n364\n00:18:44.273 --> 00:18:47.094\nAnd if I do an IP config,\n\n365\n00:18:47.094 --> 00:18:53.171\nI now notice that I have\na communicable IP address.\n\n366\n00:18:53.171 --> 00:18:57.304\nI can now communicate end to end,\nbecause we no longer have that duplicate.\n\n367\n00:18:57.304 --> 00:19:00.789\nSo keep in mind that a duplicate IP\naddress and I'm giving you an example\n\n368\n00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:04.002\nof here in Windows, and\nthis is just how Windows 10 handles it.\n\n369\n00:19:04.002 --> 00:19:07.794\nEven amongst operating systems,\nserver operating systems,\n\n370\n00:19:07.794 --> 00:19:12.233\nadditions of Windows, they can handle\nthis just a little bit different.\n\n371\n00:19:12.233 --> 00:19:17.136\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what would happen,\nlet's say, if DHCP falsely.\n\n372\n00:19:17.136 --> 00:19:19.083\nHere I am fowling up the words.\n\n373\n00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:23.223\nBut what if I obtained an incorrect or\na duplicate Duplicate IP address.\n\n374\n00:19:23.223 --> 00:19:25.647\nHow would I resolve that issue?\n\n375\n00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:29.952\n&gt;&gt; Well, if it's gonna be DHCP that you're\ndoing, you could, and well first of all,\n\n376\n00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:31.590\nif that happens and it's DHCP,\n\n377\n00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.550\nit might be a problem with your DHCP\nserver, could be a configuration error.\n\n378\n00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.555\nOne of the easiest ways that if you happen\nto receive a duplicate IP address and\n\n379\n00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:41.718\nthis can happen.\n\n380\n00:19:41.718 --> 00:19:43.630\nLet me give you a scenario first and\nI'll tell you want you do.\n\n381\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.164\nSo for instance,\nmaybe we've got a scope and let's say,\n\n382\n00:19:47.164 --> 00:19:52.073\nit's 10.10.10.10.50 all the way\nthrough 0.90 at the end and\n\n383\n00:19:52.073 --> 00:19:55.418\nsomebody maybe doesn't know\nmaybe what the scope is.\n\n384\n00:19:55.418 --> 00:19:59.904\nSo, they statically assign an IP\naddress that's in that range.\n\n385\n00:19:59.904 --> 00:20:01.796\nThe DHCP server doesn't know about that.\n\n386\n00:20:01.796 --> 00:20:03.695\nIt's basically got like a phone bug.\n\n387\n00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:06.589\nA record that says,\nI see that that address is available.\n\n388\n00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:09.727\nAnd when my computer calls out to\nthe network, it hands it to it.\n\n389\n00:20:09.727 --> 00:20:11.320\nNow, we have a duplicate.\n\n390\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.773\nWhat is something that can happen?\n\n391\n00:20:12.773 --> 00:20:16.873\nWell, one of the things that you can do\nis just an IP config space forward slash\n\n392\n00:20:16.873 --> 00:20:19.333\nrelease and\ntry to release the IP address, but\n\n393\n00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:22.255\nI can tell you that almost never works and\nhere's why.\n\n394\n00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:25.366\nFor some reason,\nthe DHCP servers have a good memory.\n\n395\n00:20:25.366 --> 00:20:27.801\nAnd a lot times,\nwhat they'll do is they'll turn around and\n\n396\n00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:30.114\ngive you the same IP address\neven though you released it.\n\n397\n00:20:30.114 --> 00:20:33.106\nSo a lot of times, what you're gonna\nhave to do is you're gonna have to\n\n398\n00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.702\nuse do things like ARP inspections.\n\n399\n00:20:34.702 --> 00:20:38.355\nYou're gonna have to find out what's the\nother hardware adapter that's some device\n\n400\n00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:40.331\non my network that's causing the problem,\nso\n\n401\n00:20:40.331 --> 00:20:43.141\nthat one can be a little bit harder\nto spot just like this one here.\n\n402\n00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.165\nThis one's harder to spot,\nbut there's something wrong,\n\n403\n00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:49.962\nbecause I should not be able to assign\non a APIPA address a default gateway and\n\n404\n00:20:49.962 --> 00:20:53.187\nthat was my first tell tale sign\nthat there was something wrong.\n\n405\n00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:55.617\nBut you can see in\nthe aspects like Windows 10,\n\n406\n00:20:55.617 --> 00:20:57.697\nit didn't give us the obvious red flags.\n\n407\n00:20:57.697 --> 00:20:59.731\nWe kinda had to dig for that information.\n\n408\n00:20:59.731 --> 00:21:02.687\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you do use that\nforward slash release switch,\n\n409\n00:21:02.687 --> 00:21:06.710\njust be aware of that if you are working\nremotely or you're troubleshooting over\n\n410\n00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:09.686\nthe phone with someone and\nyou're telling them what to do.\n\n411\n00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:13.478\nBecause remember, you are gonna lose\nthat connection with that other node.\n\n412\n00:21:13.478 --> 00:21:14.255\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n413\n00:21:14.255 --> 00:21:17.701\nNow some of the other\nthings that they call out,\n\n414\n00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:21.069\nthey call out misconfiguration\nof your DHCP.\n\n415\n00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:25.180\nThat's one of the things that I can\ntell you is that, for instance,\n\n416\n00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.222\nyou have devices that you need\ncreate things like reservations and\n\n417\n00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:34.131\nyou create a reservation that means I'm\nnot gonna assign that specific device,\n\n418\n00:21:34.131 --> 00:21:35.887\na random IP out of this pool.\n\n419\n00:21:35.887 --> 00:21:36.933\nIt's gonna get it every time.\n\n420\n00:21:36.933 --> 00:21:40.394\nAnytime you statically map an IP address\nthat happens to be in that pool,\n\n421\n00:21:40.394 --> 00:21:42.108\nthe DHCP server isn't aware of it.\n\n422\n00:21:42.108 --> 00:21:45.497\nSo that could cause a DHCP\nconfiguration error, but\n\n423\n00:21:45.497 --> 00:21:47.817\nthat's really on the client side.\n\n424\n00:21:47.817 --> 00:21:52.245\nWhen it comes to DHCP misconfigurations,\nmost often than not,\n\n425\n00:21:52.245 --> 00:21:57.170\nif it's on the client side,\nchances are it's gonna be a duplicate IP.\n\n426\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.090\nThe other thing is that it might be the\nfact that it's a static assignment that\n\n427\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:05.368\nyou've got currently assigned to it, just\nlike I showed you and it needs to be DHCP,\n\n428\n00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:09.554\ncuz it's not in the same address scheme or\nnetwork really when it comes down to it.\n\n429\n00:22:09.554 --> 00:22:12.809\nEverything else really when\nit comes to DHCP is gonna be\n\n430\n00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:15.870\nmore of on the server side,\nso I'll tell you what.\n\n431\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.148\nWhat we'll do is let's go ahead and\nlet's check out the DHCP server and\n\n432\n00:22:20.148 --> 00:22:24.283\nlet's see if we can kind of cause\none of these configuration errors,\n\n433\n00:22:24.283 --> 00:22:27.729\nshow you the scenario and\nthen show you how to reverse it.\n\n434\n00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:32.081\nSo I've gone ahead and what I've done is\nI've connected to the DHCP server, and\n\n435\n00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:33.497\nthis is the DHCP console.\n\n436\n00:22:33.497 --> 00:22:37.318\nNow, remember that when we talked\nabout DHCP in the past episodes,\n\n437\n00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:40.948\nwe talked about, there are some\nthings known as scope options.\n\n438\n00:22:40.948 --> 00:22:44.984\nNow if you have some kind of DHCP\nconfiguration error like they're calling\n\n439\n00:22:44.984 --> 00:22:48.520\nout a lot of times, it's gonna be\non the DHCP server side itself.\n\n440\n00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.186\nLet's go ahead and what we'll do is we'll\nlook at the current scope that I have here\n\n441\n00:22:53.186 --> 00:22:57.585\nand I want to just kinda again talk about\nsome of those options that you might see\n\n442\n00:22:57.585 --> 00:23:01.452\nunder the scope and the big ones\nhere are things like, for instance,\n\n443\n00:23:01.452 --> 00:23:03.945\napparently I don't have a Time Server set.\n\n444\n00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:06.617\nSo, I could say that they're\nsome configuration problems.\n\n445\n00:23:06.617 --> 00:23:09.198\nYou might say, well,\nwhat's the problem with a Time Server?\n\n446\n00:23:09.198 --> 00:23:14.170\nWell, a Time Server is very important in a\ndomain controller, especially when you're\n\n447\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.008\nusing things like Kerberos authentication,\nbut I could have things like DNS names,\n\n448\n00:23:19.008 --> 00:23:22.790\nthe DNS server that we use to\nresolve addresses is misconfigured.\n\n449\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:29.867\nAnd when that happens, well, I'm sending\nname resolution requests to well, nobody.\n\n450\n00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:32.791\nSo I need to make sure that, for instance,\n\n451\n00:23:32.791 --> 00:23:37.356\nconfigurations like my domain name,\nfor instance, let's see.\n\n452\n00:23:37.356 --> 00:23:39.794\nI can uncheck that, for instance.\n\n453\n00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:44.795\nBut look, if you look in here, for\ninstance, we've got our name servers.\n\n454\n00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:46.787\nAnd if I'm doing the configuration,\n\n455\n00:23:46.787 --> 00:23:49.722\nI need to make sure that I put\na valid name server in here.\n\n456\n00:23:49.722 --> 00:23:53.922\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll use my domain\ncontroller, cuz it's running DNS and\n\n457\n00:23:53.922 --> 00:23:54.929\nit takes a second.\n\n458\n00:23:54.929 --> 00:23:58.151\nWhat it does is it just reaches out to\nthe DNS server and it validates it.\n\n459\n00:23:58.151 --> 00:24:00.868\nIt says Are you a DNS server?\n\n460\n00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:03.896\nAnd we hope that the domain\ncontroller will respond back to you,\n\n461\n00:24:03.896 --> 00:24:04.960\nand say yes I am.\n\n462\n00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.770\nAll right, so I can see that\neverything's going good here.\n\n463\n00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.840\nSo if I go ahead and apply this, let's\nsee if we can perform name resolution.\n\n464\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.462\nNow you'll remember earlier\nin our demonstration,\n\n465\n00:24:14.462 --> 00:24:16.799\nwe did a statically mapped IP address,\nright?\n\n466\n00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:19.304\nAnd I did a 10.10.10.10, all right.\n\n467\n00:24:19.304 --> 00:24:25.150\nWell let's go ahead and let's flip\nthat over to DHCP and see what we got.\n\n468\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.590\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll switch it on over.\n\n469\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.710\nAnd remember, the difference between\nobtaining an IP address automatically,\n\n470\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.550\nthat's DHCP versus a static assignment.\n\n471\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.480\nAll right, so we'll go ahead and\nwe'll apply those properties.\n\n472\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.680\nAnd it takes a second.\n\n473\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.820\nAgain, keep in mind what's going on\nis that four step process, right,\n\n474\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.150\nthat DORA process, discover,\noffer, request, acknowledge.\n\n475\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.220\nIt's sending out a discovery packet saying\nhey, is there a DHCP server out there?\n\n476\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.890\nThat DHCP server,\nhopefully it's listening,\n\n477\n00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.820\nand it makes an offer, all right?\n\n478\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.710\nAnd then finally,\nthe request comes to the first DHCP\n\n479\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.760\nserver that responds when I take the IP\naddress and its configuration parameters.\n\n480\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.680\nAnd that's something\nimportant to remember.\n\n481\n00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.690\nDHCP is a configuration protocol.\n\n482\n00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.890\nAnd it's some of those options that\nsometimes can be misconfigured.\n\n483\n00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:16.280\nLet's go ahead and let's find out,\ndo we have a DHCP issue to address?\n\n484\n00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.208\nAll right, go ahead and clear the screen\nhere and we'll run ipconfig /all.\n\n485\n00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:25.840\nAll right,\nwell that's a lot of information there.\n\n486\n00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.830\nBut if I look I can see that I've\ngot a default gateway, right?\n\n487\n00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.090\nI've got an IP address, right.\n\n488\n00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.418\nAnd I can see that it was offered by DHCP.\n\n489\n00:25:38.418 --> 00:25:40.770\nI can see what my DNS server is, right?\n\n490\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.752\nI've got a DNS server.\n\n491\n00:25:42.752 --> 00:25:45.090\nLets go ahead and\nlets try a name resolution.\n\n492\n00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.902\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\ndo ping and I'll tell you what?\n\n493\n00:25:47.902 --> 00:25:49.950\nI'll ping the fully qualified name.\n\n494\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.370\nLets make sure first that it's\nactually truly resolving it.\n\n495\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.130\nI don't want to use the local\nresolver cache right?\n\n496\n00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.159\nSo I'm going to go ahead and do nslookup.\n\n497\n00:25:59.447 --> 00:26:03.078\nAll right, and\nwe're going to go ahead and we'll run.\n\n498\n00:26:03.078 --> 00:26:04.662\nWell, let's ping the domain controller.\n\n499\n00:26:04.662 --> 00:26:10.935\nWe'll do srv01.demo.itpro.tv,\nall right we'll do an nslookup,\n\n500\n00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:15.383\nand we'll see can I reach\nout to that DNS server, and\n\n501\n00:26:15.383 --> 00:26:19.125\nyou can see the address right there.\n\n502\n00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:22.215\nAll right, and sure enough,\nit resolved the name for me.\n\n503\n00:26:22.215 --> 00:26:24.085\nSo I'm getting name resolution.\n\n504\n00:26:25.215 --> 00:26:27.835\nWell let's look at a misconfiguration.\n\n505\n00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:33.068\nWhat happens, if I first of all,\nI do a ipconfig, if I can spell ipconfig.\n\n506\n00:26:33.068 --> 00:26:35.020\n[LAUGH] And I do a release.\n\n507\n00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:41.030\nWe're gonna give that IP address up, and\nI don't have an IP address any more.\n\n508\n00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.463\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go ahead, you remember,\n\n509\n00:26:44.463 --> 00:26:46.316\nwe were configuring the options?\n\n510\n00:26:46.316 --> 00:26:50.370\nWell let's go ahead and\ndo a misconfiguration, like they call out.\n\n511\n00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:54.965\nMaybe, somebody comes in here, and, just\nlike had a check mark in the time server,\n\n512\n00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:58.740\nmaybe, I fat fingered the keyboard,\nand I decided, you know that?\n\n513\n00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.606\nI hit the check box right next to the DNS\nServer, and I go ahead and choose OK.\n\n514\n00:27:03.606 --> 00:27:06.980\nWell, now here's a problem.\n\n515\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.484\nI have a default gateway.\n\n516\n00:27:08.484 --> 00:27:11.072\nI have a DNS domain name, right?\n\n517\n00:27:11.072 --> 00:27:15.622\nActually let's switch back\nover to our command prompt, or\n\n518\n00:27:15.622 --> 00:27:17.820\nPower Shell in this case.\n\n519\n00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:23.620\nAnd let's do an ipconfig /flushdns.\n\n520\n00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.269\nI don't want that local resolver cache\nto being where it's looking because that\n\n521\n00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:29.145\nwould be cheating right?\n\n522\n00:27:29.145 --> 00:27:34.868\nNow I'm gonna do an ipconfig /renew and\nwe're gonna call back to the DHCP server.\n\n523\n00:27:34.868 --> 00:27:37.332\nAnd we're gonna say, hey I was kidding.\n\n524\n00:27:37.332 --> 00:27:38.246\nI didn't mean to let that go.\n\n525\n00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:41.156\nI need an IP address back.\n\n526\n00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:45.205\nBut know when I run\nipconfig /all I want you,\n\n527\n00:27:45.205 --> 00:27:50.120\nlet's just confirm that I no\nlonger have a DNS server.\n\n528\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.011\nNow you got be careful because\ntechnically we kind of have a DNS server\n\n529\n00:27:55.011 --> 00:27:58.820\nhere because it's using the link local,\nall right?\n\n530\n00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:04.600\nIt's using multi cast here IPv6, but\nI don't have a IPv4 address at all, right?\n\n531\n00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.517\nWell, let's go ahead and let's try\n\n532\n00:28:09.517 --> 00:28:14.600\nto ping srv 01.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n533\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:22.300\nAnd unfortunately,\nwe don't get a reply back, right?\n\n534\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.210\nBecause dhcp hasn't been configured.\n\n535\n00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.820\nIn this case, it's been misconfigured and\n\n536\n00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:32.380\nit's no longer handing us that DNS server,\nright, our name server for resolution.\n\n537\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:37.050\nBecause of that misconfiguration,\nI can't resolve any names in my network.\n\n538\n00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:42.980\nSo this is a situation in which you\ncould see that a DHCP misconfiguration\n\n539\n00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.660\ncauses additional things like in\nthis case a name resolution problem.\n\n540\n00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.450\nSo we go back to configuring the options.\n\n541\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.880\nLet's see if we can remedy the situation.\n\n542\n00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.080\nAnd we're looking for DNS option 006.\n\n543\n00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.190\nAll right, and we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll put the same DNS server in.\n\n544\n00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.840\nWe'll add it.\n\n545\n00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.240\nWe'll let it do the validation.\n\n546\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.710\nIt just needs to see, hey,\nyou've been running DNS out there?\n\n547\n00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.300\nTalk back to me if you are.\n\n548\n00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.295\nAnd, in this case it is,\nand we'll choose OK.\n\n549\n00:29:09.295 --> 00:29:13.835\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nlet's do ipconfig first.\n\n550\n00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.405\nWe'll do a release, oops.\n\n551\n00:29:16.405 --> 00:29:19.855\nIf that's how you spell release,\nreal lease.\n\n552\n00:29:19.855 --> 00:29:22.965\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nlet it just give up the configurations and\n\n553\n00:29:22.965 --> 00:29:25.085\nthe IP address,\nall that lease information.\n\n554\n00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:27.010\nWe just want to get rid of it.\n\n555\n00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.110\nAnd the next thing that we will\ndo is we're gonna turn around and\n\n556\n00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.250\nwe're gonna start the DORA process again\nand we're gonna pull back the IP address.\n\n557\n00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.410\nRemember we'll restart the DORA\nprocess by doing a renew.\n\n558\n00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.921\nAnd it's gonna reach out to the domain\ncontroller and it's gonna call back and\n\n559\n00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:46.497\nsay, hey, I need an IP address and\nthose configuration options that you have,\n\n560\n00:29:46.497 --> 00:29:47.196\nall right?\n\n561\n00:29:47.196 --> 00:29:49.990\nLet me go ahead and clear the screen here,\nmake it a little easier to see.\n\n562\n00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.531\nAnd we'll do an ipconfig /all.\n\n563\n00:29:54.531 --> 00:29:57.177\nAnd now I can see, if I zoom in here,\n\n564\n00:29:57.177 --> 00:30:00.810\nthat yes DHCP is handing\nme out the right option.\n\n565\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:05.110\nIt's handing me out the valid\nDNS Server for this internal network.\n\n566\n00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.928\nAnd this time,\nwhen I do something like for instance ping\n\n567\n00:30:09.928 --> 00:30:14.600\nsrv01.demo., remember the fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n568\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:21.230\nSo, we're using the DNS here, if I ping\nsrv01 I might get some replies back.\n\n569\n00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.030\nBecause netbios is on our network too and\n\n570\n00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.300\nit can resolve things\nlike single lookup names.\n\n571\n00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.700\nBut that doesn't help me\nin this case with DNS.\n\n572\n00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.710\nSo when I run this,\nnow notice I'm getting replies back.\n\n573\n00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.508\nNow there's a couple of things here,\nright.\n\n574\n00:30:33.508 --> 00:30:38.130\nThis also could be a misconfiguration of\nDNS even though it's on the DHCP server.\n\n575\n00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.700\nSo you can see that in\nDHCP misconfigurations\n\n576\n00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.330\na lot of times it's gonna\nbe the server side.\n\n577\n00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:47.040\nIf it happens to be the client side it\ncould just be the difference between\n\n578\n00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.180\na static mapping and a dynamic mapping.\n\n579\n00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.755\n&gt;&gt; But that was also good advice to\nremember to flush that DNS there, because\n\n580\n00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:56.535\nsometimes after the problem's been fixed,\nyour computer might not be aware of that.\n\n581\n00:30:56.535 --> 00:30:57.815\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n582\n00:30:57.815 --> 00:31:01.915\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, because remember, and\nlet me show you exactly what Cherokee.\n\n583\n00:31:01.915 --> 00:31:03.155\nLet's drop back down to my computer.\n\n584\n00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:06.415\nLet me show you exactly what\nCherokee's talking about because that's\n\n585\n00:31:06.415 --> 00:31:07.055\nthe truth, right?\n\n586\n00:31:07.055 --> 00:31:10.469\nSo if I do an ipconfig\n\n587\n00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:15.190\n/displaydns, I've got a few names here,\nwell one of\n\n588\n00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.680\nthem's an LDAP wrecker cuz I gotta\ncommunicate with the domain controller.\n\n589\n00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.670\nBut more importantly if I'm already\ncaching this information, and I do a ping,\n\n590\n00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:28.140\nI could disable, or I could completely\ntake the DNS server out of the mix,\n\n591\n00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.080\nout of the IP Properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n592\n00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.480\nBut because I've got this cache,\n\n593\n00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.100\nit's still gonna look like I have\nname resolution when truly I don't.\n\n594\n00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.250\nSo that's a couple of things,\n\n595\n00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.290\nscenarios that you could see inside\nof misconfiguration of DHCP.\n\n596\n00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.930\nAnd I'll recap it one last time,\nserver side issues.\n\n597\n00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.640\nA lot of times the misconfiguration\nof the server itself.\n\n598\n00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.850\nOn the client side however,\n\n599\n00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:52.990\nit's typically the differences of\nstatic versus a dynamic allocation.\n\n600\n00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.020\n&gt;&gt; Wes it looks like we got through\nat least three of our topics from our\n\n601\n00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:56.980\nlaundry list here.\n\n602\n00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.890\nLike we had said there are a lot of\ndifferent problems that can go wrong\n\n603\n00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.570\non a network, so\nstay tuned to learn some more solutions.\n\n604\n00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.240\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n605\n00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.190\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n606\n00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryant.\n\n607\n00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.800\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n608\n00:32:10.800 -->

00:00:12.029\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nComp TIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.680\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boost.\n\n6\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.630\nThis is a continuation of part two where\nwe were discussing common networking\n\n7\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.520\nissues and problems.\n\n8\n00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.230\nSo we'll look at some troubleshooting\ntechniques with Mr. Wes Bryan today.\n\n9\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.370\nThank you for joining us, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.300\nYeah, I talked a lot in the first one.\n\n12\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.510\n&gt;&gt; That one quite a bit, yeah.\n\n13\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.890\n&gt;&gt; We got through like four-\n&gt;&gt; And we just got started.\n\n14\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.750\n&gt;&gt; We go through four of the bullet\npoints here but that's okay.\n\n15\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.300\nWe're gonna pick back up and\nwe're gonna go move along like\n\n16\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.980\nCherokee already said and some common\nnetworking issues and I wanna recap.\n\n17\n00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.560\nIn the first part, we were talking\nabout things like the misconfiguration\n\n18\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.890\nof your network adapters and\nthat can happen.\n\n19\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.406\nThey call out things like for\n\n20\n00:00:49.406 --> 00:00:52.765\ninstance, incorrect IP configuration and\ndefault gateway.\n\n21\n00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:56.535\nThese can happen for a couple reasons,\nmore often than not it's gonna happen\n\n22\n00:00:56.535 --> 00:01:01.100\nbecause of something like for instance,\nyou're doing static configuration.\n\n23\n00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.820\nRemember when you do static configuration,\n\n24\n00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.640\nit has its place within our networks,\nright?\n\n25\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.300\nWe want our servers,\nwe want our network devices, printers and\n\n26\n00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.980\nstuff like this, we want those\ndevices to have static IP addresses.\n\n27\n00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.840\nSo we know they don't change, I gotta\nbe able to find services on my network.\n\n28\n00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.580\nAnd if they're using\ndynamic IP addressing,\n\n29\n00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.140\nthen there is a possibility that\nthe IP addresses can change.\n\n30\n00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.170\nSo, static IP addressing has its place\nwithin our network and you do need to\n\n31\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.730\nremember that it doesn't mean,\nit's something we should shy away from.\n\n32\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.740\nHowever, remember,\n\n33\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.230\nany time we do any kind of manual\nimplementation, it leads the human error.\n\n34\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.730\nGuys, you've seen probably in the first\npart, I can't type to save my life, right?\n\n35\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.404\n&gt;&gt; It happens, yeah.\n\n36\n00:01:38.404 --> 00:01:43.086\n&gt;&gt; And I would say how many network\nadapters do you think you can get\n\n37\n00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:46.190\nthrough with a flawless configuration?\n\n38\n00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.170\nAnd that sounds like some\nkind of video game here, but\n\n39\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.770\nwhat I mean is that I might get\nthrough five, right, maybe.\n\n40\n00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.880\nAnd then it leads to things\nlike inconsistencies.\n\n41\n00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.360\nThe other could be is, what if you\nare relying on dynamic configuration?\n\n42\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.300\nWe mentioned that DHCP,\nif there's configuration problems,\n\n43\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.000\nwe've shown you in the first episode, the\nDHCP can be causing the problem as well.\n\n44\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.310\nWe also looked at duplicate IPs.\n\n45\n00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.450\nRemember, any time you\nhave a duplicate IP, ARP\n\n46\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.400\nis working when we assign an IP address,\nARP is the address resolution protocol.\n\n47\n00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.970\nAnd it calls out to the local network and\nit tells every other computer,\n\n48\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.012\nthis is my IP address.\n\n49\n00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:27.370\nAnd if another computer\nalready has that IP address,\n\n50\n00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.620\nit calls back it says no no no no no,\nthat's my IP address.\n\n51\n00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.478\nAnd what happens to the computer,\nthat's the one that's causing the problem.\n\n52\n00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:40.800\nThe entire TCP/IP protocol stack shuts\ndown and in Windows, for instance,\n\n53\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.020\nyou get a 169.254.anything.anything\nacross the APIPA address.\n\n54\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.040\nSo those are some things that can affect\nthings like end-to-end connectivity.\n\n55\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.820\nNow I did mention in that first episode,\n\n56\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.120\nI talked a little bit about things like\nbroadcast storms and routing loops, but\n\n57\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.500\nI didn't show you a diagram and\nI have a diagram.\n\n58\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.080\nI just forgot to show you.\n\n59\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.880\nRemember that when we talk about broadcast\nstorms, what we're talking about is for\n\n60\n00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.940\ninstance, in your switching, in layer two.\n\n61\n00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.500\nIf a broadcast is sent into\nthe to the port of a switch,\n\n62\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.440\nwell, a switch is gonna just\nbroadcast it all out all other ports.\n\n63\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.630\nKeep in mind the broadcast traffic kind\nof makes a switch act like a hub, right?\n\n64\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.600\nBroadcasting communications\nout all their ports.\n\n65\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.090\nWell, the problem is what if\nanother switch picks up, right?\n\n66\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.040\nMaking multiple switches in a network and\nthe other switch picks up that broadcast.\n\n67\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.380\nWell, what is it gonna do?\n\n68\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.810\nIt knows it needs to go to\nthat all f MAC address,\n\n69\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.770\nwhich is the broadcast MAC address, and\nthen it broadcasts out all other ports.\n\n70\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.730\nAnd eventually what you get is\nthis broadcast storm that can\n\n71\n00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.390\nreally cripple your network.\n\n72\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.320\nSo we implement things like spanning tree\nalgorithm or spanning tree protocol.\n\n73\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.100\nAnd it goes through this process,\n\n74\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.990\nan election process where it\nhas a root bridge, right?\n\n75\n00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.790\nAnd the root bridge is the top\nof part of the tree hierarchy.\n\n76\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.080\nAnd then it goes through\na process of electing which\n\n77\n00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.360\nports on the switch can actually\nforward traffic and some can't, right?\n\n78\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.670\nSo that breaks up that broadcast storm.\n\n79\n00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.010\nSo we don't have broadcast\ncontinuing on our network,\n\n80\n00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.490\nbringing our network to crippling it.\n\n81\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.980\nI also mentioned routing loops, too.\n\n82\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.060\nAnd routing loops,\nwe're talking a little bit more,\n\n83\n00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.900\na little bit higher than the OSI model,\nright.\n\n84\n00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.280\nWe're talking about layer three.\n\n85\n00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.250\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer here.\n\n86\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.110\nNow, what the goal is look for\na routing, right?\n\n87\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.170\nWe want all our communications\ngoing across the network and\n\n88\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.250\nwe don't wanna just cycling around to\ninfinity, if you will, on our network.\n\n89\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.690\nThat's the ultimate goal,\n\n90\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.140\nbut distance vector protocols\nare very acceptable to routing loops.\n\n91\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.390\nAnd that's because the way they\ncommunicate is by doing router\n\n92\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.840\nadvertisement messages, right?\n\n93\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.560\nIn a distance vector protocol, what we do\nis we're talking to our nearest neighbors.\n\n94\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.160\nAnd it's a little inconvenient in the fact\nthat we're always broadcasting the entire\n\n95\n00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.810\nrouting table every 45 seconds.\n\n96\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.300\nSo for instance,\nrouter one is gonna talk to router two and\n\n97\n00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.450\nrouter four in this case, all right?\n\n98\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.910\nAnd then router two,\nit talks to its nearest neighbors, right?\n\n99\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.890\nIt talks to one and\nit talks to three in the sense.\n\n100\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.460\nAnd then finally we have for instance,\n\n101\n00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.170\nrouter one talking to its nearest\nneighbors in this case, two and four.\n\n102\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.330\nThen finally four gets in the picture and\n\n103\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.810\nwhat we end up having is what\nis known as convergence.\n\n104\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.700\nA converged network.\n\n105\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.660\nThat means that the routing and tables\nare aware of all routes on these routers.\n\n106\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.620\nEverybody knows what the topology is.\n\n107\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.970\nSo we have a consistent or\nconverged topology.\n\n108\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.860\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a [INAUDIBLE]\nlike state all on the same page.\n\n109\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.690\nEveryone's happy.\n\n110\n00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n111\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.760\nI don't know if they're holding their\nhands like that or not but maybe.\n\n112\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.810\nSo, where is the problem coming in?\n\n113\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.080\nWell, I want you to think\nof a situation where,\n\n114\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.990\nwe're gonna talk about,\nlet's go back to our instance router one.\n\n115\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.560\nWhen router one sends these\nroute advertisements,\n\n116\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.290\nit actually sends the entire database.\n\n117\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.720\nThat entire routing table, but\n\n118\n00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.710\nI'm gonna just say that in that routing\ntable, one of these routes is new.\n\n119\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.860\nNone of the other routers really\nknow about it yet, right?\n\n120\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.590\nSo it's not a fully converged network.\n\n121\n00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.070\nWe've got a route that's now new and\n\n122\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.490\nwe needed to make sure that it\npropagates throughout the network.\n\n123\n00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.686\nWell, imagine this,\nif router one says hey,\n\n124\n00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:09.893\nI'm aware of 172.16 network, right?\n\n125\n00:06:09.893 --> 00:06:12.140\nWell, it's gonna tell\nits nearest neighbors.\n\n126\n00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.380\nBoth router four and\nin this case, router two.\n\n127\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.977\nNow what would happen if router two\nsays you know about 172.16.0.0?\n\n128\n00:06:20.977 --> 00:06:22.700\nOkay, well, I didn't know about that.\n\n129\n00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.550\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet me put that in my routing table.\n\n130\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.310\nWhat's router two gonna do?\n\n131\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.350\nWell, remember how the distance\nvector protocol is actually working.\n\n132\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.370\nRemember, if we go back up here,\nwhat is router two gonna do?\n\n133\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.640\nWell, router two is gonna turn around and\nrebroadcast that information, right?\n\n134\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.120\nWell, now there's a problem.\n\n135\n00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.980\nRouter two tells router one, hey,\nI know about this network, 172.16.0.0.\n\n136\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.370\nWell, does it really\nknow about that network?\n\n137\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.170\nWell, it learned about that\nnetwork from router one.\n\n138\n00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.970\nSo essentially it knows about it\nbecause some other router told it.\n\n139\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.810\nWell, what happens if router one loses\nconnection to the 172.16 network?\n\n140\n00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.580\nThat it is the only one\nthat knows about it.\n\n141\n00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.360\nAnd for whatever reason the interface\ngoes down, it can no longer connect.\n\n142\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.560\nWell, it's gonna recalculate and\nit's gonna talk to router two.\n\n143\n00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.695\nAnd router two is gonna say yeah,\nI know how to get to 172.16.0.0.\n\n144\n00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:16.379\nAnd I'm gonna send it out this interface.\n\n145\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.380\nBut wait a second here.\n\n146\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.090\nRouter two learned about that\nnetwork from router one.\n\n147\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.790\nIt really doesn't know exactly\nwhere that network is.\n\n148\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.220\nAnd that's where we get a problem cuz\nthese guys start passing communications\n\n149\n00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.810\nback and forth when router one goes okay,\nI'll send it to you router two.\n\n150\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.690\nYou told me you knew how to get it there.\n\n151\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.310\nRoute two says yeah, I know how to get\nit there, I'm gonna send it back to you.\n\n152\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.110\nRemember originally it learned it, so\nthat can cause those routing loops.\n\n153\n00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.790\nAnd again, distance vector protocols\nare very, very susceptible to that.\n\n154\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.718\nSo what we have to do,\nlike I mentioned in the last episode,\n\n155\n00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:52.781\nwe implement something known\nas split horizons, all right.\n\n156\n00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:56.055\nAnd when we look at split horizons,\nit does something kind of interesting.\n\n157\n00:07:56.055 --> 00:08:00.924\nIt doesn't allow the broadcasting\nof a route back to\n\n158\n00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:04.475\nthe originating router, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:08.680\nSo my diagram really should\nbe kind of corrected here.\n\n160\n00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.860\nBecause when it really comes down to it,\n\n161\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.850\nthere isn't gonna be this possibility\nof that going out of the interface.\n\n162\n00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.510\nIt actually stops right\nthere on the interface.\n\n163\n00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.810\nAnd it says, wait a second, instead\nof talking back to you, router 1, and\n\n164\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.450\ntelling you about a route you just\ntold me about, I'm gonna stop that.\n\n165\n00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.320\nI'm gonna tell the next router downstream\nfrom me, I'll tell router 3 that hey,\n\n166\n00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.880\nif you need to send information to 172,\njust send it back to me.\n\n167\n00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.490\nThen I can forward it back.\n\n168\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.810\nNow the other thing that we do is\nsplit horizons with poison reverse.\n\n169\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.200\nAnd then what poison reverse\ndoes is it kind of does.\n\n170\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.050\nThink about poison.\n\n171\n00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.590\nIt's route poisoning.\n\n172\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.800\nIt will tell router 2 or\n\n173\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.340\nrouter 2 will tell router 1\nhey that's got a metric of 16.\n\n174\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.930\nWell, the metric of 16 means\nit's an unreachable network.\n\n175\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.470\nAnd when router 1 sees that and says,\nand that's what you're telling me?\n\n176\n00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.070\nOkay, well let me just go ahead and\nremove it from my routing table,\n\n177\n00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.280\nbecause we can't reach it anyways.\n\n178\n00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.890\nSo I want to make sure that you\nunderstand that split horizons and\n\n179\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.340\na lot of times we implement split\nhorizons with poison reverse.\n\n180\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.820\n&gt;&gt; So Wes what you're telling me is\nthat by implementing one of these two\n\n181\n00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.660\ntechniques, I don't have to wait until my\nTTL, my time to live has been exceeded.\n\n182\n00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.710\nI'm reducing all that excessive traffic,\nkind of nipping it in the bud right there.\n\n183\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n184\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.260\nSo we do have to make sure that if we\nwant to implement loop free routing.\n\n185\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.580\nRemember that when I say routing, it can\nalso happen in the forwarding layers,\n\n186\n00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.630\ndown there at layer 2.\n\n187\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:36.010\nSo it's either expanding tree protocol at\nlayer 2 with your switches or it's gonna\n\n188\n00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.295\nbe something like split horizons or poison\nreverse when we're talking about layer 3.\n\n189\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.280\nAll right, so that has us really with,\nI just wanted to double back on that so\n\n190\n00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.930\nthat you were aware of that.\n\n191\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.720\nNow the next thing that\nwe talk about is DNS.\n\n192\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.690\nAnd DNS can also be misconfigured.\n\n193\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.400\nAnd there's a couple of different ways,\nhonestly, that this can happen.\n\n194\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.260\nOne of the ways that can\nhappen is very simple.\n\n195\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.150\nSo I've got a couple of machines here.\n\n196\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.030\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look at my machine.\n\n197\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.210\nSo when it comes to DNS configuration,\nagain, just like DHCP,\n\n198\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.230\nwe do have to worry that some of\nthe issues can be on the client side.\n\n199\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.660\nSome of the issues can\nbe on the server side.\n\n200\n00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.800\nAnd it's up to us to kind of figure\nout where does the problem lie?\n\n201\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.116\nSo the first thing I'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna run an ipconfig /all.\n\n202\n00:10:20.116 --> 00:10:22.570\nI just wanna kinda see if I\neven have a DNS server, right?\n\n203\n00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.420\nIf you don't have a DNS server, it's gonna\nbe kind of hard to do name resolution,\n\n204\n00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.015\nso that is something that we do\nhave to take into consideration.\n\n205\n00:10:28.015 --> 00:10:30.525\nAnd I can see that I do\nhave a DNS server here, so\n\n206\n00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:33.505\nthat's one of the first\nthings that I gotta consider.\n\n207\n00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:37.295\nNow the other thing that we can do when\nit comes to misconfiguration of DNS,\n\n208\n00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:40.430\nis it really could be\nthe fact that maybe somebody\n\n209\n00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.100\ndidn't set the properties of\nthe network adapter right.\n\n210\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.540\nLike for instance, if I drill down\ninto our ethernet properties here, and\n\n211\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.270\nI pull up the properties of v4 here,\nIPv4, excuse me.\n\n212\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.970\nIf I do something like this, right,\n\n213\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.000\nthe valid DNS server is .100\nin the last octet, but.\n\n214\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.710\nLet's say I misconfigure it right,\nand I close this down.\n\n215\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.220\nAnd we'll go ahead and let's make\nsure that we don't have any former or\n\n216\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.120\nprior resolution in the local\nresolver cache because again,\n\n217\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.420\nthat would kind of be cheating.\n\n218\n00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.115\nWe would still resolve things\nbecause we might have already asked\n\n219\n00:11:15.115 --> 00:11:16.101\nthe question earlier.\n\n220\n00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:19.488\nSo I'm gonna go ahead And\n\n221\n00:11:19.488 --> 00:11:24.200\nI'll do an ipconfig /flushdns.\n\n222\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.720\nAnd now that we've done that.\n\n223\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.470\nKeep in mind that this is\na misconfiguration of the DNS on\n\n224\n00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.280\nthe client side.\n\n225\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.140\nIf I do something like this,\nfor instance, ping.\n\n226\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:39.588\nI'll ping my domain controller,\nsrv01.demo.itpro\n\n227\n00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:45.420\nDot tv and we'll run this.\n\n228\n00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.500\nNow notice what's happening.\n\n229\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.440\nThe ping request could not find the host.\n\n230\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.400\nNow I also want you to keep this in mind\nthat when I'm using the ping command,\n\n231\n00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.200\nthe ping command can test test\nthings like name resolution.\n\n232\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.710\nBut it's not the only thing that can\ntest name resolution when you're\n\n233\n00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.360\ntroubleshooting.\n\n234\n00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.510\nKeep in mind we also have\nthings like nslookup.\n\n235\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.700\nAnd remember with nslookup,\none of the things that happened,\n\n236\n00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.460\neven though we couldn't resolve it, is it\nsaid don't look at the local cache, right?\n\n237\n00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.170\nLet me go ahead and\n\n238\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:15.990\nI'm gonna send a request to\nthe interface defined DNS server.\n\n239\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.560\nSo that's important, right?\n\n240\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.840\nNow, let's go ahead and\nI'll go ahead and clear my screen here.\n\n241\n00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.771\nAnd we'll drop back down and\n\n242\n00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:26.806\nlet's just double check again\nthat we do have a DNS server.\n\n243\n00:12:26.806 --> 00:12:29.930\nAnd I'm gonna run ipconfig /all.\n\n244\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.400\nSo I can see that I do have a DNS server.\n\n245\n00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.210\nAnd like I said, you guys know that we\ndon't have the right IP address, right.\n\n246\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.810\nI can't send name resolution requests\nto a server that doesn't exist.\n\n247\n00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.730\nOr an IP address, if you will,\nthat doesn't exist.\n\n248\n00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.310\nSo I happen to know that the machine\nthat I'm trying to get to\n\n249\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.340\nhas a valid IP address.\n\n250\n00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.530\nI know that it's communicating, right?\n\n251\n00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.120\nIts one of the ways that I have\nto authenticate it when I got on\n\n252\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.060\nthe network, all right.\n\n253\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.313\nSo if I try to ping my IP address,\ndo I get any replies back?\n\n254\n00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:05.470\nSo we'll ping by 10.10.10.100.\n\n255\n00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.180\nAnd notice that I am getting replies\nfrom my domain controller, so\n\n256\n00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.600\nI know it's got to be some\nkinda name resolution issue.\n\n257\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.430\nSo that would imply that in this case,\non the client side,\n\n258\n00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.830\nthat I need to go back to the network\nadaptorr, and I need to ensure\n\n259\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.680\nthat I have the DNS server set correctly,\nand the properties of the network adapter.\n\n260\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.010\nSo again, I know I'm kinda doing this,\nlet me slow this down a little bit.\n\n261\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.170\nAll I'm doing is right-clicking\non the network adapter here.\n\n262\n00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.470\nAnd you'll see, if we kinda zoom in.\n\n263\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.589\nI'm going to Properties.\n\n264\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.385\nAnd then, we're looking at the properties.\n\n265\n00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:43.920\nTCP/IP properties and more specifically\nIPV4, and then we choose our properties.\n\n266\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.570\nNow, notice that I've got the wrong\nnumber here, the wrong octet,\n\n267\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.880\nor excuse me, the wrong IP address.\n\n268\n00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.030\nSo, I need to change that.\n\n269\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.000\nGet it right eventually.\n\n270\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.228\nWe've got something wrong here.\n\n271\n00:13:54.228 --> 00:13:58.280\n[LAUGH] So as I straighten this out,\n\n272\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.790\nby putting the right DNS\nserver IP address in here.\n\n273\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.450\nLet's go ahead, and let's try that again.\n\n274\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.180\nWe're gonna try first, we'll try our ping,\nand I'm gonna ping the DC here.\n\n275\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.326\nSo SRB01.demo .itpro.tv.\n\n276\n00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:18.480\nAll right, now notice that I'm\nstarting to get the name resolution.\n\n277\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.590\nPing's working, right.\n\n278\n00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.610\nI can see in the results here,\nI can see that I did a ping.\n\n279\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.210\nIt was the name right here, and\nhere I can see the name and\n\n280\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.820\nI can see that it resolved\nto the correct IP address.\n\n281\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.830\nAnd again that's because now\nwe have the right IP address.\n\n282\n00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.210\nNow, what might happen if you\nhave a server side issue?\n\n283\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:43.970\nAll right, so I've got another like a\nWindows 10 machine here parked over here.\n\n284\n00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.260\nAll right and let's see if we\ncan actually get a hold of it.\n\n285\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.630\nAnd what I mean by that is\nthrough name resolution.\n\n286\n00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.938\nSo let me go ahead and\nlet's find out what the host name is here.\n\n287\n00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:58.410\nWe'll go ahead and\njust type hostname, and there we go.\n\n288\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.120\nSo this is the host name of this machine.\n\n289\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.320\nAnd I know that it's part of the domain,\nso what I wanna do is see,\n\n290\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.980\ncan I resolve this machine's name.\n\n291\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.120\nAll right, so we'll go back to\nour Windows 10 machine here.\n\n292\n00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:15.530\nLet me go ahead and\nclear the screen here, zoom out here.\n\n293\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.255\nFigure out what plan that I'm on.\n\n294\n00:15:17.255 --> 00:15:18.690\n[LAUGH] There we go.\n\n295\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.860\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll try to resolve that machine.\n\n296\n00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.210\nWe'll do a ping here and\nwe're gonna do now dash client.\n\n297\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.280\nThis is the same machine that we\nused in an earlier episode for\n\n298\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.320\nour network access control.\n\n299\n00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.790\nSo we haven't changed its name at all.\n\n300\n00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.230\nAnd I'm gonna try to ping it.\n\n301\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.030\nWell isn't that interesting.\n\n302\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.280\nNotice that the ping request,\nI can't ping this host.\n\n303\n00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.790\nAgain, it can't find the name.\n\n304\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.850\nNow this time, I have the right IP\naddress, right, of the DNS server.\n\n305\n00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.622\nBut I still can't find this machine.\n\n306\n00:15:50.622 --> 00:15:51.935\nWell, I know its IP address.\n\n307\n00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:55.951\nAnd if we need to, we could always\nbump back over to the machine, and\n\n308\n00:15:55.951 --> 00:15:57.438\nI could run an IP config.\n\n309\n00:15:57.438 --> 00:16:01.113\nAnd I notice that well I do\nhave an IP address here, right.\n\n310\n00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:05.699\nWell let's go ahead and let's see\nif we can do resolve this by name.\n\n311\n00:16:05.699 --> 00:16:10.119\nLet's see if we can actually ping it by\nits IP address we'll take name resolution\n\n312\n00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:11.097\nout of the issue.\n\n313\n00:16:11.097 --> 00:16:16.187\nAll right, so we'll do a ping here\nten dot ten dot ten dot 20 and\n\n314\n00:16:16.187 --> 00:16:19.120\nsure enough, I got communication.\n\n315\n00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.735\nWell here's the thing,\nwhy can I resolve the domain controller,\n\n316\n00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:28.251\nbut I can't resolve this other machine?\n\n317\n00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:32.155\nThere's the DNS issue, obviously\nthere's some kind of problems, so\n\n318\n00:16:32.155 --> 00:16:35.090\nwe need to go to that machine and\nfigure out.\n\n319\n00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.320\nIs that machine having issues?\n\n320\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.290\nSo maybe we know that this machine\ndoesn't have DNS issues but\n\n321\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.650\nmaybe the other machine\nis having DNS issues.\n\n322\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.940\nSo let's go ahead and\nwe'll switch on over to this box and\n\n323\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.880\nwe'll kinda see what this window, what's\ngoing on with this Windows 7 machine.\n\n324\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.040\nFirst thing I'm gonna do\nis clear the screen out and\n\n325\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.260\nlet's run an ipconfig /all on this one.\n\n326\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.950\nAnd let's see if we have a DNS server,\nall right?\n\n327\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.040\nLet's check the settings of the TCIP\nproperties of the network adapter.\n\n328\n00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.720\nAnd if you remember what I said,\nthe DNS server's IP address is?\n\n329\n00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.570\nYou'll see that,\nwell isn't that interesting?\n\n330\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.570\nWe do have an IP address for\nthe right DNS server.\n\n331\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.800\nSo again, is it the client issue?\n\n332\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.970\nWell, I'm not sure.\n\n333\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.940\nLet's find out, all right?\n\n334\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.484\nSo let's try to see if this machine\ncan do some name resolution, right?\n\n335\n00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:28.886\nLet's do a ping, srvo one\n\n336\n00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:34.295\ndot demo dot itpro dot tv.\n\n337\n00:17:34.295 --> 00:17:38.364\nAnd isn't that interesting,\nthis machine can resolve a name.\n\n338\n00:17:38.364 --> 00:17:41.818\nCan this machine resolve\nthe Windows 10 machine I have here?\n\n339\n00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:46.130\nWell, I don't know, let's find out.\n\n340\n00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:51.293\nLet's do a ping, and\nthis is mdt slash win slash\n\n341\n00:17:51.293 --> 00:17:55.830\nref dot demo dot itpro dot tv, all right?\n\n342\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.190\nWell sure enough,\nit can resolve that machine too.\n\n343\n00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.150\nNow we gotta figure out\nwhat's going on here, right?\n\n344\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:11.820\nMaybe, maybe I can't find this\nmachine because I've got for\n\n345\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.870\nwhatever reason on the other machine,\nwe've got some configuration issue.\n\n346\n00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.770\nNow we checked the IP properties\nof the network adapter and\n\n347\n00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.370\nwe seem to have the right DNS server.\n\n348\n00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.820\nI've checked the IP properties\nof this network adapter,\n\n349\n00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.580\nthe one that we can't resolve, and\nwe have the right configuration there.\n\n350\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.660\nSo what that's making me think is that\nmaybe we've got some kind of issue\n\n351\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.570\nwith the DNS server itself.\n\n352\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.015\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's bump over to the DNS server here and\n\n353\n00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:37.901\nwe'll get logged in.\n\n354\n00:18:42.683 --> 00:18:49.030\nAnd I went ahead and what I've done is\nI pulled up the DNS zone here, right.\n\n355\n00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.832\nSo if I go into our server here and\nI pull up the DNS console.\n\n356\n00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:56.390\nYou'll see here's our SRV01 that's\n\n357\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.100\nthe one that we've been\ntrying to resolve its name.\n\n358\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.253\nAnd we seem to be having no\nissues resolving that name.\n\n359\n00:19:04.253 --> 00:19:06.590\nBut we can't resolve our WIN 10 client.\n\n360\n00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.680\nSo let's go ahead and let's get into the\nzone file here and see what's going on.\n\n361\n00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.080\nAnd right away remember earlier\nwe talked about DNS records.\n\n362\n00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.910\nWe talked about A records being\nthe name to the IP addresses.\n\n363\n00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.540\nHere's one thing that\nI can see right away.\n\n364\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.159\nI can see that there's my WIN 10 machine.\n\n365\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.590\nI can see that SRVO one is there.\n\n366\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.149\nThose are the two names\nthat we can resolve.\n\n367\n00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:35.815\nBut I can't resolve\nthe NAP dash client o one.\n\n368\n00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:39.440\nAnd one of the first things that I notice-\n&gt;&gt; No record.\n\n369\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.640\n&gt;&gt; That's right, very good catch Cherokee.\n\n370\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.150\nThere is no record in here, all right.\n\n371\n00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:49.050\nSo in IP config one of the other\nthings that you have that you can do\n\n372\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.800\nis dynamic registration, right?\n\n373\n00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.270\nWhat should happen is that\nwhen the computer comes online\n\n374\n00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.290\nit should reach out to the domain\ncontroller or the DNS server and\n\n375\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.180\nsay hey I'm here, this is my IP address.\n\n376\n00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.750\nLet's go ahead and let's see if we can\nresolve the issue that way, all right.\n\n377\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.230\nSo we'll switch back over\nto our Windows 7 machine.\n\n378\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.153\nWe'll go ahead and clear the screen here.\n\n379\n00:20:10.153 --> 00:20:17.118\nAnd we'll run the command IPconfig\nspace forward slash register DNS.\n\n380\n00:20:17.118 --> 00:20:21.825\nNow, what it's going to do is it's going\nto reach out to the domain controller and\n\n381\n00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:23.700\nsay, hey, I'm here.\n\n382\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.089\nThis is my IP address and here's my name.\n\n383\n00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.010\nNow, notice what it tells me right here.\n\n384\n00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:33.830\nIt says the registration of the DNS\nresource records for all adapters for\n\n385\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.770\nthis computer has been initiated.\n\n386\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:43.830\nIt said within 15 minutes you should be\nable to find something in event viewer.\n\n387\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.990\nHowever, we're not gonna wait that long,\nright?\n\n388\n00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.250\nWe're not gonna wait 15 minutes because\nwe don't have 15 minutes in the episode.\n\n389\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:54.230\nSo let's go ahead and\nswitch back over to our DNS server.\n\n390\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:59.260\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nrefresh the zone file and its interesting.\n\n391\n00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.700\nAnd again, keep in mind that the zone\nfiles, where we keep all of these named IP\n\n392\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.200\naddresses, and I still don't see it\ninside of this machine, all right.\n\n393\n00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.780\nSo that isn't really,\nsomething else is going on here, right?\n\n394\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.950\nBecause I can't get that\nrecord inside of the database.\n\n395\n00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.970\nSo, let's do what Windows told us to do.\n\n396\n00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.030\nRemember, it said that it's been\ninitiated, right, the registration here.\n\n397\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.170\nAny errors will be reported, right?\n\n398\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.690\nAnd the word wrap there.\n\n399\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:31.030\nIn event your so let's go ahead and\nsee if any errors have been reported.\n\n400\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.889\nWe'll go ahead and\nlaunch our event viewer here.\n\n401\n00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:41.850\nMaybe, there we go.\n\n402\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:47.530\nAnd once event viewer opens up, we'll go\nahead, and what we're gonna do is we'll\n\n403\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.000\nrifle down in the system logs and see if\nwe can kinda determine what's going on.\n\n404\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.720\nSo remember with name resolution\nright we've looked at ping,\n\n405\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.350\nwe've looked at using NS lookup, but\nyou can also use your system logs too.\n\n406\n00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.680\nWhether you're running sys log\ninside of Unix base systems,\n\n407\n00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.050\nyou're running event viewer as your\nsystem logs inside of Windows.\n\n408\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.330\nSo we're going to go ahead.\n\n409\n00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.250\nWe're going to open up Windows logs here.\n\n410\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.150\nWe'll go to system.\n\n411\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.060\nAll right, and how about I go ahead and\nfilter this log here.\n\n412\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.390\nWe're gonna do just warning critical and\nerror here.\n\n413\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.150\nI don't need the information events.\n\n414\n00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:24.180\nAnd right away I see that\nI've got a warning here and\n\n415\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.589\nlet's see what the timestamp is on it,\nall right.\n\n416\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.480\nNotice something here.\n\n417\n00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.990\nWe don't have any name resolution.\n\n418\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.160\nI don't have any name resolution and\nit looks like that hasn't refreshed here.\n\n419\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.390\nI'll tell you what.\n\n420\n00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.620\nLet's try this again.\n\n421\n00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:44.190\nI'm gonna remove error, and\njust kind of update that.\n\n422\n00:22:46.232 --> 00:22:46.760\nAll right,\n\n423\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.620\nso I can see that the DNS client\ndoesn't seem to actually be responding.\n\n424\n00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.580\nIt looks like name\nresolution isn't happening.\n\n425\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.170\nThe DNS servers aren't responding.\n\n426\n00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.392\nSo what does that mean?\n\n427\n00:22:58.392 --> 00:23:01.670\nAll right, that means this machine for\nwhatever reason,\n\n428\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.840\nwe don't know yet, cannot communicate with\nthe DNS server to update it's information.\n\n429\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.990\nAnd that could be a problem.\n\n430\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.960\nAnd here is where, again, finally,\n\n431\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.980\nthe misconfiguration of\nthe DNS server can happen.\n\n432\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.950\nMaybe you have a secure zone.\n\n433\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.020\nAnd you don't want anybody to just be able\nto put information inside of this file.\n\n434\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:24.370\nWell, for security purposes, you can\ndo things like disabling registration.\n\n435\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.940\nAnd if I go to the properties\nof the zone here.\n\n436\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.020\nAnd I dig down in here.\n\n437\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:33.630\nSure enough I can see that dynamic\nregistration it isn't turned on.\n\n438\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.580\nSo there's no way that Windows 7 machine\nis going to be able to update it's\n\n439\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.932\ninformation so that we can turn around and\nresolve it's name.\n\n440\n00:23:39.932 --> 00:23:45.620\nSo you see we've got some kind of\nDNS issue and the configuration.\n\n441\n00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.310\nJust happens to be,\nwe don't want non secure.\n\n442\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.110\nJust happens to be on the DNS server\nside itself so we'll go ahead and\n\n443\n00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.951\nchoose okay to that.\n\n444\n00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.890\nWe're gonna run back to\nour Windows 7 machine and\n\n445\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.060\nwe'll see if we've resolved this issue.\n\n446\n00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.830\nWe're gonna rerun that ip config space\nforward slash registered DNS and\n\n447\n00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.930\nwe'll see.\n\n448\n00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.420\nIf we can update the information\non the DNS server side.\n\n449\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.760\nSo, it's running its registration gives\nus the same exact warning again and\n\n450\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.160\nsays just check event viewer in 15 minutes\nif you still can't connect, all right?\n\n451\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.860\nAnd if I refresh the zone.\n\n452\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.580\nSure enough I have nap dash client 01 and\n\n453\n00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.720\nit seems to have resolved itself,\nall pun intended.\n\n454\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.650\nBut let's see if it\nactually resolved anything.\n\n455\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.100\nLet's go to our Windows 10 machine.\n\n456\n00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.640\nWe're gonna do an IP config space\nforward slash flush DNS, right.\n\n457\n00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.980\nI wanna make sure that I'm not\ndoing anything locally here.\n\n458\n00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.830\nI'm not checking the local result or\ncache.\n\n459\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.190\nLet me go ahead and clear the screen,\nand making it a little easier for\n\n460\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.760\nyou guys to see out there.\n\n461\n00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.635\nAnd we're gonna try this again.\n\n462\n00:24:49.635 --> 00:24:53.523\nWe're gonna try a ping and\n\n463\n00:24:53.523 --> 00:25:02.030\nwe'll try net dash cliento one\ndot demo dot itpro dot tv.\n\n464\n00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:05.580\nAnd sure enough we got name resolution.\n\n465\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.130\nSo, as a re-cap keep in mind,\n\n466\n00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:11.500\nsome of the configuration could be\na simple misconfiguration on the client.\n\n467\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.780\nOthers could be security\npurposes where we don't want\n\n468\n00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.480\nregistration inside of our DNS zone file,\nand we could have disabled that.\n\n469\n00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.270\nBut at that point, it's gonna\nbe something on the server side.\n\n470\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:26.020\nSo it is important to use things like\nping, use things like NS lookup.\n\n471\n00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:30.720\nAnd use things like ipconfig when\nyou're testing DNS name resolution and\n\n472\n00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.700\nany issues that might come up.\n\n473\n00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.460\n&gt;&gt; Well I think I feel a little more\nconfident to be able to resolve\n\n474\n00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:38.370\nthese issues if we do\nexperience them on the network.\n\n475\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.450\nSo thank you for that, Wes.\n\n476\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.330\nAnd ladies and gentlemen,\n\n477\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:44.220\nhopefully this will help you continue with\nyour studies here for CompTIA Network+.\n\n478\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.940\nBut don't go anywhere, because we have\na lot more issues that we need to cover.\n\n479\n00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.830\nBut for this show we're about out of time,\nso we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n480\n00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.020\nRemember, I'm Cherokee

00:00:11.012\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.590\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.460\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.970\nThis is actually a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.560\nWe have a lot different networking\nissues to look at here.\n\n8\n00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.350\nWe've already covered quite a bit.\n\n9\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.170\nBut with us today, we have Mr. Wes Bryan\nin the studios to cover additional topics.\n\n10\n00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.520\nSo thank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.370\nYeah, we've got a few more\nthat we've gotta round up.\n\n13\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.690\nAnd, well,\nwhen it comes to common networking issues,\n\n14\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.130\nthere can be a lot of them, and\nthat’s why we are in a part three.\n\n15\n00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.020\nAnd so, we are going to be looking\nat some additional concepts.\n\n16\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.670\nRemember, in the first part we\ntalked about IP configurations,\n\n17\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.989\nproblems that that can cause\nif it's misconfigured.\n\n18\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.520\nWe talked about things like\nduplicate IP's, broadcast storms,\n\n19\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.010\nall different kinds of interesting stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.490\nIn the last episode, we really\nfocused in on things like DNS, right.\n\n21\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.890\nSo moving away from DNS,\n\n22\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.380\nwe're gonna look at some additional\nproblems that we could face.\n\n23\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.360\nOne of the ones that they call out, for\ninstance, is an incorrect VLAN assignment.\n\n24\n00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.590\nWhen it comes to an incorrect VLAN\nassignment, to understand why that could\n\n25\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.490\ncause a communication problem,\nwe gotta remember what VLANs do, right.\n\n26\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.060\nVLANs allow me to logically\ndivide up a switch.\n\n27\n00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.960\nIt's basically allowing one\nphysical switch to be treated\n\n28\n00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.830\nlike multiple switches.\n\n29\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.860\nAnd every virtual local area network,\nthe machines\n\n30\n00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.440\nthat are grouped in a specific VLAN,\nthey can communicate amongst themselves.\n\n31\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.370\nBut they can't communicate, even if\nthey're attached to the same switch,\n\n32\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.610\non a VLAN on that switch,\nif they're not a part of it.\n\n33\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.280\nRight?\n\n34\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.780\nThat's where we need things like,\nfor instance, our\n\n35\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.580\nlayer three technologies in order to route\nbetween the virtual local area network.\n\n36\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.660\nSo, just because you're attached to\nthe same switch doesn't necessarily mean\n\n37\n00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.230\nthat you're gonna be able to communicate\nif there is an incorrect assignment and\n\n38\n00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.780\na machine is misconfigured by\nplacing it on a different VLAN.\n\n39\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.320\nSo you do have to keep that in mind.\n\n40\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.710\nSome of the other things\nthat they call out to.\n\n41\n00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.300\nThey call out things\nlike hardware failure.\n\n42\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.330\nRight?\nI mean that can happen.\n\n43\n00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.090\n&gt;&gt; It happens, yeah.\n\n44\n00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.130\n&gt;&gt; It certainly does.\n\n45\n00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.880\nI mean, you look at blades on a switch.\n\n46\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.170\nA blade on a switch can go bad, well,\neven the network adapter on the machine.\n\n47\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.230\nIf we drop down to,\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n48\n00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.225\nIf I pull up the properties of\nthe network adapter via device manager,\n\n49\n00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.505\nit could be things like a driver\nissue on the client side.\n\n50\n00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.205\nNow, it could be a failing\nnetwork adapter.\n\n51\n00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:34.735\nIt could be embedded into the motherboard.\n\n52\n00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:39.803\nAnd, unfortunately, if that happens,\nif you've got an available port,\n\n53\n00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:42.825\nyou need to put in a replacement NIC,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:42.825 --> 00:02:44.390\nNetwork Interface Card.\n\n55\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.250\nHowever, if it's a driver's issue,\nI can always go in here, and\n\n56\n00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.950\nI can look for\nmy network adapter in this list.\n\n57\n00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.131\nAnd I can find out, well, it doesn't\nhappen to be my network adapter.\n\n58\n00:02:54.131 --> 00:03:00.149\nIs my network adapter, in this case,\nyou can see, it's the Intel(R) 82,\n\n59\n00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.900\nwhat is it,\n574 gigabit network connection.\n\n60\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.380\nNow, if I go in here I can also\nlook at things like the driver,\n\n61\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.320\nif I need to find out,\ndo I need a driver update, right.\n\n62\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.840\nSo we can do things like\ndriver updates as well in here\n\n63\n00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.145\nif it happens to be hardware\nfailure on the client side.\n\n64\n00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:20.915\nWhen we also talk about hardware failure,\nI could show you one of the easiest\n\n65\n00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:24.365\nthings, is the fact that the network\nadapter works just fine.\n\n66\n00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:28.995\nBut when we rifle down in here to,\nlet's say, network and sharing center, and\n\n67\n00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.915\nI look at the adapter itself,\nit could be disabled, right?\n\n68\n00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:33.479\nNow, in this case, this one is enabled.\n\n69\n00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.530\nRight, but it could be a disable.\n\n70\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.730\nSo, the hardware failure might just be\n\n71\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.150\nbecause of the old layer rate\nissue that we talk about, right?\n\n72\n00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.420\nThe human error, if I come in here and\nI've disabled it.\n\n73\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.680\nI might have a problem.\n\n74\n00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.773\nThe other thing with hardware failure too\nthat we talked about in another issue that\n\n75\n00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:54.750\nI'll just kinda bring back up\nis if you have copper media.\n\n76\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.870\nRight?\nIf it's copper media,\n\n77\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.080\nyou gotta check the cable.\n\n78\n00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.240\nSimple fixes first, right?\n\n79\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.110\nCheck the link light on the adapter and\nif it's working, move from there.\n\n80\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.940\nIf it's a wireless communication, right?\n\n81\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.430\nIf it's wireless communication,\nsome of the things that happen as well,\n\n82\n00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.660\nis the fact that, for instance, on my\nMac here, you'll see that, for instance,\n\n83\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.850\nI'm running wired or a wireless, but\nI also have a wired connection too.\n\n84\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.970\nAnd what happens if you have\na simultaneous wired connection and\n\n85\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.680\na wireless connection?\n\n86\n00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.820\nWell, typically, your machines,\nthey'll have a preference order, right,\n\n87\n00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.580\na precedence order.\n\n88\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.420\nAnd the precedence, the highest precedence\nis usually the wired connection.\n\n89\n00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.000\nBecause the wired connection\nperforms better, right.\n\n90\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.860\nAnd then the second precedence\nis the wireless communication.\n\n91\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.030\nNow, I've seen it cause problems, right?\n\n92\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.590\nWhere you've got wireless turned on,\n\n93\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.560\nyou're not connected\nto a wireless network.\n\n94\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.450\nYou've got a wired adapter plugged in,\nand for\n\n95\n00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.180\nwhatever reason,\nthe precedence order is changed, right?\n\n96\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.470\nAnd that could be a misconfiguration.\n\n97\n00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.730\nCould be a driver problem,\ncould be a hardware problem,\n\n98\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.000\nand it's up to you to determine,\nyou know, what the case might be.\n\n99\n00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.310\nSo, keep in mind, those could be\na couple things that happen too.\n\n100\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.740\nAgain, the simultaneous wired and\nwireless connection,\n\n101\n00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.930\nif the precedence order is off,\nit could be choosing a wireless adapter,\n\n102\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.510\nwhich you're not connected to a wireless\nnetwork, even though it's turned on,\n\n103\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.240\nwhen it should be preferring\nthe wired connection.\n\n104\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.990\n&gt;&gt; So\njust a simple little check like that,\n\n105\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.740\ndisable whichever adapter\nyou're not using,\n\n106\n00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.540\nmay resolve some of those intermittent\nissues or issues that you're having.\n\n107\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so and\nI can give you another example here.\n\n108\n00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.790\nSo we've disabled this network\nadapter on this machine.\n\n109\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.660\nIf I pull up the properties of the network\nadapter, and more specifically,\n\n110\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.610\nthe TCIP properties, and I run IP config,\nI can see things like media disconnected.\n\n111\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.640\nNow, be careful.\n\n112\n00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.380\nOn the exam, it might be something.\n\n113\n00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.210\nIn fact, Cherokee, I think you\nmentioned this when we were talking\n\n114\n00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.710\nabout some of the media\nissues that we have.\n\n115\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.030\nNever overlook the simple fixes first,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.200\nIf I don't have a network connection,\nit might not be the hardware that failed,\n\n117\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.025\ncould be that my configuration failed,\nand I mean me.\n\n118\n00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.860\nI'm the one that actually failed,\nbecause I didn't configure it right.\n\n119\n00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.530\nSo, you could also use IP config to\nfigure out if that might be the problem.\n\n120\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.700\nSo let me go ahead and\nenable this as well.\n\n121\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.700\nAlright, so those are a couple of\nthings we need to be careful with.\n\n122\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.440\nA couple of other things that they call\nout, one of the things that they call out\n\n123\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.530\nis, well, cable placement,\nwhy can that cause an issue?\n\n124\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.330\nWell I want you to think\nabout wired connection.\n\n125\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.270\nTypically, when we're\nusing wired connections,\n\n126\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.890\nwe're gonna be using a copper-based\nmedia like ethernet.\n\n127\n00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.550\nI'm not telling you you couldn't\nbe using fiber, but usually,\n\n128\n00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.090\nyou save your fiber for\nyour backbone connections, right?\n\n129\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.430\nFor instance, in our server closet, we've\ngot a ten-gig fiber optic connection.\n\n130\n00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.910\nThat's not gonna be running to this\nmachine, I can tell you that, right?\n\n131\n00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.430\nThat's gonna be for\nthings like high bandwidth.\n\n132\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.025\n&gt;&gt; Not everyone can afford all that, yeah.\n\n133\n00:06:46.025 --> 00:06:46.525\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n\n134\n00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:49.040\nSo, when we talk about cable placement and\n\n135\n00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.140\nit being copper media,\ndon't run it near electricity, right?\n\n136\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.490\nDon't run it near things like high\nend intensity discharge lamps.\n\n137\n00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.035\nDon't run it across things\nlike fluorescent lights.\n\n138\n00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:00.770\nFluorescent lights cause\na problem as well.\n\n139\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.850\nOne of the things with fluorescent lights,\ngives you electromagnetic interference, so\n\n140\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.270\nthat could be a problem too.\n\n141\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nany kind of high-voltage machinery.\n\n142\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.420\nAir conditioning units, too,\nsometimes, elevator shafts.\n\n143\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n144\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.190\nThe other thing that they call out is,\nI can't communicate with my neighbors.\n\n145\n00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.630\nWhat do they specifically say?\n\n146\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.280\nDiscovering neighboring devices and nodes.\n\n147\n00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.870\nWell, inside a couple of\nthe protocols that you have,\n\n148\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.780\nyou have the ability that we can\ncommunicate with our nearest neighbors.\n\n149\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.490\nBut, if it's misconfigured,\nthis could cause a problem.\n\n150\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.730\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you here.\n\n151\n00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.030\nI'll show you a couple of technologies\nthat rely on things like, for\n\n152\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.090\ninstance, neighbor discovery messages,\nright?\n\n153\n00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.357\nWe have inside of, for instance,\nthis Windows 7 machine,\n\n154\n00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:47.703\nif I get down in here, and\ngo into the network and\n\n155\n00:07:47.703 --> 00:07:52.328\nsharing center, we look at the,\nthe advance sharing settings.\n\n156\n00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:54.500\nI can see things like network discovery,\nright?\n\n157\n00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.489\nAnd if it's turned off, well,\nwe have problems, right?\n\n158\n00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:02.357\nIf we turn off network discovery, then I\ncan't find other computers on the network,\n\n159\n00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.390\nand that can cause a problem.\n\n160\n00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.540\nBut it doesn't stop there, either.\n\n161\n00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.700\nWe have protocols, like for\ninstance, this one now,\n\n162\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.920\nkeep in mind that this is more vendor\nspecific, and I mean in a Windows machine.\n\n163\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.390\nIf I go to the adapter settings, we\nalso have additional communication types\n\n164\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.190\nthat if they're disabled might\nbe causing us problems, right?\n\n165\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.630\nI have, for instance,\nthis Link Layer Topology Discovery Mapper.\n\n166\n00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.380\nNotice what it says it does, right?\n\n167\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.030\nIt's used to discover and\nlocate other PCs.\n\n168\n00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.330\nWell, if I've got this turned off,\n\n169\n00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.240\nI might not be able to communicate\nto those nearest neighbors.\n\n170\n00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.550\nWe have other things, too, like the\nLink Layer Topology Discovery Responder.\n\n171\n00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.290\nNotice what it says.\n\n172\n00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.190\nIt allows this machine to be\ndiscovered and located on the network.\n\n173\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.410\nIf we don't have that turned on,\nthen we very well could have a problem.\n\n174\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.673\nLet me give you an example here,\nfor instance.\n\n175\n00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.860\nIf I go ahead, and\nI want to do something like, for\n\n176\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.410\ninstance, maybe create a home group,\nright?\n\n177\n00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.740\nI can go back into the Network and\nSharing Center, we can go into Home Group.\n\n178\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.720\nLet me change my network location\nbecause that could be it, too, and\n\n179\n00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.710\nwe'll get to that in a second.\n\n180\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.890\nThe firewall could be causing the problem.\n\n181\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.180\nAnd I choose Home Network, and\n\n182\n00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.470\nall of a sudden I have the ability,\nas you can see, to create a home group.\n\n183\n00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.210\nAnd it looks like I already got one.\n\n184\n00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.890\nI'll tell you what, let's go ahead and\nstart this all over here.\n\n185\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.485\nIf I can.\nLet me see if I can leave the ome group.\n\n186\n00:09:22.683 --> 00:09:25.726\nSo, let's go ahead, and what we're going\nto do is we're going to go ahead and\n\n187\n00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:26.520\nset up a home group.\n\n188\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.800\nSo we'll click Home Group.\n\n189\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.460\nAnd I kind of want to show\nyou how network discovery and\n\n190\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.520\nnot being able to find those\nneighbors might cause you problems.\n\n191\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.000\nSo let me go ahead and\nchange my network location here.\n\n192\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.820\nWe had somebody in the chatroom\nthat noticed rightfully so,\n\n193\n00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.940\nwell, wait a second here, you don't have\nthat set to a home or a private network,\n\n194\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.490\nit's not gonna work, and that's true here.\n\n195\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.610\nSo we'll go ahead and\nchange our network locations so\n\n196\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.760\nthat we can set up the home group.\n\n197\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.310\nAnd we'll give it a second, here.\n\n198\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.670\nAnd it's gonna apply the right\nprofile settings in the firewall, and\n\n199\n00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.650\nthen hopefully what we'll see\nis that we can get in here.\n\n200\n00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.180\nAnd sure enough,\nwe can create a home group.\n\n201\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.630\nSo, I'll go ahead and\nchoose Next, all right?\n\n202\n00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.340\nAnd again, don't worry about\nthe home group on the exam.\n\n203\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:11.490\nThe point here is to understand how if you\ncan't discover those network neighbors,\n\n204\n00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.860\nthat technologies like this don't work,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.370\nAnd they work on top of these\nprotocols that we're discussing here.\n\n206\n00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.710\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll finish the home group.\n\n207\n00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.500\nAnd what we want to do is we want to\nswitch over to our Windows 10 machine and\n\n208\n00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.498\nsee can it find that home group,\nall right?\n\n209\n00:10:26.498 --> 00:10:30.350\nSo, I'm gonna go ahead, and I'll bring\nup the Network and Sharing Center here,\n\n210\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.020\nas well.\n\n211\n00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.320\nWe'll choose Network and Sharing Center,\nand we're gonna go to home group.\n\n212\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.410\nNow I want you to see something here.\n\n213\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.620\nNotice that it says admin on\nWindows 7 has created a home group.\n\n214\n00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.340\nSo this is using that network discovery,\nright?\n\n215\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.030\nIt's using things like IPv6 that has\n\n216\n00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.360\nlink local multi-cast name\nresolution built into it.\n\n217\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.530\nThe link local address in IPv6 so\n\n218\n00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.600\nwe can communicate on the same\nlocal network, right?\n\n219\n00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.590\nAnd doing things like network discovery.\n\n220\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.520\nSo we can see this, all right?\n\n221\n00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.020\nNow what happens if I turn\noff network discovery?\n\n222\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.490\nWell, let's go ahead and\nfind out what will happen there.\n\n223\n00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.760\nSo we're gonna switch back over to our\nmachine, here with the home groups on.\n\n224\n00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.770\nAnd I'm gonna go into the Network and\nSharing Center, and\n\n225\n00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.870\nI'm gonna go into some of\nthe advanced sharing settings.\n\n226\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.560\nNotice network discovery is turned on,\nand we're gonna turn it off, all right?\n\n227\n00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.130\nNow, we'll save the change here.\n\n228\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.610\nNow I want you to notice something.\n\n229\n00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:33.140\nIf I switch back over to the Windows\nmachine, we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n230\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.240\nwe're gonna close this window down,\nand then we're gonna re-open it and\n\n231\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.840\nsee what we can find.\n\n232\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes, in a practical environment,\nwhy would we wanna turn network and\n\n233\n00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.420\nsharing off?\n\n234\n00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, not so much network and\n\n235\n00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.330\nsharing cuz that's the application\ninside of Windows.\n\n236\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.210\nBut network discovery-\n&gt;&gt; Discovery, excuse me, yes.\n\n237\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n238\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.920\nBecause for security purposes, this very\nwell could be something that's implemented\n\n239\n00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.520\nby your company that says\nturn off network discovery.\n\n240\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.730\nI don't want you knowing where\nall the nodes are on the network.\n\n241\n00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.520\nAnd more importantly, I certainly don't\nwant you then to know about them and\n\n242\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.040\nconnect to them.\n\n243\n00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.549\nSo this could be security purposes,\n\n244\n00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:04.745\nthat might be one of the reasons\nthat we turn this off.\n\n245\n00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:10.560\nAnd unfortunately, when we do, it could\nbreak other applications that rely on it.\n\n246\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.850\nSo I went ahead and closed it down.\n\n247\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.440\nLet's go ahead and reopen it, and\nlet's see if it can find that home group.\n\n248\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.790\nWell, that's interesting now, all right?\n\n249\n00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.170\nNotice that I turned\noff network discovery.\n\n250\n00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:23.760\n&gt;&gt; It's still there.\n\n251\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.620\n&gt;&gt; And, it's still there.\n\n252\n00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.720\nSo what's going on, here, all right?\n\n253\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.210\nLet me go ahead, now that\nNetwork Discovery is turned off, and\n\n254\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.120\nlet me show you what's going\non here underneath the hood.\n\n255\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.790\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna restart this machine, all right?\n\n256\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.190\nThat's really all I've done.\n\n257\n00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.670\nNotice I haven't changed any\nconfigurations on this machine at all.\n\n258\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.560\nAll I did is on the machine that\nis offering the home group,\n\n259\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.270\nI turned off network discovery.\n\n260\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.730\nIt's not calling out to the network and\nsaying, hey,\n\n261\n00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.640\nthis is where I'm at, all right?\n\n262\n00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.540\nAnd as this machine gets restarted,\nwe'll go ahead and get logged in.\n\n263\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.650\nAnd I wanna launch up\nthe home group again, and\n\n264\n00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.750\nlet's see what's going on here, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.650\nSo our machine's coming back online.\n\n266\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.030\nLet's go ahead and get logged in.\n\n267\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.335\nWe'll get logged in.\n\n268\n00:13:10.335 --> 00:13:12.950\nWe go back to the same spot, we're\ngonna go to Network and Sharing Center.\n\n269\n00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.240\n&gt;&gt; And you've just disabled that.\n\n270\n00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.780\n&gt;&gt; Only on the Windows seven machine,\nthat's right.\n\n271\n00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.780\nSo far, we haven't done anything\non my Windows 10 box here yet.\n\n272\n00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.050\nAnd I'll go head and\nchoose home group Well,\n\n273\n00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.110\nthat's funny,\nit didn't find it this time, all right?\n\n274\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.120\nWell, what is going on here?\n\n275\n00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.470\nWell, let's go ahead, and\nhere's something that I wanna do.\n\n276\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.280\nI'm gonna switch back\nover to our other machine\n\n277\n00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.140\nthat we turned off network discovery.\n\n278\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.040\nWe'll turn it back on.\n\n279\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.300\nWe'll see what's going on here, all right?\n\n280\n00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.640\nSo I turn network discovery back on,\nand sure enough,\n\n281\n00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:52.740\nbefore I can even switch back over to the\nmachine that is trying to find the home\n\n282\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.510\ngroup, moment I turn network discovery on,\nI can find it again, all right?\n\n283\n00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so what's going on here?\n\n284\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100\nI'm gonna do this one more time.\n\n285\n00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.020\nAnd follow along with me here so\nyou can follow my train of thought here.\n\n286\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.990\nI'm gonna go ahead one more time, and\nI'm gonna turn off network discovery.\n\n287\n00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.100\nAnd you remember before,\n\n288\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.810\nit didn't matter if I closed down\nmy window here on Windows 10.\n\n289\n00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.890\nAnd then turned around and\nbrought that same home group back up.\n\n290\n00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.740\nIt still finds it, all right?\n\n291\n00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.450\nAnd here's what's going on.\n\n292\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:28.040\nNetwork discovery is allowing the first\nparts of the neighbor solicitation\n\n293\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.350\nmessages, the neighbor advertisement\nmessages, to find these devices.\n\n294\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.700\nNetwork discovery, when it's turned on,\nsays go ahead IPv6, do your job.\n\n295\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.860\nDo what you're meant to do.\n\n296\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.350\nUse that link local address,\ncommunicate with those other devices,\n\n297\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.630\nand find out where this home group is.\n\n298\n00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.550\nSo when I turn off network discovery,\nlike you see right here,\n\n299\n00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.200\nall I'm doing is turning off\nthat initial communication.\n\n300\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:56.080\nBut if we go a little bit farther than\nthat, what happens if on this machine,\n\n301\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.810\nit's misconfigured, and\n\n302\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.880\nwhat I mean by that is we\nturn off the protocol itself.\n\n303\n00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.180\nIt's bound to the network adapter,\nbut what happens when I turn it off?\n\n304\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.720\nAnd we choose OK.\n\n305\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.672\nAnd now we'll bring up\nthat home group again.\n\n306\n00:15:14.672 --> 00:15:18.900\nNow notice it doesn't find it, all right?\n\n307\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.530\nAnd here's why.\n\n308\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.800\nIn this case,\nthe application that's running is\n\n309\n00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.310\nusing network discovery just to\nstart that first communication.\n\n310\n00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.028\nOnce that first little communication\nis gone, as long as IPv6 is on,\n\n311\n00:15:31.028 --> 00:15:33.619\nyou can turn network\ndiscovery off all you want.\n\n312\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.200\nYou turn off network discovery,\nand you turn off IPV6,\n\n313\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.850\nand now we can no longer discover\nthose local nodes like that.\n\n314\n00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.980\nSo that is something\nimportant to keep in mind.\n\n315\n00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.820\nRemember that it can cause a lot\nof problems on your network\n\n316\n00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.790\nwhen you rely on technologies\nlike this and it isn't happening.\n\n317\n00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.048\nIt is something to keep in mind\nthat can go on on your network.\n\n318\n00:15:56.048 --> 00:15:58.056\nSo that's some of the things\nthat you can see.\n\n319\n00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:01.825\nFor instance, in network,\nneighboring network, or excuse me.\n\n320\n00:16:01.825 --> 00:16:02.806\nI'm gonna get this right here.\n\n321\n00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:04.244\nNeighboring devices and nodes.\n\n322\n00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:08.932\nIf you can't discover them,\nmake sure that you have the protocols\n\n323\n00:16:08.932 --> 00:16:12.290\nturned on that use these\ntype of technologies.\n\n324\n00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.090\nHere's another one that you might have,\nneighboring devices might not be\n\n325\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.740\ndiscovered because you\nhave a firewall issue.\n\n326\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.080\nWell, let's go ahead, when I say\nfirewall issue, what do you mean?\n\n327\n00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.210\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at our firewall.\n\n328\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.120\nI've got an inbound rule and\none of the inside of my\n\n329\n00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.490\ninbound rules allowing\nthe communication into this machine.\n\n330\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.010\nIf I drill down to some of\nthe core networking services,\n\n331\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.220\nyou'll see that we have some interesting.\n\n332\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.740\nRemember I said IPv6 and\n\n333\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.300\nI said if I disable IPv6 it loses\nit's ability to even communicate.\n\n334\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.270\nWell, I want you to see why.\n\n335\n00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.670\nLook here at IPv6-in,\n\n336\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.290\nNeighbor Discovery Advertisement,\nNeighbor Discovery Solicitation.\n\n337\n00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.490\nIf you're blocking these in the firewall,\n\n338\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.740\nyou're not gonna discover the neighbors\nof the nodes that are next to you.\n\n339\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.150\nThere's other things too, like, for\n\n340\n00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.540\ninstance, I just happen to know that,\nbehind the scenes, Drop,\n\n341\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.750\nI almost said Dropbox, Home group,\nnot Dropbox, that's for another show.\n\n342\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.220\nHome group,\n\n343\n00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:14.330\nit also uses something known as the simple\nservice discovery protocol, right?\n\n344\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.117\nAnd if I scroll down in here I\nbelieve you're gonna notice, in here,\n\n345\n00:17:19.117 --> 00:17:20.521\nnetwork discovery.\n\n346\n00:17:20.521 --> 00:17:25.679\nThat in this case, the application,\nnetwork discovery,\n\n347\n00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:31.940\nyou can see actually relies on\nSimple Service Discovery Protocol.\n\n348\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.220\nThat could be the problem,\nit could be a firewall issue.\n\n349\n00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.440\nHow about other things too?\n\n350\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.700\nLike for instance,\nif you can't find those nodes.\n\n351\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:43.147\nMaybe the device that\nyou're on uses a service.\n\n352\n00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:47.401\nOr in this case, maybe it's like a Unix\nsystem it's using a demon or daemon,\n\n353\n00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.890\nhowever you'd like to say that.\n\n354\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.420\nBut I also have a service here that\nif I drill down into our services,\n\n355\n00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.510\nnotice that I have an SSDP Discovery,\nthat's Simple Service Discovery Protocol.\n\n356\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.940\nAnd if I select that\nnotice what it tells me,\n\n357\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:08.320\ndiscovers devices on\nthe network that use SSDP.\n\n358\n00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.013\nSo again, this is all forums and\n\n359\n00:18:10.013 --> 00:18:14.051\ndifferent technologies that communicate\noutbound to your nearest nodes.\n\n360\n00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:17.971\nAnd if that doesn't happen, you might have\nto have a service that that is shut off,\n\n361\n00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:21.163\nyou might have the application of\nthe technology that's shut off,\n\n362\n00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:23.583\nyou might have a firewall\nissue that is turned off.\n\n363\n00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:28.557\nSo keep that in mind, these are all\ntypes of things that can cause problems.\n\n364\n00:18:28.557 --> 00:18:31.840\nThere's other things that they call out,\ninterface errors.\n\n365\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.424\nNow with an interface error sometimes\nthese are hard to tell especially when\n\n366\n00:18:35.424 --> 00:18:38.168\nyour using things like\ntransmission control protocol but\n\n367\n00:18:38.168 --> 00:18:41.763\nthere are a couple of things that we can\nuse if you will for interface errors.\n\n368\n00:18:41.763 --> 00:18:46.334\nLike for instance, if I fire up\nmy command prompt for PowerShell.\n\n369\n00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:53.020\nAnd we use things like netSTAT,\nand we do a -e.\n\n370\n00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.410\nI can find out the protocol or\nthe packets that have been sent.\n\n371\n00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.930\nAnd notice that I have this error option,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.820\nNow well I'm not really getting errors,\nright?\n\n373\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.420\n&gt;&gt; Zero.\n\n374\n00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.760\n&gt;&gt; Zero errors, so that's a good thing.\n\n375\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.492\n&gt;&gt; That is a good thing [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; But if you are getting errors,\n\n376\n00:19:06.492 --> 00:19:09.620\nyou might have cable placement\nthat's causing the problem, right?\n\n377\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.200\nYou might have\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n378\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.635\nYou might have a break in the cables\ncausing intermittent issues.\n\n379\n00:19:14.635 --> 00:19:17.245\nNow that might be something that you\nhave to go a little bit farther,\n\n380\n00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:19.575\nit might be one of those\nintermittent things.\n\n381\n00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.875\nSo we might have to do things like, for\ninstance, we can do launch up like for\n\n382\n00:19:23.875 --> 00:19:27.135\ninstance, perfmon, or\nthe performance monitor.\n\n383\n00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:29.765\nAnd when I run performance monitor,\nI could come in here and\n\n384\n00:19:29.765 --> 00:19:35.645\nI can develop a test that is specific\nto errors, to try to find those errors.\n\n385\n00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:40.720\nLike for instance, we could add\ncriteria like maybe the network adapter\n\n386\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.680\nhere if I can find it alphabetically.\n\n387\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:46.960\nLet's see here, there we go.\n\n388\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.460\nThings like packet outbound errors right?\n\n389\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.290\nI believe they've got an inbound\nerror received error.\n\n390\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:53.870\nThat's what.\nSo\n\n391\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.420\nI could add this as something\nthat I want to monitor.\n\n392\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.968\nI can add these, oops.\n\n393\n00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:04.720\nWe choose OK, and\nnow if I'm monitoring this for\n\n394\n00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.930\na little while, and you can see I'm not.\n\n395\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.760\nI'm not really getting any errors, and\nwe can also tell that from netSTAT.\n\n396\n00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.986\nSo there are ways that you\ncan monitor the errors,\n\n397\n00:20:10.986 --> 00:20:13.440\nit really just depends\nif you're having them.\n\n398\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.380\nIf you're having them, that's some\nof the locations that you could\n\n399\n00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.670\nuse in order to test your theory.\n\n400\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.419\nRemember your network trouble-shooting\nmodel to test the theory.\n\n401\n00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.745\nAll right Ms Cherokee, let's see here.\n\n402\n00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:29.605\nWe are coming close to the end.\n\n403\n00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:31.465\nI do have a couple other things\nthat I want to talk about.\n\n404\n00:20:31.465 --> 00:20:33.315\nPower failure and power anomalies right?\n\n405\n00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:37.345\nThat's one of the reasons we implement\nredundancy in our power UPS's right?\n\n406\n00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:38.685\nGraceful shut downs on our machine.\n\n407\n00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:41.225\nPower anomalies, it's all different kinds.\n\n408\n00:20:41.225 --> 00:20:44.475\nSpike surges, brown outs,\nblack outs if you will.\n\n409\n00:20:44.475 --> 00:20:49.860\nYou can get things like event voltage or\n\n410\n00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.190\nvoltage of event recorders and\nsuch, so that you can track time.\n\n411\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.420\nIf you're in a SCADA system, they have\nthings like remote telemetry units that\n\n412\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.315\ntell you, and can monitor your power and\nthe condition of the power.\n\n413\n00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:03.795\nKeep in mind that you typically\nwant some kind of UPS system.\n\n414\n00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:08.275\nIf you're a bigger system, you might have\nthings like, for instance, multiple grids.\n\n415\n00:21:08.275 --> 00:21:11.065\nBut power anomalies and\npower issues can happen.\n\n416\n00:21:12.175 --> 00:21:15.815\nThe other thing that they call out is MTU,\nMTU black hole.\n\n417\n00:21:15.815 --> 00:21:18.305\nWhen we talk about that,\nthat's maximum transmission unit.\n\n418\n00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:21.460\nAnd that is something that it can happen,\nit doesn't happen a lot.\n\n419\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:26.327\nCuz this is a switching issue and\nwhen your computer first communicates what\n\n420\n00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:31.193\nit does is it sends a little bit of\ninformation from you operating system into\n\n421\n00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:35.547\nthe switch and it discovers what\nthe maximum transmission unit is.\n\n422\n00:21:35.547 --> 00:21:37.551\nAnd typically, it's 1500 bytes and\n\n423\n00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:40.940\nthat really isn't something that I\nset on the operating system side.\n\n424\n00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.250\nThat's really something that is going\nto be set by the operating system.\n\n425\n00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:52.180\nSo, if it happens you might be potentially\nsending information more than the MTU and\n\n426\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.960\na packet gets discarded, or\na frame gets discarded, but\n\n427\n00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.280\nagain a lot of times it doesn't happen.\n\n428\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.260\nBecause the communication even if you\ntalk about routers communicating to\n\n429\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.310\ntheir nearest default gateway\nthey know what the MDU is.\n\n430\n00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.080\nThe other thing that can happen\nis a speed and duplex mismatch.\n\n431\n00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.220\nNow that could be possible too.\n\n432\n00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.860\nAnd a lot of times this doesn't happen\nbecause again when your computer or\n\n433\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.500\nyour operating system comes\nonline it talks to the switch and\n\n434\n00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.870\nit says this is what's going on.\n\n435\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.997\nThis is the speed we're running,\nwe are running 100 megs,\n\n436\n00:22:22.997 --> 00:22:25.961\nwe are running a gig,\nwe are running 10 gig if it happens.\n\n437\n00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:30.059\nI doubt you could have a 10 gig network\nconnection from your computer to your\n\n438\n00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:32.280\nswitch, if you do you have a lot of money.\n\n439\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.433\nIt doesn't happen a lot, but\n\n440\n00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:37.739\nthere is sometimes where that\nnegotiation doesn't happen.\n\n441\n00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:39.334\nAnd let me show you what you can do,\n\n442\n00:22:39.334 --> 00:22:42.240\nat least on the client\nside In order to fix that.\n\n443\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.180\nIf we drop down to my machine here,\nI can get in the Device Manager and\n\n444\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.050\nyou can get a little bit more advanced\nwhen it comes to the configurations of\n\n445\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.250\nyour network adapters.\n\n446\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.000\nSo for instance,\nI could open up my network adapter and\n\n447\n00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.090\nwe could pull up the properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n448\n00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.730\nAnd I have this Advanced tab for\ninstance right here.\n\n449\n00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.446\nIf I look at the Advanced tab,\n\n450\n00:23:02.446 --> 00:23:05.612\nwe got all kinds of things\nthat we can set here, right?\n\n451\n00:23:05.612 --> 00:23:08.492\nVLAN information, packet priority and\nVLAN information,\n\n452\n00:23:08.492 --> 00:23:11.660\nif that's misconfigured you might\nhave problems with your VLAN.\n\n453\n00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.580\nBut what I am really looking for\nis speed and duplex.\n\n454\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.009\nAnd speed and duplex, you can see,\nis typically auto-negotiated today.\n\n455\n00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:23.400\nBut there could be some time,\nmaybe somebody got click happy in here,\n\n456\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.650\ncame in here and set this wrong and\nnow it's static.\n\n457\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.510\nAnd now you're not communicating\nlike you think you should be.\n\n458\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.651\nIf you're operating in half duplex when\nyou should be operating in full duplex\n\n459\n00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:34.795\nyour communications are gonna happen.\n\n460\n00:23:34.795 --> 00:23:35.629\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna see performance issues.\n\n461\n00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:36.930\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n462\n00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.533\nyour communications are gonna happen, but\n\n463\n00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:41.530\nyou might be on dial up speeds before you\nknow it and it could cripple you network.\n\n464\n00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.370\nSo, those are things that can happen too.\n\n465\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:47.750\nLet's see, other things that they talk\nabout, NIC teaming, misconfiguration,\n\n466\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:53.080\nthis is link aggregation when you can do\na couple different types of NIC teaming.\n\n467\n00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.950\nSo for instance,\nyou could be doing things like active.\n\n468\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:59.612\nActive which means two network adapters or\nboth kind of load balancing,\n\n469\n00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:03.347\nnot really load balancing but\nactually link aggregation for more speed.\n\n470\n00:24:03.347 --> 00:24:08.774\nIf I've got a gigabit network adapter,\nI've got another gigabit network adapter,\n\n471\n00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:11.650\nwe link them together and\nthen what happens?\n\n472\n00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.626\nWe get two gigabit connection.\n\n473\n00:24:13.626 --> 00:24:17.431\nBut if you're supposed to have it in\nan active, passive where it is for\n\n474\n00:24:17.431 --> 00:24:21.301\nthe purposes of redundancy where\nonly one network adapter is working,\n\n475\n00:24:21.301 --> 00:24:25.900\nwhen it fails, it moves over to\nthe passive one that now becomes active.\n\n476\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.840\nIf you misconfigure these, right,\nyou're supposed to be running active,\n\n477\n00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.437\nactive and you have it active, passive.\n\n478\n00:24:30.437 --> 00:24:32.930\nThat could cause problems.\n\n479\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.310\nIf you have it, the other way around\nthat could cause problems so watch your,\n\n480\n00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.260\nnic teaming configuration issues, right?\n\n481\n00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.740\nThe other thing that could cause problems\ntoo is multicast communications, right,\n\n482\n00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.540\nwhen you have two, network adapters and\n\n483\n00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.289\nwhen a network adapter gives\nout a multicast communication.\n\n484\n00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.290\nWhich network adapter does\nthe end point respond back to?\n\n485\n00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.360\nThis can cause problems.\n\n486\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.490\nBroadcast communications.\n\n487\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.370\nWill the network adapter\nbroadcast communications?\n\n488\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:01.980\nWhich one's gonna get answered?\n\n489\n00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.210\nIf your Nic Teaming configuration\nisn't set right, and,\n\n490\n00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.860\nfor instance like the link\naggregation control protocol, LACP.\n\n491\n00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.386\nThis could be causing problems as well,\nso you do have to keep that in mind.\n\n492\n00:25:14.386 --> 00:25:18.953\nOne of the last things that I'll mention\nhere, is that they talk about missing\n\n493\n00:25:18.953 --> 00:25:22.618\nIP Routes, and I can honestly\nsay that with missing IP Routes,\n\n494\n00:25:22.618 --> 00:25:25.750\nthere's all kinds of things\nthat could happen here.\n\n495\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.790\nSome of the things that could happen,\nright?\n\n496\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.530\nWell first of all, you could have\na statically mapped route, and\n\n497\n00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.360\nif you statically map a route.\n\n498\n00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.060\nYour dynamic routing protocols\nwill not try to update that route.\n\n499\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.110\nAnd if you misconfigured it,\nyou have a missing route.\n\n500\n00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.070\nYou might have a route in\nyour configuration but\n\n501\n00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.910\nit's not the one that you want.\n\n502\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:45.440\nThe other thing that can happen\ntoo are convergence issues.\n\n503\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.640\nIt takes a little bit for\nthe network to converge and\n\n504\n00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.650\nif there's an update in a routing table,\nrouter 1 is aware of that route.\n\n505\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.329\nBut it hasn't propagated\nthrough the other routers.\n\n506\n00:25:55.329 --> 00:25:58.980\nIt's a missing route,\nit's just being convergence latency,\n\n507\n00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.830\nif I can say that right.\n\n508\n00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.410\nIt's one of the reasons we use things\nlike link state routing protocols, right?\n\n509\n00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.320\nBecause they converge quickly.\n\n510\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.460\nWhat else, too?\n\n511\n00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.900\nRouting protocol mismatch.\n\n512\n00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.690\nWe talked about implementing\nroute redistribution.\n\n513\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.050\nIf I'm running OSPF and I'm running VGP,\nthey're not communicating.\n\n514\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.700\nThey don't talk the same language.\n\n515\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.720\nSo you have to tell each side what they\nshould expect for their metrics, so\n\n516\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.470\nthat they can share information.\n\n517\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.850\nThat might be the problem.\n\n518\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.770\nThe other thing could be something and,\nin fact, let me give you a simple scenario\n\n519\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:31.840\nwhere you can have a missing\nroute in your routing table.\n\n520\n00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.635\nLet's go ahead and\ndrop back down to my Windows 10 machine.\n\n521\n00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:39.133\nAnd the first thing that we're gonna do\nis we're gonna use good old ipconfig to\n\n522\n00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:41.470\ndetermine what the IP\nconfiguration is currently.\n\n523\n00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.308\nSo we'll go ahead and do ipconfig.\n\n524\n00:26:45.308 --> 00:26:49.180\nIf I can spell ipconfig,\nwe'll be doing good and all.\n\n525\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.080\nAll right,\nnow I want you to notice something.\n\n526\n00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.960\nI don't have a default gateway, all right.\n\n527\n00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.700\nWell that's a problem, all right so\nlet's go ahead very first and\n\n528\n00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.970\nlet's set a default gateway.\n\n529\n00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.020\nAll right, so\nI'm gonna change the adapter, or\n\n530\n00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.530\nproperty TCBI properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n531\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.470\nAnd I'm gonna choose IPv4 and\nwe'll choose Properties.\n\n532\n00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.590\nNow I don't really have a Default Gateway,\nbut\n\n533\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.530\nthis computer's not gonna be any wiser.\n\n534\n00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.260\nAll right, so\nwe'll let that go ahead and run.\n\n535\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.450\nAnd we'll rerun our ipconfig/all.\n\n536\n00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.676\nAnd Cherokee, do you see a Default Gateway\nnow, just to make sure.?\n\n537\n00:27:25.676 --> 00:27:26.670\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n538\n00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.930\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe've got a Default Gateway.\n\n539\n00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.947\nAnd that's what we want, all right.\n\n540\n00:27:30.947 --> 00:27:34.360\nNow, I wanna see the local routing table.\n\n541\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.830\nAnd inside of Windows, for\ninstance, you can do a route print.\n\n542\n00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.300\nAnd if you do route print by itself,\nit's gonna give you everything.\n\n543\n00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.220\nIt's gonna give you IPV4 and IPV6,\n\n544\n00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.490\nincluding things like letting you\nknow what your persistent routes are.\n\n545\n00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:49.660\nI wanna make this a little bit easier.\n\n546\n00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.632\nCuz for this example,\nI only care about IPv4.\n\n547\n00:27:52.632 --> 00:27:54.417\nAnd I want you to know, notice this route.\n\n548\n00:27:54.417 --> 00:27:56.842\n0.0.0.0, all right?\n\n549\n00:27:56.842 --> 00:28:00.644\nWhat your computer's doing, is it's gonna\nlook at all of these local routes, and\n\n550\n00:28:00.644 --> 00:28:03.420\nsay these are the routes\nthat I'm aware of.\n\n551\n00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.700\nI'm aware of the loop back network.\n\n552\n00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.710\nI'm aware of what my local network is.\n\n553\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.808\nI'm aware of what my local\nbroadcast is on that subnet.\n\n554\n00:28:09.808 --> 00:28:15.200\nI'm aware of things like\nmulticast addresses or networks.\n\n555\n00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:22.060\nIt says that if I can't find where to\nsend the traffic in this routing table,\n\n556\n00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.840\nit uses the route of last resort.\n\n557\n00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.935\nAnd in this case,\n\n558\n00:28:24.935 --> 00:28:28.960\nyou'll see that the route of last\nresort is the default gateway.\n\n559\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.180\nAnd that's what happens with\nlocal communication, right?\n\n560\n00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.940\nOur computers can use ARP and they can\ndeliver traffic locally on the network.\n\n561\n00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.850\nThey don't need a default gateway.\n\n562\n00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.920\nBut on a remote network, they don't know,\n\n563\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.690\nwhere that remote network is so they\nlook at the packet and the destination,\n\n564\n00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:47.310\nand they say,\nit doesn't match any of these routes.\n\n565\n00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.890\nLet me go ahead and\nsend it to the default gateway.\n\n566\n00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:54.213\nLook what happens if I go back into\nthe properties of the network adapter.\n\n567\n00:28:57.319 --> 00:29:04.760\nAll right, and we change that adapter\nsetting, which is properties.\n\n568\n00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.010\nAnd we're gonna remove that\ndefault gateway, which is okay.\n\n569\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.360\nWe'll go ahead and close all these, down\nhere, and we'll go and clear that screen.\n\n570\n00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.450\nAnd let's run our route print again.\n\n571\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.790\nAnd notice that I no longer\nhave thar route, it's missing.\n\n572\n00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.380\nSo that's a simple issue\nwhere if the route's missing\n\n573\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.760\nI can't send information\nto the default gateway now.\n\n574\n00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.700\nRoute's not there,\n\n575\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.750\nI can't route traffic and the computer\nisn't actually routing the traffic but\n\n576\n00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:43.970\nI can't send it to the device that does\nroute that traffic off of my network.\n\n577\n00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.090\nSo when it comes to missing IP route,\n\n578\n00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:50.235\nthat's a simple example of when that\nroute isn't in the routing table,\n\n579\n00:29:50.235 --> 00:29:53.070\nit's not aware of it, and\nit won't be able to deliver the traffic.\n\n580\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.210\nAll right, let me just double check here,\nI think we might have got it all.\n\n581\n00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.755\n&gt;&gt; I know, I'm looking at this list and\nit looks pretty well covered here, so\n\n582\n00:30:02.755 --> 00:30:03.720\nthat's it.\n\n583\n00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.890\nWe didn't make it to a part 3,\nbut thank you so much for\n\n584\n00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.860\ntaking the time to really go through\nevery one of those details, there.\n\n585\n00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.220\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for joining us.\n\n586\n00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.320\nBut stay tuned,\nwe do have more Network+headed your way.\n\n587\n00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.860\nFor this show we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n588\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.190\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n589\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n590\n00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.331\n&gt;&gt; See you here next time at ITProTV\n\n591\n00:30:21.331 -->

00:00:12.103\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:14.898\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:20.140\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CompTIA Network+.\n\n6\n00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.915\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look at ways to resolve some common\n\n7\n00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:24.852\nsecurity issues.\n\n8\n00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:27.714\nAnd here to help us walk us through\nthe process is none other than\n\n9\n00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:28.578\nMister Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.070\nWelcome back Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.440\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back Mike.\n\n12\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.420\nAlways a pleasure to be here with ITproTV.\n\n13\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.240\nThat is right.\n\n14\n00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.197\nWe are going to be looking at, well like\nMike said some comments security issues.\n\n15\n00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:41.563\nAnd we've got a list here of objectives\nthat we're gonna go through and\n\n16\n00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.480\nwe're gonna kinda talk about each one.\n\n17\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.440\nHopefully, we're talking to you.\n\n18\n00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.080\nWe're gonna talk about each one and\n\n19\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.250\nhopefully we can give you some\ndemonstrations on here too,\n\n20\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.050\nso there won't be too much talk and\nnot enough action, if you will.\n\n21\n00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.100\nSo, let's go ahead and\nwe'll dive right in.\n\n22\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.200\nOne of the first things\nthat they call out are ooh,\n\n23\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.790\nthis one's kind of an obvious one.\n\n24\n00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.320\nMike, I know that we've talked about\nthis one on many occasions and\n\n25\n00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.150\nthis is a misconfigured firewall.\n\n26\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.860\nNow, firewalls can be misconfigured\nin many different ways and\n\n27\n00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.670\nthat doesn't necessarily mean one\nof the ones that comes to mind.\n\n28\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.040\nI'm gonna throw Mike a question here,\none of our security gurus.\n\n29\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.260\nMike, an application won't connect.\n\n30\n00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.890\nWhat's the first thing users typically\ntell you to do to troubleshoot it?\n\n31\n00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.100\n&gt;&gt; Reboot your system.\n\n32\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.814\n&gt;&gt; There we go, right?\n\n33\n00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.043\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, how about turning off\n\n34\n00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:20.998\nthe firewall, right?\n\n35\n00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:22.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we don't have any communications,\n\n36\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.420\njust turn the firewall off.\n\n37\n00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.910\nAnd hey, look that fixed everything.\n\n38\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.820\n&gt;&gt; It does, it works.\n&gt;&gt; Well, in your defense,\n\n39\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.540\nreboots do fix everything too, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Apparently even commercial jetliners at\n\n41\n00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.330\nsome point as well.\n\n42\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But I digress.\n\n43\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.152\nNow, so when we say misconfigure firewall\nit doesn't necessarily have to be one of\n\n44\n00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.723\nthe obvious ones,\nwe're joking around here.\n\n45\n00:01:42.723 --> 00:01:47.016\nBut, sometimes you will hear people that\nwill give you that piece of advice that\n\n46\n00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:50.240\nsays, I just disabled the firewall\nnow everything works.\n\n47\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.370\nWell, that's great but now you've\nbasically just opened the front door and\n\n48\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.030\nyou left your house and you just said,\nI don't care who comes in and\n\n49\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.090\ncomes out potentially.\n\n50\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.630\nSo that obviously,\nis a misconfiguration of the firewall, but\n\n51\n00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.420\nI would say that's more\nlazy than anything else.\n\n52\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.150\nBut, let's go to the other side\nof the fence on that one too.\n\n53\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.380\nIn basic security concepts,\nwe talked about confidentiality,\n\n54\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.080\nintegrity and availability.\n\n55\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.030\nWell, sometimes we forget about\nthe availability part, right?\n\n56\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.090\nYou can go the opposite side and\nbe too strict.\n\n57\n00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.230\nYou can say, well,\nI'm just gonna block everything.\n\n58\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.310\nAnd by default, inbound traffic,\nthat's usually what a firewall does, but\n\n59\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.400\nsometimes you need to\ncommunicate outbound as well.\n\n60\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.030\nAnd if you block everything,\nwell, what's happening here?\n\n61\n00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.410\nSo, we wanna make sure that we do\nhave our firewalls configure, right.\n\n62\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.070\nAnd the way you configure your firewall\nmight not be the way I configure my\n\n63\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.110\nfirewall, right?\n\n64\n00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.080\nOn Mike's home network, maybe he's got\nsome media streaming server that he uses,\n\n65\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.580\nand he needs a certain kind\nof rule to be opened up.\n\n66\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.290\nBut, I don't have a media streaming\nserver on my network, right?\n\n67\n00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.350\nSo, that rule wouldn't be applicable for\nmy network.\n\n68\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.870\nSo, when we say Configured,\nyou really have to analyze your network,\n\n69\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.420\nsee what kind of services maybe you have\nrunning, what kind of applications, and\n\n70\n00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.700\nreally isolate it down to exactly how\nyou should configure your firewall.\n\n71\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.740\nAnd don't do the obvious thing that,\nit's an obvious mistake for some, but\n\n72\n00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.080\nit's not always to everybody.\n\n73\n00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.130\nWhen they say disable the firewall, right?\n\n74\n00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nyou've got what, 65,535 ports and\n\n75\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280\napplications using a few of those ports\nmaybe, so sure, turning off the firewall\n\n76\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.600\nlets that application work, but it lets\na lot of other things work as well.\n\n77\n00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.310\nSo, always better being specific, figuring\nout what ports that application actually\n\n78\n00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.670\nneeds and only allowing those ports.\n\n79\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.820\nAnd even better, only allowing that\napplication to use those ports and\n\n80\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.520\nnot anything else.\n\n81\n00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.140\nSo, definitely worth looking into.\n\n82\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.453\n&gt;&gt; Sure, one of the things that they call\nout that could almost being the same thing\n\n83\n00:03:38.453 --> 00:03:40.694\nas a firewall,\nthey talk about misconfigured ACLs.\n\n84\n00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:43.580\nNow, ACLs can be in many\ndifferent locations.\n\n85\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.150\nI mean they can be ACLs in switches that\nallow network communication to go from one\n\n86\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.720\nnetwork to the other network.\n\n87\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.400\nAnd maybe isolate that communication, too.\n\n88\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.340\nBut, they can also be something as\nsimple as a permissions ACL within\n\n89\n00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.360\nWindows, right?\n\n90\n00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.340\nJust give everyone access.\n\n91\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.270\nGive everyone full control, all right?\n\n92\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.330\nNow, I don't have a connection issue,\nbecause what did I do?\n\n93\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.260\nI opened it up for everybody.\n\n94\n00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.960\nBut the problem is, in that ACL, there's\nalso something called the everyone group.\n\n95\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.090\nWell, the everyone group also includes\nthe guest users, and the guest users,\n\n96\n00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.670\na lot of times don't have to authenticate\nif you've enabled accounts like that.\n\n97\n00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.110\nSo, that can also be a problem, right?\n\n98\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n99\n00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.220\nIt kinda goes back to what you're saying\nabout the firewalls, and the lazy admin.\n\n100\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.260\nIt's easy to just say, hey,\nthis person don't have access.\n\n101\n00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.740\nLet me just give everyone access,\nthinking everybody needs access to it.\n\n102\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.570\nAt least,\n\n103\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.380\nif you are in a domain environment,\nuse your Authenticated Users group.\n\n104\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.620\nThat'll give everybody that actually\nhas an account in your domain\n\n105\n00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.480\naccess to a file.\n\n106\n00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.970\nRemember, the everyone group is,\nyeah, everybody, and\n\n107\n00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.910\npeople that really shouldn't be there.\n\n108\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.405\nSo, try to avoid that one if you can.\n\n109\n00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.515\nSometimes you have to,\npublic resources I am sure.\n\n110\n00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:47.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely.\n\n111\n00:04:47.555 --> 00:04:50.405\nNow, they also call out additional\nthings again that are just obvious,\n\n112\n00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:51.625\nright, malware.\n\n113\n00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.198\nA malware is going to be a problem, right,\n\n114\n00:04:53.198 --> 00:04:55.537\nthat's why we want to run things\nlike our antivirus software.\n\n115\n00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:59.700\nWe wanna make sure that it implements\nreal time protection, right?\n\n116\n00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.230\nHaving any virus software on your computer\nand then turning it off because it's doing\n\n117\n00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.550\nits job is not the proper way\nto configure your any virus.\n\n118\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.330\nThe other thing you have to worry to\nin any virus is that it doesn't, and\n\n119\n00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.810\nin this configuration, it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that it's turned off.\n\n120\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.890\nFor instance, when you have signature\nbased definitions or you're doing\n\n121\n00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.430\nsignature based recognition well those\ndefinitions have to be up to date.\n\n122\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.470\nAnd maybe you're one that says\nI just don't get any viruses.\n\n123\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.990\nI'm okay I don't ever\nsee anything wrong so.\n\n124\n00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.840\nYou don't allow it to update.\n\n125\n00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.430\nWell now, you could be trying to identify\nviruses on a definition database that\n\n126\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.470\ncould have been six months old, right?\n\n127\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.680\nAnd we've talked extensively.\n\n128\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.385\nMike I know you've also taught many\ncourses on this where If your computer, or\n\n129\n00:05:42.385 --> 00:05:44.026\nyour antivirus software,\n\n130\n00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:48.614\ndoesn't know what the definition of\na virus is because it doesn't have it.\n\n131\n00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.088\nIt doesn't know how to define it,\nthen it's going to pass through,\n\n132\n00:05:51.088 --> 00:05:53.300\nand it's going to look\nlike everything's safe.\n\n133\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.600\nSo firewalls can, not firewalls,\nbut malware is always a problem.\n\n134\n00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.490\nAnd it typically lends itself to things on\nhow we configure our antivirus platforms.\n\n135\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I used to say,\nrunning an out-of-date antivirus Virus\n\n136\n00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.680\nsoftware is about like\nrunning no software at all.\n\n137\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.411\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n138\n00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:06.974\n&gt;&gt; Honestly.\n\n139\n00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:07.913\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n140\n00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:11.351\nSome protection is better\nthen no protection at all.\n\n141\n00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:12.538\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is right.\n\n142\n00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:15.676\nHere's another one.\nThis one really can get us into many,\n\n143\n00:06:15.676 --> 00:06:17.493\nmany problems, right?\n\n144\n00:06:17.493 --> 00:06:18.647\nOpen and closed ports.\n\n145\n00:06:18.647 --> 00:06:20.690\nWhat's so big about an open port?\n\n146\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.791\n&gt;&gt; Right,\none thing is people can take advantage of\n\n147\n00:06:24.791 --> 00:06:28.000\nthe service that is a port if you will.\n\n148\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.142\nWhen you open a port up that means there's\na service typically listening on the other\n\n149\n00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:34.610\nside of that port for\nan incoming communication.\n\n150\n00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.590\nLet's just take it back to our\nA plus days when we first, and\n\n151\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.510\neven here in network plus, we've talked\nabout the client server model, all right?\n\n152\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.550\nI don't care what\nthe physical hardware is,\n\n153\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.240\nif a you got a device on network that\nsending out a request for a service.\n\n154\n00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.580\nAnd a device that is listening for\nthat service.\n\n155\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.390\nYou are the client server model, right?\n\n156\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.630\nSo, don't pay attention to\nthe physical device itself.\n\n157\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.490\nAnd in here servers what they do\nis they listen beyond those ports.\n\n158\n00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.240\nIf I have too many ports opened and\n\n159\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.922\nI'm not using those services, they become\nan increased attack surface, right?\n\n160\n00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:04.960\nAnd Attack Vector.\n\n161\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.500\nAnd that's a point of\nentry into our systems.\n\n162\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.760\nBut even more so then that,\n\n163\n00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.970\nopen ports can also tell us a lot of\ninformation about a specific system.\n\n164\n00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.770\nRight, if I know that a certain\nport is open on a machine, or\n\n165\n00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.298\nmaybe a series of certain\nports are open on a machine.\n\n166\n00:07:19.298 --> 00:07:25.840\nI can almost tell what that, the role\nof that device is within your network.\n\n167\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.875\nSo, we definitely have to\nworry about that, too.\n\n168\n00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:31.050\nNow, there are other things\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n169\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.590\nWe have to worry about things like,\nfor instance, ICMP.\n\n170\n00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.380\nAll right, ICMP is a great protocol\nInternet control message protocol,\n\n171\n00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.510\nif I get that acronym right.\n\n172\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.811\nAnd, its responsibility is to\ncontrol things like congestion.\n\n173\n00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:48.024\nIf I'm sending information too\nfast into Mike's computer and\n\n174\n00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:51.672\nI don't mean maliciously,\nI mean I'm sending him a document rather.\n\n175\n00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:55.529\nAnd, his computer, the buffer in his\nnetwork adapter, is having a little bit of\n\n176\n00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:59.163\ntime chewing Processing that information,\nwell then what he's gonna fire\n\n177\n00:07:59.163 --> 00:08:03.550\na signal back to my computer over ICMP\nthat says, hold on a second, slow down.\n\n178\n00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.490\nIf you don't slow down,\nI'm gonna start dropping packets, right?\n\n179\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.460\nAnd that's a problem, right?\n\n180\n00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.970\nWe want communications\nto be evenly processed.\n\n181\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.300\nBut there's another thing too.\n\n182\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.160\nWith those controlled messages,\n\n183\n00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.580\nyou can send too many of them to a device\nfor the purposes of taking it offline.\n\n184\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.420\nRight, I can send, for instance, hundreds,\nthousands, hundreds of thousands of ICMP\n\n185\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.390\necho requests to your machine, with the\nintent of trying to overwhelm the buffer.\n\n186\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.900\nWhy?\n\n187\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.850\nBecause if I can bog your network\nadapter down, then somebody else,\n\n188\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.230\nMike's trying to get that service that\nhe should legitimately have access to,\n\n189\n00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.310\nhe no longer has access to, cuz it's\ntrying to respond to me, and it can't.\n\n190\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.540\nThey mention things in here\nlike ping of death, right?\n\n191\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.392\nNow The ping of death, it can happen, but\n\n192\n00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.680\n[LAUGH] one thing about\nthe ping of death is,\n\n193\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.560\nyou always have to exceed the bandwidth\nof the device that you're attacking.\n\n194\n00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.150\nSo, they're very strategic in\nthe way they can do these,\n\n195\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.570\nby grouping a whole massive\namount of computers together, and\n\n196\n00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.840\nfiring it off against a single computer\nThen, it eventually takes it offline.\n\n197\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.130\nOther things they call out and this one's\ninteresting is an unreachable gateway.\n\n198\n00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:08.809\nWith the unreachable gateway, that\njust means you're not gonna be able to\n\n199\n00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:10.350\nsend communications off of your network.\n\n200\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.000\nIt can be considered kind of like a ping\nof death in the fact that it's a denial of\n\n201\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.460\nservice attack, if whatever\nresource that you're looking for,\n\n202\n00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.350\nincluding the internet,\nis on the other side of that network.\n\n203\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.680\nSo those can also be some issues\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n204\n00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.630\nOther things that we have,\nunpatched firmware, right?\n\n205\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.670\nUnpatched firmware,\n\n206\n00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.990\nwe know that firmware a lot of times when\nwe update it does a few things for us,\n\n207\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.422\na lot of times it increases functionality\nor gives us additional functionality maybe\n\n208\n00:09:35.422 --> 00:09:41.240\nhelps to patch known vulnerabilities,\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n209\n00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.880\nAnd we if we leave those unpatched, that\nmeans that there are still exploits and\n\n210\n00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.180\nsystems that people can eventually\ntake advantage of, right?\n\n211\n00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.760\nSo we have to worry about that.\n\n212\n00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.377\nWe have to make sure that our\noperating systems are up to date.\n\n213\n00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:54.830\nIn fact, let me give you\nan example of one right here.\n\n214\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.780\nI've got a Server 2016 Box, and with this\n2016 Box, if I go to my action center,\n\n215\n00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.120\nI'm gonna notice right away it tells me,\nyou need some updates.\n\n216\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.510\nSo, what are those updates that I need?\n\n217\n00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.090\nWell I don't know, but\nif I don't check, I'll never know, and\n\n218\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.326\nI can tell you the sun\nnever sets on hackers.\n\n219\n00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:15.530\nMaybe sometimes it you know and\nwhen it does they go to work so\n\n220\n00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.690\nyou have to be careful with that.\n\n221\n00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.960\nSo I can go in here.\n\n222\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.074\nSo just very simply I can go into\nhere something like that's the action\n\n223\n00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:23.320\ncenter here.\n\n224\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.650\nGo to Update and Security, and\nI can look at Windows Update.\n\n225\n00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.060\nI can also see, well,\n\n226\n00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.590\nthere are some here that kinda look\nlike they have security in mind, right?\n\n227\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.270\nRMRT.\n\n228\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.830\nNow I'm not too worried about this one cuz\nit's a program that tries to find viruses\n\n229\n00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.090\nafter the fact.\n\n230\n00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.820\nSo, I'm not worried about that one,\nbut there are some times when you have\n\n231\n00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.440\nspecific ones that\nare specifically security,\n\n232\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.960\nin fact,\nlet me show you on the client here.\n\n233\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.980\nI could probably give you,\nlet me see here which machine I'm on here.\n\n234\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.710\nAll right, let's try this one.\n\n235\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.770\nI believe I've got a couple here.\n\n236\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.650\nWindows Defender we'll get\ninto that here in a second.\n\n237\n00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.570\nLet's go to the same place.\n\n238\n00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.810\nAction center update and security.\n\n239\n00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.980\nLet's look at our update history.\n\n240\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.490\nNow all right okay, there we go.\n\n241\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.840\nThere's one for a specific application,\nAdobe Flash, right?\n\n242\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.170\nNotice that it says security update,\nand you can see, you can see,\n\n243\n00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.890\nyou guys can read this, right?\n\n244\n00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.660\nFor Windows 10 Version 1607.\n\n245\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.060\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n246\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.300\nI'm not really sure.\n\n247\n00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.280\nLet me go ahead and\nclick the link and find out.\n\n248\n00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.480\nNotices it says that a security issue has\nbeen identified in a Microsoft software\n\n249\n00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.430\nproduct that could affect your system.\n\n250\n00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.230\nJust says you can help protect your\nsystem by installing this update.\n\n251\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.430\nNow if you don't do things like that,\nproblem is, it can end up being a problem,\n\n252\n00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.950\nit can leave your systems open and\nvulnerable to attack.\n\n253\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:43.000\nSo what we should be doing to resolve\nan issue like this, is to go ahead and\n\n254\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.090\nperform your updates.\n\n255\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.540\nNow, let's be realistic here.\n\n256\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.780\nOn a server,\nI'm probably not gonna just click Update.\n\n257\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.020\nI'm probably gonna have some kinda\npatch management solution like WSUS.\n\n258\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.390\nYou're gonna have an administrator\nthat is testing or\n\n259\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.880\na team that is testing these updates\nbefore we roll them out to production.\n\n260\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.100\nBut the point is, making sure\nthat you're doing those updates.\n\n261\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I think that one of the things\nthat maybe some people forget or\n\n262\n00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.470\ndon't quite think about is\nas these updates come out,\n\n263\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.310\nthese security updates and\nthings like that.\n\n264\n00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.730\nWhen they come out.\n\n265\n00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.060\nThey're really good for the bad guys,\nand you might think, what do you mean?\n\n266\n00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.900\nYou're patching a vulnerability.\n\n267\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.880\nYes, they are, but if I analyze that patch\nand I look and see what vulnerability that\n\n268\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.060\nis patching, I now know the vulnerability\nthat exist in the unpatched system.\n\n269\n00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.660\nSo all I got to know is write an exploit\nfor that particular vulnerability,\n\n270\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.220\ngo around and find the people who\nhaven't done that update yet and\n\n271\n00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.560\ntake advantage of that.\n\n272\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.180\nThat's why it's very important,\nwhen updates come out,\n\n273\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.370\nyou don't wait days or weeks.\n\n274\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.685\nYou might have a testing process like Wes\nsaid that you go through to verify there\n\n275\n00:12:40.685 --> 00:12:43.830\nnot going to be any problems, but\nyou want to apply those updates as soon as\n\n276\n00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:48.540\npossible, because now everybody\nknows about the vulnerability that\n\n277\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.940\nexisted without that patch, and they're\ngonna start taking advantage of it.\n\n278\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.500\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, for instance,\nwhen we talk about things like\n\n279\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.840\nmisconfigured ACLs or applications,\nlet me give you an example of that.\n\n280\n00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.570\nSo back on the same server here, if I\nactually get on the server that might help\n\n281\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.530\nokay, can't show you a server\nif I'm on the client, right?\n\n282\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.830\n[LAUGH] And\nI'm gonna launch up my PowerShell and\n\n283\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.020\nmaybe I need to run some scripts, right.\n\n284\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.160\nI need to run some Power Shell scripts and\nfor whatever reason,\n\n285\n00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.080\nwe were trying to run these scripts,\nthey weren't working, so what do we do,\n\n286\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.280\nwe said, you know what, let's make sure\nthat the software isn't the problem.\n\n287\n00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.500\nSo I do something like this, I come in\nhere and I do a get execution policy and\n\n288\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.740\nI run that and\nthe first thing I see is unrestricted.\n\n289\n00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.110\nSo what does that mean, unrestricted?\n\n290\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.620\nThat's kinda like turning\nyour firewall off.\n\n291\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.550\nYou're saying,\nI don't care what the script is,\n\n292\n00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.720\nI don't care where it comes from.\n\n293\n00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.220\nI don't even care if you could\nprove the integrity of it.\n\n294\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.180\nGo ahead and run it.\n\n295\n00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.560\nMike, does that sound safe to you?\n\n296\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.170\n&gt;&gt; That does not, Wes.\n\n297\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.350\nI don't know.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\n\n298\n00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.040\nour job is to\n&gt;&gt; Is to increase our security but\n\n299\n00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.000\nnot increase it too much.\n\n300\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.910\nSo, for instance, I could say you know\nwhat, I wanna be as secure as I can,\n\n301\n00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.140\nwe're gonna lock this thing\ndown like Fort Knox, okay.\n\n302\n00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.600\nSo I could do something like this,\nI could do a set execution policy.\n\n303\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.187\nAnd I can set the execution policy itself.\n\n304\n00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:12.740\nTo let's say we wanna be\nreally restrictive, right?\n\n305\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.466\nAnd we do an all signed.\n\n306\n00:14:14.466 --> 00:14:18.252\nAnd, make sure I don't know\nif it takes abbreviations, so\n\n307\n00:14:18.252 --> 00:14:22.280\nwe're gonna find out if I actually\ndid what I said was gonna do.\n\n308\n00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.530\nWe'll find out, and sure enough.\n\n309\n00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.190\nAll signed, all right?\n\n310\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.120\n&gt;&gt; Now, are you secure?\n\n311\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.180\nMost likely.\n\n312\n00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.120\nWhat this means is I have to have\na little bit of a digital signature,\n\n313\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.780\nlittle signature,\n\n314\n00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.935\nlittle electronic proof of documentation\nif you will on this that now says okay?\n\n315\n00:14:39.935 --> 00:14:42.986\nI see that's it signed,\nI trust who signed it and\n\n316\n00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:45.600\nnow it's gonna run.,\n&gt;&gt; Now what\n\n317\n00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.260\ndoes that do to the scripts\nthat I've written internally\n\n318\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.420\nthat I need to run on those\n&gt;&gt; machines?\n\n319\n00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; I don't have a certificate server to\n\n320\n00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.780\nassign my own certificates.\n\n321\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.850\n&gt;&gt; Sure, now what happens is well,\nwe can't run scripts anymore, right.\n\n322\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.020\nAnd they always say in the Windows world\nif you're gonna manage your servers,\n\n323\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.770\nright, what do you do?\n\n324\n00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.310\nYou bring up the server, you don't log\ninto it locally, you get something like\n\n325\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.820\nRSAT, the remote administration toolkit,\nand you do it remotely from your client.\n\n326\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.570\nWell all signed means it doesn't\nmatter where it's coming from, right?\n\n327\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.670\nMike says he's in my internal network.\n\n328\n00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.810\nWell, he's not remote.\n\n329\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.570\nWell maybe I want him to be able\nto verify that when he sends\n\n330\n00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.620\nsomething over the network right outside,\nthat it is signed.\n\n331\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.470\nBut if he's in my network, that's not\ngonna happen with this AllSigned.\n\n332\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.820\nSo what we can do is,\nrather than going two strikes right?\n\n333\n00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.750\nI don't know if there's\nactually an even balance right?\n\n334\n00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.930\nNot strict enough, too strict right?\n\n335\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.480\nI can do something like this\nwhere I do set execution policy,\n\n336\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.280\nsame thing that we did before.\n\n337\n00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.920\nI keep hitting that underscore.\n\n338\n00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.358\nI'll learn to type one of these years.\n\n339\n00:15:48.358 --> 00:15:54.422\n[LAUGH] Execution policy, and\nI can do remote sign, all right?\n\n340\n00:15:54.422 --> 00:15:58.201\nNow when I do this, and we always wanna\nverify, so I'm just gonna verify that I\n\n341\n00:15:58.201 --> 00:16:01.255\ndid set it because you guys have\nseen my typing abilities here.\n\n342\n00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:04.296\n[LAUGH] Notice that I have RemoteSigned.\n\n343\n00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:05.713\nNow why is that important?\n\n344\n00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:09.010\nWell, now Mike inside of the network,\nhe's local.\n\n345\n00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.880\nHe can go over to the machine, if he\nwants, locally and he can run one and\n\n346\n00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.840\nit doesn't have to be a set.\n\n347\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.110\nYou don't have to worry\nabout the digital signature.\n\n348\n00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.890\nWhy?\n\n349\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.140\nWell, we're doing role-based\nadministration, we're authenticated users.\n\n350\n00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.300\nWe know Mike,\nwe know that Mike is the administrator.\n\n351\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.940\nHe should be able to sign into the machine\nif he wants, if he's in the building, and\n\n352\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.970\nrun that script.\n\n353\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.030\nBut now, if he's using our set,\n\n354\n00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.490\nand he's at another location and he fires\nthat script off across the network,\n\n355\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.830\nwe're gonna have to make sure\nthat there's a digital signature.\n\n356\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:41.350\nIn this kind of scenario,\nwhere is that fine line?\n\n357\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:43.680\nI think that's why we have\nthe entire security industry,\n\n358\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.940\nbecause we don't really\nknow where that fine is.\n\n359\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.570\nIt's a constant journey.\n\n360\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.667\nSo now what we've said is, now we're not\nsetting it where everything can run.\n\n361\n00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:57.218\nWe're not saying that you have to\nhave multi-factor authentication,\n\n362\n00:16:57.218 --> 00:17:01.480\nGPS tracking system, and\ntake wind calculations to run anything.\n\n363\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.280\nBut we've kinda hit the medium level,\nif you will.\n\n364\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.700\nSo that's an example in which you can see,\nfor\n\n365\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.838\ninstance, things like applications\nneed to be configured right.\n\n366\n00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:13.380\nAll right,\nnow the other thing we also mentioned,\n\n367\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.150\nwe mentioned things like malware, right?\n\n368\n00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:20.560\nWhen we talk about things like malware,\nwell, we did look and when I opened.\n\n369\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.870\nOop, in fact,\nlet me switch over to the client.\n\n370\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.270\nI opened the action center and\nI already kind of clicked on it.\n\n371\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.110\nSorry, guys,\nyou can see the heads up right there.\n\n372\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.830\nIt tells me, and this is something good.\n\n373\n00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.790\nWell, let's just stay\nin the Action Center.\n\n374\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.300\nI can tell that updates were installed.\n\n375\n00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.286\nIt's good to have that notification there.\n\n376\n00:17:37.286 --> 00:17:40.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But I also know that just recently\n\n377\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.330\nWindows Defender ran a scan, right?\n\n378\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.140\nSo am I safe?\n\n379\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.930\nI don't know and I'm not going to\nturn this on right now because I\n\n380\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.040\ndon't want anything to shut me down.\n\n381\n00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.550\nYou can see that it is protected, right?\n\n382\n00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.360\nBut I need to know,\nam I protected with Windows Defender?\n\n383\n00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.090\nRemember I told you the signature,\nthe database, well,\n\n384\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.340\nhow do I find that information out?\n\n385\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.170\nHow do I know that it's configured right?\n\n386\n00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.880\nWell, I can go to the Action Center here.\n\n387\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.620\nWe can go to All Settings &gt; Update and\nsecurity.\n\n388\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.470\nAnd I can come over here\nto Windows Defender, and\n\n389\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.340\nwe've got a series of settings.\n\n390\n00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.670\nI've got the real time protection.\n\n391\n00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.090\nIf I turn this off, it's like not\neven having Windows Defender.\n\n392\n00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.918\nWhat's the purpose of having it on your\nmachine if you're not going to use it?\n\n393\n00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:23.211\nThings like cloud-based protection, and\nthis is really cool because what you can\n\n394\n00:18:23.211 --> 00:18:24.858\ndo is you can send\nsamples to Microsoft and\n\n395\n00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:27.322\nthey can analyze it against\nstuff they already know, right?\n\n396\n00:18:27.322 --> 00:18:31.778\nAnd if it is identified, you could help\npeople with things like zero day threats,\n\n397\n00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.020\nwhich I'm definitely a fan on.\n\n398\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.930\nBut more importantly, for me,\nif I wanna know am I current?\n\n399\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.950\nIs this going to protect me?\n\n400\n00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.030\nWell, what I can do is I can\nfind definition database.\n\n401\n00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.000\nI can find the client version.\n\n402\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.695\nI can go up to Microsoft's website, and\nI can look what is the current version of\n\n403\n00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:54.649\nthe definition database that we can see,\nright?\n\n404\n00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:57.349\nKnowledge base, it's a great way\nto get some information off of\n\n405\n00:18:57.349 --> 00:18:59.151\nMicrosoft about the Microsoft products.\n\n406\n00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:02.439\nAnd in this case I can find out if\nthis is current or if this database,\n\n407\n00:19:02.439 --> 00:19:04.287\nunfortunately, is six months old and\n\n408\n00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:07.970\nwe could have viruses on here that\nthe software is just not aware of.\n\n409\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great point to make.\n\n410\n00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.240\nAnd going in there and\nlooking at that version number because\n\n411\n00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.030\nI've gone to systems where\nyou think it's been updating.\n\n412\n00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.948\nYou're pretty sure that it's current and\nyou go to look and you realize,\n\n413\n00:19:17.948 --> 00:19:20.033\nlike you said, for\nsome reason it hasn't updated.\n\n414\n00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:23.165\nHad an issue where,\nwhat was it that happened?\n\n415\n00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:28.260\nOur WSUS server had run out of disk\nspace and nobody was checking.\n\n416\n00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.700\nAnd so, all over a sudden,\n\n417\n00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.845\nwe noticed that a couple of our machines\nhadn't got updates in several weeks.\n\n418\n00:19:33.845 --> 00:19:35.775\nAnd then after some troubleshooting,\nwe figured out the problem.\n\n419\n00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:39.794\nBut it's an easy thing to miss because you\njust assume that everything is working\n\n420\n00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:40.444\nproperly and\n\n421\n00:19:40.444 --> 00:19:44.785\nknowing where to look to figure out what\nversion you're on is really important.\n\n422\n00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:47.650\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, we've also talked\nabout things like open ports,\n\n423\n00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.100\nopen and closed port,s but\nwhy is that such a problem?\n\n424\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.310\nLet's see if we can show\nyou why that's a problem,\n\n425\n00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.965\nin fact I'm back on my Windows server box,\nI'm gonna go ahead and clear this screen,\n\n426\n00:19:55.965 --> 00:19:57.865\nto give us a little bit\nmore real estate here.\n\n427\n00:19:57.865 --> 00:19:59.320\nLet me do a cd\\,\nI'm just kinda particular about that.\n\n428\n00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.230\nI like to have as much on\nthe screen as possible.\n\n429\n00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.680\nSo if I run something like netstart,\nright?\n\n430\n00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.700\nAnd I do -a, cuz I wanna see all, and\ndon't worry about these on the exam.\n\n431\n00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:15.380\nI don't know that they're gonna, like knit\npick you of specific switches, they could.\n\n432\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.970\nJust know what you're\ngonna do with netstat.\n\n433\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.540\nNetwork statistics, we've shown in other\nepisodes, gives me all the connections\n\n434\n00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.560\nthat are on this machine and a lot more\ngreat information that we've talked about.\n\n435\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.050\nSo I'm going to do a -a,\nI wanna see all connections.\n\n436\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.230\nAnd I don't care about\nthe UDP information, so\n\n437\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.010\nI'm going to do a protocol of TCP.\n\n438\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.820\nAnd I'm gonna run this.\n\n439\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.610\nNow this information,\n\n440\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.730\nwe've talked about in other\nepisodes as being important, right?\n\n441\n00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.410\nWe can see those connections to\nthe other addresses and stuff,\n\n442\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.630\noutbound foreign addresses.\n\n443\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:47.800\nBut that's not the only information\nthat's important and valuable to me.\n\n444\n00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.960\nLook at these ports here, right?\n\n445\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.530\nWhat does this mean?\n\n446\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:57.060\nWell, this means that if I look,\nthis server is listening.\n\n447\n00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:02.030\nIn relation, if you will see these ports,\nwe have a listening state.\n\n448\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.720\nRemember what we said our server is\nlistening for an incoming connection?\n\n449\n00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.410\nWell, what is that port?\n\n450\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.590\nI can tell right now that I've got\nFTP running on this server, right?\n\n451\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.530\nSo that's a problem.\n\n452\n00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:17.180\nI can see things like SMTP, I can see\nthings like 80, that's web traffic.\n\n453\n00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.360\nI can see things like port 88.\n\n454\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.020\nGuess what?\n\n455\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.640\nPort 88 is Kerberos.\n\n456\n00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.520\nAll right, I could start to deduce\na little bit of information\n\n457\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.570\nfrom this, right?\n\n458\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.710\nBut let's see just because I know this,\n\n459\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:32.520\nwhat if somebody was not part of my\nnetwork and they didn't know this.\n\n460\n00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.590\nHow can they use this information, right?\n\n461\n00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.270\nI know looking at these\nports what they do.\n\n462\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.790\nSo let's go ahead and let's see that.\n\n463\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.670\nLet me get over to another machine\nhere and let's go ahead and do an SSH.\n\n464\n00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.810\nI've got a senseBox running\nthat's got Nmap installed.\n\n465\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.330\nSo let me go ahead and get into that,\n\n466\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.942\nif I can remember the IP\naddress of that XenServer.\n\n467\n00:21:58.075 --> 00:21:59.510\nOop, did I get that right?\n\n468\n00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.650\nNo, 014 here.\n\n469\n00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.684\nLet's try an IP address,\nthat might actually work to connect here.\n\n470\n00:22:05.813 --> 00:22:09.416\nNow, all right, and let's go ahead, and\n\n471\n00:22:09.416 --> 00:22:14.140\nI'm gonna take the IP\naddress of this server here.\n\n472\n00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.110\nAnd we're gonna do a quick\nlittle port scan on it, right?\n\n473\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.430\nWe're gonna go ahead and what we'll\ndo is I'll do a, let's see here.\n\n474\n00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.620\nI'm gonna do a -p cuz I\nwant a port range here.\n\n475\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.670\nAnd I'm gonna do the common ports\nthat really mean something to me, for\n\n476\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.690\nme ports lower than 20 I\ndon't really care for.\n\n477\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.510\nYou might have a reason that\nyou care about them but for\n\n478\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.270\nme in this demonstration I do not.\n\n479\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.830\nSo I'll do a port scan\nof a specific range.\n\n480\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.550\nAnd we'll do 251, let me just double check\nto make sure I've got that right and\n\n481\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.850\nwe'll go ahead and run this.\n\n482\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.892\nNow what Nmap is doing is kinda like\nnetstat was showing me those ports.\n\n483\n00:22:49.892 --> 00:22:52.670\nNmap is firing off scripts\nin the background and\n\n484\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.050\nit's scanning that host that\nI've sent this Nmap scan.\n\n485\n00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.750\nSo it might take a second here.\n\n486\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.890\nBut one of the problems with those\nports that we have is the fact that\n\n487\n00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.160\nthe more ports that\nare open on your machine,\n\n488\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.730\nthe easier it is to identify\nwhat that machine's doing.\n\n489\n00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.040\nFor instance, I said we have port 80,\n\n490\n00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.470\nI can almost imagine that it's going\nto be some kind of web traffic, right?\n\n491\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.520\nI see there's port 21.\n\n492\n00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.000\nI know there's some kind of\nFTP service going on there.\n\n493\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.410\nI see things like port 88.\n\n494\n00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.610\nYou say, well port 88, you said it's\nKerberos, why does that make a difference?\n\n495\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.568\nAnd then I see port 53 and there is DNS.\n\n496\n00:23:25.568 --> 00:23:29.790\nWell now I'm starting to think,\nwhat kind of machine would be running DNS,\n\n497\n00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:34.170\nwould be running Kerberos and\nwould be running things like LDAP, right?\n\n498\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.210\n&gt;&gt; My first thought is that\nmust be a domain controller.\n\n499\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very good.\n\n500\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.830\nSo and this is taking a second.\n\n501\n00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.409\nIt shouldn't take too much longer,\nhopefully not, there we go.\n\n502\n00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:46.536\n&gt;&gt; It's a good point though that you make\nis that are you're doing these port scans,\n\n503\n00:23:46.536 --> 00:23:48.641\nyou start to learn what\nservices belong in what ports.\n\n504\n00:23:48.641 --> 00:23:50.973\nAnd you're basically\nfingerprinting the OS,\n\n505\n00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:54.472\nfingerprinting the services that\nare on that machine and you think well\n\n506\n00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:58.453\nWho cares if people know that it's a\nWindows machine running Active Directory?\n\n507\n00:23:58.453 --> 00:24:02.750\nWell, now I know what exploits I need to\nfocus on to try to attack that machine.\n\n508\n00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:08.230\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so make sure that if\nports aren't, there we go, there we go.\n\n509\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.350\nSo notice what it tells me, all right?\n\n510\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.954\nAnd it took a little bit on that one\nthere, but notice what I see here.\n\n511\n00:24:12.954 --> 00:24:17.221\nI see a lot more ports and definitions\nof those ports right here, right?\n\n512\n00:24:17.221 --> 00:24:19.122\nHTTPS, well, that's Microsoft, so\n\n513\n00:24:19.122 --> 00:24:22.330\nthat's [LAUGH] gotta be some\nkinda Windows machine, right?\n\n514\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.870\nWhat else do we see here?\n\n515\n00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.747\nI see actually a lot of\nstuff going on here too.\n\n516\n00:24:26.747 --> 00:24:27.933\n&gt;&gt; I see some interesting things.\n\n517\n00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:28.903\nI think I see VNC, my SQL.\n\n518\n00:24:28.903 --> 00:24:33.322\n&gt;&gt; VNC is going on this, my SQL, so you\ncan see somebody like Mike going [LAUGH]\n\n519\n00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:37.590\nwhat can I do with this machine\nnow that I know what's going on?\n\n520\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.030\nAnd again,\nwe can start to scan this machine and\n\n521\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.400\ncome up with what it is based\non the ports that are open.\n\n522\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.710\nSo, what do you need to do?\n\n523\n00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.956\nYou need to close down ports\nthat you're not using.\n\n524\n00:24:47.956 --> 00:24:52.086\nSo, if we switch, let me give you\nan example of that, so we switch back\n\n525\n00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:56.862\nall our server here, right, you'll\nnotice that right there is port 5985.\n\n526\n00:24:56.862 --> 00:25:00.361\nNow I don't expect you guys and I'm sure\nCompTIA doesn't either, on the exam,\n\n527\n00:25:00.361 --> 00:25:02.040\nto know what that port is.\n\n528\n00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.630\nI just happen to know\nthat on this machine,\n\n529\n00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.900\nI set up remote log manager, right?\n\n530\n00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.970\nRemote event log management,\nif I could say that right.\n\n531\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:10.848\nSo guess what?\n\n532\n00:25:10.848 --> 00:25:13.750\nIf I wanna connect to this machine and\nscrape its event logs,\n\n533\n00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.100\nit has to have a port open listening for\nthat incoming request.\n\n534\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.820\nSo if I decide,\nmaybe I decide that you know what,\n\n535\n00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.670\nI don't want that port to be open.\n\n536\n00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.310\nSo what do I do?\n\n537\n00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.770\nWell, I can do something\nlike Stop Service winrm,\n\n538\n00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.230\nwhich is the Windows Remote Management,\nand I can run that.\n\n539\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.425\nAnd we'll hope that that\ncloses the port down, right?\n\n540\n00:25:35.425 --> 00:25:38.855\nSo let me go ahead and\nwe'll rerun our net stat.\n\n541\n00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:44.995\nAnd we'll do -a, -p for protocol,\nwe'll do TCP, we'll rerun this.\n\n542\n00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:47.970\nNow I don't see it anymore, right?\n\n543\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.960\nNotice that, it's gone.\n\n544\n00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.052\nAnd why is it gone?\n\n545\n00:25:51.052 --> 00:25:54.839\nWell, I stopped the service\nthat the port was behind.\n\n546\n00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:57.040\nRemember we told you it's listening for\nthat port?\n\n547\n00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.860\nAnd behind that port is a service\nthat it's gonna offer as\n\n548\n00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.800\npart of your client request?\n\n549\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.580\nNow that I've closed it down, or turned\nthe service off the port is closed down.\n\n550\n00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.165\nBut does that really\nlock down our systems?\n\n551\n00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:12.018\nRemember we also talked\na misconfigured firewall as well?\n\n552\n00:26:12.018 --> 00:26:13.410\nI don't know, let's find out.\n\n553\n00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.550\nSo there's a few different\nways that you can do this.\n\n554\n00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.920\nThis is my favorite\n\n555\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.998\nMSC command because it's the shortest\nI think in all Microsoft.\n\n556\n00:26:21.998 --> 00:26:24.380\nAnd it's wf.msc, and\n\n557\n00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.240\nthat brings up the Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security, right?\n\n558\n00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.310\nBasically, I could see\nthe inbound communications.\n\n559\n00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.640\nAnd if I search through this,\nthere we go, reverse the search,\n\n560\n00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.660\neven though I closed down things like your\nWindows, there it is, I'm looking at WMI.\n\n561\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:42.414\nWrong rule there.\n\n562\n00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:43.397\nGet your rules right, man.\n\n563\n00:26:43.397 --> 00:26:48.522\n[LAUGH] I notice that I have\nWindows Remote Management and guess what?\n\n564\n00:26:48.522 --> 00:26:50.731\nOn a public network, it's open.\n\n565\n00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:51.840\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n566\n00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.399\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna take some flack for\n\n567\n00:26:53.399 --> 00:26:55.930\nthis one from Mike after\nthe show's over for sure, right?\n\n568\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.120\nSo what do we have to do though?\n\n569\n00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.155\nAnd that's a good reaction.\n\n570\n00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:01.100\nIt was like, wait a second, man.\n\n571\n00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.856\nYou've opened the service, the server, and\n\n572\n00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:06.624\npotentially the network\nto an exploitation.\n\n573\n00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:10.900\nSo what we need to do is we need to make\nsure that we configure our firewall right.\n\n574\n00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.461\nAnd if I can quit scrolling all around\nhere, we might be able to do that.\n\n575\n00:27:13.461 --> 00:27:16.672\nAnd I need to do things like\ndisable this rule, all right?\n\n576\n00:27:16.672 --> 00:27:20.741\n&gt;&gt; So, you're saying that stopping the\nservice might not necessarily be enough.\n\n577\n00:27:20.741 --> 00:27:21.905\nI need to take it a step further.\n\n578\n00:27:21.905 --> 00:27:24.500\nThat's absolutely correct, for sure.\n\n579\n00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.746\nSo, we've seen a couple of\nthings that we need to do,\n\n580\n00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:30.935\na couple of other things\nthat they call out here too.\n\n581\n00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:32.706\nI do have some few other ones, Mike.\n\n582\n00:27:32.706 --> 00:27:36.271\nBut I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to fit\nit in this episode cuz as you guys can\n\n583\n00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:37.462\nsee, boy, I talk a lot.\n\n584\n00:27:37.462 --> 00:27:39.380\n&gt;&gt; You do but, Wes,\nit's been great information.\n\n585\n00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.420\nAnd I don't wanna rush through any of\nthis cuz I know it's very important,\n\n586\n00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.798\nespecially as we're preparing for\nthis Network+ exam.\n\n587\n00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:47.312\nSo I'll tell you what,\nwe'll stop the episode here and\n\n588\n00:27:47.312 --> 00:27:49.035\nwe'll just come back to do a part two.\n\n589\n00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:50.414\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n&gt;&gt; And any parting words for\n\n590\n00:27:50.414 --> 00:27:52.190\nour viewers before we wrap this one?\n\n591\n00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.800\n&gt;&gt; No, just make sure that you\ndocument your configurations right.\n\n592\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.284\nYour documentation and\n\n593\n00:27:57.284 --> 00:28:01.001\nI'm out there telling you guys\nto do what I say not what I do.\n\n594\n00:28:01.001 --> 00:28:04.834\nThere's been time that I've missed\ndocumentation and change management.\n\n595\n00:28:04.834 --> 00:28:06.650\nIt could really get you into trouble.\n\n596\n00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:10.350\nSo just make sure that you're\ndocumenting your current configurations.\n\n597\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.125\nAnd you might have a change management\nteam where you have to submit\n\n598\n00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.495\na change request.\n\n599\n00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:19.876\nIt has to be reviewed by a CAB, a change\nadvisory board, it's gotta be approved,\n\n600\n00:28:19.876 --> 00:28:21.701\nit's gotta be tested, then implemented.\n\n601\n00:28:21.701 --> 00:28:25.350\nSo, it's not sometimes just as\nsimple as flipping a switch.\n\n602\n00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.230\nYou might have a process to go through.\n\n603\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.480\nBut I would say the best thing to do is\nalways start with your documentation so\n\n604\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.160\nyou know where you stand now.\n\n605\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.380\n&gt;&gt; Great advice, Wes.\n\n606\n00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.210\nAll right, we appreciate that.\n\n607\n00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.320\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n608\n00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.876\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n609\n00:28:39.876 --> 00:28:40.860\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n610\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.761\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n611\n00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:49.768\n[MUSIC]\n\n612\n00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:52.992\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.436\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:12.436\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:16.084\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:20.310\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Comp TN Network Plus.\n\n7\n00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.420\nAnd in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.150\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\nresolving some common security issues.\n\n9\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.340\nThis is actually a part two\ncontinuation of our thought process, so\n\n10\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.660\nif you missed the first part,\nmake sure you go back and watch that.\n\n11\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.450\nAnd back again in\nthe studio with me today,\n\n12\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.260\nto help me troubleshoot these security\nissues, is none other than Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.040\nWelcome back, Wes.\n\n14\n00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks for having me here, Mike.\n\n15\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.492\nAs always, great to be here.\n\n16\n00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:44.615\nGood seeing you guys in electrical\nlimbo out there I guess?\n\n17\n00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:45.860\n[LAUGH] Good to have you guys with us.\n\n18\n00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.520\nThat's right.\n\n19\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.190\nWe are coming back with a part two.\n\n20\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.090\nAs you've been following along\nwith this series you know I\n\n21\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.880\ncan tend to talk a little bit too much,\nbut not too much.\n\n22\n00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.700\nJust making sure that you have enough for\nyour exam.\n\n23\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.050\nIn the first part we talked about some\nof the common issues that we'll face.\n\n24\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.230\nEvery network at one point\nis going to face, right.\n\n25\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.280\nA misconfiguration of the firewall, right.\n\n26\n00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.390\nSomebody needed an application,\n\n27\n00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.880\nthey needed to test an application,\nthey went to a forum or a blog post.\n\n28\n00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.470\nThe blog posted said I know how you fix\nthat just go ahead disable the firewall.\n\n29\n00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.320\nBut we've showed you that that's\nprobably not what you should be doing.\n\n30\n00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.660\nBut at the same time,\nremember on the other side of the tracks,\n\n31\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.270\nyou get a little bit too restrictive,\nrestrict everything.\n\n32\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.490\nAnd then we start to ruin that CIA\ntriad at, least the availability part.\n\n33\n00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.815\nWe also talked about\nthe things like ACLs and\n\n34\n00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:33.465\napplications that are misconfigured,\nright.\n\n35\n00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:36.415\nWell for instance we showed you\nsome of the execution policy for\n\n36\n00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.285\nthings like scripts that run on\nservers and making sure that again,\n\n37\n00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.800\nwherever that balance is right, and\nI can't tell you where the balance is.\n\n38\n00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.680\nWe've got companies that make billions\nof dollars a year telling you\n\n39\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.240\nwhat the balance is, but we could at\nleast show you some of the basics here.\n\n40\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.890\nNow in the first one,\nI kind of mentioned denial of service,\n\n41\n00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.150\nbut I really didn't call it out.\n\n42\n00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.440\nI just kinda talked\nabout the ping of death,\n\n43\n00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.540\nwhich is a form of denial of service.\n\n44\n00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.560\nI don't know that the ping of death\nis really that popular anymore and\n\n45\n00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.020\nthe reason I say that is because routers\nthey have a way today that they could just\n\n46\n00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.840\nbasically take unnecessary excess traffic\nthat's coming into your network and\n\n47\n00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.260\nthey can discard it, right?\n\n48\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.000\nIf I have too many of these ICMP messages,\nICMP echo request,\n\n49\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.490\nthat's not an important piece of data.\n\n50\n00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.900\nSo, we could put a rule or\n\n51\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.970\nwe could put a filter in that says, all of\nthat ICMP echo traffic that's coming in,\n\n52\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.110\nrequest or replies if you will,\nwe're filter those out, right?\n\n53\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.930\nGive you an example,\nin fact let me see if I can do this.\n\n54\n00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.310\nLet me show you my machine where I can\nshow you where a lot of places do this.\n\n55\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:47.640\nIf I was to do ping of www.microsoft.com.\n\n56\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.150\nI think Microsoft is one,\nI don't know if they still do.\n\n57\n00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.650\nWhere I thought, no, there they are.\n\n58\n00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.480\nSometimes you will find that\nyou can't ping them, right, and\n\n59\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.080\nif it comes back with replies or\nrequest timed out,\n\n60\n00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.170\nyou can say that they're probably\nnot allowing that communication.\n\n61\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.295\nThe other one I can do too is trace RT or\n\n62\n00:03:08.295 --> 00:03:12.920\ntrac route if you're in the Linux world,\nwill send out ICMP echo requests,\n\n63\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.260\nand sometimes you don't get a lot\nof information as it makes its way\n\n64\n00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.760\nthrough the various connectivity\ndevices on its way to its destination.\n\n65\n00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.190\nWe'll see if this works here.\n\n66\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.740\nHopefully it does, but if I start to see\nthings like asterisks and this will be\n\n67\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.100\nthe one time that every single bit in\nthe path will come back like it just did.\n\n68\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which you never see.\n\n69\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] which\nyou usually never see.\n\n70\n00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:37.520\nLet's use everybody's\nfavorite social media site.\n\n71\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.550\nWe'll see if this we can generate,\nand if it doesn't, that's okay.\n\n72\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.850\nBut the point is if you start\nseeing these asterisks in here,\n\n73\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.090\nthen what might be happening is the device\nas it passes through is not allowing you\n\n74\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.460\nto see that ICMP return.\n\n75\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.780\nThere's the second one.\n\n76\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.830\nThree strikes, you're out, guys.\n\n77\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.290\nSo I'm not gonna do this a third time.\n\n78\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.540\nAnd just completely\nairball here on camera.\n\n79\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.280\nSo I want you to keep in mind that if you\nwere to see things like asterisks in here,\n\n80\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.110\nyou can see that the ICMP echo requests,\njust in general, are being blocked.\n\n81\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of organizations do that.\n\n82\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.070\nICMP is a great way to troubleshoot\nnetwork connectivity, but\n\n83\n00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.955\nit has also been used in malicious ways.\n\n84\n00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.595\nWays as you said the ping of death,\nthe fraggle attack, or\n\n85\n00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:16.365\nI should say smurfs not fraggle.\n\n86\n00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:17.645\nFraggle was UDP.\n\n87\n00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:19.762\nAnd the other thing people don't\nrealize is that ping pack,\n\n88\n00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:21.095\nit's actually carry a payload.\n\n89\n00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:23.985\nThey don't by default, but\nthere is room in there to put data.\n\n90\n00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.274\nSo you might be thinking you're\nletting ping packets come through and\n\n91\n00:04:27.274 --> 00:04:29.090\nmalicious payload inside there.\n\n92\n00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.890\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n93\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.420\nAnd standing next to this guy,\none of our security gurus here,\n\n94\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.740\ndefinitely knows about\nsome of the other ones.\n\n95\n00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.890\nYou gotta heard him mention it\nin things like the fraggle.\n\n96\n00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.410\nWell if you think about excess\nunnecessary traffic, right.\n\n97\n00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.750\nWe can filter that.\n\n98\n00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.140\nBut how about traffic that looks legit.\n\n99\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.960\nHow about traffic that we use as\npart of normal communications?\n\n100\n00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.210\nWe talk about things like\nthe TCP three-way handshake.\n\n101\n00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.910\nThat's part of a session establishment.\n\n102\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.790\nThat is a legit, valid communication.\n\n103\n00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.710\nSo if people are not configuring things\nlike their ACLs right, not configuring\n\n104\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.650\ntheir connectivity devices, when a router\nc is a synchronization request packet,\n\n105\n00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.290\na syn packet come in,\nthat's not excess traffic.\n\n106\n00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.630\nThat is traffic that's bound for\n\n107\n00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.410\nsome kind of three way handshake on\nthe other side of whatever that device is.\n\n108\n00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.690\nAnd that's where denial service attacks\ncan sometimes happen just because\n\n109\n00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.480\nI might be able to discard\ntraffic that's excessive, but\n\n110\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.605\nit's kind of hard to detect when that\ntraffic looks legitimate, right?\n\n111\n00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, absolutely that's\nwhen it becomes very difficult.\n\n112\n00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.709\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so, denial service is they can\nhappen in many different forms, right?\n\n113\n00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.160\nCould be something like a physical\ndenial of service, right?\n\n114\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.980\nWe've talked about this,\nand I know Mike and\n\n115\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.160\nI have talked about\nthis before off camera.\n\n116\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.090\nHow about taking that big old blanket?\n\n117\n00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.600\nAnd you said blanket?\n\n118\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.740\nDid I have a service attack, a blanket?\n\n119\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.360\nReally, really Wes?\n\n120\n00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.790\nYeah, how about taking that blanket and\n\n121\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.909\nthrowing it over the exhaust ports\non the top of the data center.\n\n122\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.760\nNow the heat stays in the data center,\nbrings everything completely offline.\n\n123\n00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.630\nHow about walking over and\npulling the power?\n\n124\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.150\nThe breaker box.\n\n125\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.140\nCut.\n\n126\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.610\nRight?\nThat's a denial of service.\n\n127\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.900\nThe service is usually\nprovided as a request.\n\n128\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.180\nIf the request comes in and\n\n129\n00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.320\nservice isn't provided,\nthat's denial of service very simple.\n\n130\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.510\nSo those are some things that\nwe also have to worry about.\n\n131\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.610\nLet me see, so some of the additional\nthings that we wanna talk about,\n\n132\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.940\nI think it's like malicious users.\n\n133\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.125\nRight, now, they classify this a little\nbit different because a trusted user\n\n134\n00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.115\ncan be a malicious user.\n\n135\n00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:29.235\nYou say wait a second, trusted user,\nhow's that malicious, right?\n\n136\n00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:30.635\nWell, I don't like Mike.\n\n137\n00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:31.475\nI don't like Mike at all.\n\n138\n00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:33.095\nHe didn't buy me lunch today.\n\n139\n00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.275\nSo you know what I'm going to do?\n\n140\n00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:35.975\nI'm a trusted user on this network.\n\n141\n00:06:35.975 --> 00:06:37.355\nWait til he walks away from his computer.\n\n142\n00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:39.255\nHe's not going to like his background.\n\n143\n00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:41.735\nAnd hopefully he's put in his credit\ncard information in that browser and\n\n144\n00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.355\nhe hasn't cleared his cache.\n\n145\n00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:45.417\nNow I joke, and\nI would not do that to him-\n\n146\n00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:48.625\n&gt;&gt; Because I use Windows key L.\n\n147\n00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:49.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n148\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.960\nLocks the machine before he walks away.\n\n149\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.505\nVery good.\n\n150\n00:06:51.505 --> 00:06:55.880\n[LAUGH] But the trusted user, I already\nhave an avenue of, I have a pathway in.\n\n151\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.130\nI can't find it right now.\n\n152\n00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.220\nI've got my card.\n\n153\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.090\nI can get in.\n\n154\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.010\nI can get into the building.\n\n155\n00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.990\nNow, once I can get into\nthe building I have access and\n\n156\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.540\nif I'm a trusted employee\nnobody's gonna be none the wiser.\n\n157\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.770\nSo what else can we do?\n\n158\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.540\nIt's kinda interesting cuz they\nalso talk about packet sniffing.\n\n159\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.140\nPacket sniffing can be a malicious user,\nbut it can also be, again, a trusted user.\n\n160\n00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.090\nSo for instance let me show you.\n\n161\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.670\nYou're here on our network, right?\n\n162\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.829\nIf I decide that I wanna\nfire up WireShark, okay?\n\n163\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.760\nAll right.\n\n164\n00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.160\nAnd I'm gonna do, quite literally,\nthe quickest capture that I can.\n\n165\n00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.570\nAnd we're done [LAUGH].\n\n166\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.300\nYeah, really.\n\n167\n00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.470\nJust like that.\n\n168\n00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.300\nWell, why is the packet\nsniffing in general,\n\n169\n00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.770\nwe've talked about protocol analyzers and\npacket sniffers in other episodes.\n\n170\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.470\nYou guys go back and check those out.\n\n171\n00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.870\nBut the point is, things like ARP.\n\n172\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.510\nARP can cause some\nproblems on your network.\n\n173\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.771\nIt can also give away a little bit\nmore information than you want.\n\n174\n00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.833\nAnd if I'm a trusted user and\nI have access to your network,\n\n175\n00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:52.852\nI now have access to information\nthat maybe I shouldn't.\n\n176\n00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:57.732\nSo let me show you here for instance if\nI go dig down in here to the our packet\n\n177\n00:07:57.732 --> 00:08:01.640\nsniffer here, and\nI pull up the Mac address, right?\n\n178\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.050\nSee Mac address is as we've talked\nabout in our addressing schemes,\n\n179\n00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.780\nIf I can figure out what layer of\nthe OSI we're in, [LAUGH] there we go.\n\n180\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.640\nI can find the OUI, remember,\nthe organizationally unique identifier?\n\n181\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.360\nGuys, generically, it's a vendor ID.\n\n182\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.630\nIt tells me who made the network adapter.\n\n183\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.350\nWell, Wireshark is really,\n\n184\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.210\nreally good because I don't even have\nto know what those bytes are, right?\n\n185\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.830\nNotice how it's the first\nthree bytes there?\n\n186\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.970\nBut it tells me.\n\n187\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.860\nSamsung.\n\n188\n00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.520\nSo I can start to glean\ninformation that will allow me\n\n189\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.720\nnot only to discover what the device\nis but the manufacturer of the device.\n\n190\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.440\nI might not know the device here but\nI can at least start and\n\n191\n00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.800\nI can start to profile your network.\n\n192\n00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.330\nAnd if I'm trusted,\nI'm not gonna have a hard time doing it.\n\n193\n00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.050\nNow, they also call out things\nlike untrusted users too.\n\n194\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.930\nPersonally, Mike,\nI think untrusted users is external,\n\n195\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.250\nwell, internal users versus\nexternal entities, all right.\n\n196\n00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.410\nBecause the external user\ncould be a contractor.\n\n197\n00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.290\nContractors don't try to be malicious,\nwe don't even talk about packet sniffers.\n\n198\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.640\nThey could just do something,\nyou give them too much access.\n\n199\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.980\nYou don't implement things like\nthe principle or least privilege and\n\n200\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.010\nyou've given a guest user that shouldn't\nhave a level of access to your\n\n201\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.790\nshared resources in your network,\nand now that can cause problems.\n\n202\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.810\nInvertently they didn't even try,\nlet alone someone that has an agenda.\n\n203\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.060\nAnd those are the ones you really\nhave to watch out for, right?\n\n204\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:21.850\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n205\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.250\nAnd really when it comes down to it,\nyour insiders,\n\n206\n00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.820\nyour employees can be much more dangerous\nthan any external threats you might face.\n\n207\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.120\nCuz as you said,\nthey're already on the inside.\n\n208\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.410\nThey already have a set of credentials.\n\n209\n00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.840\nAll they need is privilege escalation.\n\n210\n00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yes sir.\n\n211\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.880\nThe other things that they call out too\nare things like authentication issues,\n\n212\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.690\nTACACS, again Terminal Access Control\nAccess Control Systems, and RADIUS,\n\n213\n00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.780\nRemote Access Dial In User Service,\nI believe.\n\n214\n00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.520\nYeah, authentication, thank you.\n\n215\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.610\nAnd that could cause problems as well.\n\n216\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.480\nWhy?\n\n217\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.780\nWell, that can actually be\na denial of service attack,\n\n218\n00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.640\na radius denial or an AAA authentication\ntype denial of service attack\n\n219\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.070\nwhere I'm just setting up authentication\nrequests as much as I can to your machine.\n\n220\n00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.960\nAnd I'm the attacker,\nMike's the legitimate user.\n\n221\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.820\nHe's trying to authenticate and he can't.\n\n222\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.440\nWhy?\n\n223\n00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.820\nBecause I'm saturating the network and\n\n224\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.930\nthe bandwidth with all\nthe authentication requests I can.\n\n225\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.890\nBut you can also get\npeople too much access,\n\n226\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.810\nright, maybe your network\npolicies aren't set up.\n\n227\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.840\nMaybe you're running NPS on your local\nnetwork, a network policy server and\n\n228\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.290\nyou've got it not restrictive enough.\n\n229\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.440\nAnd maybe you use weak\nauthentication protocols, right.\n\n230\n00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.020\nRemote access protocols.\n\n231\n00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.460\nWe've got some out there that\nhave been out there for a while.\n\n232\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.130\nMaybe you've set up PAP.\n\n233\n00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.280\nPassword authentication protocol.\n\n234\n00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.510\nNow, most likely you have it,\nbut if you misconfigure it,\n\n235\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.220\nit's plain text communication,\nso these can cause problems too.\n\n236\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.500\nThe other thing, too, they talk about and\n\n237\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.120\nthey call out are things like passwords,\npassword settings if you will, well,\n\n238\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.690\nwhat would be the problem\nwith a password setting be?\n\n239\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.780\nWell, I want you to\nunderstand that it depends.\n\n240\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.710\nIf I'm in a domain environment,\nright, and Mike's the domain admin,\n\n241\n00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.080\nhe can control password settings.\n\n242\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:04.050\nHe can define what type of password we\nneed to use and control that, right?\n\n243\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.010\nBut what I'm not part of the domain?\n\n244\n00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:09.760\nIf I'm not part of a domain then\nit's a little harder to control.\n\n245\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.600\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n246\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.620\nGo back to our server here.\n\n247\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.640\nLet me close down some things.\n\n248\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.480\nMake sure that I am on my server.\n\n249\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.522\nAnd if I launch up,\nI know I launched up server manager,\n\n250\n00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:21.480\nI should just do it from the start menu.\n\n251\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.670\nAnd if I launch up things like our GPMC,\nour group policy management console.\n\n252\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.577\nAnd I come in here and just very\nbasically look at like for instance,\n\n253\n00:11:29.577 --> 00:11:31.800\nthe default domain policy, right?\n\n254\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.330\nWhen I get into that default\ndomain policy, yes I know,\n\n255\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.580\nI will not be editing it here.\n\n256\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.045\nAnd I look at the settings,\nand we do a show here.\n\n257\n00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:43.649\nWell, I've got password policy settings,\nright.\n\n258\n00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:47.269\nAnd what do these password\npolicy settings dictate, right?\n\n259\n00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:48.815\nThings like complexity.\n\n260\n00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:54.495\nHow many passwords do we have to cycle\nthrough before we can reuse passwords.\n\n261\n00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:57.605\nWe can control that here, right.\n\n262\n00:11:57.605 --> 00:11:59.405\nSo for instance let me go ahead and\nshow you.\n\n263\n00:11:59.405 --> 00:12:02.950\nI'll log out of this machine,\nactually, no, I'm not gonna log out.\n\n264\n00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.052\nI'm gonna do a Ctrl Alt Delete.\n\n265\n00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:06.810\nLet me change my password.\n\n266\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.710\nAll right,\nmy old super secret Microsoft password and\n\n267\n00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.025\nI'm just gonna put password,\nall lower case, right?\n\n268\n00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:18.605\nNow I say that hopefully I haven't\ndisabled the default domain policy and\n\n269\n00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:19.385\nnone of this is gonna work.\n\n270\n00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:22.165\nIt'd be no different than\na non domain environment.\n\n271\n00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:23.795\nAll right and I try to set it right?\n\n272\n00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:25.295\nNow remember I'm picking on Mike here.\n\n273\n00:12:25.295 --> 00:12:29.175\nHe's the administrator but\nhe has the rights to set that.\n\n274\n00:12:29.175 --> 00:12:33.725\nNo it says does not meet complexity\nrequirements and we can control that.\n\n275\n00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:37.149\nHowever if I switched over\nto a non domain join device.\n\n276\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.170\nAnd in this case,\nlet me just double check.\n\n277\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.920\nI can't remember if I joined\nthis one to the domain or not.\n\n278\n00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.130\nAnd there's ways around it, so.\n\n279\n00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.463\nOkay so it's in a work group, all right.\n\n280\n00:12:47.463 --> 00:12:52.795\nNow if I, let's say, go down here and\ndo like a GP edit, right, and we look at\n\n281\n00:12:52.795 --> 00:12:58.870\nwhat the local password policy is on this\nmachine and that's local versus domain.\n\n282\n00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.100\nIt's easier to set configuration\nsettings on a domain because you\n\n283\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.190\npush them out their group policy.\n\n284\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.580\nIt's not so easy on local machines, right?\n\n285\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.850\nLocal machines have become decentralized.\n\n286\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:13.450\nRight, and even more so,\nif you set defaults, and\n\n287\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.100\nwe come in here to, where is that?\n\n288\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.790\nSecurity settings, account policies,\nI believe, password policy?\n\n289\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.310\nThere's a big difference here, right?\n\n290\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.126\nHow many passwords do I have to cycle\nthrough before I can reuse one?\n\n291\n00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:26.470\nZero.\nWhat's that mean?\n\n292\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.590\nYou never change your password.\n\n293\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.500\nIt just means it doesn't\ncare about history.\n\n294\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.225\nSo I could use capital P@ssw0rd,\n\n295\n00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:38.400\nand then turn around and reset it to\nthe same password over and over, right.\n\n296\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.420\nSo that's essentially not really doing too\nmuch to protect your passwords, right.\n\n297\n00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.960\n42 days is the maximum days before\nI have to change a password.\n\n298\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.258\nMinimum password age zero,\nmeans it doesn't expire, right?\n\n299\n00:13:50.258 --> 00:13:54.906\nSo if I do the same thing that I\njust did on this machine, right, and\n\n300\n00:13:54.906 --> 00:14:00.480\nI decide I want to change my password,\nright, from something that is complex.\n\n301\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.020\nAnd I don't know, I don't mind showing\nyou guys, I trust you guys out there.\n\n302\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.520\nAll right and I set it, and this just\nguys, not kidding, this is password,\n\n303\n00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.210\nall lowercase, long as I can type that.\n\n304\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.530\nWait a second.\n\n305\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.650\nPassword's been changed.\n\n306\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.339\nSo understand that you can have issues\nwith your password and especially when it\n\n307\n00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:25.330\ncomes to the difference between domain\naccounts and local accounts, right?\n\n308\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.060\nDomain groups we can control.\n\n309\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.920\nThey're settings,\nwe can define the security settings.\n\n310\n00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.740\nLocal groups we cannot.\n\n311\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.700\nAnd that's where that kind\nof becomes a complexity.\n\n312\n00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.440\nSo we do have to watch that too.\n\n313\n00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.280\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that we have there,\n\n314\n00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.790\nthings like improper access,\nback door access.\n\n315\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.730\nWe talked about people setting\nbackdoor accounts, right.\n\n316\n00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.290\nThen you have an administrator that\ngets fired because they're lazy,\n\n317\n00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.090\nthey're not doing their work, and\nthey say, well that's okay, fire me.\n\n318\n00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:54.550\nI've got five accounts on\nseven different systems, and\n\n319\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.090\nI'm gonna get access\ninto your network again.\n\n320\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.250\nThat becomes a problem.\n\n321\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.560\nLike Mike said earlier, sometimes\nthe worst enemies are from within.\n\n322\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.470\nRight, enemy within, it sounds like\na movie or something like that, right?\n\n323\n00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:06.645\nBut it's true, right?\n\n324\n00:15:06.645 --> 00:15:10.630\nCuz if an administrator decides, well,\nyou know what, and I'm guilty of this.\n\n325\n00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.250\nLet me give you an example\nof where I'm guilty of this.\n\n326\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.170\nNot on the administrative level, but I\nneed to help somebody with their computer.\n\n327\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.590\nSo I wanted to make sure that they would\nnever forget their password again.\n\n328\n00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:20.670\nAnd if they did, it wouldn't matter, so\n\n329\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.610\nI put an administrative account\nthat they didn't know about, right?\n\n330\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.050\nNow my due diligence came out and\nI felt guilty about that.\n\n331\n00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.490\nAnd I told them about it and gave them the\npassword and said if you wanna delete it,\n\n332\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.000\nthat's okay.\n\n333\n00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.220\nBut it's gonna make it a lot easier for\n\n334\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.160\nme to get into your computer\nwhen you forget your password.\n\n335\n00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.850\nIt's still back door access and\ntechnically it's not ethical.\n\n336\n00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.650\nWhen it comes to any kind\nof systems administration.\n\n337\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.198\nDoesn't matter if you're talking\nabout it at an administrative level,\n\n338\n00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:46.252\nenterprise level, or you're talking about\njust dealing with a simple end user right?\n\n339\n00:15:46.252 --> 00:15:48.220\nWe try to follow a code of ethics.\n\n340\n00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.199\nSo back door access can be a problem too.\n\n341\n00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.697\nSo that's why you have to\nrun things like audits.\n\n342\n00:15:52.697 --> 00:15:56.901\nAnd I know you stressed this big in some\nof the higher end security courses that we\n\n343\n00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:57.885\nhave here.\n\n344\n00:15:57.885 --> 00:16:00.200\nAudit your systems,\nknow what's going on in your systems,\n\n345\n00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.690\nknow those groups,\nknow who has the administrative access.\n\n346\n00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.480\nYou can run things, for instance serve,\nyou can the Microsoft Baseline,\n\n347\n00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.350\nSecurity Analyzer and\nit'll flag a warning that says,\n\n348\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.960\nyou've got five accounts that\nhave administrative access.\n\n349\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.090\nHow many do we really need?\n\n350\n00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.110\nI don't know.\n\n351\n00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.410\nIf there are five and\n\n352\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.620\nonly four are documented, you might\nfind that there's a problem there.\n\n353\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.100\nSome of the other things that they\ncall out here too there, Mike,\n\n354\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.210\none of the things they\ncall out are ARP issues.\n\n355\n00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.710\nRight?\n\n356\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.410\nIs ARP an issue?\n\n357\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.020\nWell, it can be.\n\n358\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.800\nIf we talk about ARP and IPv4 sense.\n\n359\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.510\nARP and IPv6 is a little bit different.\n\n360\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.590\nIt's lumped into ICMP V6 so\nworks a little bit different, but\n\n361\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.790\nin IPv4 it works on broadcast\ncommunications, right?\n\n362\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.870\nSo what do I have to do in\norder to take an IP address and\n\n363\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.900\nresolve it to a MAC address?\n\n364\n00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.050\nWe use ARP, all right?\n\n365\n00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:55.100\nThat tells me hey, somebody is trying to\nfind this computer's physical location.\n\n366\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.910\nBut what if I'm not doing that with the\nintentions of just normal communications?\n\n367\n00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.430\nWhat if I'm doing it maliciously?\n\n368\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.750\nWhat if we call out to the network and\n\n369\n00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:06.829\nI say your MAC address is at my IP address\nor your IP address is at my MAC address?\n\n370\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.630\nIf I can tell everybody else in\nthe network on my local network there\n\n371\n00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.810\nthat that Mac address that's supposed\nto be sending information to you\n\n372\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.210\nis actually my address right?\n\n373\n00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.670\nNow I've poisoned the ARP table\nfrom every other machine.\n\n374\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.020\nAnd any time they send something out\nthey think they're send it to you and\n\n375\n00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.440\nthey're actually sending it to me.\n\n376\n00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.340\nSo ARP has issues.\n\n377\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.570\nNow ARP, in fairness, they have to\nhave physical access to your network.\n\n378\n00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.100\nAnd we commonly say that if they've\ngot physical access to your network,\n\n379\n00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.032\nyou've got more problems to\nworry about than just ARP, but\n\n380\n00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:37.510\nit is one of those things\nthat you have to be aware of.\n\n381\n00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.190\nAll right, let's see, a couple of\nother things that they call out,\n\n382\n00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.770\nthey call out jamming, right?\n\n383\n00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.320\nAnd we were kinda joking around this.\n\n384\n00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.330\nThis isn't Bob Marley.\n\n385\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.232\nWe're not jamming.\n\n386\n00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.010\nIt's not my guitar,\nthat's sitting in the car.\n\n387\n00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.040\nThis is when you literally,\nyou could almost\n\n388\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.940\nsee it as a form of denial of service\nattack, right, on wireless networks.\n\n389\n00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.170\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah.\n\n390\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.690\n&gt;&gt; If I can send out signals that do\nnot allow any other wireless network\n\n391\n00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:00.790\n&gt;&gt; Or wireless device upsetting so\n\n392\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.810\nmuch radiated energy out\nthat I'm interfering, right?\n\n393\n00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.310\nElectromagnetic interference,\n\n394\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.190\nradio frequency interference,\nit's all the electromagnetic spectrum,\n\n395\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.840\njust depends on which side of\nthe tracks you're on, EMI, RFI.\n\n396\n00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.090\nThen you can't connect\nto your network either.\n\n397\n00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.780\nSo, jamming can be a problem too.\n\n398\n00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.830\nIt can be a form of a denial service\nattack, so we have to worry about that.\n\n399\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.510\nAll right, Michael, let's see.\n\n400\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.480\nI do have one other thing\nthat I wanna talk about, and\n\n401\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.480\nthat's something known as banner grabbing.\n\n402\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.570\nAnd they lump this together with OUI.\n\n403\n00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.390\nAnd I actually had to talk\nto one of our other hosts.\n\n404\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.420\nI go, why did they put together\nOUI with banner grabbing.\n\n405\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:36.940\nRecognizance.\n\n406\n00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:40.360\nIt's all about how much information\nI can scrape off your network, so\n\n407\n00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.280\nI know what your systems are and I can\ntailor make my attacks to whatever I find.\n\n408\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.950\nRight.\n\n409\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.960\nSo for instance if I'm on,\nlet's see ,what machine am I on?\n\n410\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.780\nI've gotta figure out which\nmachine I'm on now, okay.\n\n411\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.880\nSo let's go ahead, let's take something\nlike for instance the client.\n\n412\n00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.250\nNow keep in mind, I've shown you\nthat the client that I logged into,\n\n413\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.040\na Windows 10 machine,\nit is not a domain computer, right?\n\n414\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.360\nIt is a separate computer.\n\n415\n00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.560\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer here.\n\n416\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.330\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlet's launch up, not the start menu,\n\n417\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.620\nthat's not what we want.\n\n418\n00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.660\nLet's launch up something like Telnet.\n\n419\n00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.820\nWhat Telnet?\n\n420\n00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.360\nWhy are we gonna use Telnet?\n\n421\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.700\nCan we scrape information with Telnet?\n\n422\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.720\nYeah, Mike's over here giving that\njust let me get a hold of it, right?\n\n423\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.540\nLet me show what I mean.\n\n424\n00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.410\nSo if I do something like Telnet, right?\n\n425\n00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.890\nAnd I, whatever the target might be, in\nthis case it's the server that we've been\n\n426\n00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.750\ndealing with and, no there's not\nbackslashes in an IP address by the way,\n\n427\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.570\njust letting you know that guys.\n\n428\n00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.830\n251, I think, no that's the centOS box.\n\n429\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.190\nGet my IP addresses right.\n\n430\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.920\nAnd I do something like this and I do 25.\n\n431\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.550\nWhat did I just do?\n\n432\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.050\nI set a Telnet request on port 25\nto see if the port was open, right?\n\n433\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Can you do into that port process?\n\n434\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I can, but\n\n435\n00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.300\nlike Mike wants to see here,\n&gt;&gt; Notice what it tells me.\n\n436\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.020\nIt tells me the name of the computer,\nright, then a little name resolution here.\n\n437\n00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:12.090\nIt tells me that this is Microsoft\nEnhance, I think it is, SMTP Mail Service.\n\n438\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.470\nAnd it tells me what the version is and\nit's ready and it tells me the date.\n\n439\n00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.850\nThank you, so i can make sure\nthat my attack is on time, right?\n\n440\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.450\nSo, we look at it.\n\n441\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.830\nI've got some information here.\n\n442\n00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.550\nI can do other things too like for\ninstance.\n\n443\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.150\nLet me go ahead and Control C out of this.\n\n444\n00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.910\nI might have to actually shut this\n\n445\n00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.570\ndown I don't think those TelNet\nconnections like to be Controled C.\n\n446\n00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.130\nAll right how about this too.\n\n447\n00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.350\nWe talk about things like FTP.\n\n448\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.940\nFTP is the problem, right?\n\n449\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.940\nFTP, unencrypted, but I can also\n\n450\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.850\nuse FTP to grab some information\nabout the server as well, right.\n\n451\n00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.090\nOther than the fact that it's running FTP.\n\n452\n00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.665\nSo for instance,\nI can do an FTP into that same machine.\n\n453\n00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:57.637\n.0.13.124 all right.\n\n454\n00:20:57.637 --> 00:21:01.120\nAnd I don't even have\nto connect all right?\n\n455\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.390\nWe could go on for\nanother hour about clear text and\n\n456\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.670\nplain text protocols right and\nwhy you shouldn't be using them.\n\n457\n00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.980\nI'm not going to be using\nFTP in my networks.\n\n458\n00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.900\nI'm gonna be using secure FTP, but\nI'm not going to be using plain text FTP.\n\n459\n00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.360\nAnd at this point, it isn't about\nan exploitation of the protocol and\n\n460\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.100\ndoing an FTP bounce attack, or\ncontrolling your server for that matter.\n\n461\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.125\nThis is just about the fact that,\nwell guess what?\n\n462\n00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:27.090\n[LAUGH] I know you're\nrunning the FTP service.\n\n463\n00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.900\nWe would hope that you don't have\nanonymous authentication turned on because\n\n464\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.060\nthen it gets even worse.\n\n465\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.440\nBut I at least know the information.\n\n466\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.706\nSo when I talk about banner grabbing,\nyou can, what is a banner?\n\n467\n00:21:36.706 --> 00:21:39.280\nI guess, thinking about, we got\na banner up here, it's gonna fall and\n\n468\n00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.440\nit's gonna say happy birthday, no.\n\n469\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.070\nLet me step back a little bit guys.\n\n470\n00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.730\nA banner is really just any kind of,\nit's a welcome message on\n\n471\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.130\nthe network that's sent back to you and\nresponse to a service.\n\n472\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:53.080\nRight, you can see that when we tested\nTelnet with port 25 it said yeah,\n\n473\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.420\nbanner said here, welcome.\n\n474\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.040\nSMTP, ESMTP in Microsoft lingo.\n\n475\n00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.140\nAnd in this case I haven't\neven authenticated.\n\n476\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.900\nI don't have to.\n\n477\n00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.650\nLook, failed.\n\n478\n00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.820\nI don't care, that's not what I want.\n\n479\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.940\nAgain like we said with OUIs, it's about\nthe information that i can get off your\n\n480\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.360\nnetwork to know what systems\nare running on your network and\n\n481\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.070\nwhat avenues of attack,\nwhat exploits are out there.\n\n482\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.330\nI don't know, their vulnerabilities?\n\n483\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:21.610\nWell I could start by saying Google,\nFTP, Microsoft, vulnerabilities.\n\n484\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.530\nAnd I can guarantee you, somebody\nout there's got some kinda database.\n\n485\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.290\nYeah.\nLet's put your little cute\n\n486\n00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.380\npuppy JPEG in there with this little bit\nof extra information that sum it up to\n\n487\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.280\nthe FTP server.\n\n488\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.810\nNow you got control over it, and\n\n489\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.690\nyou could use their FTP server\nto attack somebody else.\n\n490\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.595\nThese are security issues and\nyou have to know how to resolve them.\n\n491\n00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:41.485\nSo make sure that you're aware of these,\nmake sure you know what they are, and\n\n492\n00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:46.545\nnot only for an exam purposes, make sure\nyou know how to resolve some of them.\n\n493\n00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:50.942\nFTP in this case, if I'm not using FTP,\nthen I need to come back to my server, and\n\n494\n00:22:50.942 --> 00:22:54.821\nI need to do, and I'm not gonna do this,\ncuz it could take a little bit,\n\n495\n00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:59.572\nactually you know what, I'll tell you what\nMike, let's go ahead and we'll do this.\n\n496\n00:22:59.572 --> 00:23:03.412\nJust for the sake of doing another\nerror ball here on camera.\n\n497\n00:23:03.412 --> 00:23:07.743\n[LAUGH] So we'll do Next and\nwe'll go through here real quick.\n\n498\n00:23:07.743 --> 00:23:12.399\nOop, just a bit outside past my INS\nserver, and I'm gonna uncheck FTP.\n\n499\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.240\nAll right.\nAnd it goes through the removal process.\n\n500\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.030\nI don't know how long this\nis going to take, and\n\n501\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.850\nit really isn't the point\nof how long it takes.\n\n502\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.290\nThe point is remember like we\nsaid in the first part of this,\n\n503\n00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.160\nif you don't need that service,\nyou turn the service off.\n\n504\n00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.520\nCloses the port down.\n\n505\n00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.790\nI'm not using the service at all?\n\n506\n00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.900\nI shouldn't even have it installed.\n\n507\n00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.580\nWhy?\n\n508\n00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.410\nWell, because I know that\nI'm not using it, but\n\n509\n00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.910\ndoes Mike not know that it's not using it?\n\n510\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.680\nIf I don't have change\ndocumentation in here,\n\n511\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.330\nMike says, you've got an FTP server\nrunning, but it's turned off!\n\n512\n00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.870\nLet me turn it on for you, right?\n\n513\n00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.290\nNow, I know Mike's not going to do that.\n\n514\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.470\nBut the point is,\nsomebody else might do that.\n\n515\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.027\n&gt;&gt; He doesn't know me very well.\n\n516\n00:23:49.027 --> 00:23:52.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Like I said,\nthis whole time he's been back here going,\n\n517\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.740\nI could not wait to get on the network and\nsee your server.\n\n518\n00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.590\nAll right, and you gotta understand\nthat he's playing the role that\n\n519\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.260\na lot of other people might\nplay to attack your networks.\n\n520\n00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.870\nBe aware of these things,\nand it can help you a lot,\n\n521\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:06.800\nsave you a lot of money, but\nalso can help you pass the Comp T exam.\n\n522\n00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.070\n&gt;&gt; That's what it's all about right?\n\n523\n00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.580\nPassing that exam, getting that\ncertification, so I can get out there and\n\n524\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.700\nland that big job.\n\n525\n00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.540\nAlright Wes,\nwe appreciate that great look there.\n\n526\n00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.900\nSome of the security issues that, the some\nmore common security issues that we need\n\n527\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.980\nto be able to identify,\ntroubleshoot, and resolve.\n\n528\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.120\nSo we appreciate that West.\n\n529\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.510\nGreat demonstration there.\n\n530\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.330\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n531\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.980\nSinging off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Mike Roderick\n\n532\n00:24:30.980 -->

may experience.\n\n8\n00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.880\nWith us a today, we have Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.560\nWes Bryan in studio, thank you for\njoining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.450\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee, thanks for\nhaving me back, that's right,\n\n11\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.380\nwe're gonna to look at, well,\nthe other side of the tracks, right?\n\n12\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.270\nSo far we've been talking a lot about some\ncommon network issues that we can see and\n\n13\n00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.470\nwe've really been talking about\ninside of our networks, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.630\nWell most of the topics that you're\ngonna hear within this episode\n\n15\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.460\nwe've really already covered so\nwe're gonna recap some of them.\n\n16\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.490\nSome of them are new and\n\n17\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.620\nwill be specific if you will to\nthe WAN side of the communication.\n\n18\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.660\nBut really when it comes down to networks,\nsome of these issues can be within\n\n19\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.605\nyour network,\nsome of them could be on the ISP side.\n\n20\n00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:07.505\nWhat that boils down to is, well if\nit's on our side of the network, right?\n\n21\n00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:10.895\nAnd when I say, remember I said in a past\nepisode I talked about the demarcation,\n\n22\n00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:11.615\ndemark, right?\n\n23\n00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:15.670\nThat's the point of responsibility, that's\nthe point where the carrier's network, or\n\n24\n00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.920\nfacilities, faculties if you will,\nthey come in to your network and beyond\n\n25\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.745\nthat demarcation point is where you are\ngonna have the point of responsibility.\n\n26\n00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:30.700\nSo when we look at it, some of the things\nthat are on the ISP side, maybe you\n\n27\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.620\ncan handle, but a lot of times you can't,\nthere's nothing really that you can do.\n\n28\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.980\nOther than maybe look at your SLA and\n\n29\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.030\nsee if the ISP is meeting the service\nlevel agreement that you've signed onto.\n\n30\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.460\nSo some of the things\nthat they talk about,\n\n31\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.260\nright, are loss of internet connectivity.\n\n32\n00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.240\nLet's start simple,\nwe say simple fixes first.\n\n33\n00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.160\nDid you pay the bill?\n\n34\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.310\nIf you don't pay the bill you might\nhave a loss of Internet connectivity so\n\n35\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.230\nas much as sometimes we joke around\nyou do have to keep that in mind too.\n\n36\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.570\nLoss of Internet connectivity that's\ngonna be one that you're gonna\n\n37\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.390\nhave to troubleshoot.\n\n38\n00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.750\nIs it the actual WAN side?\n\n39\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.020\nThis is where things like route\nredundancy come into play.\n\n40\n00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.090\nIf you are an autonomous system and you\nwanna make sure that maybe you have route\n\n41\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.260\nconnections to two different\nautonomous systems.\n\n42\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.010\nMaybe two different providers.\n\n43\n00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.230\nIf you need high availability\nwithin your networks.\n\n44\n00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.344\nI know, here we're actually\nconnected to two different ISPs.\n\n45\n00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:31.966\nWe're connected to the Gainesville\nRegional Utilities, G-R-U, sometimes,\n\n46\n00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:33.840\nyou'll hear us call it gru.com, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.760\nIt's just G-R-U.com, gru.com.\n\n48\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.690\nWe're also connected to another\ncommunications provider, and\n\n49\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.260\nthat's Cox Communication.\n\n50\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.580\nAnd why are we doing that, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.260\nWell, when it comes to loss of\nInternet connectivity, if, let's say,\n\n52\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.870\nsomething happens to GRU.com,\nand it does happen,\n\n53\n00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.010\nwe've got some construction that goes on\naround Gainesville, from time to time.\n\n54\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.230\nIn fact, there's a lot of construction\nthat goes on, and a crew can accidentally,\n\n55\n00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.720\nand, again,\nwe're not placing blaming blame here,\n\n56\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.040\njust Crew can accidentally\ncut a fiber optic line.\n\n57\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.700\nI know they did this out by the airport,\n\n58\n00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.920\nthe Gainesville Regional Airport\nat one point.\n\n59\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.880\nI think it was the city that\naccidentally cut one of those lines.\n\n60\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.610\nAnd this is a couple years back and\nwe lost connectivity for,\n\n61\n00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.710\nI wanna say, for a good four hours.\n\n62\n00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.470\nWhy?\nWell,\n\n63\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.210\nit's a fiber optic backbone that they cut,\nand\n\n64\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.740\nwe're not talking about just putting a\nlittle electrical tape, right, around it.\n\n65\n00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.700\nIt's a fiber optic line, right?\n\n66\n00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.040\nSo it's gonna take them time.\n\n67\n00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.910\nThey've gotta find out where the break is.\n\n68\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.290\nThat happens to be an excavating crew,\n\n69\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.820\nchances are they know right away at least\nwithin five feet where the break is.\n\n70\n00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.390\nBut they may get somebody out\nthere it takes time to fix.\n\n71\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.250\nSo, that's why when you have things like\nroute redundancy or you're connected\n\n72\n00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.170\nto different providers, you're connected\nto multiple autonomous systems.\n\n73\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.670\nIn case the path through one\nautonomous system fails, or\n\n74\n00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.540\nthe connection to a single\nInternet provider fails.\n\n75\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.720\nYou can fail over to the next connection,\nand\n\n76\n00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.325\nhopefully, the goal is that you don't have\na complete Internet connectivity loss.\n\n77\n00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:03.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like someone in our chat had\nposted, oops, when you hear that word,\n\n78\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.580\nit's a little scary sometimes, oops.\n\n79\n00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and somebody accidentally\nhit the kill switch engage, right?.\n\n80\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.730\nSo be careful, right.\n\n81\n00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.575\nThere's a reason they have signs\nthat says call before you dig.\n\n82\n00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:16.750\n[LAUGH] And\nI've worked on an excavating crew before,\n\n83\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.540\nso I think I've actually been the cause\nof one of these once or twice.\n\n84\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.270\nSo it can happen, it's fairly easy.\n\n85\n00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.570\nThe other thing that they call out\nare things like interface errors.\n\n86\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.060\nLike we've mentioned in the past episode,\nwe mentioned about interface errors.\n\n87\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.210\nWhen it comes down to it\nthere's gonna be checking.\n\n88\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.340\nIf you're talking WAN communications\nyou're probably talking about checking\n\n89\n00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.730\nthe logs within your router itself.\n\n90\n00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.530\nThe system logs if it happens to be that.\n\n91\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.522\nIf you're firewall is directly connected,\n\n92\n00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:49.030\nthen it might be firewall logs that you're\nchecking depends on what the device is.\n\n93\n00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.620\nI know we have the next generation\nmultifunctional devices that are doing\n\n94\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.130\neverything.\n\n95\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.861\nEverything except for\nmaking the coffee and\n\n96\n00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:59.820\nhaving it ready when you come into work,\nbut so it depends on what the device is.\n\n97\n00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.590\nLike for instance if it happens to\nbe inside of your network like we've\n\n98\n00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.600\ntalked about, I can drop down\nlike a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n99\n00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.620\nI can drop down something like for\ninstance like command prompt, and\n\n100\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.600\nif I want to bring up a command\nprompt I can run I don't know,\n\n101\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.470\nsomething like NetStat, right?\n\n102\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.030\nThat font is really really\nsmall here guys, sorry,\n\n103\n00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.600\ndidn't mean to give you guys brain\naneurysms out there trying to see it.\n\n104\n00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.730\nLet's bump that up just a little bit.\n\n105\n00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.920\nThere we go, make it a little easier.\n\n106\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.700\nSo we can run something like,\nfor instance, we can run NetStat.\n\n107\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.850\nAnd if I run NetStat with a E switch,\nwrite -E -echo, if you will.\n\n108\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.362\nThat's short for Ethernet Statistics.\n\n109\n00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.100\nSo that'll give us the Ethernet\nstatistics that I have.\n\n110\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.100\nA lot of times today,\n\n111\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.620\nyou're not gonna see errors present\nwithin your network adapters, and\n\n112\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.050\nif I run this, sure enough, I can see\nthat I don't have any errors present.\n\n113\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.090\nErrors could be, for instance, you could\nhave damaged the lines, damaged media that\n\n114\n00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.640\nmight be causing this problem, so again\nyou do have ways to check this out, right?\n\n115\n00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.790\nYou have things like for\ninstance your network packet analyzers,\n\n116\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.210\nprotocol analyzers that you can find\nout What's going on on the network,\n\n117\n00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.580\nwhat is sending traffic?\n\n118\n00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.470\n&gt;&gt; Trace route.\n\n119\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.320\n&gt;&gt; Trace RT's another great one.\n\n120\n00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.220\nTrace route if you're in\nthe Unix based systems.\n\n121\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.608\nTrace RT if you're in Windows.\n\n122\n00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:18.920\nIf I wanna see, okay if we're having\nsome kind of intermittent connectivity,\n\n123\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.150\nI might do for instance a trace RT\nto something like www.google.com.\n\n124\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.510\nAs hard as it is for me to spell it and\nthen again, you just let it run and\n\n125\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.680\nit might take a bit, and then when\nwe can find out things like latency.\n\n126\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.700\nThat's another thing that\nwe have to worry about.\n\n127\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.850\nLatency, latency can be due to quite\na few different things, right?\n\n128\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.000\nLatency could be electromagnetic\ninterference, right?\n\n129\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.620\nThere might be some kind of\ninterference that's causing latency.\n\n130\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.840\nNow, this is actually what you might see,\n\n131\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.391\nright here when you aren't\ngetting any communication.\n\n132\n00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:55.656\nNow you have to understand with trace RT,\nit also uses ICMP,\n\n133\n00:06:55.656 --> 00:06:59.944\nthe Internet Control Message Protocol,\nand a lot of times people like that to be\n\n134\n00:06:59.944 --> 00:07:03.803\nblocked because they don't want you\nto see that information, right?\n\n135\n00:07:03.803 --> 00:07:05.970\nYou know, like attacks right?\n\n136\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.582\nYou can formulate things\nlike attacks there.\n\n137\n00:07:08.582 --> 00:07:11.186\nActually denial of service attacks and\nstuff, so\n\n138\n00:07:11.186 --> 00:07:13.860\nI'm not actually sure that\nthis one's gonna get.\n\n139\n00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.266\nActually you know what let's\ndrop down to the max terminal.\n\n140\n00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.018\nThat one might do a little bit better and\n\n141\n00:07:19.018 --> 00:07:21.470\nwe'll use the one that\nMs Cherokee was talking about.\n\n142\n00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.560\nWe use trace route, all right.\n\n143\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.988\nDoing pretty much the same thing but\nthe difference here is, yu are,\n\n144\n00:07:28.988 --> 00:07:31.962\nwell, if I could spell it right.\n\n145\n00:07:31.962 --> 00:07:36.780\nYou're spelling traceroute out,\nand, if I do www.google.com, and\n\n146\n00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.340\nrun it, this might run a little quicker.\n\n147\n00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.609\nYeah, and it might be the virtual\nmachine that is having an issue with it.\n\n148\n00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.643\nBut, you can see that I\nstart to information, right,\n\n149\n00:07:45.643 --> 00:07:50.993\nas it's making its way, trace RT is\ntelling me the hops that this is going\n\n150\n00:07:50.993 --> 00:07:57.156\nthrough on its way from my computer here\nout to, in this case, Google's website.\n\n151\n00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:59.702\nAnd I can see that,\nwell, I can see, again,\n\n152\n00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:03.240\nthat we're getting some\nkind of request timed out.\n\n153\n00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.100\nAnd that's okay.\n\n154\n00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.750\nThere's no problem with that because,\nagain, that might not be the fact that I'm\n\n155\n00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.452\nnot communicating, it just might be the\nfact that wherever that device is isn't\n\n156\n00:08:11.452 --> 00:08:14.140\nletting me know that it's there for\nsecurity purposes.\n\n157\n00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.780\nHowever, I can see some pretty\ninteresting information just right here.\n\n158\n00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.538\nRemember, I told you guys that\nour provider is GRUCom, right?\n\n159\n00:08:21.538 --> 00:08:22.160\nI's GRU.\n\n160\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.440\nWell, I can see that when I'm sending\na packet of information from myself to\n\n161\n00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.680\nGoogle, I can see right here\nthat we have GRUCom, right?\n\n162\n00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.750\nThis is GRU, Gainesville Regional Utility.\n\n163\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.170\nAnd it bumps on their network.\n\n164\n00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.110\nAnd then, in fact,\nyou can see this is gru.\n\n165\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.300\nAnd it's kind of interesting,\napparently, this is Juniper router-\n\n166\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.810\n&gt;&gt; Juniper router, yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.140\n&gt;&gt; Right, we could see, and\nthis is why Cherokee and\n\n168\n00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.520\nI mentioned security purposes.\n\n169\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.920\nThey might not want you\nto see this information.\n\n170\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.480\n&gt;&gt; To know all that.\nTheir hardware, right.\n\n171\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.170\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n172\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.180\nWe start doing device fingerprinting and\nnow we can lien a tax.\n\n173\n00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.970\nBut I digress cuz this\nisn't a security episode.\n\n174\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.170\nBut what's kinda really cool\nis I can turn around and\n\n175\n00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.360\nI can see that once we get\ndown to this area, right?\n\n176\n00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.710\nGRU dumps us right off onto, actually,\n\n177\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.340\none of the major NOCs, network operation\ncenters, in all of Florida, here.\n\n178\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Hubs, yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.660\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThis is a level three.\n\n180\n00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.470\n&gt;&gt; Love living down south.\n\n181\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.560\n&gt;&gt; There you go, that's right.\n\n182\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.900\nAnd this is a major, major building.\n\n183\n00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.360\nThis is level three.\n\n184\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.260\nThey're one of the Internet\nbackbone providers.\n\n185\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.460\nNow, when it comes to things like latency,\n\n186\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.020\ninterference, What can we\ndo with this information?\n\n187\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.680\nWell, here's what I can do.\n\n188\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.960\nIn this area where I see my local ISP,\nI can call them, right?\n\n189\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.740\nI've got an SLA.\n\n190\n00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.017\nI've got a service level agreement\nthat defines a certain level of\n\n191\n00:09:38.288 --> 00:09:40.420\nAcceptable performance.\n\n192\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.790\nAnd if I don't see that, if I see that\nmaybe these asterisks here are happening\n\n193\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.580\nup here, right after,\nthis is our public IP address.\n\n194\n00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.490\nIt leaves our gateway,\nhops on GRU.com's network, and\n\n195\n00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.899\nI start getting these issues right here.\n\n196\n00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.100\nWell, maybe, and I can usually tell this\nbecause they don't usually block this\n\n197\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.740\ninformation, that maybe\nwe need to call GRUcom.\n\n198\n00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.930\nHowever, Cherokee,\nI got a question for you.\n\n199\n00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; What do you think I could do if I find\n\n200\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.120\nout that level three is having the issue?\n\n201\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.720\nCan I call them and do anything about it?\n\n202\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.940\n&gt;&gt; You can relay the message to your ISP.\n\n203\n00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.430\nBut what they do with that information,\nyou're kind of,\n\n204\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.200\nyou got your hands tied in that situation.\n\n205\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.358\nBut I would always call them.\n\n206\n00:10:18.358 --> 00:10:22.060\nI've worked for companies where there are\nissues, and because you are paying, and\n\n207\n00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.560\nsometimes a premium,\ndepending on that level of service,\n\n208\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.630\nthey do give you discounts on your bills.\n\n209\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.170\nEven in my personal home environment,\n\n210\n00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.136\nI know you've heard me\ncomplain about it before.\n\n211\n00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:34.200\n[LAUGH] But I do.\n\n212\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.030\nIf they're not gonna hold up\ntheir end of the bargain,\n\n213\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.310\nthen why should you hold up yours if you\nhave a service level agreement in place?\n\n214\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n215\n00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.620\nAnd with the Internet backbone providers,\ngotta say something honestly guys, there's\n\n216\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.990\nnot really much you're gonna be able to do\nwhen it comes to the backbone providers.\n\n217\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.510\nAnd why do I say that?\n\n218\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:57.980\nWell, the backbone providers,\nthey are ones that when you\n\n219\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.370\nhear of the issue, by the time you've seen\nthe issue they already know about it.\n\n220\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.140\nThey've got the best in the world.\n\n221\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.870\nNow, the other thing that they call out\nhere is, they call it Split Horizon.\n\n222\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.580\nWe've talked about Split Horizon\nin another episode.\n\n223\n00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.933\nAnd I've got a kind of a diagram\nhere that, just as a quick recap,\n\n224\n00:11:17.933 --> 00:11:22.774\nremember Split Horizon's helps us\nto solve things like routing loops.\n\n225\n00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:27.410\nAnd Split Horizon's, for the most\npart used with your distance vector\n\n226\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.530\nprotocols cuz they're very\nsusceptible to routing loops.\n\n227\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.400\nBut remember that routers,\nwhat they do is they advertise\n\n228\n00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.410\ntheir routing table to their nearest\nneighbors like, for instance, right,\n\n229\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.910\nlike router one is doing here.\n\n230\n00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:44.940\nAnd then Split Horizons, essentially\nwhat it does is it says if I've learned\n\n231\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.380\nif router two here, it goes to broadcast\nit's information, it's routing table,\n\n232\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.030\nit says, well, wait a second, I learned\nabout that route from router one.\n\n233\n00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.710\nSo I don't really need to send that\ninformation back to you, right?\n\n234\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.800\nYou already know about it,\nyou told me about it.\n\n235\n00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.440\nI don't need to sit there and\nbroadcast back to you.\n\n236\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.160\nSo, like I've done in the past,\nthere probably wouldn't even be this arrow\n\n237\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.620\nhere because it's not even gonna\nmake its way out of that interface.\n\n238\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.280\nSo essentially, what it does\nis it stops the routing loops.\n\n239\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.680\nAnd again, when we're talking\nabout our WAN communications,\n\n240\n00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.570\na lot of times we're talking, working\nits way over a routed infrastructure.\n\n241\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.850\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that they call out to.\n\n242\n00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.940\nThey call out things\nlike satellite latency.\n\n243\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.633\nAnd I know I'm kinda jumping out of\norder here on you there, Cherokee.\n\n244\n00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:31.270\nSince we've talked kind of about latency,\nwe talk about satellite, right?\n\n245\n00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.000\nSo, I got a little diagram here\nthat we've also seen before.\n\n246\n00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.980\nRemember that satellite, we're talking\nabout a line of sight communication.\n\n247\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.200\nNow, it's one of the most geographically\n\n248\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.660\nlong distance line of\nsight communications.\n\n249\n00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.980\nAnd because of that,\n\n250\n00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.530\nthere is an inherent amount of\nlatency in satellite communications.\n\n251\n00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.570\nSometimes it's not really good for\nthings like streaming, can cause issues.\n\n252\n00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.600\nBut there's not really anything that you\ncan do about that for the most part.\n\n253\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.360\nIf you are using satellite\ncommunications and\n\n254\n00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.140\nthere happens to be latency,\nunfortunately what do you do?\n\n255\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.170\nIt's not like you can go out and\nyou can launch a rocket and\n\n256\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.940\ngo fix the satellite, right?\n\n257\n00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.630\nSo more often than not, it can be affected\nby things like weather conditions.\n\n258\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.240\nAnd there again,\nyou can't really change the weather.\n\n259\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.110\nSo it is also something that\nyou have to worry about, too.\n\n260\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.620\nAll right, a couple of the other\nthings that they mention.\n\n261\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.320\nWe've already talked about interference.\n\n262\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.010\nKeep in mind, interference might\nbe something that you can help,\n\n263\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.000\nmight be something that you can't help,\nright?\n\n264\n00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.548\nIf it's electromagnetic interference and\nit's happening because of things like\n\n265\n00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:39.650\nhigh-voltage power lines,\nyou can't move the lines.\n\n266\n00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.310\nYou can't move your building.\n\n267\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.670\nSo really,\nthere's nothing that you can do about it.\n\n268\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:44.520\nSo what can you do?\n\n269\n00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.387\nWell, you implement a thing,\nif it gets too bad,\n\n270\n00:13:46.387 --> 00:13:48.130\nyou implement things\nlike shielded cabling.\n\n271\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.470\nMore expensive, but\nit might be what you need.\n\n272\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.130\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes,\n\n273\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:58.100\nshielding is a great suggestion, but\nwhat if it still seems to be an issue?\n\n274\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.690\nFiber optic, we still have that, right?\n\n275\n00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.090\nIf our budgets allow for that?\n\n276\n00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if we could afford it,\nthat's right.\n\n277\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.700\nBecause if electromagnetic\ninterferences so\n\n278\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.460\nbad that the shielding is not doing it,\nyou implement fiber.\n\n279\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.650\nAnd now you got a light source, and\n\n280\n00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.520\nyou don't have electromagnetic\nenergy that you have to worry about.\n\n281\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.490\nSo fiber is also an option, too.\n\n282\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.130\nIt's certainly does raise the price.\n\n283\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.350\nAll right, Cherokee,\nwhat else do we got here?\n\n284\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.280\nWe've got a couple of other\nthings that I want to mention.\n\n285\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.270\nThey talk about router\nconfiguration errors.\n\n286\n00:14:24.758 --> 00:14:27.570\nThat's really just going to be\nsomething of knowing how your routers\n\n287\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:28.620\nare configured.\n\n288\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.140\nOne of the things that you can do\nis implement change management and\n\n289\n00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.180\nalso configuration management.\n\n290\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.180\nI think you've all ready stressed\nthis about documentation, right?\n\n291\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.210\nHave your current configuration documented\nso that if there is a configuration issue,\n\n292\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.570\nyou can compare it back to a baseline and\nsay, I can see the baseline and I\n\n293\n00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.360\nknow that this isn't configured correctly,\nso we need to put it back into place.\n\n294\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.310\nOther things, too.\n\n295\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.130\nDNS issues.\n\n296\n00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.960\nWhen it comes to a DNS issue,\nif it's your ISP, a local ISP,\n\n297\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.010\nyou might be able to call them.\n\n298\n00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.890\nThe other thing that you might consider,\n\n299\n00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:04.020\ntoo, is if it's on an internal network\nyou maybe have an internal DNS server.\n\n300\n00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.160\nYou might be forwarding external\nDNS requests to an ISP.\n\n301\n00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.360\nCheck your DNS settings on your server,\n\n302\n00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.440\nmake sure that it's forwarding\nthem appropriately.\n\n303\n00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.810\nThese could be configuration errors,\nthey could be communication errors, too.\n\n304\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.530\nYou can use things like nslookup\nlike we've talked about before.\n\n305\n00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.570\nYou can use things like ping as well,\n\n306\n00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.360\ntracert to see if you can\ncommunicate with a DNS server.\n\n307\n00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.640\nYou can change, too.\n\n308\n00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.570\nYou can tell your machine that,\nno, I don't wanna use\n\n309\n00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:36.470\nwhen I'm testing DNS issue, I don't wanna\nuse the server that we're currently using.\n\n310\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.270\nI wanna use another one.\n\n311\n00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.770\nSo let me give you an example\nhere on my Windows 10 machine.\n\n312\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.030\nIf I did something like NS Lookup, right?\n\n313\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:49.710\nAnd I did www.google.com, right?\n\n314\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.948\nThat gives me the ability to find\nout can we resolve the name, right?\n\n315\n00:15:53.948 --> 00:15:56.314\nAnd I would expect that, yes,\nwe can resolve the name.\n\n316\n00:15:56.314 --> 00:15:58.254\nAt least that is what I am hoping, right?\n\n317\n00:15:58.254 --> 00:16:00.648\nAnd I get a reply back.\n\n318\n00:16:00.648 --> 00:16:03.881\nBut Maybe I can't resolve the name.\n\n319\n00:16:03.881 --> 00:16:06.596\nSo, one of the things that\nI can do is I can do an 8.\n\n320\n00:16:06.596 --> 00:16:08.629\nAnd it's kinda funny, I'm gonna turn\naround and bounce it off of Google here.\n\n321\n00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:09.283\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n322\n00:16:09.283 --> 00:16:14.360\n&gt;&gt; I can tell it, don't use\nthe interface configured DNS server.\n\n323\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.440\nUse whichever server it is,\na DNS server you want to bounce it off.\n\n324\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.506\nNow isn't it interesting that I did\nget a different set of results?\n\n325\n00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:27.835\nThis is Google's authoritative server so I\nasked Google, how do I find your web page?\n\n326\n00:16:27.835 --> 00:16:30.050\nAnd it gave me a whole\nbunch of information.\n\n327\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.926\nSo that might be something that you can\ndo too if you have an interface defined.\n\n328\n00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:36.845\nWhen I say interface defined,\nit could be the default gateway.\n\n329\n00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:40.421\nWhich means you're doing nothing but\npassing that DNS query off to the router.\n\n330\n00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:43.570\nThat turns around and forwards it\nright to your ISP's DNS server.\n\n331\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.260\nIf that happens to be the problem,\nthen do what I did right here and\n\n332\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.500\nbounce it off another server, right?\n\n333\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.580\nSo this is 8.8.8.8, I can turn around and\ndo that same thing.\n\n334\n00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.260\nAnd how about we change it to one\nof Google's other servers, r ight?\n\n335\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.500\nAnd I get the same approach.\n\n336\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.395\nMaybe I don't want to use Google at all.\n\n337\n00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:03.968\nAnd I do something like 4.2.2,\nif I type the IP address right.\n\n338\n00:17:03.968 --> 00:17:10.160\nAnd I bounce this off of level 3s, one of\nthe higher end root hit servers, right?\n\n339\n00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.480\nAnd I always think it's interesting,\n\n340\n00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.720\nbecause we get a whole\nbunch of different results.\n\n341\n00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.470\nAnd, you ask Google, and you get a list.\n\n342\n00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.610\nAnd you ask anybody else,\nyou get different results.\n\n343\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.170\nSo, again, that could be something that\nyou can do when it comes to DNS issues.\n\n344\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.840\n&gt;&gt; What about different\ntypes of limitations, Wes?\n\n345\n00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.560\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is something, you might\nhave things like security policies.\n\n346\n00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.070\nIf you end up having\na corporate security policy-\n\n347\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.850\n&gt;&gt; It might not actually be a networking\n\n348\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.060\nproblem, but more of a restriction, right?\n\n349\n00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.307\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so and\ngive you an example, right?\n\n350\n00:17:41.307 --> 00:17:43.405\nWe have a high definition\nvideo conferencing system.\n\n351\n00:17:43.405 --> 00:17:46.322\nWe need fast,\nstreaming reliable communication and\n\n352\n00:17:46.322 --> 00:17:48.740\nthey're putting throttling, a ll right?\n\n353\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.270\nThey've implemented throttling and\nthey're actually throttling you,\n\n354\n00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.980\nwhich means slowing down your\ncommunication, or blocking it.\n\n355\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.200\nThe other thing that we've seen\nout there across the internet\n\n356\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.100\nis things like net neutrality right?\n\n357\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.990\nThat's one of the biggest examples\n\n358\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.810\nof a fair access policy that implements\npotential utilization limits right?\n\n359\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:13.220\nThey say well 75% of all traffic on\nthe Internet is used by Netflix users and\n\n360\n00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.060\nnow what are they doing?\n\n361\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.590\nRight they're ensuring\nthat it's not 75% of\n\n362\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.090\nall Internet traffic is coming\nfrom streaming media services.\n\n363\n00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.351\nWe're gonna make sure that\nwe're divving it out right.\n\n364\n00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:25.650\nSo it could be a fair access policy.\n\n365\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.880\nThe other thing too is it could be a CPE,\nright.\n\n366\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.710\nIt could be one of your customer\npremise equipment, right.\n\n367\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.280\nOne of the common ones\nthat you might have.\n\n368\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.570\nYour T1 lines might be\ncoming into your building.\n\n369\n00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.430\nAnd the termination equipment that\nyou have might be one of the smart\n\n370\n00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.530\njacks, right.\n\n371\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.260\nThey call them out network interface unit.\n\n372\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.270\nYou might hear things like\nWAN Interface Controller, WIC, CSUDSUs.\n\n373\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.000\n&gt;&gt; It's just hardware.\n\n374\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it could be just\na general hardware failure.\n\n375\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.080\nThey call out the CSUDSUs.\n\n376\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.180\nThese are typically one component that's\nbuilt into a module that's plugged\n\n377\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.810\ninto a switch.\n\n378\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.770\nThe module could have gone bad.\n\n379\n00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.820\nWhat else?\n\n380\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.810\nWe talked about the demarcation point,\npoint of responsibility, remember that.\n\n381\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.770\nThe other thing too, that they call out,\nis the loopback plug.\n\n382\n00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.522\nIt's a little plug with\nwire that loops them back.\n\n383\n00:19:09.522 --> 00:19:10.614\nAnd that's the only thing that's in there.\n\n384\n00:19:10.614 --> 00:19:15.100\nAnd you can put that into the smartjack\nto test whether it can recognize itself.\n\n385\n00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.500\nYou put the loopback into the loopback\nplug and the light comes on and you know.\n\n386\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.040\nThat it's not the smart jack that's\ncausing you to not have communication.\n\n387\n00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.460\nIt could be the wiring that's coming into\nthe smart jack that you need to check.\n\n388\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.840\nThey mention something\ncalled copper line drivers.\n\n389\n00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.840\nCan we talk about copper line drivers?\n\n390\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.100\nWe're talking about a repeater.\n\n391\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.290\nThey have ways that if you want to extend,\n\n392\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.990\nfor instance, the distance that Ethernet\ncan communicate over copper media.\n\n393\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.800\nOur copper cables can only\ngo out to 100 meters.\n\n394\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.300\nSo if we want them to go farther\nthan that we can put a repeater in\n\n395\n00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.840\nthe middle of them.\n\n396\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.000\nWe can extend it farther.\n\n397\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.280\nIf the repeater dies then\nyou get signal attenuation.\n\n398\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.090\nThat will give you signs of errors because\nof the fact that the signal's attenuating.\n\n399\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.420\nSo you also have those as well.\n\n400\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.850\nAgain, those-\n&gt;&gt; It might work but\n\n401\n00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.040\nyou're gonna need to fix it.\n\n402\n00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.942\nYou gotta love those intermittent issues,\nright?\n\n403\n00:20:03.942 --> 00:20:08.388\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's one of those\nthings that if it does happen,\n\n404\n00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:13.020\nyou might even be able to see\nthe interface errors at that point.\n\n405\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.650\nSo those are some of the things.\n\n406\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.690\nLike I said this is really\na repeat of a lot of the stuff\n\n407\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.290\nthat we've talked about in other issues or\nother areas with networking issues.\n\n408\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:29.302\nJust keep in mind that in this episode\nwe're talking more on the ISP side.\n\n409\n00:20:29.302 --> 00:20:32.369\nPay the bill, pay attention to\nthe service level contracts, and\n\n410\n00:20:32.369 --> 00:20:34.283\nget ahold of them if it's the local ISP.\n\n411\n00:20:34.283 --> 00:20:36.706\nIf it happens to be more of\nthe Internet backbone providers,\n\n412\n00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:39.853\na lot of times there's nothing you can\ndo there, you just have to live with it.\n\n413\n00:20:39.853 --> 00:20:42.457\nThey've got the best network\ntechnicians in the world.\n\n414\n00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:45.612\nAnd if you're discovering that you're\nhaving a problem chances are they knew\n\n415\n00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:47.380\nabout it before you ever got to it.\n\n416\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.660\n&gt;&gt; And usually people kind of,\nduring your career path you'll choose.\n\n417\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.876\nDo I want to be a local\narea network administrator,\n\n418\n00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:54.431\nwide area network administrator?\n\n419\n00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.503\nAnd that's really because I dunno if\nyou've heard that saying a jack of all\n\n420\n00:20:57.503 --> 00:20:58.643\ntrades is a master of none.\n\n421\n00:20:58.643 --> 00:21:02.071\nBecause they're really dealing with\na lot of different protocols and\n\n422\n00:21:02.071 --> 00:21:03.125\ndesign techniques.\n\n423\n00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:07.340\nThat are well, just really different than\nwhat we see on our local area networks.\n\n424\n00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.260\nSo if that's something\nthat you're interested in,\n\n425\n00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.720\nthen definitely spend more\ntime looking into that.\n\n426\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.030\nBut I think that's about it for\nthis episode.\n\n427\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.712\nAll right, Wes?\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n428\n00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:16.627\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n429\n00:21:16.627 --> 00:21:17.631\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n430\n00:21:17.631 --> 00:21:18.479\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n431\n00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:21.829\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITProTV.\n\n432\n00:21:21.829 --> 00:21:27.826\n[MUSIC]\n\n433\n00:21:27.826 -->

00:00:17.265\ngreetings, everyone, and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:18.755\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:23.555\nin today's episode we are moving on with\nmore on our Network+ series for CompTIA.\n\n9\n00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:27.620\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio,\nlending his expertise on that very topic,\n\n10\n00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.450\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.280\nWes, welcome back, sir.\n\n12\n00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.160\nHow's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.050\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.820\nAlways a pleasure to be here with ITProTV.\n\n15\n00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.821\nThat's right.\nWe are diving into theory and\n\n16\n00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:40.200\nthat's what our episode is\ngoing to be about today.\n\n17\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610\nIt's going to be about a seven,\nan abstract seven layer model that\n\n18\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.920\ngoes all the way back to the 80s,\ncalled the OSI model.\n\n19\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.330\nAnd if you haven't heard of that that is\nthe Open Systems Interconnection model.\n\n20\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.120\nActually the whole thing is the reference\nmodel for Open System Interconnection.\n\n21\n00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.140\n&gt;&gt; Created by the ISO,\nif I'm not mistaken, that's fun.\n\n22\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.952\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n23\n00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:02.318\nyou know what's interesting is that's\nhow I would remember on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:03.451\n&gt;&gt; It was a mirror-image backwards.\n\n25\n00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.507\nThe ISO, OSI.\n\n26\n00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:06.694\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; And what does that mean?\n\n27\n00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:10.260\n[LAUGH] Well that's the International\nOrganization for Standardization.\n\n28\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.680\nAnd it's funny,\nI always thought about their acronym,\n\n29\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.150\nInternational Organization for\nStandardization.\n\n30\n00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.800\nWhy isn't it IOS?\n\n31\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.820\nWell, it actually gets its acronym\nthere from a Greek word, isos, I-S-O-S.\n\n32\n00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.950\nI believe it means equality or equal.\n\n33\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.890\nSo that was their method\nto their naming convention.\n\n34\n00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.510\nBut why do we have the OSI model?\n\n35\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.070\nWhy did it come about?\n\n36\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.530\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's do the proverbial time machine and\n\n37\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.360\nlet's go back in time a little bit.\n\n38\n00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.870\nIn the earlier days of what we\nwould later call the Internet,\n\n39\n00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.170\nthere were many different\ncompanies out there and\n\n40\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.720\nevery company had the next latest,\ngreatest communications technology.\n\n41\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.060\nBut the problem is none of them\nwere talking to each other.\n\n42\n00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.250\nSo if you did happen to buy a certain\ncommunication technology by a certain\n\n43\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.240\ncompany, well, guess what?\n\n44\n00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.910\nThat means everything that you bought\nwould have to come through them.\n\n45\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.790\nAnd if you needed some kind of\ninteroperability between another vender,\n\n46\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.370\nwell, you would hope that those\nvendors were talking to each other.\n\n47\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.010\nWell, that's not exactly\nthe way it happened.\n\n48\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.930\nSo we had a lot of people,\nall different components,\n\n49\n00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.280\non networking with none of them\nactually being able to work together.\n\n50\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.400\nSo they said there were a couple\nof committees at the time.\n\n51\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.590\nThe ISO was one of them.\n\n52\n00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.840\nAnd I can't remember the other committee.\n\n53\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.830\nBut they were both working in 1983 on some\nreference documentation for standardizing\n\n54\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680\nnetworks and what they did is they\nbasically said okay, we're gonna meet.\n\n55\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.620\nWe'll take both of these.\n\n56\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.630\nWe're gonna put them together and\nultimately that's what became the OSI.\n\n57\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.970\nNow the OSI model it's,\nthey say interconnections.\n\n58\n00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.540\nIt's really a referencing framework,\nif you will, to make sure that if you\n\n59\n00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.110\nare following the framework that\nyou do have an interoperability.\n\n60\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.370\nHence, interconnection.\n\n61\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.360\nSo that's a little bit\nabout the history of it.\n\n62\n00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.480\nLet's talk a little bit\nmore about what it is.\n\n63\n00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.080\nWell, it is a seven layer model,\nand in these seven layers, what you\n\n64\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.940\nhave are essentially services that service\nlayers below it and then below that.\n\n65\n00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.300\nSo if we talk about the highest layer,\nthe top layer there\n\n66\n00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.000\nis going to be providing basically\nhanding off its information to a lower\n\n67\n00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.040\nlayer that's gonna service that upper\nlayer and then finally down the stack.\n\n68\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.730\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's look at the OSI model.\n\n69\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.770\nI got a little diagram drawn up here and\nthis is that seven layer model.\n\n70\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.700\nYou can see that working from Layer\n7 all the way down to Layer 1,\n\n71\n00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.570\nwe start with something known\nas the Application layer.\n\n72\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.740\nNow guys, we're going to\ncover each individual layer.\n\n73\n00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.790\nI just want you to kinda step back and\n\n74\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.450\nget the 10,000 foot overview before we\nstart dividing each of these layers up.\n\n75\n00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.150\nThe next layer, Layer 6,\nthat's gonna be the Presentation layer.\n\n76\n00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.260\nAnd you can see Layer 5\nis the Session layer.\n\n77\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.500\nLayer 4 is the Transport layer.\n\n78\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.476\nDown to the Network layer,\nData-Link layer, and the Physical layer.\n\n79\n00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:05.185\nSo when I say that these layers\nhelp to assist each other,\n\n80\n00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:09.437\nyou'll see that Layer 7,\nit puts its information in the data and\n\n81\n00:04:09.437 --> 00:04:12.711\nthen it passes it down to\nthe Presentation layer.\n\n82\n00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:17.011\nThe Presentation layer performs a service\non the data for the Application layer and\n\n83\n00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.120\nthen it passes the data\ndown to the Session layer.\n\n84\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.610\nWell, the Session layer helps\nthe Presentation layer.\n\n85\n00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.910\nSo they're all collectively working\ntogether to ensure that you have\n\n86\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.860\ncommunications from source to\ndestination over your networks.\n\n87\n00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.190\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's take this a little bit farther and\n\n88\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.300\nstart breaking down these layers.\n\n89\n00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.330\nSee if we can make a little bit more\nsense out of the individuality of\n\n90\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.090\neach layer here.\n\n91\n00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.320\nAll right, so when we start at Layer 7,\n\n92\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.070\nhere's some of the things that you can\nthink about when it comes to Layer 7.\n\n93\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.370\nLayer 7 is where all, everything starts.\n\n94\n00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.300\nNow when we talk about\nwhere everything starts,\n\n95\n00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.060\nyou can see some of the examples that\nwe used I want you to think of email.\n\n96\n00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.750\nWhen I send email there's data\nwithin that packet, if you will, or\n\n97\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.910\nthat information within that\ncommunication that you're gonna send.\n\n98\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.930\nWell, in order to gain\naccess to the network,\n\n99\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.890\nwe have to go through\nthe Application layer.\n\n100\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.000\nSo the Application layer has protocols and\n\n101\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.950\nservices that allow us access\nto the network, right?\n\n102\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.115\nSome of the examples you'll see here and,\nguys, there are a bunch of them.\n\n103\n00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:23.100\nI'm just touching base with some of them.\n\n104\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.430\nYou have things like directory services,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.650\nLDAP, light weight directory access\nprotocol is one of those that\n\n106\n00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.150\nis an application where your protocol,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.760\nWhat it is doing?\n\n108\n00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.860\nWell, it's giving me a structured\nrules of communication\n\n109\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.690\nfrom myself to a directory\nservices database, right,\n\n110\n00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.200\nsomething like Active Directory,\nright, Active Directory open LDAP.\n\n111\n00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.205\nSome different\nimplementations that you see.\n\n112\n00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:51.290\nThe next thing, for example,\nyou can see name resolution.\n\n113\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.830\nNow with name resolution, we have DNS.\n\n114\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.020\nDNS is a form,\nan Application layer protocol, right?\n\n115\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.319\nIt's what allows us to resolve\nnames to IP addresses.\n\n116\n00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.910\nOther examples, well,\nI just went ahead and\n\n117\n00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.750\nlumped the email protocols\nall together there.\n\n118\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.710\nThey're all Application layer protocols,\nright.\n\n119\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.650\nYou have IMAP, POP3, SMTP.\n\n120\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.667\nAgain, when I send information,\nwhen I send an email,\n\n121\n00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:21.624\nthat program that is formulating\nthat message, and when I hit Send,\n\n122\n00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:25.996\nthe application is what's giving\nme access to the network.\n\n123\n00:06:25.996 --> 00:06:29.232\nAll right, some of the other ones\nhere real quick that we have,\n\n124\n00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:31.530\nthings like Host Configuration (DHCP).\n\n125\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.371\nDHCP is an Application\nlayer protocol as well.\n\n126\n00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.400\nAll right, you also have things\nlike Web Communications.\n\n127\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.556\nOne of the most common protocols that\nwe use out there on the Internet is\n\n128\n00:06:40.556 --> 00:06:41.261\nHTTP, right?\n\n129\n00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:44.880\nHTTP is another form of\nan Application layer protocol.\n\n130\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.070\nSo what I want you to take away from the\nApplication layer, guys, is that it gives\n\n131\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.720\nbasically applications and different\nuser processes access to the network.\n\n132\n00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.880\nIt is our starting point in order to send\n\n133\n00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.990\ninformation across\nthe network to a destination.\n\n134\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.160\nAll right, next one that we have here,\nOSI Layer 6.\n\n135\n00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.503\nAll right, what this is kind of\ninteresting is that Layer 6,\n\n136\n00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:15.431\nit helps our, it helps the network\nby basically formatting our data in\n\n137\n00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:19.541\na syntax that the network\ndoesn't have to understand it.\n\n138\n00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:22.300\nRight, so when we see like our letters,\n\n139\n00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.670\nour way of different encoding schemes and\nstuff like that.\n\n140\n00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.340\nThat's what we see and\nthat's what we recognize, right?\n\n141\n00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.030\nIf we were to take some of those encoding\nschemes and those characters off, right,\n\n142\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.930\nand if we were to change it up, we\nwouldn't be able to read anything, right?\n\n143\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.680\nWell, the network doesn't wanna\nhave to worry about that.\n\n144\n00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.240\nThe network should only, and\nI literally mean the whole network,\n\n145\n00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.350\nall it should have to worry about\nis destination address, really.\n\n146\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.701\nWhen we look at TCP IP, that's one of the\nbig things about TCP IP is we're really\n\n147\n00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:49.965\nlooking at the destination.\n\n148\n00:07:49.965 --> 00:07:52.271\nHow do I get that information\nwhere I need to go?\n\n149\n00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.809\nWell, I don't want the network to have\nto figure out what language are they\n\n150\n00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:56.436\ntalking in?\n\n151\n00:07:56.436 --> 00:08:00.976\nRight the other thing that you can see\nhere is encryption and decryption happen\n\n152\n00:08:00.976 --> 00:08:05.724\nat the presentation layer.It's all about\nformatting the data basically in a way\n\n153\n00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:10.090\nthat is has become transparent to\nthe networking portion of the OSI Model.\n\n154\n00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.550\nCompression, decompression.\n\n155\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.440\nI didn't put that one up there.\n\n156\n00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.030\nBut compression and\n\n157\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.840\ndecompression are another thing\nthat happens at the layer six.\n\n158\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.650\nAnd you also have like\nI said data conversion.\n\n159\n00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.950\nSometimes they will call this,\njust call it the syntax layer.\n\n160\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.350\nCuz we're just formatting that information\nso that we can put it on the network and\n\n161\n00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.940\nagain the network doesn't\nhave to deal with it.\n\n162\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.440\n&gt;&gt; Plus, this is also where we would find\nthings like because we're presenting to\n\n163\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.840\nthe end user things like Jpegs and\ngifs and any type of text, fonts,\n\n164\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.070\nthings that, anytime it's being presented\nto an end user as in a visual format,\n\n165\n00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.630\nthat's what we mean by\nthe presentation layer.\n\n166\n00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.700\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct, Jpeg,\npng, all of those tiffs, gifs,\n\n167\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.100\nthey're all a form of that.\n\n168\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.930\nAnd another thing too when\nwe talk about encryption.\n\n169\n00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.980\nYou know since you mentioned\nthe format of the data.\n\n170\n00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:58.710\nSMIME.\n\n171\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; MIME. Multi. What is it?\n\n172\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.040\nMulti Internet Mail Extensions\nis what the acronym.\n\n173\n00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.940\nRight?\n\n174\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.380\nWe couple that with encryption.\n\n175\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.150\nRight?\n\n176\n00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.195\nSMIME.\n\n177\n00:09:07.195 --> 00:09:09.810\nEncryption's is happening\nup at this layer.\n\n178\n00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.710\nAnd again formating that data\nthat male extensions right.\n\n179\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.090\nPutting them two together\nyou got yes mind and\n\n180\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.290\nyou got secure multi internet male\nextensions so yes absolutely.\n\n181\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.710\nAll right so let's go ahead and\n\n182\n00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.534\nlet's look we moving down the stack\nhere as they say the protocol stack.\n\n183\n00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:28.564\nAll right the next thing we\nhave is layer five, all right.\n\n184\n00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:32.910\nNow layer five is interesting because\nthis is about session control, all right.\n\n185\n00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.440\nNow I know that sounds, well Wes,\nit's in the name, Session Control,\n\n186\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.240\nwell I could have guessed that\njust by looking at the tape.\n\n187\n00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.270\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\n188\n00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.300\nWell when I need to establish\na communication with an endpoint This\n\n189\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.120\nlayer is what helps me create the session,\ndefine the parameters of the session,\n\n190\n00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.230\nmaintaining it if you will, and\nthen terminating the session.\n\n191\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.960\nAll right, some of the examples\nthat you can see of information, or\n\n192\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.310\nexcuse me, technologies and\nexamples that happen at this layer.\n\n193\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.860\nRight, security, the other thing\nthat we have as well is, you know,\n\n194\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.300\nI put a name recognition in here, and\nthat's not right that was actually a copy.\n\n195\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.750\nSo let me take that out.\n\n196\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.480\n&gt;&gt; It's trying to find its\nway in the other side here.\n\n197\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's trying to find its way in.\n\n198\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.200\nRPC is another one,\nthe remote procedure call.\n\n199\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.680\nThis is another with sockets.\n\n200\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.310\nRight we talk about a protocol an IP\naddress and a port of the number.\n\n201\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.730\n&gt;&gt; That's probably the most\nrelevant to most people or\n\n202\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.990\nif they think of the idea of a socket\nthey've got a connection being made.\n\n203\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.390\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely\n&gt;&gt; Once the connection has made\n\n204\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.850\nboth ends are establishedw\nWe have a socket.\n\n205\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Hence we're in the session.\n\n206\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.570\nWe had a session.\n\n207\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.550\nAnd you know I don't know why I did but\nthis when you're I'm going to put it here\n\n208\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.160\nbecause it needs to To be here,\nbecause it also,\n\n209\n00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.270\nthis is another one of these protocols\nthat's in multiple layers, and that's TCP.\n\n210\n00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.040\nGotta put that here,\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n211\n00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.610\nConnection oriented service says,\nI'm gonna reach out across the network and\n\n212\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.770\nI'm gonna set up a session.\n\n213\n00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.730\nHold your data up there at application\nlayer and presentation layer,\n\n214\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.420\njust hold on.\n\n215\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.350\nLet me reach out to that end point and\nlet me grab that session.\n\n216\n00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Wes I think you hit on a very good.\n\n217\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.510\nThing here is that fact that,\nthese are guidelines, right?\n\n218\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.560\nAnd for the most part, there's a lot\nof set in stone things going on,\n\n219\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.230\nbut they're basic ideas on how you\nshould be working with your data,\n\n220\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.650\nas it works through a network.\n\n221\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.780\nSo, some of these things might\ncross-pollinate a little bit, and\n\n222\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.190\nwe saw that here with TCP.\n\n223\n00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.260\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, you know,\n\n224\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.240\nand that's something that it took\na long time for me to grasp.\n\n225\n00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.530\nYou now, just wrap my mind around\nthat we think 7 to 1, 1 to 7,\n\n226\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.020\nlike I'm gonna show here in a bit, right?\n\n227\n00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.710\nIt's gonna go nice and\nclean up to the layers and\n\n228\n00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.670\nthat just doesn't happen, right?\n\n229\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.330\nIf I have data that I\nneed to be encrypted.\n\n230\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.560\nRight, we talk about HTTPS,\n\n231\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.310\nhypertext transport protocol\nover secure socket layer.\n\n232\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.310\nWell, the encryption has to happen, right?\n\n233\n00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.440\nWhen we do encryption,\nwe have to set up a key exchange, right?\n\n234\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.490\nWe have SSL communications that have\nto go on, establish that connection,\n\n235\n00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.490\nbefore we send the encrypted data.\n\n236\n00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.460\nSo please understand that when it comes\nto the OSI model it's not just a straight\n\n237\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.790\nseven to one or one to seven.\n\n238\n00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.630\nIt might be seven to presentation\nhold on gotta encrypt it stop for\n\n239\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.630\na second okay now to the session GCP gets\ninvolved so you need a connection okay\n\n240\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.360\nhold on to your data let me go ahead and\nI'll reach out to the end we'll meet.\n\n241\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.570\nWill bring up this connection\noriented service and\n\n242\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.820\nit'll establish that connection for you.\n\n243\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.820\nAll right, some of the other\nthings that you might see here.\n\n244\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.260\nOSI, layer four.\n\n245\n00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:25.840\nOSI layer four.\n\n246\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.310\nThere's a lot going on here and\nI will, for\n\n247\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.830\nmaybe some of you guys that\nare watching out there,\n\n248\n00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.200\nthere are certain things in this that\nonly a single protocol is doing.\n\n249\n00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.290\nAlright, for instance, transport layer\nreally is about moving the data.\n\n250\n00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.280\nIf we have to look at any layer of\nthe seven layers of the OSI model,\n\n251\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.530\nthis is where we start moving our\ninformation across the network.\n\n252\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.950\nWe pick what's known as\na transport protocol.\n\n253\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.110\nReally when it comes to transport\nprotocols we only use two today.\n\n254\n00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.100\nWe use TCP Transmission Control Protocol\nas an example.\n\n255\n00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.270\nAnd we use User Datagram Protocol UDP.\n\n256\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.780\nNow, I went ahead and,\nit's funny there Dan and\n\n257\n00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.090\nI don't think you pick up on the fact that\nI've got an oldie but goodie up there.\n\n258\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.140\nBut I had to put it up there nobody's\ngonna really be using it anymore but\n\n259\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.120\nOne of the older, routing protocols that\nwe're had, SPX sequence packet exchange.\n\n260\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.300\nYou've see that one in a while?\n\n261\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.220\n&gt;&gt; I haven't seen it in forever and\n\n262\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.730\na day because nobody thinks\nthat they uses that anymore!\n\n263\n00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.210\nBut it is legitimate for\nthe Transport layer.\n\n264\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.150\n&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct, so\n&gt;&gt; Keep it in mind.\n\n265\n00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.050\nAnd what he says today,\nthis is the old Novell.\n\n266\n00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:32.620\nIt would be a much different world\ntoday if IPX/SPX was still around.\n\n267\n00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.990\nWe wouldn't have the TCP/IP model.\n\n268\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.950\nWe might have the,\nI don't know, IPSPX model.\n\n269\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.620\nSo this is legacy, but\nI did put it up here.\n\n270\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.250\nJust in case, so you guys can see.\n\n271\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.930\nNow, let's talk about some of the services\nthat this layer provides, okay?\n\n272\n00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.650\nNow, you'll see a bunch here, right?\n\n273\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.800\nI say, ensures data is\ndelivered error-free, okay?\n\n274\n00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.630\nWell, most of these,\nactually pretty much all of these,\n\n275\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.290\nare done by transmission control protocol.\n\n276\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.390\nIf you choose TCP as\nyour transport protocol,\n\n277\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.720\nwell it's going to do things like\nensuring error-free delivery.\n\n278\n00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.780\nSo it starts at the session layer, right?\n\n279\n00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.990\nAnd it says hey let's go ahead and\nlet's start a communication.\n\n280\n00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.780\nWe'll maintain that communication,\nwe'll monitor it.\n\n281\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.090\nNow, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nsend you your information, and\n\n282\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:23.010\nif the information gets to you and\nit's corrupt, we're gonna discard it and\n\n283\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.590\nI'm gonna call back to the source,\nand I'm gonna say,\n\n284\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.050\nhey, I need you to\nre-transmit that information.\n\n285\n00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.460\nThe information didn't\nmaintain its integrity,\n\n286\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.490\nthere's some kind of error in it.\n\n287\n00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.380\nAll right, the next thing it does too is\nit ensures that the data is delivered\n\n288\n00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.500\nin the right sequence, all right?\n\n289\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.830\nWell, that's kinda putting the carriage in\nfront of the horse here, because we gotta\n\n290\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:47.070\nunderstand that it also does what's known\nas data sequencing and data segmentation.\n\n291\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.150\nNow, see, when you a connection\noriented communication or\n\n292\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:57.090\nservice like TCP, you might have\ndata that's too big to fit in\n\n293\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:02.010\na certain amount of information within\nthe structure of that packet of data,\n\n294\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.620\nor segment, as they call it.\n\n295\n00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.570\nSo what TCP does is says,\nthat's okay, let's just chop it up.\n\n296\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.270\nLiterally, let's just put the samurai\nsword on it, we'll segment it up.\n\n297\n00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.280\nBut then what we're gonna do is,\n\n298\n00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.170\nwe're gonna put numerical values\nacross everyone of those segments.\n\n299\n00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.190\nBecause we're using, largely we're\nusing packet switch networks.\n\n300\n00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.760\nAnd you gotta understand\nthat every packet can\n\n301\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.160\ntake a different route\ngetting to it's destination.\n\n302\n00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.620\nSo if I have all these different\n\n303\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.080\nsegmented packets go into the destination\nall taking a separate path,\n\n304\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.570\nhow can I ensure that they rebuild in\nthe right order and the destination?\n\n305\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.930\nAnd that's where the portion\nof this where it says,\n\n306\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.320\nthat it's delivered in the right sequence.\n\n307\n00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.840\nLet's take some generic\nsequencing numbers, right?\n\n308\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.486\nWe got segment one, two,\nthree, four, five, right?\n\n309\n00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:53.661\nWe send it out to the destination,\nit goes one, got one processed,\n\n310\n00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:55.730\ntwo, got four, got three.\n\n311\n00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.162\nWait, they're not ordered.\n\n312\n00:15:58.162 --> 00:16:03.668\nDiscard the one that wasn't in the right\norder and retransmit the next packet or\n\n313\n00:16:03.668 --> 00:16:07.740\nthe next segment that I'm looking for,\nall right?\n\n314\n00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.261\nSo it also does things like\nhost-to-host flow control as well.\n\n315\n00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:13.021\nAll right.\n\n316\n00:16:13.021 --> 00:16:18.035\nNow, [LAUGH] you get absolutely none\nof this, by the way, if you use UDP.\n\n317\n00:16:18.035 --> 00:16:20.437\nSo that's why I want to say,\nthe majority of what you see for\n\n318\n00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:23.470\nthe services that we see here\nare Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n319\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.180\nBecause the User Datagram Protocol\nis what they call connectionless,\n\n320\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:27.960\nbest effort delivery.\n\n321\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.418\nIt means I just put it on the wire and\nGod, I just hope it gets there.\n\n322\n00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nyou might not get all the cool bells and\n\n323\n00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.305\nwhistles that TCP offers,\nbut you do get speed.\n\n324\n00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:37.530\nDemon speed, greasy fast speed, right?\n\n325\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n326\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.838\nBecause when I don't need things\nlike error-free delivery, right,\n\n327\n00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:43.920\nI need real time delivery.\n\n328\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.790\nI don't have time.\n\n329\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.530\nSee, TCP is very,\nvery processor intensive.\n\n330\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:52.430\nAll this stuff that you see is going on\nwith TCP, every single device that that\n\n331\n00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.970\npacket passes through has to\nbe processed pretty heavily.\n\n332\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.770\nIn fact, they've got things like\naggregator boards in certain connection\n\n333\n00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:05.250\ndevices that offload all the TCP\nprocessing to a dedicated board or\n\n334\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.420\na dedicated place within a device just so\nit doesn't slow down the device.\n\n335\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.570\nAll right.\n\n336\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.660\nSo, like Dan said, when you need\nthat blistering speed, you need to\n\n337\n00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.050\nget that information there, and\nyou're not really worried about error-free\n\n338\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.680\ndelivery because the application up\nthere's got something built in that says,\n\n339\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.150\nokay, well, when I'm receiving\nthe data I can see, there's an error.\n\n340\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.620\nLet me just discard this.\n\n341\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.410\nAnd it's the application, not UDP.\n\n342\n00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.470\nUDP does nothing like that.\n\n343\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.210\nIn fact, the only thing it does\nis it has an integrity check.\n\n344\n00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.360\nThere is one thing that it has.\n\n345\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.000\nIt has a little checksum that it puts\non it that the endpoint can say,\n\n346\n00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.330\nyeah that's not good, throw it away.\n\n347\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.280\nBut it never calls back to the source.\n\n348\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.764\nSo it is a connectionless service,\nconnectionless transport protocol,\n\n349\n00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:49.195\nbest effort delivery.\n\n350\n00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:53.010\nAll right.\n\n351\n00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.548\nNow, let me go ahead and I wanna,\nI'm gonna back up to the top here, guys.\n\n352\n00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:02.536\nBecause we've gotten through the\napplication, the presentation session, and\n\n353\n00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:04.080\ntransport.\n\n354\n00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.790\nI want to, since we've talked about seven,\nsix, and five,\n\n355\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.730\nmention what those three layers are doing.\n\n356\n00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.760\nThese are application servicing layers.\n\n357\n00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.890\nWhen you look at seven,\n\n358\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.610\nsix, five, we haven't even started with\nnetwork communications yet, right?\n\n359\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:27.500\nWe're taking that information and\nwe're turning it into something that\n\n360\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.960\nwe can put on the network and\nthen the network can start to do its job.\n\n361\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:38.220\nNow, when we get into the transport layer\nand lower, that's the network block.\n\n362\n00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.420\nThat's where the network says, okay,\nI've got my information, it's in a format.\n\n363\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.910\nI don't know what it is, but I don't care,\n\n364\n00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.800\nbecause I've got information that can\nmove it along to its destination.\n\n365\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.529\nSo I do want you to keep that in mind.\n\n366\n00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:53.940\nAll right, now that being said,\nlet's go to Layer 3.\n\n367\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.190\nLayer 3 is where a lot of\naction is happening, right?\n\n368\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:03.280\nSo Layer 3 is really about routing your\ninformation and logical addressing.\n\n369\n00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.440\nNow, I'll make a comparison of\nwhat I mean the difference between\n\n370\n00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.150\nphysical addressing and\nlogical addressing here in a second.\n\n371\n00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.612\nBut at layer 3, this is where we\nplace software-based addresses,\n\n372\n00:19:12.612 --> 00:19:14.980\nnamely with something known as IP.\n\n373\n00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:21.355\nAnd we use routing and routing protocols\nto the get information to its destination.\n\n374\n00:19:21.355 --> 00:19:25.245\nAnd one really cool thing about\nthe network layer is that\n\n375\n00:19:25.245 --> 00:19:29.714\nthe routing protocols can make\na decision based on the best way to\n\n376\n00:19:29.714 --> 00:19:32.731\nget that information to the destination.\n\n377\n00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:34.750\nThat's what's really cool\nabout the networking layer.\n\n378\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.367\nAnd again, a lot of stuff's going on here.\n\n379\n00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:39.120\nWe could decide which\nroute to send the data.\n\n380\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.020\nAnd guess what?\n\n381\n00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.703\nIf I'm a connectivity device,and\nwe'll just role play here,\n\n382\n00:19:43.703 --> 00:19:45.550\nDan's a connectivity device.\n\n383\n00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.915\nAnd I've said, hey, man,\nit's gonna cost you,\n\n384\n00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:51.656\nlet's just say $10 to get to that\ndestination, it's gonna cost you $10.\n\n385\n00:19:51.656 --> 00:19:53.074\nDan talks to somebody else, and\n\n386\n00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:55.868\nsomebody says, it only cost me\n$2 to get to the destination.\n\n387\n00:19:55.868 --> 00:19:57.297\nHe's gonna say, well, the heck with you.\n\n388\n00:19:57.297 --> 00:20:02.180\nI'm gonna forget your information and\nnow I've got updated information that can\n\n389\n00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.736\nget that data to\nthe endpoint a lot easier.\n\n390\n00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:09.493\nSo routers and stuff at Layer 3, they can\ncommunicate between each other, right,\n\n391\n00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:14.050\nmaking sure that they've got the best path\nto the networks that they know about.\n\n392\n00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.200\nLet's see.\nSo some of the things that\n\n393\n00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.800\nhappen at this layer.\n\n394\n00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:25.079\nWe talked IP addresses, those are those\nlogical software-based addresses.\n\n395\n00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:28.321\nRouters, here at this level as well.\n\n396\n00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:30.140\nPackets, all right?\n\n397\n00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.960\nSo, at the transport layer,\nwe have what are known as segments.\n\n398\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.800\nI wanna make sure that we\ngot the clarification.\n\n399\n00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.095\nI'm gonna call everything a packet.\n\n400\n00:20:37.095 --> 00:20:39.050\n[LAUGH] I've just been used to doing that.\n\n401\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.300\n&gt;&gt; And\nthat's not uncommon to be honest with you.\n\n402\n00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.540\nA lot of people that have been\nwell hoofed into the industry for\n\n403\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.250\nquite some time,\nthey'll call all these things packets.\n\n404\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.084\nFor the exams you do need\nto know that in Layer 4,\n\n405\n00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:53.320\nyou have segments,\nin Layer 3, it's packets.\n\n406\n00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.840\nAs we get down to layer two,\n\n407\n00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.740\nit's going to be-\n&gt;&gt; Frames.\n\n408\n00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes, frames, thank you.\n\n409\n00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.910\nAnd then bits.\n\n410\n00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.150\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; On the physical layer.\n\n411\n00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we go to physical layer,\n\n412\n00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.090\nwe're talking about electrical ones and\nzeros.\n\n413\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.673\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Pretty much just that.\n\n414\n00:21:04.673 --> 00:21:06.050\nSo packet filtering?\n\n415\n00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.790\nPacket filtering happens at Layer 3 too.\n\n416\n00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:08.870\nBut I wanna be a little careful,\n\n417\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.080\nbecause packet filtering also happens\nat the transport layer, right?\n\n418\n00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.226\nWhen we talk about those TCP/IP ports.\n\n419\n00:21:15.226 --> 00:21:19.235\nWhen you're doing things like for\ninstance stateful packet inspection and\n\n420\n00:21:19.235 --> 00:21:20.935\npacket inspection in general.\n\n421\n00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:24.676\nIt can look up into the transport layer\nto see what those port values are.\n\n422\n00:21:24.676 --> 00:21:28.908\nSo I do want you to keep in mind that\npacket filtering doesn't just happen at\n\n423\n00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:29.520\nLayer 3.\n\n424\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.910\nLet's just be clear on that,\nthat it also happens at Layer 4 as well.\n\n425\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.220\nAll right.\n\n426\n00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.370\nBoy, isn't this confusing?\n\n427\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:38.690\n&gt;&gt; This just got crazy today.\n\n428\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.210\n&gt;&gt; What just happened here, right?\n\n429\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.064\nNo, Dan did not take a knife out and\ncut this layer in half before we started.\n\n430\n00:21:44.064 --> 00:21:48.422\nThat was actually a decision that was made\nto do a little bit better description of\n\n431\n00:21:48.422 --> 00:21:52.630\nwhat was happening in what was\nknown as Layer 2 of the OSI model.\n\n432\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.051\nAll right, so Data-Link Layer's\ngot a couple of things going on.\n\n433\n00:21:56.051 --> 00:21:57.178\nAnd really early on,\n\n434\n00:21:57.178 --> 00:22:01.260\nthey learned that it was doing a little\nbit more than just a single thing here.\n\n435\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.510\nSo what they did is they broke it\nup into two sub-layers, all right?\n\n436\n00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.328\nThese sub-layers that you have, one is\ncalled the Media Access Control Layer,\n\n437\n00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:08.898\nMAC Layer.\n\n438\n00:22:08.898 --> 00:22:13.848\nAnd that's what communicates with\nthe physical layer, if you will.\n\n439\n00:22:13.848 --> 00:22:17.670\nThen you have what's known as\nthe Logical Link Control Layer.\n\n440\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.029\nAnd that's what's actually receiving\ninformation from the networking layer,\n\n441\n00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:23.100\nif you will.\n\n442\n00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.030\nAnd then starting to format it, and\n\n443\n00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.880\nhanding it to\nthe Media Access Control Layer, all right?\n\n444\n00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.870\nNow, what does this provide?\n\n445\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.010\nPhysical addresses, all right?\n\n446\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.670\nThose physical addresses\nare MAC addresses.\n\n447\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.524\nRemember what I told you with Layer 3.\n\n448\n00:22:35.524 --> 00:22:39.090\nLayer 3, we're talking about\nsoftware-defined addresses.\n\n449\n00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.020\nWhat does that mean?\n\n450\n00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.380\nWell, it means if I grab Dan's laptop,\nI can put an IP address on it.\n\n451\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.910\nAnd well,\ndoes that change anything physically?\n\n452\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.926\nNo, because Dan will look at that IP\naddress and say, man, Wes is crazy.\n\n453\n00:22:50.926 --> 00:22:53.653\n[INAUDIBLE] 10 dot,\nI use a 192 dot, right?\n\n454\n00:22:53.653 --> 00:22:55.331\nAnd he can change it.\n\n455\n00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:58.569\nWith a hardware-level address,\noutside of virtualization, so\n\n456\n00:22:58.569 --> 00:23:02.207\nsome of you guys that are watching that\nknow your OSI model maybe know some of\n\n457\n00:23:02.207 --> 00:23:03.890\nthe software we have out there.\n\n458\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.050\nOutside of virtualization,\nyou can't change these addresses.\n\n459\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.430\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can spoof them.\n\n460\n00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.080\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n461\n00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.450\n&gt;&gt; That's splitting hairs.\n\n462\n00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:10.992\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n463\n00:23:10.992 --> 00:23:11.851\nAnd that's in software.\n\n464\n00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:15.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So frames.\n\n465\n00:23:15.188 --> 00:23:19.431\nFrames happen, you mentioned that too when\nwe were talking about which layers do we\n\n466\n00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:22.730\nknow what the unit of data\nmeasurement is called.\n\n467\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.050\nHere's frames, right?\n\n468\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.070\nWhat else do we got here?\n\n469\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.900\nSwitches, right?\n\n470\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.580\nSwitches deal with MAC addresses.\n\n471\n00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.567\nNow-\n&gt;&gt; This is where they live.\n\n472\n00:23:28.567 --> 00:23:30.850\n&gt;&gt; That's right, this is their territory.\n\n473\n00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.770\nNow, in a previous episode, a prior\nepisode that Dan and I were in, you made\n\n474\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.040\na good mention that we gotta pay attention\nto those Layer 3 switches, right?\n\n475\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.010\nThey'll catch you.\n\n476\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.100\nWhy is that?\n\n477\n00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.936\nWell, they allow us to do\nmore than one function,\n\n478\n00:23:43.936 --> 00:23:47.257\nbasically sitting at more than\none layer of the OSI model.\n\n479\n00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:51.825\nWhen they say Layer 3 switch, guys,\nit means they understand routing, right.\n\n480\n00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:53.289\nThey understand the routing protocols.\n\n481\n00:23:53.289 --> 00:23:56.485\nWe speak that language,\nwe know what it means.\n\n482\n00:23:56.485 --> 00:23:57.965\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; Not only do they speak but\n\n483\n00:23:57.965 --> 00:23:58.632\nthey can do it.\n\n484\n00:23:58.632 --> 00:24:00.260\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nThey don't just speak it,\n\n485\n00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.444\nthey can perform it as well.\n\n486\n00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:04.150\nSo, like I said,\nthere's an exception to that.\n\n487\n00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.937\nSo I want you guys, some of you guys\nmaybe that are watching to say,\n\n488\n00:24:06.937 --> 00:24:08.338\nI know switches can do routing too.\n\n489\n00:24:08.338 --> 00:24:10.919\nWe got one in our shop,\nthat's a layer three switch.\n\n490\n00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:14.983\n&gt;&gt; And the good news is that on the exam,\nthey're not gonna try to trick you with,\n\n491\n00:24:14.983 --> 00:24:18.630\nhey, here's a switch and it's routing,\nand try to call it a switch.\n\n492\n00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.720\nThey'll most likely label it a multilayer\nswitch or a layer three switch,\n\n493\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.510\nsomething like that.\n\n494\n00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.328\nOr ask you, if this switch is able\nto communicate between VLANs with no\n\n495\n00:24:27.328 --> 00:24:29.381\nother device, what is that?\n\n496\n00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:31.840\nAnd you'll say it's a multi-layer switch,\nor a layer three switch.\n\n497\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\nI would agree with Dan that first of all,\n\n498\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.720\nthey're not gonna try to trick you.\n\n499\n00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.807\nThey might ask you something\nabout a layer three switch and\n\n500\n00:24:39.807 --> 00:24:41.996\nsay which of these describes\nthe functionality.\n\n501\n00:24:41.996 --> 00:24:46.050\nAnd you should know, like Dan said,\nwhat those functionalities are.\n\n502\n00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.115\nAll right, what else do we got here?\n\n503\n00:24:47.115 --> 00:24:51.480\nEthernet, ethernet is another\nexample of a layer two technology.\n\n504\n00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.957\nFrame-relay is an example.\n\n505\n00:24:52.957 --> 00:24:55.930\nI didn't put it up here but\nI can just go ahead and mention it, ATM,\n\n506\n00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.217\nautonomous transfer mode.\n\n507\n00:24:57.217 --> 00:25:00.440\nFiber distributed data interface, even\nthough we really don't use it anymore.\n\n508\n00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.722\n&gt;&gt; Is SONET here?\n\n509\n00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:03.230\n&gt;&gt; SONET is there thank you very much.\n\n510\n00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.890\nYes SONET, SDH depending on if\nyou're here in the country and\n\n511\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.359\nyou're following ANSI standards\nversus ITU in Europe.\n\n512\n00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:10.821\nAbsolutely, Network Adapters.\n\n513\n00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.972\nNow I know [LAUGH] that there's been,\nthis is always one that's fun, all right?\n\n514\n00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:17.690\nThere is a little bit of a going back and\n\n515\n00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.500\nforth across the Internet that I've\nseen when it comes to network adapters.\n\n516\n00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.453\nWhat do I do with a network adapter?\n\n517\n00:25:22.453 --> 00:25:24.890\nI plug a physical cable in, right?\n\n518\n00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.110\nSo does that mean it's at the physical\nlayer, and I would say, yeah.\n\n519\n00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.960\nThat there are certain functionalities\nof a network adapter that are at\n\n520\n00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.380\nthe physical layer.\n\n521\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.590\nHowever, it is what defines,\n\n522\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.758\nwhether you put that information\non that physical layer.\n\n523\n00:25:39.758 --> 00:25:42.286\nSo it's also working at layer two,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n524\n00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:44.910\n&gt;&gt; Remember that cross-pollination\nthing I was talking about here?\n\n525\n00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.178\nWe see it yet again.\n\n526\n00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:50.475\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and let's give you another\nexample of that cross-pollination.\n\n527\n00:25:50.475 --> 00:25:52.450\nI like that analogy.\n\n528\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.770\nLayer three, right?\n\n529\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.610\nIP knows nothing about MAC addresses,\nright?\n\n530\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.530\nMAC addresses are a physical\naddress that we deliver on the LAN.\n\n531\n00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.520\nSo what happens?\n\n532\n00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.630\nWell, right in between here, right,\nI could probably in here in the middle.\n\n533\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.628\n&gt;&gt; The layer 2.5.\n\n534\n00:26:05.628 --> 00:26:07.154\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we could do that.\n\n535\n00:26:07.154 --> 00:26:10.037\nWell, you know what's kinda funny,\nthat's what they call MPLS.\n\n536\n00:26:10.037 --> 00:26:11.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n537\n00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:15.960\n&gt;&gt; Between the data link layer and\nthe network layer.\n\n538\n00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.861\nBut ARP,\naddress resolution protocol, right?\n\n539\n00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:23.409\nWhen IP a router delivers the IP to\nits final destination, to the LAN,\n\n540\n00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:26.430\nit doesn't know anything\nabout MAC address.\n\n541\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.535\nSo what does it do?\n\n542\n00:26:27.535 --> 00:26:32.280\nIt says, well here, ARP, let me just hand\nthis over to you and can you help me?\n\n543\n00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.249\nAnd it calls down to the data link\nlayer and it says, I got an IP address.\n\n544\n00:26:37.249 --> 00:26:38.720\nWhose MAC address is this?\n\n545\n00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:46.870\nAnd Layer 2 responds to ARP and\nsays, yeah, I know that IP address.\n\n546\n00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.190\nYou can find that IP address\nat this MAC address.\n\n547\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:54.130\nSo you do have, just like he says, a lot\nof these layers that are protocols and\n\n548\n00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.476\nservers that might be on both,\nmore than one layer.\n\n549\n00:26:57.476 --> 00:27:00.384\nAll right, now finally.\n\n550\n00:27:00.384 --> 00:27:01.050\n&gt;&gt; Finally, last one.\n\n551\n00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:01.618\n&gt;&gt; Last one.\n\n552\n00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:02.180\nThat's right.\n\n553\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.386\nThat's the OSI Model Layer 1.\n\n554\n00:27:04.386 --> 00:27:10.203\nAll right, now this is where we start\ntalking about provides the physical.\n\n555\n00:27:10.203 --> 00:27:12.020\nYou heard what Dan said earlier, right?\n\n556\n00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.980\nThe bits, the raw bits.\n\n557\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.602\nNow we're talking about things like\nelectrical impulses or electrical light,\n\n558\n00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:19.475\nif you're talking about fiber, right?\n\n559\n00:27:19.475 --> 00:27:23.190\nBut you're talking about the raw bits\nthat are going over the wire, right?\n\n560\n00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.730\nData encoding happens here.\n\n561\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.466\nWe talk about things like baseband and\nbroadband, they happen here.\n\n562\n00:27:30.466 --> 00:27:36.040\nSome other examples, unshielded\ntwisted pair, shielded twisted pair,\n\n563\n00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.400\nfiber, T1 your T3 lines,\nour physical copper lines, right?\n\n564\n00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.100\nHubs, hubs are here.\n\n565\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.780\nThey don't understand logic.\n\n566\n00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.170\nAll they do is, they're really more\nlike a repeater more than anything, and\n\n567\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.540\nI probably put repeaters down here and\nI didn't, all right?\n\n568\n00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.760\nAnd then you also have some of these\ntechnologies that we've talked about\n\n569\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.700\nlike for instance ethernet.\n\n570\n00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.950\nEthernet describes portions of layer one.\n\n571\n00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:01.595\nWhy?\n\n572\n00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:05.699\nBecause it uses UTP,\nSTP, and Fiber, right?\n\n573\n00:28:05.699 --> 00:28:07.190\nShielded twisted pair if\nI didn't say that, guys.\n\n574\n00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.554\nSo that is about the physical layer,\nall right?\n\n575\n00:28:10.554 --> 00:28:14.263\nNow we've got more to go because\nI wanna show you what's going on\n\n576\n00:28:14.263 --> 00:28:16.127\nwith the processing and stuff.\n\n577\n00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:19.700\nBut I do see that Dan's telling me\nit might be time for a part two.\n\n578\n00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've exhausted our time for\nthis episode.\n\n579\n00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:25.381\nBut Wes, the great thing about this\nshow is we could just make more.\n\n580\n00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:26.462\nSo, that's what we'll do.\n\n581\n00:28:26.462 --> 00:28:28.536\nLook forward to seeing\nyou in that part two.\n\n582\n00:28:28.536 --> 00:28:31.194\nThank you guys for watching,\nbut we are gonna sign off.\n\n583\n00:28:31.194 --> 00:28:33.790\nFor IT PRO TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n584\n00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:34.715\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n585\n00:28:34.715 --> 00:28:36.270\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n586\n00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:42.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.835\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.920\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n5\n00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.990\ngreetings everyone and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.700\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n7\n00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.017\nin today's episode we are back with more\non our CompTIA series for Network Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:25.300\nThat's right,\nyou've come to the right place.\n\n9\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.998\nAnd, of course,\njoining us back in the studio,\n\n10\n00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:31.300\nwe're continuing on our\nconversation on the OSI model and\n\n11\n00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.360\nthe conversations that\nare tertiary to that as well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.955\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio,\nour good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.575\nWes, welcome back my man,\nhow's it going today?\n\n14\n00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:40.845\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:42.665\nAs always, great to be here and\n\n16\n00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:45.825\ngreat to see you guys out there\nin electrical limbo [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:49.035\nThat's right,\nwe are coming back with OSI Mono Part 2.\n\n18\n00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:52.875\nAnd there were a couple of things that\nwe didn't really finish with because\n\n19\n00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.735\nwe talked a lot about the theory, and\nwhile most of it's still gonna be theory,\n\n20\n00:00:56.735 --> 00:01:00.140\nwe didn't really discuss,\nhow is this happening?\n\n21\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.760\nWe talked about the seven layers.\n\n22\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.770\nIn fact, let's go ahead,\nlet's kind of just do a real quick recap.\n\n23\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.060\nWe're not gonna go into each\nindividual layer again.\n\n24\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.260\nBut remember, seven layers,\nseven all the way down to one.\n\n25\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.350\nThe physical being at the bottom.\n\n26\n00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.260\nRemember, application layer, that gives\nus our entrance into the network so\n\n27\n00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.770\nwe can even send network communications.\n\n28\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.070\nRemember the presentation layer,\n\n29\n00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.670\nit's about formatting the data\nin a syntax that, basically,\n\n30\n00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.830\nthe network can understand or\ndoesn't have to worry about that.\n\n31\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.144\nSession layer, remember that the session\nlayer is about session establishment.\n\n32\n00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:34.209\nAnd this is where we say, okay,\nyou need a session established,\n\n33\n00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.780\nlet me go ahead and\ntalk to the end point there.\n\n34\n00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.291\nWe'll bring up that session,\nwe'll manage it, we'll maintain it and\n\n35\n00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:40.890\nwe'll terminate it when it's done.\n\n36\n00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.600\nRemember the transport layer's where\nwe actually start picking which\n\n37\n00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.535\nprotocol we're gonna use to move the data.\n\n38\n00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:51.070\nLargely speaking, we've got two protocols,\ntwo choices, TCP and UDP.\n\n39\n00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.070\nAlso remember that at the transport layer\nthat's where the segmentation happens to,\n\n40\n00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.090\nbasically, divide up your information\ninto more manageable segments and\n\n41\n00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.530\nthen sequencing.\n\n42\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.900\nAnd, TCP will make sure that those\nare rebuilt in the right order as they\n\n43\n00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.550\nmake their way to the destination or\nwhen they do.\n\n44\n00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.320\nNext we have the network layer, keep\nin mind this is where routing happens.\n\n45\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.720\nThis is where your IP address is,\nthat logical or\n\n46\n00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.550\nsoftware based address\nis put onto your data.\n\n47\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.060\nKeep in mind, routers,\nthey communicate at this layer if\n\n48\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.580\nit's a layer three switch\nalso at this layer as well.\n\n49\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000\nAs well as things like packet filtering,\nremember that.\n\n50\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.046\nNext, we have the data link layer.\n\n51\n00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.649\nAnd the data link layer really is where\nLAN communications happen, right?\n\n52\n00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.028\nThis is where we have things like\nour MAC addresses, our switches,\n\n53\n00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:38.710\nthings like our modems if you will,\nnetwork adapters.\n\n54\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.490\nAnd last but not least, the physical bits.\n\n55\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.250\nWe talked about the physical layer being\nabout the more about the electrical\n\n56\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.290\nmechanics and\ncharacteristics of our network, and\n\n57\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.110\nthis is where the raw bits end up\nbeing placed on the physical media.\n\n58\n00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.950\nSo, with that,\nwith that little bit of a recap,\n\n59\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.670\nlet's talk about how the information or\nhow we're gonna actually use this in\n\n60\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.780\ncombination with our information\non the networking communications.\n\n61\n00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.310\nSo, when you talk about\nthe processing order,\n\n62\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.580\nthis is essentially what is going on here.\n\n63\n00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.839\nNow keep in mind that, like I said in\nthe last part, it doesn't necessarily\n\n64\n00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.946\nmean that you're going to go seven,\nsix, five, all the way down to one.\n\n65\n00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:21.803\nOr one all the way back up to seven,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:24.117\nSo, for instance,\nwhen we start processing it,\n\n67\n00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:28.190\nwe have application data that is then\nsent to the presentation layer, right?\n\n68\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.805\nAnd at the presentation layer,\nnext thing that happens, it's formatted,\n\n69\n00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.318\nit's put to the session layer.\n\n70\n00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:36.270\nNow, understand that\nwhat could go wrong here,\n\n71\n00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.726\nif you're talking about\nconnection oriented service,\n\n72\n00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:44.481\nwe could have something like this where\nat the session layer it stops, right?\n\n73\n00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:47.929\nJust for a second it stops and it says,\nhold on a second, hold that data that's\n\n74\n00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.852\nready to be put on the network cuz I'm not\nready for you to put it on the network.\n\n75\n00:03:51.852 --> 00:03:55.180\nLet me reach out to the endpoint and\nbring up this session and\n\n76\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.930\nstart that communication.\n\n77\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.450\nAnd then once that happens,\nthen let's go ahead and\n\n78\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.470\nstart working our way back\ndown the OSI model, right?\n\n79\n00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.080\nNotice that layer 4 happens,\n\n80\n00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.880\nthat's when we put on what's known as\na layer 4 header, the transport layer.\n\n81\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.040\nWe picked those protocols.\n\n82\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.090\nAnd then, as it's processed,\nnow we've got, we picked our protocol.\n\n83\n00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.299\nNow we have to put our IP\naddressing information source and\n\n84\n00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.209\ndestination kinda like a letter.\n\n85\n00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.874\nIf you're gonna send it, you have to put\na mailing address on the letter before you\n\n86\n00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:26.423\ncan put that letter in the mail carrier,\nor your box, and\n\n87\n00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:28.090\nthe mail carrier comes and takes it.\n\n88\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.430\nThey gotta know where is\nit going to be sent to.\n\n89\n00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.795\nKeep in mind that the IP address is\nkind of like your international travel.\n\n90\n00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:36.900\n[LAUGH] Kind of like your passport, right?\n\n91\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.030\nThat allows you to jump through\nnetworks when you're not directly\n\n92\n00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.620\nconnected to them.\n\n93\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.610\nThen when we move down\nto the data link layer,\n\n94\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.760\nthe data link layer is where\nwe talk about our frames.\n\n95\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.070\nKeep in mind that this is your\nLAN communications, right?\n\n96\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.540\nThe data link layer is about, you're\ndelivering information to the end point\n\n97\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.764\non the network that you\nare physically connected to.\n\n98\n00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:02.583\nAnd then finally, once that's done,\nnotice that we have the physical bits,\n\n99\n00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:05.075\nthe physical bits that\nare placed on the media.\n\n100\n00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:11.029\nNow, when this packet of information, and\nI know I use that term, we clarified that,\n\n101\n00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.700\nI use that term kinda interchangeably\njust as calling it packets.\n\n102\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.760\n&gt;&gt; I think Cisco,\nif you get into Cisco stuff,\n\n103\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.700\nthey prefer to the amorphous blob that may\nbe any one of those layers as a datagram.\n\n104\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.350\n&gt;&gt; A datagram.\n\n105\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.017\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes datagram,\n\n106\n00:05:25.017 --> 00:05:27.030\naatagram, I have heard that term too,\nas well.\n\n107\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.740\nYep, so we end up with this\nformed data packet if you will or\n\n108\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.230\ndatagram, like Dan is saying here, and\nthere's a lot of extra information.\n\n109\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.980\nOur data is just portion of it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.730\nAs we go through the layers, we do what's\nknown as encapsulation and it adds\n\n111\n00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.110\nadditional information to your original\ndata so that it knows where it's going and\n\n112\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.920\nit knows how to process the information\nback up the protocols stack to this young\n\n113\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.930\nlady here so whatever application that,\nmaybe it's an email, right?\n\n114\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.020\nMaybe she's reading her email, she finally\njust sees the data at the application\n\n115\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.270\nlayer, and it's rendered inside of\nwhatever maybe the email client might be.\n\n116\n00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.500\nNow, let's talk just\na little bit more about\n\n117\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.480\nthat data encapsulation\nthat I was talking about.\n\n118\n00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.630\nWhat is going on with that?\n\n119\n00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.170\nWell, processing order kind of\nlooks a little bit like this and\n\n120\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.300\nI know we are gonna zoom\ninto one side of this, and\n\n121\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.610\nthen we'll look at\nthe other side coming up.\n\n122\n00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.500\nBut when this gentleman decides that he's\ngonna send information to that young lady,\n\n123\n00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.530\nagain, you start with the data itself,\nbut remember,\n\n124\n00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.970\nif I have a letter here,\nand I need to mail it,\n\n125\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.620\nI can't just take this letter,\nfold it up, and stick it in the mailbox.\n\n126\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.770\nIt's not gonna go anywhere.\n\n127\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.140\nSo, that's where we have to grab the\nenvelope like the presentation layer and\n\n128\n00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.120\nit formats that information and\nit puts a layer six header on there.\n\n129\n00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.310\nAnd then,\nit sends it down to the next layer.\n\n130\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.830\nAnd in this case, layer five,\nthe session layer, it does encapsulation.\n\n131\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.600\nIt's kinda like the Russian dolls, right?\n\n132\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.830\nThe smaller doll fits into a bigger doll,\nfits into a bigger doll,\n\n133\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.640\nfits into a bigger doll.\n\n134\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.160\nWell, that's what we're doing here.\n\n135\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.030\nI could actually color this all blue,\nand you wouldn't see the data, right?\n\n136\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.470\nBecause that's what's essentially\nhappening, but we use this so\n\n137\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.780\nyou can kind of see the different\nlayers that's going on.\n\n138\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.720\nNow, once layer five hands this\ninformation down to layer four,\n\n139\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.510\nlayer four puts its information on it.\n\n140\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.540\nNow, we've got a couple of terms here\nthat I kind of wanna throw to you.\n\n141\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.600\nYou have what is known as\na protocol data unit, and\n\n142\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.150\nyou have what's known\nas a service data unit.\n\n143\n00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:42.560\nWhen you have like, for instance,\nlayer 5 here puts its information on and\n\n144\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.900\nbasically modifies the information\nhere by adding that header,\n\n145\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.680\nthat header is called\na protocol data unit.\n\n146\n00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.280\nHowever, when it hands it\ndown to the lower layer and\n\n147\n00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.880\nlayer 4 puts its information to layer 4,\nit's a service data unit.\n\n148\n00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.920\nRemember, I told you, all of these\nlayers help provide services for\n\n149\n00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.270\nthe lower layers.\n\n150\n00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.748\nSo, this is layer five's\nprotocol data unit, its header.\n\n151\n00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:14.825\nBut when it It passes it down and\nit's encapsulated in layer four,\n\n152\n00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:19.655\nit becomes layer four's service data unit,\nright?\n\n153\n00:08:19.655 --> 00:08:21.165\nSo, please keep that mind.\n\n154\n00:08:21.165 --> 00:08:22.835\nAnd then on we go, right?\n\n155\n00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:26.035\nSo now, at this point,\nI've got an envelope, right?\n\n156\n00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:28.732\nI've decided what carrier I'm gonna use.\n\n157\n00:08:28.732 --> 00:08:32.610\nMaybe here in the United States,\nPost Office Service, maybe it's FedEx,\n\n158\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.250\nmaybe it's UPS, but\nI've determined my carrier.\n\n159\n00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.010\nUDP versus TCP.\n\n160\n00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.590\nI know who I want to take\nthe information where it needs to go.\n\n161\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.100\nBut I don't have addressing\ninformation on it.\n\n162\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.840\nI don't know where it's supposed to go.\n\n163\n00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.930\nNow the letter is in the envelope,\n\n164\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.970\nI've chose that maybe I'm gonna use UPS\nas the carrier, what do I gotta do?\n\n165\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.500\nI gotta put that address on it.\n\n166\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.060\nAnd I put the mailing address on it, and\n\n167\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.410\nthat's what the encapsulation\nof the layer three does.\n\n168\n00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.030\nIt puts our IP addresses on it,\n\n169\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.660\nso we know what the destination\nnetwork is that it's supposed to go.\n\n170\n00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.530\nLast but not least, I guess not last\nbecause we saw the physical layer,\n\n171\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.740\nthe next thing we have here\nis layer 2 information, and\n\n172\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.190\nthat's the LAN information.\n\n173\n00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.460\nSee, when my computer decides, hey I don't\nknow where to send this information,\n\n174\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.048\nI need to send it to the router.\n\n175\n00:09:21.048 --> 00:09:25.610\nWell, the router's directly connected to\nyour local network, so what does it do?\n\n176\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.120\nIt puts the MAC address for\nthe router and sends it to it.\n\n177\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.160\nThat's your layer two information.\n\n178\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.080\nThen it's up to the, and we'll get\ninto this more in other episodes.\n\n179\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.820\nThen it's up to the router to make\nthe decisions where to send it after that.\n\n180\n00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.020\nNow, we've kind of talked about this.\n\n181\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.903\nJust kind of as a recap remember,\n\n182\n00:09:42.903 --> 00:09:46.470\nsegments, segmentation\nhappens at layer four.\n\n183\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.010\nRemember, data packets,\nthat happens at layer three.\n\n184\n00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.730\nRemember, frames at layer two.\n\n185\n00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.900\nNow finally,\nwhen we get down the physical layer,\n\n186\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.000\nnotice I didn't actually put\nthe physical layer here.\n\n187\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.120\nI could have, and yes, it does have its\ninformation there that it puts as well.\n\n188\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.330\nAnd then,\nit gets put on the physical media.\n\n189\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.600\nThen, once it hits\nthe destination network,\n\n190\n00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.430\nit's the process of what's\nknown as decapsulation.\n\n191\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.380\nSee, what we've gone through\ngoing down the protocol\n\n192\n00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.750\nstack is encapsulation, right?\n\n193\n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.270\nA smaller doll inside of a larger doll,\ninside of a larger doll,\n\n194\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.250\ninside of a larger doll.\n\n195\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.830\nNow, once we deliver it to\nthe destination network, and\n\n196\n00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.330\nthis young lady wants to view that e-mail,\n\n197\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.798\nwell her computer is gonna go through\nthe process of removing those layers.\n\n198\n00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:33.010\nIt's gonna see,\nwell hey is this my MAC address?\n\n199\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.630\nAnd we should see that once\nit's on the local LAN,\n\n200\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.540\nit has the destination MAC address\nthrough an ARP discovery process.\n\n201\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.930\nIt says, yeah, that is my MAC address,\nand processes that information.\n\n202\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.671\nBasically, removes that layer if you will,\nlike removing that Russian doll, okay?\n\n203\n00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:54.790\nAnd then likewise,\nup to the network layer.\n\n204\n00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.250\nMy IP address, yeah, that's my IP\naddress and so on and so forth.\n\n205\n00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.455\nAll the way back up to the application\nlayer in which we've removed,\n\n206\n00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:08.167\nin this case, all the Russian dolls and\nthe only thing that we're left with is\n\n207\n00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.450\nthe data that the application\nitself expects to see.\n\n208\n00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.155\nWhen we say network aware application,\nit means that it knows how\n\n209\n00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:20.790\nto start sending this\ninformation down the OSI model.\n\n210\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.228\nWell, when it comes up the OSI model,\nbasically,\n\n211\n00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:26.915\nwhat's happening here is the application\njust says, okay that's my data,\n\n212\n00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:29.033\nI don't need to worry about anything else.\n\n213\n00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:33.716\nRemember the first three layers is\nabout the formatting of your data.\n\n214\n00:11:33.716 --> 00:11:40.370\nRemember the bottom four layers are about\nthe actual network communications.\n\n215\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.280\nSo again, that's a little bit about\nthe processing, and the reason we\n\n216\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.230\nuse this model a lot of times is to\nfind out where errors might be lying.\n\n217\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.294\nAnd so, for instance,\nif Dan came to me and Dan goes,\n\n218\n00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:54.966\nWes I think we're having\na layer three issue.\n\n219\n00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:58.330\nI've searched the network,\nmy cables are fine,\n\n220\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.383\nMAC addresses, network adaptors are good.\n\n221\n00:12:01.383 --> 00:12:02.583\nSo, the only thing left,\n\n222\n00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.560\nis maybe a misconfiguration\nin software at layer three.\n\n223\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.380\nWell, I need to know what he's\ntalking about if he asked me\n\n224\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.110\nto help him with that, right?\n\n225\n00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.770\nAnd, the case would be that,\n\n226\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.420\nhey we've gotta look,\nis an IP address misconfigured?\n\n227\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.050\nIs a subnet mask misconfigured?\n\n228\n00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.010\nIs a default gateway misconfigured?\n\n229\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.175\nIs the router turned off?\n\n230\n00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:23.570\n[LAUGH] So things like that.\n\n231\n00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.584\nWe kind of figure out where\nthe problem is, right?\n\n232\n00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:29.330\nIf I know that I can't ping an endpoint,\nwell,\n\n233\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.200\nwhere are you gonna start\nwith your troubleshooting?\n\n234\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.170\nAnother one of our host here always says\nstart with the physical layer, right?\n\n235\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.680\nWhy are you starting\nat the physical layer?\n\n236\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.240\nWell, it's one of the easiest to fix.\n\n237\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.070\nIt's one of the easiest to\nat least notice, right?\n\n238\n00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.820\nI could say, man,\nthat cable has a cut right in it.\n\n239\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.800\nI don't have to worry about its software\nconfiguration, I could visually see,\n\n240\n00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.210\nnot all the time, but I can visually see\nthere's something wrong with the cable.\n\n241\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.310\nI could put something like\na cable detector on it or\n\n242\n00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.690\na cable certifier on it and\nit says, well it's not broke.\n\n243\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.140\nI mean I see I got a continuous signal,\nelectrical signal from end point to\n\n244\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.810\nend point but the problem is this\nis supposed to be a 6A cable.\n\n245\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.140\nLooks like somebody pulled\non a little bit too much and\n\n246\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.480\nnow it's not gonna give me my\n10G speeds anymore, right?\n\n247\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.440\nIt's a damaged cable.\n\n248\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.420\nSo you start at the physical layer and\nthen if that happens, you're plugged in,\n\n249\n00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.270\nyou know you are good to go,\nwe start at layer two.\n\n250\n00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.690\nOr a good move to Layer 2.\n\n251\n00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:22.820\nWhat's that?\nDo I have a link light?\n\n252\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.010\nDo I got a link status\non the network adapter?\n\n253\n00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.610\nIs there a link light that's\nmoving on the switch?\n\n254\n00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.140\nMaybe the switch has got a port shut off,\nright?\n\n255\n00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.660\nNow technically,\n\n256\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.820\nthat would be the physical layer\nwith the port shut off, right?\n\n257\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.390\nWe don't have any electrical\ncommunications going, but\n\n258\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.620\nat least I know that it's at the switch.\n\n259\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.490\nAnd then finally,\nthings like software communications or\n\n260\n00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.280\nexcuse me, your routing layer,\nyour layer three.\n\n261\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.896\nAgain, configurations of\nthings like IP addresses,\n\n262\n00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:54.150\nrouting protocols,\nmaybe you've got a routing loop going on.\n\n263\n00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.080\nAnd then,\nyou just work your way back up the stack.\n\n264\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.180\nIs it an encryption problem?\n\n265\n00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.700\nWell, then that means it's\na presentation layer problem.\n\n266\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.073\nIf I think that it's\nan encryption problem,\n\n267\n00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:06.952\ndo I have the right encryption key?\n\n268\n00:14:06.952 --> 00:14:09.640\nDo I got a key that is corrupt?\n\n269\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.390\nI can't see the data.\n\n270\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.630\nI can't get in to the data, right?\n\n271\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.712\nHow about the application itself.\n\n272\n00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:17.810\nMaybe it's the application, all the way\nback up here at the application layer\n\n273\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.840\nthat's having the problem and\nour network is just fine.\n\n274\n00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.160\nWe don't have routing problems.\n\n275\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.470\nWe don't have data link problems,\nnetwork adapters got link lights,\n\n276\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.300\nand we got information communicating,\nright?\n\n277\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.850\nPhysical cables, no problem, wired fine,\n\n278\n00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.260\nusing the right wiring standards but\nthe application itself is the issue.\n\n279\n00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.080\nNow, there's another layer here, Dan,\nthat we haven't really mentioned there.\n\n280\n00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.355\nAnd the problem could\nstem at this layer too.\n\n281\n00:14:45.355 --> 00:14:47.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to be nice on this one but\n\n282\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.960\nyou know what layer that\nis Dan by any chance?\n\n283\n00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.510\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be the human layer.\n\n284\n00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.930\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's what we\ncall the layer eight issue, right?\n\n285\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.010\nAnd it happens.\n\n286\n00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.420\nI probably should have a shirt that\njust says, walking layer eight issue.\n\n287\n00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.570\nI've been the source of my\nnetworking problems before, why?\n\n288\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.100\nBecause I misconfigured something, right?\n\n289\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.700\nAnd, if you misconfigure something or you\ndon't plug something in right, or you do\n\n290\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:18.318\nWes's 568w instead of 568b and wiring it\nappropriately, it could be user error.\n\n291\n00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:23.400\nBut, there again,\nwhen you use this OSI model,\n\n292\n00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.500\nif you learn it for the theory\npurposes on the exam, that's great.\n\n293\n00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.770\nBut I will tell you that you should\nstill continue to use it for\n\n294\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.200\nthings like troubleshooting.\n\n295\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.110\nI know some people say,\n\n296\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.060\nwell it's theory, I really don't need\nto look at it anymore like that.\n\n297\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.560\nThen just that.\n\n298\n00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.570\nAnd that is, I wouldn't say very true.\n\n299\n00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.850\nI believe that you can use this as\na troubleshooting model to figure\n\n300\n00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.418\nout what layer of the OSI\nmodel is your problem and\n\n301\n00:15:49.418 --> 00:15:53.042\nhelp you to identify where you\nneed to start to fix that problem.\n\n302\n00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:56.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, well OSI,\nwe've kind of run you through the gamut,\n\n303\n00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.920\nwe've talked about each one of\nthe layers You do need to know that.\n\n304\n00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.860\nThere's always some fun\nacronyms to help you do that.\n\n305\n00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.250\nSo, find one,\nGoogle search not acronyms but acrostics,\n\n306\n00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:06.910\nI guess, is what they're called.\n\n307\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.590\nFigure one out that works for you,\nso that you can remember what each\n\n308\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.350\none of those layers are because\nthey can be a little daunting.\n\n309\n00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.890\nAnd then learn about the encapsulation.\n\n310\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.790\nThe encapsulation, so that you can see\nhow that process works itself out.\n\n311\n00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.940\nKnowing that, again, for\nthe exam, and like Wes said,\n\n312\n00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.300\nfor good old troubleshooting.\n\n313\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.240\nWes, anything else we need to\ncover before we close the show?\n\n314\n00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.510\n&gt;&gt; You know, you just reminded me of\nsomething that was that was really\n\n315\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:32.010\nimportant, and that is a little mnemonic\nto remember all of these layers,\n\n316\n00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:38.110\nand that is all people seem to\nneed data processing, right?\n\n317\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.490\nIf you remember application\nlayer presenting,\n\n318\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.560\nall people seem to need data processing.\n\n319\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.030\nIt might be a way that you can help\nyourselves to remember it on the exam.\n\n320\n00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.410\nThe other thing is know the associations\nof the layers because I\n\n321\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.710\ndon't know what they're\ngonna give you on the exam.\n\n322\n00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.380\nAre they gonna call it\nthe application layer or\n\n323\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.180\nare they gonna call it layer three or\nlayer seven?\n\n324\n00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.893\nI don't know.\n\n325\n00:16:56.893 --> 00:17:01.920\nSo know the layers' names and\ntheir respective numbers.\n\n326\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.470\nThe numerical values of them just\nin case they ask you on the exam.\n\n327\n00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mine was a little cruder.\n\n328\n00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.620\nWe always heard all people\nsmell the new dog poop.\n\n329\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.796\nAnd stupid as that is,\nI remembered it, so it was effective.\n\n330\n00:17:13.796 --> 00:17:14.500\n&gt;&gt; It worked.\n\n331\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.384\n&gt;&gt; There are tons of them out there.\n\n332\n00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:18.568\nLike I said, go find yourself one that\nworks for you that you'll remember what\n\n333\n00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:22.000\neach one of those layers are so that you\ncan nail those questions on the exam.\n\n334\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.938\nWes, thanks for dropping by today,\nthanks for explaining OSI to us.\n\n335\n00:17:24.938 --> 00:17:28.666\nWe thank you guys for joining us as\nwell but it is that time, yet again, for\n\n336\n00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:29.460\nus to sign off.\n\n337\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.240\nFor ITPro TV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n338\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.024\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n339\n00:17:33.024 --> 00:17:34.516\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n340\n00:17:34.516 --> 00:17:40.830\n[MUSIC]\n\n341\n00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.921\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.334\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:11.800\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.832\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:16.317\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:19.167\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:21.640\nwe are moving on with more\non our Network+ series.\n\n9\n00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.742\nAnd of course, joining me in the studio\nagain is our good friend, our mentor,\n\n10\n00:00:24.742 --> 00:00:26.185\nour getting star in this endeavor.\n\n11\n00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.240\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.390\nWes, welcome back my man.\n\n13\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.190\nHow goes it today?\n\n14\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.130\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.110\nThanks for having me here.\n\n16\n00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.760\nThat's right, we are joining,\nwe're gonna be diving into,\n\n17\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.778\nif I can figure out what\nit is we are doing here.\n\n18\n00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:39.968\n[LAUGH] We're gonna be diving into\nthe basics of network theory and\n\n19\n00:00:39.968 --> 00:00:41.534\nsome of the concepts here, so,\n\n20\n00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:45.376\nwe can understand some of the things that\nwe kinda mentioned from time to time.\n\n21\n00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:48.270\nOr at least, I should say, I mentioned\nfrom time to time throughout this series.\n\n22\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.700\nAnd sometimes,\n\n23\n00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.390\nforget maybe you guys haven't heard\nwhat some of these concepts are.\n\n24\n00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.620\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\ndive into a few of the basics.\n\n25\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.340\nNow, in a previous episode,we\ntalked about the OSI model, right?\n\n26\n00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.750\nThe Open Systems Interconnection model.\n\n27\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.470\nAnd we had talked about how\nit was a seven-layer model.\n\n28\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.830\nIf you haven't seen that episode,\n\n29\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.430\ndefinitely go watch that episode\nas it will come in handy for\n\n30\n00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.750\na lot of the different things,\ntheory-wise that we talk about.\n\n31\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.478\nBut keep in mind, one of the things that\nwe mentioned in that episode is as data,\n\n32\n00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:24.160\nwhen data's gonna be\nplaced on the network,\n\n33\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.929\nit goes through those\nseries of seven layers.\n\n34\n00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.380\nAnd each layer, it relies on\nthe services of the layer below it.\n\n35\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.625\nAnd we had mentioned how that's kinda\nlike taking Russian dolls, right?\n\n36\n00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:39.580\nThe smallest doll and\nputting it in a larger doll, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.595\nthen in a larger doll, and\nthat's essentially what encapsulation is.\n\n38\n00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:49.825\nNow, I got a little diagram on my computer\nhere that we should take a look at.\n\n39\n00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:54.190\nI just pulled some of it\n[LAUGH] off of the OSI model.\n\n40\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.075\nAnd we talked about how as data works\nits way down these layers, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:03.914\nWe end up adding a little\nbit of extra data, right?\n\n42\n00:02:03.914 --> 00:02:07.317\nTheir layer 6 header, remember,\nthat's presentation layer and then,\n\n43\n00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:08.298\nthe layer 5 header.\n\n44\n00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:13.585\nNow, this could, we draw this so you guys\ncan kinda understand what's going on.\n\n45\n00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:17.935\nIt would be just as valid to say that\nthe data would look a little bit more\n\n46\n00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:19.535\ncorrectly like this, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.995\nNot these individual\nlayers,but if you see,\n\n48\n00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:25.965\nI could actually do the encapsulation\nmore like this, right?\n\n49\n00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.664\nSo, you have the data layer, right?\n\n50\n00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:31.935\nOr the application layer where your\ndata's coming in to the network.\n\n51\n00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:35.224\nAnd then, the presentation layer, once\nit's done, when it gets done formatting,\n\n52\n00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:36.374\nit actually looks like that.\n\n53\n00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:39.524\nLike I said, we just kinda put these\nheaders here just to kind of show you\n\n54\n00:02:39.524 --> 00:02:41.060\ntheoretically what's going on.\n\n55\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.752\nBut the encapsulation, really,\nis that whole entire data.\n\n56\n00:02:45.752 --> 00:02:51.929\nIf you will, let me raise this section,\nso we could see what's going on,\n\n57\n00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:56.214\nbeing basically put inside\na larger capsulation,\n\n58\n00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:59.318\nif you will, a larger piece of data.\n\n59\n00:02:59.318 --> 00:03:01.587\nAnd then, we could turn around and\nwe can hand that down.\n\n60\n00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:04.947\nAnd when we hand that down,\nsame thing happens again.\n\n61\n00:03:04.947 --> 00:03:09.890\nIt's finally, until we get down to the,\nreally, to the data link layer.\n\n62\n00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.260\nAnd the data link layer,\nby the time we [LAUGH] get down there,\n\n63\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.580\nwhat we end up having is what's\nknown as a fully encapsulated frame.\n\n64\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.540\nAnd that means that it is pretty much\n\n65\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.130\na unit of data that is ready to\nput on to the physical medium.\n\n66\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.680\nNow, when we work our way back up,\nthe protocol stack, right?\n\n67\n00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.978\nSo, the data goes over the wire,\ngoes to the destination network.\n\n68\n00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:40.576\nAnd now, it's the person or the\ndestination, the machine that's processing\n\n69\n00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:45.220\nthe information, it goes through\nthe process of decapsulation, right?\n\n70\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.700\nAnd decapsulation is it quite literally,\nbasically, working up through the layers.\n\n71\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.698\nStripping off all the additional\ninformation being processed at each\n\n72\n00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:58.152\nlayer until finally,\nwhat we're left with at the end is just\n\n73\n00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:02.574\nthe application data that is handed\nover to that network aware application.\n\n74\n00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.510\nLet's say, for instance, like an email.\n\n75\n00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.320\nSo, that is your data encapsulation and\ndecapsulation.\n\n76\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.582\nKeep in mind, in the context of\nsomething like the OSI model,\n\n77\n00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:16.680\nit's just the fact that we're taking\nthat data from an upper layer, right?\n\n78\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.667\nThe services that are provided, and\nthen we sit it down into a framework and\n\n79\n00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:24.390\nthat's the encapsulation part\nof the layer that's below it.\n\n80\n00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.460\nAnd then, we take that whole\nentire bit of information and\n\n81\n00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.660\nwe set it down into the framework\nof the lower layer below it.\n\n82\n00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.600\nUntil finally, like I said,\nwe get down to layer two here.\n\n83\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.040\nAnd we've got a frame that is\nfully formatted, ready to put\n\n84\n00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.660\nout on the physical media, essentially\nturning it into the electrical ones and\n\n85\n00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.820\nzeros that are passed\nacross the copper media.\n\n86\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.500\nOn the other side,\nit's just a reverse process.\n\n87\n00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.930\nLayer two information,\nthat's my MAC address,\n\n88\n00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.000\nstrip that information off,\nprocess it, moves up the layer.\n\n89\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.480\nIs this my IP address?\n\n90\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.930\nThat's my IP address.\n\n91\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.590\nProcess that information.\n\n92\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.170\nRemove that wrapper, right?\n\n93\n00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.710\nYou can also think of it as an onion,\nright?\n\n94\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.560\nPeeling back the layers of the onion\nuntil you get to the center.\n\n95\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.120\nIn this case,\n\n96\n00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.690\nthe center is the data that's finally\nturned over to the application.\n\n97\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.275\n&gt;&gt; Now ,Wes, another one of the really\nfoundational topics or concepts theories.\n\n98\n00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:16.321\nThings that we do techniques\neven inside of networking\n\n99\n00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:19.110\nis going to be multiplayer modulations,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.630\nDifferent types of things like this.\n\n101\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.980\nCan you tell us a little more about that?\n\n102\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan.\nOne of the techniques that they call out\n\n103\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.310\nis being able to take multiple signals and\napply this to a single physical medium.\n\n104\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.888\nAnd that's through something\nknown as multiplexing.\n\n105\n00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:35.920\nIn fact, I got a diagram here on\nmy screen that kinda explains just\n\n106\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.360\nthe concept here of what something known\nas a mux device or a multiplexer does.\n\n107\n00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.700\nIf you can look here on the left, and\n\n108\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.440\nwe see that we've got three\ndifferent clients, right?\n\n109\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.076\nSignal 1, 2, and 3.\n\n110\n00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:50.780\nAnd they're gonna be sent into a multiplex\ndevice, or a multiplexer, if you will.\n\n111\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.380\nAnd this is typically called a mux.\n\n112\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.250\nNow, what the multiplexer is gonna\ndo is combine that into a single\n\n113\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.690\nsignal over a single physical medium and\nsend it over to another multiplexer.\n\n114\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.100\nHowever, notice the direction,\nthe flow of the traffic, right?\n\n115\n00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.310\nOn the one side here, when\nthe multiplexing is happening, we have,\n\n116\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.810\nyou can also hear what's called\nmultiple and single outs, right?\n\n117\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.750\nIn wireless technologies, right, we\ntalk about multiple in and multiple out.\n\n118\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.780\nWell, this is kind of weird because it's\nmultiple in and only one out, right?\n\n119\n00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.690\nWe take multiple signals,\ncombine them into a single signal, and\n\n120\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.670\nwe send them over the physical medium.\n\n121\n00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.160\nNow, I've kinda left it here,\n\n122\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.100\nso you can kinda see what's going on,\nmore again just conceptually.\n\n123\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.580\nBut essentially going,\n\n124\n00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.490\nthe single out is just that single signal\nthat's sent over the physical medium.\n\n125\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.449\nAnd then, on the other side,\nyou have single in and multi out.\n\n126\n00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:44.852\nOr yeah, multi out.\n\n127\n00:06:44.852 --> 00:06:45.630\nAnd what does this mean?\n\n128\n00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.890\nWell, this is just\nreversing of the process.\n\n129\n00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.130\nAnd you could hear this called a demux.\n\n130\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.310\nWell, so, what's the difference between\nthe multiplexer and the demultiplexer?\n\n131\n00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.635\nDirection of the traffic really\nis what it comes down to.\n\n132\n00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:02.390\n[LAUGH] If you're sending a signal and you\nneed to combine them, that's multiplexing.\n\n133\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.660\nIf you are receiving a single signal and\n\n134\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.470\nyou separate that out into three signals,\nthat's gonna be a demux.\n\n135\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.310\nNow, these can scale up quite large.\n\n136\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.141\nI mean,\nyou could talk about just a two to one.\n\n137\n00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:18.664\nYou could talk four to one.\n\n138\n00:07:18.664 --> 00:07:21.190\nYou could talk eight to one, 16 to one.\n\n139\n00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.910\nJust understand the concept for the exam,\nthat when it comes to multiplexing,\n\n140\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.030\nit's the process of taking\nmore than one signal,\n\n141\n00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.000\ncombining them into a single signal, and\n\n142\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.486\nsending them over the physical\nmedium as a single signal.\n\n143\n00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:41.690\nDemux or demultiplexing, again, on the\nother side, is single in, multiple out.\n\n144\n00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.220\nIt means that we remove the combined\nsignals, separating them back into\n\n145\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.910\ntheir three individual signals,\nin this case, on this example.\n\n146\n00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.800\nAnd delivered to the recipient.\n\n147\n00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.712\nAll right, so,\nthat's one of the techniques.\n\n148\n00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:59.119\nSome of the other techniques that we\nhave when it comes to, for instance,\n\n149\n00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:01.906\nanalog and digital communications, right?\n\n150\n00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:07.280\nWe've talked about modems before,\nand we take a digital signal And\n\n151\n00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.898\nwe run it through this conversion\nprocess if you will, and\n\n152\n00:08:11.898 --> 00:08:16.290\nthen we place it on analog phone lines,\nright?\n\n153\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.180\nWell you gotta understand that those\n\n154\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.880\nsignals are completely\nincompatible with each other.\n\n155\n00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.430\nWe almost have like a media converter,\nif you will,\n\n156\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.220\nis essentially what\na modem is kinda doing.\n\n157\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.950\nIt's taking those ones and zeros, right,\nthose electrical ones and zeros, and\n\n158\n00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.220\nit's converting it from those electrical\nimpulses into a sound, right?\n\n159\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.060\nAnd when that happens we\ncall that modulation.\n\n160\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.080\nNow, they also call out in analog and\ndigital, or digital-analog communications,\n\n161\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.030\nthey also talk about other\nmultiplexing techniques as well.\n\n162\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.520\nAnd one of the ones that we wanna look at\n\n163\n00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.980\nfirst is something known as\nfrequency division multiplexing.\n\n164\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.300\nNow I know, guys,\nthat is a big, fancy term.\n\n165\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.200\nYou're not here to learn any kind of\nelectrical or communications engineering,\n\n166\n00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.810\nyou just really have to know the basics,\nguys.\n\n167\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.340\nAll right, what frequency divisional,\nor division multiplexing is,\n\n168\n00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.490\nis typically,\nwhat we have are multiple channels.\n\n169\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.650\nWe have a bandwidth, right?\n\n170\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.140\nAnd in that finite bandwidth,\n\n171\n00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.900\nit is divided up into individual\nfrequencies, individual channels, right?\n\n172\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.620\nAnd then we can send our\nsignals over those channels.\n\n173\n00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.620\nNow this is what is known as a full duplex\ncommunication because look what can\n\n174\n00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.660\nhappen here.\n\n175\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.880\nI can send signal over one channel, but\n\n176\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.360\nDan, can you see what we can\nalso do over adjacent channels?\n\n177\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.330\nIf we're sending over one channel, you can\nsee that it looks like we're receiving on\n\n178\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.880\nthe other channel,\nmaking this a full duplex communication.\n\n179\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.750\nSo we divide the bandwidth, multiple\nsignals over a single bandwidth into\n\n180\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.830\nindividual channels, hence frequency\ndivision multiplexing, right?\n\n181\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.170\nNow, they don't really call\nthat one out on the exam.\n\n182\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.620\nAnd not on the objectives, but I just feel\nthat you should see the comparison between\n\n183\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.160\nthe two cuz the next one,\nthey do call out.\n\n184\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.310\nAnd that's something known as TDM,\nTime Division Multiplexing.\n\n185\n00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.910\nAgain guys, don't let this scare you\n\n186\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.535\nthat you have to have some kind of\nelectrical engineering degree, you don't.\n\n187\n00:10:21.535 --> 00:10:23.355\nBut, what I want you to notice is that,\n\n188\n00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:27.025\nnotice that we have a single\nchannel this time, all right?\n\n189\n00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:29.765\nBut it's a little bit\ndifferent on how it works now.\n\n190\n00:10:29.765 --> 00:10:35.385\nIn time division multiplexing,\nunlike frequency division multiplexing,\n\n191\n00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:38.495\ntime division multiplexing says,\nwe only have a single channel.\n\n192\n00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:43.290\nWell, if I only have a single channel, how\nis it that I get communications to Dan,\n\n193\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.620\nand Dan gets communications back to me.\n\n194\n00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.060\nWell with time division multiplexing\nnow what you say is yeah,\n\n195\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.910\nyou can use the channel,\nright now, and stop.\n\n196\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.390\nDan you can use the channel, and stop.\n\n197\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.670\nNotice it's discrete time slots, so\n\n198\n00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.770\nwe divide the bandwidth up\ninto multiple time slots.\n\n199\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.810\nNotice we have signal one and these\nare really both signal one, sending and\n\n200\n00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.680\nreceiving.\n\n201\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.160\nYou can send, now you stop,\nand you receive.\n\n202\n00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.190\nThe next person now can send and\nif they're receiving information maybe\n\n203\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.010\nthe next time slot is them\nreceiving the information, right.\n\n204\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:23.040\nSo it's a single channel\ndivided up by time slots\n\n205\n00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.710\nversus multiple channels within\na single bandwidth, all right?\n\n206\n00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.370\nNow that being said,\nthis one really isn't called out but\n\n207\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.760\nthey do kind of do this hybrid\ntoday that I kinda wanna mention.\n\n208\n00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.330\nAnd it combines kind of like\nfrequency division multiplexing and\n\n209\n00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.880\ntime division multiplexing, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.320\nAnd notice that here,\n\n211\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.190\nif we say we only got a single channel,\nnow if you say we got a single channel,\n\n212\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.770\nyou say, well, Wes, how is that\nnot time division multiplexing?\n\n213\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.670\nWell, what if I told you you\ncould take one of those multiple\n\n214\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.690\nchannels in frequency\ndivision multiplexing, and\n\n215\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.410\nI say, okay, Dan,\nyou could use that channel right now.\n\n216\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.020\nAll right, well, he's still\nusing the frequency division but\n\n217\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.270\nI'm telling him he can use\nthat channel right now.\n\n218\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.410\nNow, stop.\nAnd now, I'm gonna use that channel.\n\n219\n00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.140\nNow, stop.\n\n220\n00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.310\nNow, the third person's\ngonna use that channel.\n\n221\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.890\nSo we can actually reuse channels\nwithin frequency division,\n\n222\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.890\nif we give them a time slot.\n\n223\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.640\nYou use channel one, now you stop.\n\n224\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.450\nI'll use channel one, now you stop.\n\n225\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.640\nSomebody else uses channel one.\n\n226\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.160\nSo what you see today really is\nkinda like a hybrid between the two.\n\n227\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.140\nIt's a way that they can reuse\nwithin a finite bandwidth right?\n\n228\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.560\nWe have multiple channels.\n\n229\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.160\nWell can I put a hundred signals on that\none channel or within that one location?\n\n230\n00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.010\nWell yeah I can if you're applying\ntime division and frequency, right.\n\n231\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.800\nBecause we can do what's\nknown as spread spectrum.\n\n232\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.020\nWe use all the different channels\nacross the whole entire spectrum and\n\n233\n00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.460\nwe use them in different time slots.\n\n234\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.922\nSo we have seven, eight,\nnine, ten hundred people,\n\n235\n00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:55.446\nmaybe not a hundred people\ncan get a little crazy there.\n\n236\n00:12:55.446 --> 00:12:59.635\nBut multiple people can reuse those\nchannels because they're not on them at\n\n237\n00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:03.700\nthe same time, which is another one\nof those things that you'll see too.\n\n238\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.871\nAll right, now some of the other\ntechniques that we have when it comes to\n\n239\n00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:12.610\nanalog and digital techniques, we talk\na little bit about modulation, right?\n\n240\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.530\nI've already kind of mentioned modulation.\n\n241\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.080\nRemember modulation is just\ntaking a digital signal,\n\n242\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.520\nright, applying it through digital\nto analog converter chips and\n\n243\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.690\nthe output is essentially\nan analog signal that's sound.\n\n244\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.850\nGuys there are a couple of them that\nI wanna call out here for the exam.\n\n245\n00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.336\nI don't expect you to, and\nI missed one here, let me change that,\n\n246\n00:13:34.336 --> 00:13:36.658\nthat is not supposed to be an F,\nthere we go.\n\n247\n00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:40.115\nThey have what's known as\namplitude shift keying, all right.\n\n248\n00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:44.464\nSo how do we represent right,\nhow do we take a digital signal and\n\n249\n00:13:44.464 --> 00:13:47.031\nrepresent it as an analogue signal?\n\n250\n00:13:47.031 --> 00:13:50.060\nAll right well one thing that we have\nis called sampling array, all right.\n\n251\n00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.050\nSampling is essentially,\nI have to know how do I take this\n\n252\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.420\none second of data, right, and I represent\nit as something completely different.\n\n253\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.820\nWell I have to take samples of it,\nall right.\n\n254\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.240\nAnd within that one second,\n\n255\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.970\nhow much data samples do I have to take\nin order to accurately represent it.\n\n256\n00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.690\nThat's sampling array, all right.\n\n257\n00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.850\nWith amplitude shifting, what we\ndoing is taking the frequency, right,\n\n258\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.090\nexcuse me, the strength of the signal,\nthat amplitude is strength.\n\n259\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.188\nIf I want something to represent, say,\na binary one from digital analog,\n\n260\n00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:30.790\nwell then, I increase the strength, when I\nincrease the strength, that becomes a one.\n\n261\n00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:35.180\nIf I decrease, reduce the string,\nthe right that becomes the binary zero,\n\n262\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.000\nso very basically that\namplitude shift key.\n\n263\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.870\nIf I increase the strength,\nthat's a binary one,\n\n264\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.975\nif I decrease the strength,\nthat's a binary zero.\n\n265\n00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:47.536\nFrequency shift keying, if I want\nsomething to represent a binary one,\n\n266\n00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:52.368\nI speed it up, frequency right,\nmore faster frequency within\n\n267\n00:14:52.368 --> 00:14:56.951\nthat certain sampling period\nwill represent a binary one.\n\n268\n00:14:56.951 --> 00:15:00.277\nIf it's not as frequent,\nright we slow down the frequency, and\n\n269\n00:15:00.277 --> 00:15:02.415\nit represents a binary zero.\n\n270\n00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:04.895\nThen you've also got a couple other\nones that I just mention here for\n\n271\n00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:07.909\nthe sake of completeness,\nyou also phase shift keying.\n\n272\n00:15:07.909 --> 00:15:11.545\nAnd then the last one here,\nI always have to look, I can almost never\n\n273\n00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:16.030\nremember how to pronounce the first word,\nit's quadrature amplitude modulation.\n\n274\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.180\nGuys, again,\nit's not an electrical engineering class,\n\n275\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.130\nit's not a communications\nengineering class.\n\n276\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.645\nGood, cuz I can't even\ncommunicate that word.\n\n277\n00:15:23.645 --> 00:15:27.960\n[LAUGH] But I would just know that\nthese are some modulation techniques.\n\n278\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.900\nThese are some of the things\nthat you might see on the exam.\n\n279\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, good stuff, Wes.\n\n280\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.120\nIt's definitely things that if you think\nabout it, you're gonna practically\n\n281\n00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.730\nprobably experience in one form or\nanother, at one time or another.\n\n282\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.318\nWe've all kinda played around\nwith modems from time to time,\n\n283\n00:15:41.318 --> 00:15:43.350\nespecially if you're as old as Wes and\nI [LAUGH].\n\n284\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.750\nWe actually used to them\non a regular basis.\n\n285\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.150\nBut the whole multiplexing when\nit comes to fiber channels, and\n\n286\n00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.650\nthings of that nature, they still do that.\n\n287\n00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.280\nAnd you will as well.\n\n288\n00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.306\nBut going into some more basical, basical?\n\n289\n00:15:55.306 --> 00:16:00.010\nBasic foundational type of topics, we do\nwanna make sure that you understand things\n\n290\n00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.653\nlike the numbering systems that might be\nused inside of a network environment.\n\n291\n00:16:04.653 --> 00:16:05.391\nMost definitely.\n\n292\n00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:09.603\nAnd these really we're kinda just\ngonna recap on because Dan and\n\n293\n00:16:09.603 --> 00:16:12.812\nI did a episode where we\ntalked about IP schemas.\n\n294\n00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:16.592\nAnd we dealt pretty extensively with\nthe difference numbering systems.\n\n295\n00:16:16.592 --> 00:16:18.360\nThere's only one that I'm gonna add.\n\n296\n00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.240\nAnd it's not as common as the first two.\n\n297\n00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.980\nBinary, right?\n\n298\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.485\nWe talked about binary [LAUGH]\nto decimal conversion and\n\n299\n00:16:23.485 --> 00:16:24.960\ndecimal to binary conversion.\n\n300\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.585\nAnd I know some of you out there\nare probably saying, my gosh.\n\n301\n00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:28.990\nWhy do I have to do that?\n\n302\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.240\nI don't wanna ever do that in my life.\n\n303\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.478\nWell, remember when you're learning\nsubnetting, it does come in handy.\n\n304\n00:16:34.478 --> 00:16:36.463\nThe other one that we've looked at,\nright, and\n\n305\n00:16:36.463 --> 00:16:38.242\nthat's a base two numbering\nsystem by the way.\n\n306\n00:16:38.242 --> 00:16:39.600\nLet's go ahead and mention that.\n\n307\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.889\nOnly two possibilities, right?\n\n308\n00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:43.060\nBinary zero, binary one.\n\n309\n00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.535\nAnd we've also talked about hexidecimal\nas well in our IP addressing\n\n310\n00:16:47.535 --> 00:16:51.017\nepisodes where we were talking about IPV6,\nright?\n\n311\n00:16:51.017 --> 00:16:54.093\nHexidecimal, also with things\nlike our MAC addresses,\n\n312\n00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:56.090\nit's a hexidecimal values as well.\n\n313\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:57.638\nThat's base 16.\n\n314\n00:16:57.638 --> 00:17:02.850\nRemember we had zero through nine, and\nthen we have six additional possibilities.\n\n315\n00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.330\nAgain, what is it, a, b, c, d, e, and f?\n\n316\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.960\nThat's a base 16 numbering system.\n\n317\n00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.480\nOur normal decimal system,\nby the way, is base ten, right?\n\n318\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.621\nSo that's zero through nine, and then\nthen last one they call out as the octal.\n\n319\n00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:21.104\nI tell you Dan, I don't know that I've\never actually had to use octal, and\n\n320\n00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:22.666\nthat's where it's base eight.\n\n321\n00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:27.730\nYou have zero through seven representation\nand then you start and then you go to ten.\n\n322\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.350\nAgain guys,\n\n323\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.660\nI don't expect you [LAUGH] guys to see\nthat inside of your computing industry.\n\n324\n00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.760\nIn fact, it's kinda interesting.\n\n325\n00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.670\nI looked at where this was,\n\n326\n00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.730\nsome of these were the earliest,\nI don't know, manifestations of this.\n\n327\n00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.390\nOne of them was the original\n\n328\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.710\nupright computer system from\nDigital Equipment Corporation.\n\n329\n00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.460\nAnd I can't think of it.\n\n330\n00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.440\nIt's a PDL or PL or something like that.\n\n331\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.475\nBut anyways, it's an old system so-\n&gt;&gt; Sounds old.\n\n332\n00:17:52.475 --> 00:17:53.735\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:55.278\n&gt;&gt; And when we say old, at that point,\n\n334\n00:17:55.278 --> 00:17:58.109\nthey didn't even have monitors on\nthe computers if that shows you\n\n335\n00:17:58.109 --> 00:17:58.788\nhow old it was.\n\n336\n00:17:58.788 --> 00:18:02.220\nSo the octal system,\nI don't expect you to actually see.\n\n337\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.540\nBut I would know and check out our\n\n338\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.430\nbinary to decimal conversion\nhexadecimal in the IP schemes for sure.\n\n339\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.208\nAll right, so what are some other\nthings that they call out there, Dan?\n\n340\n00:18:15.208 --> 00:18:18.564\nThe other thing they call out\nis broadband versus baseband.\n\n341\n00:18:18.564 --> 00:18:22.790\nWhen we look at broadband versus baseband,\nbroadband is an analog signal.\n\n342\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.512\nBaseband is a digital signal.\n\n343\n00:18:24.512 --> 00:18:28.590\nAnd that's what we've been talking about\nhere is analog to digital signals.\n\n344\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.899\nSo again remember broadband signaling this\nis gonna be something that's an analog\n\n345\n00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:35.064\nsignal and baseband is a digital signal.\n\n346\n00:18:35.064 --> 00:18:38.050\nNow that might be news\nto you guys out there.\n\n347\n00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.001\nYou might've maybe always thought\nof broadband as just being\n\n348\n00:18:41.001 --> 00:18:42.740\nfast Internet connection.\n\n349\n00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.830\nI know that's how it's used, but\ntechnically it does mean an analog signal.\n\n350\n00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.730\nAll right, let's see.\n\n351\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.310\nCouple of other things that we have\ntoo that we gotta take a look at.\n\n352\n00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.882\nIt's interesting that\nthey call this one out.\n\n353\n00:18:55.882 --> 00:19:02.180\nThey call out something known as\nBit Rate and Baud Rate, all right?\n\n354\n00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.720\nSo, let me see if I can help you\nout with bit rates first, okay?\n\n355\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.940\nNow, some of you guys might\nknow bit rate as how many\n\n356\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.040\nbits can travel over\nthe wire in a given second.\n\n357\n00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.420\nIn fact, I got a little bit of a diagram\nhere, you can see that it's kinda using\n\n358\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.040\nthe differential Manchester\nencoding process here, right?\n\n359\n00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.110\n&gt;&gt; Where we're basically just keeping\ntrack of the electrical changes.\n\n360\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:26.940\nBut anyways, that being said, you'll\nnotice that we have a series of bits here.\n\n361\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.490\nAnd when we talk about bitrate,\nwhat we're talking about is exactly that,\n\n362\n00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.790\nthe amount of bits.\n\n363\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.440\nNow baud is a little bit different.\n\n364\n00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.687\nAnd in the earlier days when these\nmodems basically had their baud rate and\n\n365\n00:19:38.687 --> 00:19:40.551\ntheir bit rate were identical.\n\n366\n00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:46.760\nIf you had a 9600 baud modem, you had\n9600 bits that were traveling along it.\n\n367\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.430\nBut that's just not the case\nas the technology grew.\n\n368\n00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.470\nYou'd have to know the difference\nbetween the baud rate and\n\n369\n00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.670\nthe bit rate because baud\nrate is slightly different.\n\n370\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.940\nIf I notice,\nin fact let me count these real quick.\n\n371\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.365\nWhat do I got?\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven,\n\n372\n00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:02.661\neight, all right?\n\n373\n00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:03.550\nAnd what do I got?\n\n374\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.280\nOne, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight.\n\n375\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.010\nOkay, so I kept the bit rate the same but\nthe baud rate's different, all right?\n\n376\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.405\nAnd here's why.\n\n377\n00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:16.080\nBaud rate doesn't count the overall\nbits in a given second.\n\n378\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.402\nIt only counts the electrical\nvoltage transitions.\n\n379\n00:20:19.402 --> 00:20:23.030\nSo there's a difference like I said in the\nearlier days, that matched, one for one.\n\n380\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.250\nAgain, electrical current change,\non off key we were using.\n\n381\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.560\nYou got a one, guess what,\nyou got a transition.\n\n382\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.466\nBut with things like Manchester encoding\nthat only records the transitions,\n\n383\n00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.455\nbaud rate and bit rate can be different,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n384\n00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:38.499\nBits give me a second.\n\n385\n00:20:38.499 --> 00:20:40.445\nHow many bits transferred the wire?\n\n386\n00:20:40.445 --> 00:20:42.420\nBaud give me that same second and\n\n387\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.110\nshow me the electrical changes\nin the voltage, right?\n\n388\n00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.440\nThat's baud versus bit.\n\n389\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.870\nSo definitely know that for the exam.\n\n390\n00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.518\nAll right, let's see, moving along.\n\n391\n00:20:54.518 --> 00:20:58.907\nNext thing that we have is something that\nwe've kind of talked about a little bit\n\n392\n00:20:58.907 --> 00:21:01.210\nabout on and off throughout this series.\n\n393\n00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.374\nWe've kinda mentioned\nthe contention-based media access\n\n394\n00:21:05.374 --> 00:21:08.072\nof ethernet-based communications.\n\n395\n00:21:08.072 --> 00:21:11.720\nBut one of the things that we really\nhaven't talked too much about is\n\n396\n00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.696\nsomething known as Carrier Sense\nMultiple Access Collision Detection.\n\n397\n00:21:15.696 --> 00:21:21.235\nAnd I know that's a lot in\none little acronym, CSMACD.\n\n398\n00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:25.849\nAnd up until 10G, this is how\nethernet based networks would access\n\n399\n00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:31.030\nthe network at any given time and let's\nkind of go through this process here.\n\n400\n00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.570\nSo, collision detection, it really starts\nout with something known as collision or\n\n401\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.630\ncarrier sense and carrier detect.\n\n402\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.380\nCarrier sense really just boils down\nto the fact that, is the media there?\n\n403\n00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.700\nIs it idle?\n\n404\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.350\nCan I use it?\n\n405\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.770\nThat's carrier sense, right?\n\n406\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.170\nCarrier detect is detecting if\na collision happens, right?\n\n407\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.250\nSo those are a couple of\nthings to keep in mind.\n\n408\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.610\nCarrier sense, is the media available?\n\n409\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.150\nThis is not just in wired networks.\n\n410\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.560\nWe use this in wireless networks too.\n\n411\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.320\nAnd detect would be things like\ndetecting electrical collisions.\n\n412\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.350\nNow what is an electrical collision?\n\n413\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.364\nWell, when you have a shared medium.\n\n414\n00:22:10.364 --> 00:22:14.488\nYou have two networking devices that\nare sharing the same physical medium and\n\n415\n00:22:14.488 --> 00:22:18.677\nthey both send signals at the same time,\nthey're essentially like two trains\n\n416\n00:22:18.677 --> 00:22:21.580\nrunning at each other on\nthe same train tracks.\n\n417\n00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.730\nEventually there's gonna be a collision.\n\n418\n00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:30.450\nNow, with the carrier detect, your network\nadapters have the ability to receive.\n\n419\n00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.220\nSo, what's gonna happen?\n\n420\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:31.970\nElectrical collision,\n\n421\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:37.430\nthey're gonna reflect fragmented\nframes back to the original senders.\n\n422\n00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.760\nWell, those network adapters\ncan detect that part,\n\n423\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.650\nthey're listening out to the fragments.\n\n424\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.680\nAll right, and\nthis is constantly going on.\n\n425\n00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.910\nThis process of carrier sense\nmultiple access collision detection.\n\n426\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.800\nBut let's dive in a little bit\nmore to what's going on here.\n\n427\n00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.860\nAll right, so PC 1, when PC 1, and\nI've got a BUS network by the way guys.\n\n428\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.000\nSame thing would happen if\nyou have a hub as well.\n\n429\n00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.770\nThe process is still the same.\n\n430\n00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.237\nBut the way, like we've talked about\nin other episodes, collision domains\n\n431\n00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:07.293\nare a little bit different today\nthan they were in the earlier days.\n\n432\n00:23:07.293 --> 00:23:11.862\nToday, every single computer is\non its own individual collision\n\n433\n00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:15.610\ndomain with a switch today\nin packet switch network.\n\n434\n00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.784\nSo I went ahead and\n\n435\n00:23:16.784 --> 00:23:22.210\ndrew this in a BUS because this is one of\nthe earliest ethernet implementations.\n\n436\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.830\nSo a PC 1 has information\nthat it has to send, right?\n\n437\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.568\nIt's got a frame.\n\n438\n00:23:26.568 --> 00:23:29.140\nHey, I've got information I've gotta send.\n\n439\n00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.340\nIt's gonna use its carrier sensibility.\n\n440\n00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.640\nIt's gonna say,\nis the medium busy, all right?\n\n441\n00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.335\nIf so, right,\nsomebody is already sending information.\n\n442\n00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:37.710\nYou're just gonna have to wait.\n\n443\n00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:42.960\nAll right, see that's detecting is\nthe medium idle or not, all right?\n\n444\n00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.990\nNow, if it isn't, go ahead and\ntransfer your data.\n\n445\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.290\nThrow your data out there on the wire and\nmonitor for a collision, right?\n\n446\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.680\nCarrier sense and detect.\n\n447\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.980\nNow what happens if\na collision's detected?\n\n448\n00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.100\nHere's an interesting thing.\n\n449\n00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.190\nWhat happens is your computer's\ngonna signal its intent\n\n450\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.740\nto resend its information.\n\n451\n00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.150\nSo, it's constantly trying to\nmake people aware of, hey,\n\n452\n00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.200\nI've got information to send.\n\n453\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:07.910\nAnd it waits.\n\n454\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.410\nIs the media available?\n\n455\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.570\nOkay, I'll send it.\n\n456\n00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.980\nNow, once a collision is detected,\nit's gotta let everybody know, hey,\n\n457\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.270\nI've got information I need to send.\n\n458\n00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.900\nAll right, and what it does is it\nincrements a retransmit counter.\n\n459\n00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.900\nAll right, now that retransmit counter\nis only gonna be incremented so\n\n460\n00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.570\nmuch before they're just gonna give up.\n\n461\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.960\nOkay, I can't get this information over,\nright?\n\n462\n00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.470\nAbort or just keep retrying.\n\n463\n00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.780\nAnd then if the collision is detected,\n\n464\n00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.960\nit waits a backoff period,\nthen it starts over again.\n\n465\n00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.100\nAnd it says, okay, let's go ahead and\ntransfer this data.\n\n466\n00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:42.600\nAnd let's wait.\n\n467\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.080\nDid I hear a collision?\n\n468\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.220\nWell, if I heard a collision, guess what?\n\n469\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.770\nNow I'm gonna go back to signal\nmy intent to retransmit.\n\n470\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.830\nI'm gonna increment that transmit counter.\n\n471\n00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.578\nOnce it hits the maximum\nnumber of retransmits reached,\n\n472\n00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:01.007\nthere's an option to abort or retry.\n\n473\n00:25:01.007 --> 00:25:04.140\nAnd it's interesting that the contention\nthat goes on in these networks,\n\n474\n00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.000\nthis is constantly going on.\n\n475\n00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.080\nEvery time you're sending information\non a contention based media network,\n\n476\n00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.390\nit's constantly doing this.\n\n477\n00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.220\nNow, you might say, well, that's a real\ninefficient way to send communications.\n\n478\n00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.623\nWell, yes and no.\n\n479\n00:25:16.623 --> 00:25:21.040\nOne of the things is, it makes\nthe technologies that we use fairly cheap.\n\n480\n00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.360\nCuz they can figure it out themselves.\n\n481\n00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.750\nVersus deterministic media like\nthe old token rings and stuff.\n\n482\n00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.750\nThat would cost a lot of money.\n\n483\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.286\nAll right, so\nthat is one of the good things.\n\n484\n00:25:29.286 --> 00:25:32.234\nYes, there are possibility for\ncollisions, possibility for\n\n485\n00:25:32.234 --> 00:25:34.018\nfragments in these type of networks.\n\n486\n00:25:34.018 --> 00:25:37.470\nBut it kept the communication\nequipment relatively low in its price,\n\n487\n00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.520\nwhich made ethernet less expensive related\nto the other technologies of the day.\n\n488\n00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.950\nNow, that's carrier detection.\n\n489\n00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.154\nThere's one other one here and-\n&gt;&gt; Collision detection.\n\n490\n00:25:48.154 --> 00:25:49.241\n&gt;&gt; Or, collision detection, excuse me.\n\n491\n00:25:49.241 --> 00:25:50.932\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not carrier detection,\n\n492\n00:25:50.932 --> 00:25:51.982\ncollision detection.\n\n493\n00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:53.355\nThank you [LAUGH] there, Dan.\n\n494\n00:25:53.355 --> 00:25:55.576\nThere's another one here that\nwe gotta talk about, Dan.\n\n495\n00:25:55.576 --> 00:25:59.520\nBut I'm looking at the clock and I don't\nknow if we have enough time in this one.\n\n496\n00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.760\n&gt;&gt; Okay, not a problem.\n\n497\n00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.069\nWe can always round things out\nwith one of our famous part twos.\n\n498\n00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:05.296\nYou know I enjoy those things.\n\n499\n00:26:05.296 --> 00:26:06.964\nWell, Wes, thanks for getting us thus far.\n\n500\n00:26:06.964 -->

00:00:12.108\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.108 --> 00:00:12.826\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n5\n00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:16.795\nGreetings all and welcome to\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.185\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.665\nAnd in today's episode, well,\nif you're here for A Plus,\n\n8\n00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:21.565\nyou've come to the wrong spot.\n\n9\n00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.035\nBecause we're doing Network Plus today and\nof course, joining me in the studio.\n\n10\n00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:28.060\nThe network master, himself.\n\n11\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.200\nOur good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.980\nWes, welcome back, man.\n\n13\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.450\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Awe, man, it's going good.\n\n14\n00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.420\nHopefully I can live up\nto those expectations.\n\n15\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.388\n&gt;&gt; That's right [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:35.388 --> 00:00:37.140\n&gt;&gt; That's right and\nwe're coming back with a part two.\n\n17\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.880\nWe have just a few more things that we\nwanted to kind of tidy up when it comes to\n\n18\n00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.750\nthe basics of network theory and concepts.\n\n19\n00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.580\nIn fact, one of the things that\nwe left off in the last episode,\n\n20\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.910\nwe were talking about carrier sends\nmultiple access collision detection.\n\n21\n00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.780\nAnd if you remember,\nas a real quick recap,\n\n22\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.200\nthat is pretty much on any\nwired ethernet based network.\n\n23\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.110\nWhat they're using as far as\nthe media access method goes,\n\n24\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.920\nthat being said, up until 10G and\n10G uses something different.\n\n25\n00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.940\nBut for the most part,\nthat's what we've been using for\n\n26\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.580\nthe last 30 or\n40 years when it comes to ethernet.\n\n27\n00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.550\nRemember that a device signals its intent.\n\n28\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.530\nBasically saying hey, I've gotta frame,\nfully formatted and it's ready to send.\n\n29\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.700\nAnd it listens to see if that,\nif the media is available, if it's idle.\n\n30\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.640\nAnd if it does, it sends,\nit transmits its data and listens out for\n\n31\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.880\nan electrical collision.\n\n32\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.350\nAnd if it detects collisions,\n\n33\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.100\nit goes through a back up period if you\nwill, a little bit of a wait period.\n\n34\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.270\nAnd then it calculates and\nit tries to reset.\n\n35\n00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.530\nAnd it keeps doing that until\nfinally either a counter,\n\n36\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.920\nretransmit counter hits its max and\nit just aborts the whole thing.\n\n37\n00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.850\nOr it just constantly keeps\nretrying until it finally\n\n38\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450\nsends the information over the wire.\n\n39\n00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.950\nWell, that's not the only thing that\nwe have inside of our networks as far\n\n40\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.750\ncarriers since multiple access goes.\n\n41\n00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.540\nWe also have what's known\nas collision avoidance.\n\n42\n00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.416\nNow, this one's a little bit different,\nbecause this is what we use on 802.11\n\n43\n00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:07.087\nnetworks, the IEEE 802.11 based networks,\nall right?\n\n44\n00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:11.911\nIt's really kind of hard to detect\nan electrical collision when you're\n\n45\n00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.605\nusing radiated energy.\n\n46\n00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:16.680\n[LAUGH] There's nothing\nreally to bounce back at you.\n\n47\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.840\nSo we use a different method and\nit's called collision avoidance.\n\n48\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.440\nLet's go ahead and take a look at it.\n\n49\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.880\nSo this is CSMA CA as it were.\n\n50\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.920\nAll right, and\nthis is what we use on wireless networks.\n\n51\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.530\nSo if our laptop here wants to send\ninformation, it's gonna have again,\n\n52\n00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.520\nthat frame that's fully formatted,\nthat's ready to go.\n\n53\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.230\nAnd it's gonna detect, is the media free?\n\n54\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.360\nAnd now if the media's free, it's gonna\nsend out what is known as a jam signal.\n\n55\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.890\nAnd that jam signal is gonna say hey,\nI've got data that I've gotta send and\n\n56\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.600\nit waits for\neverybody to hear it, all right?\n\n57\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.027\nNow, what it will also do,\n\n58\n00:02:54.027 --> 00:02:58.100\nall right, is it will send what's\nknown as a request to send see.\n\n59\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.380\nIn the earlier days,\nwe had something that would come up,\n\n60\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.920\nit was called a hidden nodes syndrome.\n\n61\n00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.460\nIn fact, I wanna kinda touch base on this\na little bi,t because in the earlier days,\n\n62\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.770\nwe would use carrier sense\ncollision avoidance.\n\n63\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.480\nBasically we would throw a jam signal\nout on the wireless network and\n\n64\n00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.710\nwe'd wait a period of time for that to\nbasically propagate the entire network.\n\n65\n00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.810\nAnd then we would send our information,\nso it's a wait in line method.\n\n66\n00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.930\nWell, it still is a wait in line method,\n\n67\n00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.880\nbut today we use what's\nknown as an RTS/CTS signal.\n\n68\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.200\nNow that just sounds like a big bunch of\ntechnical jargon and it really isn't.\n\n69\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.010\nIt's a request to send signal, right.\n\n70\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.210\nWe don't use the earlier jam signal\nper se if you will, because well,\n\n71\n00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.150\nwhat happens in a scenario where let's say\nyou've got 100 yard football field, right?\n\n72\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.600\nAnd your access point\ntheoretically is in the middle,\n\n73\n00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.550\nyou've got two nodes at\nthe end of the football field.\n\n74\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.655\nWell, if I yell out carrier\nwith that jam signal and\n\n75\n00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:05.254\nI say hey Dan,\nI'm gonna send information, all right.\n\n76\n00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:09.580\nWell, Dan's all the way on the other\nside of the football field.\n\n77\n00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.230\nDan's computer's listening out,\nsays I didn't hear nothing.\n\n78\n00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.460\nSo he sends a signal, right,\nhe doesn't hear anything.\n\n79\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.190\nSo his computer automatically\nthinks the media's idle.\n\n80\n00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.870\nBut then we get electrical collisions,\nright.\n\n81\n00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.090\nAnd there's no way to detect that\ninside of a wireless based signal.\n\n82\n00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.520\nSo this would generate what's known\nas a hidden node syndrome, right?\n\n83\n00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.580\nIn this case,\nbecause I signaled my intent to send but\n\n84\n00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.220\nDan couldn't hear me,\nI just think he's not there.\n\n85\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.620\nSo what they did is the IEEE\ncame up with this process,\n\n86\n00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.508\nthis IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS.\n\n87\n00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:44.760\nAnd wouldn't it be nice if that access\npoint in the middle of the football field\n\n88\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.130\nhad a way of making Dan's computer\naware that I had information to send?\n\n89\n00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.860\nSo now that's kind of what's going on.\n\n90\n00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.670\nNow what we have is instead of sending\nthat to everybody and saying hey,\n\n91\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.970\nI'm gonna send my information\nacross this radiated energy.\n\n92\n00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.330\nNow what I'm gonna do is\nI'm going to send an RTS,\n\n93\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.340\nrequest to send signal\nstraight to the access point.\n\n94\n00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.850\nNow, how does this help\nthe hidden node syndrome?\n\n95\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.910\nWell, I want you to think about this.\n\n96\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.110\nIf I can yell all the way to the other\nside of the field to talk to Dan and\n\n97\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.030\ntell him I have information to send,\nguess what?\n\n98\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.530\nHow about the half way point?\n\n99\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.680\nRight there in the half way in the middle\nof the field, I can talk to the access\n\n100\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.340\npoint because the access point is\naware of Dan's being on the network.\n\n101\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.090\nAnd guess what the access point says,\nit says clear to sender, it says no,\n\n102\n00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.345\nyou're not clear to send, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.185\nI sent a request to transmit\nsignal to the access point,\n\n104\n00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.305\nthe access point said hold on a second.\n\n105\n00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.805\nI know you've got something to send, but\n\n106\n00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:41.885\nwhat you can't hear is\nsomething that I can.\n\n107\n00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:44.245\nI can hear Dan on the other\nside of the football field and\n\n108\n00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:46.990\nhe is already sending information,\nso you need to wait.\n\n109\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.650\n&gt;&gt; So the access point ends up\nacting like a traffic cop saying\n\n110\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.360\nI can see vantage points you can't.\n\n111\n00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.210\nSo I'll direct the flow of traffic.\n\n112\n00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.970\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n113\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.870\nGreat way to put it.\n\n114\n00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.700\nSo I just sent it to the access point.\n\n115\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.160\nI don't have to worry about\nwhether I can hear it or not.\n\n116\n00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.940\nWe know the access point can hear\nit whether someone else is sending\n\n117\n00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.730\ninformation.\n\n118\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.937\nSo that's really all\nthe RTS/CTS signal is, guys.\n\n119\n00:06:05.937 --> 00:06:10.330\nAgain, it doesn't have to be\ntechnical jargon, all right.\n\n120\n00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.170\nIf I wanna know whether I\ncan send information or\n\n121\n00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.510\nnot, why don't I send\nthe request to signal.\n\n122\n00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.320\nOr request to transmit signal to\nthe managing device on the network that's\n\n123\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.550\nmanaging the communications, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.560\nAnd if it tells me,\nnah you're good, go ahead,\n\n125\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.760\nsend your information,\nthen I know I must be okay.\n\n126\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.400\nSo that's the process, now, all right,\nso it's collision avoidance.\n\n127\n00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.800\nThink of it as a wait in line method,\nall right.\n\n128\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.120\nIf I'm sending information\nDan's computer has to send.\n\n129\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.800\nIt's not like collision\ndetection where we're just\n\n130\n00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.630\nconstantly striving to send\ninformation if it collides.\n\n131\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.946\nWe'll wait for a second,\nwe'll re-transmit.\n\n132\n00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:53.747\nIt's collision avoidance, it doesn't mean\nthat there's not electrical collisions\n\n133\n00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:57.000\nthat happen, there aren't any,\nit just means that's the goal, right?\n\n134\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.880\nSo we send information and then we\nsignal our intent and then we listen.\n\n135\n00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.590\nIf somebody else's signaled their intent,\nguess what?\n\n136\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.690\nWe stand in line and we wait, we wait for\nthe next device to send its information.\n\n137\n00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.150\nAnd then they say hey,\nI've still got more information to send.\n\n138\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.410\nMy device might chime up and\nsay no, no, now I've got time.\n\n139\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.220\nI've got information I have to send.\n\n140\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.080\nSo you can see with carrier sense\nmultiple access collision avoidance,\n\n141\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.380\nthat this is a wait-in-line\nmedia access method, all right?\n\n142\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.270\nAnd it's what we use\ninside of our wireless\n\n143\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.160\nnetworks versus our wired\nethernet-based networks, all right.\n\n144\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.860\nLet's see here what else we got,\nwavelength.\n\n145\n00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.620\nWe gonna talk a little\nbit about wavelength.\n\n146\n00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.830\nNow, we've mentioned fiber optics.\n\n147\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.370\nWe've also mentioned types of cables\nincluding these extremely just\n\n148\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.260\nridiculously long ethernet based\nfiber optic cables in other episodes.\n\n149\n00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.660\nSo guys,\nwe're not really gonna rehash that.\n\n150\n00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.259\nBut we do wanna take a bit here and\n\n151\n00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.114\njust talk about some of\nthe common wavelengths, right?\n\n152\n00:07:57.114 --> 00:07:59.797\nWavelengths inside of fiber optics, for\n\n153\n00:07:59.797 --> 00:08:04.404\nas well, wavelengths in general\nare measured in nanometers, right?\n\n154\n00:08:04.404 --> 00:08:07.249\nWe measure fiber-optic communications and\n\n155\n00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:10.640\nwavelengths based on\na millionth of a meter.\n\n156\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.880\nNow, you could say for\ninstance if you have something like the,\n\n157\n00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.160\nI got a really basic diagram here of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum, right?\n\n158\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.528\nVisible light, obviously what we can see.\n\n159\n00:08:20.528 --> 00:08:24.630\nJust to the left here is ultraviolet\nlight, it's what we can't see.\n\n160\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.910\nBut then getting into infrared\nis when we start getting into\n\n161\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.920\nthe wavelengths that we use for\nfiber-optic communications.\n\n162\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:39.216\nAnd in fact, in one of the cabling\nstandards videos that we did,\n\n163\n00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:45.746\nwe actually use one of these small\nform factor pluggable modules,\n\n164\n00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:51.357\nSFP+, and\non it it had an 850 nanometer wavelength.\n\n165\n00:08:51.357 --> 00:08:53.968\nAnd one of the things, I think, Dan,\nyou were with me with that one,\n\n166\n00:08:53.968 --> 00:08:56.492\nI think I said something like do\nyou think that's multi-mode, or\n\n167\n00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.240\ndo you think that's single-mode, right?\n\n168\n00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.090\nI believe you said multi-mode fiber and\nwhat was he basing it on?\n\n169\n00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.300\nWave length, right?\n\n170\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.727\nWe can see that multi-mode\nfiber wavelengths,\n\n171\n00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:09.109\nthey have a certain specification and\nthey don't change, right?\n\n172\n00:09:09.109 --> 00:09:11.750\nIt's not something that they're\njust throwing a dart at a board and\n\n173\n00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.560\nsaying okay, that's what we're\ngonna use for multi-mode, right?\n\n174\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.760\nWell, when you have a shorter wavelength,\n\n175\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:22.078\nwhat happens is you have a greater chance\nfor its signal attenuation, right?\n\n176\n00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:27.014\nSo smaller wavelengths don't stretch\nin the longer distances when it\n\n177\n00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:31.782\ncomes to communication distances\nversus things like single-mode\n\n178\n00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:36.899\nfiber that operate in 1310 nanometers,\nall the way past 1550.\n\n179\n00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:42.900\nSome of them getting up past that,\neven into the 1600 nanometer wavelengths.\n\n180\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.330\nSo the greater the wavelength,\nright, the longer distance\n\n181\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.618\nwe can propagate the communication\nsignal across that physical medium.\n\n182\n00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:56.180\nThat's why single-mode fiber,\nyou can see, in the 310, 550 and\n\n183\n00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.780\nbeyond nanometer wavelengths, you have\nsome cables that can transmit signals,\n\n184\n00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.480\noptical light, up to 40 kilometers.\n\n185\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.560\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n186\n00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.220\nAnd these are just some of the common,\n\n187\n00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.590\nthese are most of the common\nwavelengths that you'll see that are,\n\n188\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.120\nI believe it's the American National\nStandards Institute that sets these.\n\n189\n00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.460\nIf not, it's NIST, National Institute for\nStandard Technologies,\n\n190\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.290\nI believe, that set these.\n\n191\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.858\nSo on the exam they ask you\nabout multi-mode fiber,\n\n192\n00:10:24.858 --> 00:10:29.248\nknow that it's 850 nanometers or\n1300 nanometers.\n\n193\n00:10:29.248 --> 00:10:33.103\nIf it's single-mode fiber,\nit's gonna be 1310, 1550 and\n\n194\n00:10:33.103 --> 00:10:35.334\nI wouldn't even worry about 1625.\n\n195\n00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:38.043\nThose are the common ones there,\n1310 and 1550.\n\n196\n00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:40.780\nAgain, there are some of them\nthat are going beyond that.\n\n197\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.450\nNow, something else about infrared,\nall right?\n\n198\n00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.740\nNotice that we're outside of\nvisible light which means most\n\n199\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:54.480\nfiber-optic cables you would look into and\nyou couldn't see anything.\n\n200\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.928\nYou never look into a fiber-optic cable.\n\n201\n00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:59.602\nJust because it's infrared,\njust because you can't see it,\n\n202\n00:10:59.602 --> 00:11:01.510\ndoesn't mean it's not there.\n\n203\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.101\nAnd these fiber-optic cables\ncan permanently blind you.\n\n204\n00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:10.007\nYou're giving yourself Lasik\nsurgery without the surgery part.\n\n205\n00:11:10.007 --> 00:11:15.050\nYou're just shining a laser in your eye,\nso remember that, okay guys?\n\n206\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.720\nDon't look into the end of a fiber-optic\ncable, because what you can't see,\n\n207\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.190\nwill blind you.\n\n208\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.670\nAnd it's something that could cause you\njust irreparable damage that you can't\n\n209\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.240\ncome back from.\n\n210\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.810\nSo that is one thing that I\ndo wanna remind you guys.\n\n211\n00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.710\nInfrared, we can't see it.\n\n212\n00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.410\nAnd that's where the realm of\nthese wavelengths operate.\n\n213\n00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.390\n&gt;&gt; Important safety tip.\n\n214\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.410\nDo not stare directly at the crazy light\ncoming out of the end of this wire.\n\n215\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.340\nIt's not for fun.\n\n216\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.553\nIt's not to brighten your eyes up.\n\n217\n00:11:41.553 --> 00:11:42.540\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n218\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.700\n&gt;&gt; It's a bad, bad thing.\n\n219\n00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.890\nSo yes, thank you Wesley for reminding\nus that we wanna wear a protection and\n\n220\n00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.945\ntake care of our eyes,\ncuz we only get one set, apparently.\n\n221\n00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:53.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n222\n00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.130\nNever look into those lasers, for sure.\n\n223\n00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.618\nNow the next thing that we're\ngonna talk a little bit about,\n\n224\n00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:05.197\nit's an application suite,\nreally it's a protocol stack.\n\n225\n00:12:05.197 --> 00:12:08.450\nWe talked about the OSI model,\nthe open systems interconnection model.\n\n226\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.640\nBut one of the ones that we didn't\ntalk about that really sets the stage,\n\n227\n00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.420\nthe groundwork if you will, the protocol\nframework for the entirety of the Internet\n\n228\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.750\nis something known as TCP/IP, transmission\ncontrol protocol Internet protocol.\n\n229\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.210\nNow, you might be asking\nyourself if you've never seen or\n\n230\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.620\nheard of what TCP/IP is, does that\nmeans it's made of two protocols?\n\n231\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.724\nNo, it's actually a family.\n\n232\n00:12:28.724 --> 00:12:30.775\nIt's a suite of protocols and\nthey all help each other out.\n\n233\n00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:34.160\nIt's just the fact that TCP and IP just\nhappen to be two of the most important\n\n234\n00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.461\nones that allow us to route traffic\nacross the backbone of the Internet.\n\n235\n00:12:37.461 --> 00:12:41.408\nSo I guess apparently they said those\nare the big dogs, we'll give it that name.\n\n236\n00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:44.995\nSo TCP/IP is not just a single or\na couple of protocols.\n\n237\n00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:47.782\nIt's actually a body of protocols and\nthey're all working together.\n\n238\n00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:52.067\nNow it also works on an abstract layered\nmodel, pretty much just like OSI.\n\n239\n00:12:52.067 --> 00:12:53.222\nLet's go ahead,\n\n240\n00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:58.600\nI tell you what I've got just the\ndifferent layers here on my screen here.\n\n241\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.730\nNow this is a four-layer model,\nall right, and depending on what time you\n\n242\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.160\nlook at it sometimes they even try to\nbreak down this bottom layer as well.\n\n243\n00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.506\nBut for the large part,\n\n244\n00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:11.150\na four-layer model you have at the top\nwhat's knows as the application layer.\n\n245\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.330\nThis is the higher point\nof the TCP/IP model.\n\n246\n00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.020\nThen as we go down the protocol stack we\nhave what's known as the transport layer.\n\n247\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.400\nThen below that, we have what's\nknown as the Internet layer.\n\n248\n00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.508\nAnd then finally down here at the bottom,\nDan,\n\n249\n00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:27.891\nwe have what's know as\nthe network interface layer.\n\n250\n00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:31.427\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, we talked before about\nthe OSI model, obviously, and\n\n251\n00:13:31.427 --> 00:13:34.440\nthat was a seven-layer\napproach to networking.\n\n252\n00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.144\nHow does this differ or does it differ?\n\n253\n00:13:37.144 --> 00:13:40.556\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting because the OSI model,\nas we've talked about, is kind of like\n\n254\n00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:44.550\na recommendation for network\ncommunications, where this is different.\n\n255\n00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:49.447\nThe entirety of the Internet was made and\nformed around this protocol suite.\n\n256\n00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:54.120\nSo every individual layer\nis really highly optimized.\n\n257\n00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.510\nBut there is a comparison.\n\n258\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.730\nIn fact, if we look,\nI've kinda made a comparison here.\n\n259\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:03.580\nAnd I've got the color coordination pretty\nmuch the same way as we did inside of\n\n260\n00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.780\nour OSI model.\n\n261\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.720\nNow if you've already watched that\nthen this will make sense to you.\n\n262\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.820\nIf you haven't, go back and watch the OSI\nmodel as well, because when you look at\n\n263\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.870\nthe TCP/IP model, notice its four\nlayers versus a seven-layer model.\n\n264\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:22.970\nNow the functionality at the top layer\n[COUGH] of TCP/IP actually bundles\n\n265\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.920\nin the application, the presentation,\nand the session layer of the OSI model.\n\n266\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.276\nSo, up at the application layer of TCP/IP,\n\n267\n00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:34.306\nyou can see same type of protocols that\nwe would see in the application layer,\n\n268\n00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:38.038\nthe OSI model, right, things like DNS,\nFTP, your email protocols.\n\n269\n00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:42.396\nI just put SMTP up here, but POP3,\nIMAP would fit up here, SIP,\n\n270\n00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:48.290\nsession initiation protocol, SSL, JPEG,\nright, cuz we do things like formatting.\n\n271\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:53.010\nSo application services are also\nin this application layer.\n\n272\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.958\nSyntaxed and formatting,\ngrabbing that data, and\n\n273\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.246\nputting it into a format that\nthe network can understand.\n\n274\n00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:02.590\nAnd then also things like session\ncontrol happen here as well, right?\n\n275\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.600\nThings like TCP build up those\ncommunications, maintain the session,\n\n276\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.510\nand then terminate them after we're done.\n\n277\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:14.590\nSo all three, application, presentation,\nand session comparatively,\n\n278\n00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.871\nfit in that very first top\nlayer of the TCP/IP model.\n\n279\n00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:23.290\nNow there's a couple in here that are\nalmost kinda like a one for one, right?\n\n280\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.000\nSo for instance,\nwe have the transport layer.\n\n281\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.720\nNow you might notice that my color\ncoding has the transport on both sides,\n\n282\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.230\nthe exact same color.\n\n283\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.540\nWhy is that?\n\n284\n00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.050\nWell, the same functionality of\nthe transport layer of the TCP/IP model\n\n285\n00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.240\nis what we're seeing here\nat the OSI model too.\n\n286\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.180\nSo if I look, for instance,\n\n287\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.720\nin the transport layer, this is where I\nhave transmission control protocol, right?\n\n288\n00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.560\nThis is where I have\nuser datagram protocol.\n\n289\n00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.434\nThe difference between\nthe connection-oriented services versus\n\n290\n00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:52.890\nnon-connection or connectionless services.\n\n291\n00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.436\nBut we still have at the transport\nlayer responsible for\n\n292\n00:15:55.436 --> 00:15:58.589\nmoving the data between host to\nhost in the communications, right?\n\n293\n00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:00.198\nWe have again, like I've mentioned,\n\n294\n00:16:00.198 --> 00:16:02.454\nconnection-based versus\nconnectionless-based.\n\n295\n00:16:02.454 --> 00:16:05.778\nWe have things like sequencing and\nsegmentation that happened, right?\n\n296\n00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:10.297\nSame thing as the OSI model This is\nwhere TCP, it takes that information and\n\n297\n00:16:10.297 --> 00:16:13.478\nbreaks it down into more manageable units,\nright?\n\n298\n00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:16.274\nWe call them segments and\nthen it takes those segments.\n\n299\n00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:19.381\nAnd then after it's got\nthe segmentation done and sequences,\n\n300\n00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:23.191\nso that when it's sent over the network\nand it's routed all different routes\n\n301\n00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:26.023\nto the end point,\nit could be rebuilt in the right order.\n\n302\n00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:28.885\nSo, we see that here at\nthe transport layer as well.\n\n303\n00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:30.895\nInternet layer.\n\n304\n00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:34.385\nRight now the internet layer is\nreally kinda like the network layer.\n\n305\n00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:36.105\nNow even though then name here I know,\n\n306\n00:16:36.105 --> 00:16:40.375\nmy color coordination is\nidentical the names are different.\n\n307\n00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:41.725\nDon't let it confuse you guys.\n\n308\n00:16:41.725 --> 00:16:44.685\nIf you can remember if they ever give you\na comparison and I don't know if they\n\n309\n00:16:44.685 --> 00:16:49.570\nwill, networking and the internet layer,\nsame thing's going on, right guys?\n\n310\n00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.110\nNames are different but\nat the internet layer,\n\n311\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.050\nthis is where we get logical addressing,\nright?\n\n312\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.330\nOur IP addresses that's\na software based IP address.\n\n313\n00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.470\nWe get best path delivery, right,\nwe talked about routing protocols.\n\n314\n00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.630\nWhere our routers look, and\n\n315\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.320\nthey say, okay, well,\nI see a path here to the destination.\n\n316\n00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.566\nWhat do you have?\n\n317\n00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:08.930\nYou've got a better path?\n\n318\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.344\nWell, let me throw that out and\nput this on my routing table and\n\n319\n00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:14.030\nthat's where I'm gonna send this\npacket of information, right?\n\n320\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.590\nSo it determines the best path to\nsend to the destination, so routing,\n\n321\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.870\nif you will, and\nthings like congestion control.\n\n322\n00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.412\nNow when I say congestion control,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n323\n00:17:23.412 --> 00:17:26.847\nWell, one of the ones that they\ncall out in the objectives is ICMP.\n\n324\n00:17:26.847 --> 00:17:29.620\nAnd that's\nthe Internet Control Message Protocol.\n\n325\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.233\nAnd this is basically for\nflow control, right?\n\n326\n00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:35.903\nSo if I'm sending information from my\ncomputer to Dan's computer, right?\n\n327\n00:17:35.903 --> 00:17:38.700\nAnd let's say for whatever reason,\nI'm sending a lot of information.\n\n328\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.330\nAnd Dan's computer says,\nwell, wait a second, hold on,\n\n329\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.100\nI'm not processing this\ninformation fast enough.\n\n330\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.712\nI need you to slow down, or\nI'm gonna start dropping packets,\n\n331\n00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:47.857\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n332\n00:17:47.857 --> 00:17:51.729\nWell, that's actually ICMP that's just\nsaying, hold on, flow control, right?\n\n333\n00:17:51.729 --> 00:17:54.470\nSlow down, let me finish processing this.\n\n334\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.010\nOnce I process this,\ncome on send some more.\n\n335\n00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.522\nAll right, so\nthat's Internet Control Message Protocol.\n\n336\n00:18:00.522 --> 00:18:04.598\nThere's other things that we use,\nutilities that we use, right,\n\n337\n00:18:04.598 --> 00:18:05.535\nthat use ICMP.\n\n338\n00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:10.150\nPing, packet internet groper, when I\nneed to find out if another computer,\n\n339\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.350\nI can communicate with it\nover a TCPIP based network.\n\n340\n00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.720\nI can run a ping command against it,\nright?\n\n341\n00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.640\nWhen I ping, that's a ICMP echo request\nmessage, when the computer responds back,\n\n342\n00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.340\nthat's an ICMP echo response message.\n\n343\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.510\nSo we also have utilities like that.\n\n344\n00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.140\nWe have utilities for instance,\nin Linux, Traceroute.\n\n345\n00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.820\nAnd Windows, for whatever reason,\nthey call it Traceroute, but\n\n346\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.510\nthey spell it TRACERT.\n\n347\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:41.490\nIt's another one of those ones that sends\nout ICMP messages likewise, all right?\n\n348\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.220\nAnd then some of the other protocols\nthat we have there, IP, BGP,\n\n349\n00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.910\nare routing protocols,\nthings like OSPF and RIP as well.\n\n350\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.690\nAll right,\nnow the last layer of the TCP/IP model\n\n351\n00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.530\nactually bundles together\ntwo layers over here of OSI.\n\n352\n00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.540\nRight, the data link layer and\nthe physical layer.\n\n353\n00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.307\nWhen we look at the data link layer and\nthe physical layer.\n\n354\n00:19:04.307 --> 00:19:07.689\nAnd we compare that back over\nto the network interface layer.\n\n355\n00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.056\nI want you to think of some of\nthe functionality that's happening\n\n356\n00:19:10.056 --> 00:19:10.665\nthere, right?\n\n357\n00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:13.459\nWe got things link control,\ncontrolling and\n\n358\n00:19:13.459 --> 00:19:16.777\ndefining how the data is\nplaced on the media, right?\n\n359\n00:19:16.777 --> 00:19:21.663\nThat's the logical link control\nof the data link layer in OSI,\n\n360\n00:19:21.663 --> 00:19:24.450\nthe LLC layer, sub layer, right?\n\n361\n00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.920\nIt also defines things like\nthe electrical mechanics.\n\n362\n00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.125\nThat's usually in the OSI model,\nthat's the physical layer, right?\n\n363\n00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:35.222\nThe electrical mechanics of\nthe media things like whether\n\n364\n00:19:35.222 --> 00:19:40.335\nwe're gonna be using STP, whether we're\ngonna be using shielded twisted pair,\n\n365\n00:19:40.335 --> 00:19:43.645\nunshielded twisted pair,\ndo we need a T-carrier line?\n\n366\n00:19:43.645 --> 00:19:47.895\nIf we do, do we need a T1 line,\ndo we need a T3 line, are we using fiber\n\n367\n00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:53.330\noptics communications again,\nthings like Ethernet and frame relay.\n\n368\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.920\nThey sit right here at\nthe network interface layer.\n\n369\n00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.650\nAnd with TCP/IP, that's the same layer.\n\n370\n00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:04.610\nRemember that in the OSI model when\nwe talk about things like Ethernet,\n\n371\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.640\nSONET, SDH if you will.\n\n372\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.750\nWe could be using\neither/or of these layers.\n\n373\n00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.720\nBut here at TCP/IP,\nwe bundle all of these together.\n\n374\n00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.310\nOther things that are here at\nthe network interface layer that\n\n375\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.815\nare separated typically at\nthe physical layer of OSI.\n\n376\n00:20:20.815 --> 00:20:22.810\nSignaling speeds, transmissions speeds,\n\n377\n00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.830\nam I operating at 10megs,\nam I operating at 100megs, 10g.\n\n378\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.600\nDuplex type, right?\n\n379\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.530\nThat's all part of the network\ninterface layer and\n\n380\n00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.938\nI just left it here color coded because\nthat would actually be the physical layer\n\n381\n00:20:34.938 --> 00:20:37.450\nof the OSI model that defines all that.\n\n382\n00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.630\nSo when you look at this TCP/IP model,\n\n383\n00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.360\nyou can see that even though\nit's only a four-layer model.\n\n384\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.100\nEverything is highly optimized for\nwhatever that layer is performing.\n\n385\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.810\nAnd it's all bundled together.\n\n386\n00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.030\nSo I want you to keep that in mind,\nlike we said the comparisons back to the,\n\n387\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.610\nbetween the two just in case they\nask you and remember seven layers\n\n388\n00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:02.950\nversus four layers when\nit comes to TCP/IP.\n\n389\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:08.860\nThe process of things like data units,\nlike PDUs, and SUs, still apply.\n\n390\n00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.290\nThe application layer hands it down\nto the transport layer, right?\n\n391\n00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.190\nWe've got encapsulation going on.\n\n392\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.180\nAnd we're encapsulating as we move down\nthose layers, I send that information over\n\n393\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.710\nto Dan's computer,\nhis computer starts to process it.\n\n394\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.960\nHe's doing decapsulation,\nhe's stripping off those layers, right?\n\n395\n00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.350\nPeeling back the layers of the onion\nuntil you finally get back to your data.\n\n396\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.390\nSo know the models.\n\n397\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.060\nKnow the comparisons,\nknow some of the functionality and\n\n398\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.370\nlike I've shown you as examples,\nknow some of the examples of protocols.\n\n399\n00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.451\nBecause they might very well just test,\n\n400\n00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:41.547\ndo you know a little bit about the TCP/IP\nmodel, the different functions, and\n\n401\n00:21:41.547 --> 00:21:44.129\nsome of the protocols that\noperate at each layer?\n\n402\n00:21:44.129 --> 00:21:48.129\n&gt;&gt; All right, Nes,\nthat can seem just a little confusing.\n\n403\n00:21:48.129 --> 00:21:52.240\nThe two models basically trying to\naccomplish the exact same thing.\n\n404\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.064\nThe OSI model is definitely more\nheavily used in common speak\n\n405\n00:21:57.064 --> 00:22:01.329\nmost networks,\nI know they reference the OSI model.\n\n406\n00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:05.752\nBut the TCP/IP model does have its place,\nyou will see it from time to time and\n\n407\n00:22:05.752 --> 00:22:08.017\nit will be reference from time to time.\n\n408\n00:22:08.017 --> 00:22:10.660\nSo just keep that in mind,\nit is good to learn both.\n\n409\n00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.870\nGood news is that they\nare pretty similarly named,\n\n410\n00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.360\nyou should be able to figure out what\ngoes where without too much trouble.\n\n411\n00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.080\nIf you know one model,\nyou should basically grasp the other.\n\n412\n00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.510\nThat being said, West, thank you so much.\n\n413\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.577\nWe've gone through a lot\nof basic concepts.\n\n414\n00:22:24.577 --> 00:22:28.865\nYou did a great job, an admirable job of\nexplaining each one of those to us so that\n\n415\n00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:33.409\nwe might simulate that knowledge, take it\nto the testing booth, and pass our exam.\n\n416\n00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:37.295\nAnd then from there out, have a good\nworking practical knowledge as well.\n\n417\n00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:40.964\nA big so, it looks like it's time for\nus to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n418\n00:22:40.964 --> 00:22:42.842\nWe do thank you for joining us today.\n\n419\n00:22:42.842 --> 00:22:44.186\nI've been your host, Daniel Lawry.\n\n420\n00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:45.124\n&gt;&gt; And I'm West Bryan.\n\n421\n00:22:45.124 --> 00:22:48.623\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n422\n00:22:48.623 --> 00:22:54.607\n[MUSIC]\n\n423\n00:22:54.607 -->

00:00:12.047\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:12.633\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.402\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:18.713\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, we are coming\n\n7\n00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:23.944\nback with more on our Network Plus Series\nwith CompTIA obviously.\n\n8\n00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:27.336\nAnd of course, joining us in\nthe studio is the man, the myth,\n\n9\n00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:29.503\nthe legend, you know him as Wes Brian.\n\n10\n00:00:29.503 --> 00:00:30.640\nWes, welcome, so how's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.781\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great,\nalways great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:37.564\nThat's right, we are moving into\nan episode that is gonna be one that I'm\n\n13\n00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:42.670\ngonna do my best to make sure that you are\nstill awake by the end of this episode.\n\n14\n00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.680\nAnd the reason I say that is cuz we're\ngetting into some of the stuff that\n\n15\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780\nwhen it comes to a CompTIA exam.\n\n16\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.910\nIf you're coming from the A+, maybe you've\nalready taken an A+ exam and passed it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.330\nYou're probably familiar with how\nmuch memorization you had to do.\n\n18\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.080\nWell, in the Net Plus,\nremember you're learning a new language.\n\n19\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.720\nIf you haven't been into networks before,\n\n20\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.440\nthey definitely,\ncertainly have their own language.\n\n21\n00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.730\nAnd they're not shy on standards or\nacronyms,\n\n22\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.170\nwell, that is definitely gonna be\nwhat we're in store for today.\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.790\nWe're talking about wired connectivity\nstandards and we're gonna look\n\n24\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.370\nat really primarily we're gonna spend most\nof our time are in the base standards.\n\n25\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.490\nAnd I'm gonna do some cross-reference\nfrom base standards and\n\n26\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.880\nas well as IEEE's 802 standards here.\n\n27\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.200\nBecause what are we talking about,\n\n28\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.360\nwe're gonna be talking about ethernet,\nall right?\n\n29\n00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.380\nAnd when we talk about base standards,\nlet's go ahead, I gotta\n\n30\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.110\nsay a little diagram here, these are\nthe standards that we're gonna look at.\n\n31\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.670\nAnd a couple more to that\nare aren't on this, but\n\n32\n00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.780\nthis first standards here, these are what\nare known as Ethernet standards.\n\n33\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.146\nAnd like everything with a standard,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:50.993\nwhat I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna put in 802.3.\n\n35\n00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:55.475\nI want you guys to know that that's\nthe IEEE's working group for\n\n36\n00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:58.885\nethernet, all right, 802.3 if you will.\n\n37\n00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:03.058\n802 being February,\nsecond month of the year, 1980,\n\n38\n00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:07.760\nwhen a lot of these major organizations\ngot together and decided.\n\n39\n00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.620\nWe need to do some standardization\nhere because everybody is trying ten\n\n40\n00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.250\ndifferent things.\n\n41\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.450\nAnd well, our networks just aren't getting\nalong anymore, so what did they do?\n\n42\n00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.580\nDo they pick one and leave this one?\n\n43\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.140\nThey said you know what,\nwe'll take everybody.\n\n44\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.040\nCome on everybody, come in and\nwe'll do some standardization.\n\n45\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.750\nAnd it'll fall into the 802 standard.\n\n46\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.309\nWell ethernet, it got its\nnumerable code if you will for .3.\n\n47\n00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.245\nSo 802.3 is ethernet.\n\n48\n00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:37.174\nNow that brings us to another our\ntopic here, our base standards and\n\n49\n00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:42.461\nbase standards really what they're\ndefining is the physical cabling.\n\n50\n00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:47.395\nAnd they define what type of\nsignalling it is, base band signalling.\n\n51\n00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:52.740\nIt defines the speed and\nit defines the media type.\n\n52\n00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.450\nSo when we look at base standards,\nlet's take this base standard here.\n\n53\n00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.660\nWe'll kinda increase the font\nhere real quick for you guys.\n\n54\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.830\nAnd let's break down how a base standard,\nwhat it's comprised of and\n\n55\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.780\nwe'll kind of separate the three\ndifferent categories, all right.\n\n56\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.920\nSo that first numerical value there,\nthat's the signaling speed.\n\n57\n00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.000\nWhat's interesting is that after it's all\ndone, you're going to see every one of\n\n58\n00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.090\nthese portions of the name define\nthe physical layer of the OSI model,\n\n59\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.920\nthat's what really these\nstandards here are talking about.\n\n60\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.730\nThe signaling speed,\nten megabits, all right.\n\n61\n00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.320\nSo that first numerical value tells\nyou how fast the transmission\n\n62\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.680\nmedium is going to operate or\nhas the potential to operate at, right?\n\n63\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.570\nSo if I look at 100 based t,\nthat's 100 megs.\n\n64\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.860\nIf I look at 1,000 base,\nthat's gonna be what?\n\n65\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.250\nThat's one gig, that's gigabit speeds.\n\n66\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.410\nAnd then right on up into 10g,\nwhich is ten gigs speeds for\n\n67\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.654\nsome of our more modern,\nvery fast networks.\n\n68\n00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:53.300\nAll right, base, that's baseband,\n\n69\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.800\nbaseband versus broadband digital signal\nand then t again is the media code.\n\n70\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.050\nIn this case, we're gonna be looking\nat a few different media codes.\n\n71\n00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.650\nOne of the things I want you to know,\nmake it easier for yourselves on the exam.\n\n72\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.340\nIf you look at a base standard,\nknow what the speed is right away, right?\n\n73\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.540\nThat should be easy.\n\n74\n00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.560\nKnow what the signaling type is,\nthat should be easy.\n\n75\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.970\nHowever, what's not so\neasy are some of these darn media codes.\n\n76\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.890\nThey can get a little confusing.\n\n77\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.270\nI will tell you though for the exam.\n\n78\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.730\nA little easier memorization.\n\n79\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.800\nAnything that's got a t in it, it's\ngonna be twisted-pair implementations.\n\n80\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.450\nIt might help you out on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.190\nAnything that's got an f in it is gonna\nbe fiber and some of these other ones.\n\n82\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.640\nWhen we get to them,\nI'll help you out on those.\n\n83\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.510\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about the base standards and\n\n84\n00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.090\nreally what it means for\nus when we look at these base standards.\n\n85\n00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020\nNow, we're gonna start out with a couple\nof them, cuz it's interesting then.\n\n86\n00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.567\nI always think it's funny that you have to\nknow a little bit of history on the exams\n\n87\n00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:50.154\non CompTIA.\n\n88\n00:04:50.154 --> 00:04:53.376\nBecause they don't call this one out but\nthey do call this one out, 10 base 2 and\n\n89\n00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.441\nDan, have you ever heard\nof that 10 base 2 at all?\n\n90\n00:04:55.441 --> 00:05:02.436\n&gt;&gt; Well sure, that was the old coax cable,\nthick net and thin net was five and two.\n\n91\n00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:03.804\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Dan,\nyou knocked that one out of the ball park.\n\n92\n00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:04.489\nThat is right.\n\n93\n00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:06.865\nThose are the legacy ones,\nthin net and thick net.\n\n94\n00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:10.175\nWe'll go ahead and thick net isn't\nreally called out on the exam, so\n\n95\n00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:13.213\nI'll just take a real quick so\nI can kind of explain it though.\n\n96\n00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:18.170\n802.3, that was the first 802 standard for\nethernet, if you will.\n\n97\n00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.036\nAfter that,\nyou'll see things like 802.a, 802.ab and\n\n98\n00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:25.114\ndifferent letters after the name.\n\n99\n00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:29.516\n10 base 5 thick net, this was a very,\n\n100\n00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:36.261\nvery thick cable hence the name,\nit had a 500 meter range.\n\n101\n00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:38.964\nSo you get pretty of distance\nthat are more distance and\n\n102\n00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.331\nwe could get out of\nthe modern internet cables.\n\n103\n00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:46.204\nBut it was contention based media and\nit was also something that require 50 ohm\n\n104\n00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:49.413\nresistors on the end of what\nwould be a bus topology.\n\n105\n00:05:49.413 --> 00:05:54.100\nNow pretty much the same,\nalmost the same thing goes with 10 base 2.\n\n106\n00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.810\nCheaper implementation, that's why it\nwould be called like Dan said thin net.\n\n107\n00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.400\nYou might have heard thin wire.\n\n108\n00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.930\nYou might, I've even heard\nit called cheap net [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.995\nbecause it was cheaper to\nimplement than thick net.\n\n110\n00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:07.710\nAnd now 10 base 2,\nI do want you to know some of the facts,\n\n111\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.728\nbecause they do specifically\ncall it out here.\n\n112\n00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:14.480\nThis is 802.3a.\n\n113\n00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.300\nIt's legacy guys, this isn't gonna be\nsomething that you're really gonna see.\n\n114\n00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.980\nI have heard that some\nimplementations of this still exist.\n\n115\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.750\nIf it does, it's time for you to\nrecommend they upgrade your old networks.\n\n116\n00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.590\nBus based networks,\n\n117\n00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.490\nvery, very heavily contention based,\nand they weren't very scalable.\n\n118\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.650\nRequired 50 ohm resistors.\n\n119\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.670\nIt was a shared medium, right?\n\n120\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.350\nSo shared medium,\n\n121\n00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.840\nbus topology, using carrier sense\nmultiple access collision detection.\n\n122\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.920\nIt had 185 feet limit.\n\n123\n00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.270\nAnd this would have gone over\nwhat are known as the RG cables.\n\n124\n00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.710\nWe've talked about some of the radio\ncables when we were talking about\n\n125\n00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.020\nthe different types of cables\nthat we have in that episode.\n\n126\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.230\nSo go back and check that out.\n\n127\n00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.250\nNow we had the RG6 and the RG59.\n\n128\n00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.450\nThose aren't used for networking, guys,\noutside of something like cable modems.\n\n129\n00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.950\nBut this would have been RG58 and RG8.\n\n130\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.640\nRG8 would have been for the thick net and\n\n131\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.170\nRG58 would have been the coaxial\nimplementation for thin net.\n\n132\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.010\nSo again, They're legacy, I don't expect\nyou to see them, but again they are called\n\n133\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.830\nout on the exam so we do have to talk-\n&gt;&gt; Legacy is not even sufficient.\n\n134\n00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.630\nThis is like, you do not see these other\nthan like audio video cabling nowadays.\n\n135\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.310\nAnd you know your cable kind of thing.\n\n136\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.180\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's what we had\npointed out to when we are in the Cablenet\n\n137\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.810\nor in the Cablelink episode.\n\n138\n00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.380\nI was like gosh, I heavily used\nin things like dance in audio and\n\n139\n00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.840\nvideo communications.\n\n140\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.810\nYou're not gonna see the networking\nanymore just because of\n\n141\n00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:49.604\nthe contention-based.\n\n142\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.470\nMedia access method.\n\n143\n00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.540\nIt's just not something that\nwe're gonna see today used.\n\n144\n00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.529\nAnd if, like I said,\nif they are using it today\n\n145\n00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:59.352\nyou're supporting a very old network-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:07:59.352 --> 00:08:00.427\n&gt;&gt; You really need to tell them\n\n147\n00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:00.947\nto upgrade.\n\n148\n00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:01.958\n&gt;&gt; You need more money.\n\n149\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.147\nYeah, exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:08:03.147 --> 00:08:05.547\n&gt;&gt; Need to do a little bit better on your\n\n151\n00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:06.668\nprovisioning.\n\n152\n00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:09.763\nSo the next thing,\none that we get into and again,\n\n153\n00:08:09.763 --> 00:08:12.950\nguys, we're gonna move\ndown the standards here.\n\n154\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.177\nThe next one is 10BaseT.\n\n155\n00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:18.798\n10BaseT, keep in mind, this is an ethernet\nor a twisted pair implementation.\n\n156\n00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:22.910\nSo one of the good things about the exam,\nyou remember that media code?\n\n157\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.030\nThis was originally\nimplemented on TES CAT3 cable.\n\n158\n00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.700\nIf some of this information doesn't sound\nfamiliar you really need to go back and\n\n159\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.130\ncheck out our cable types, cable and\nconnector types because we deal\n\n160\n00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.310\nreally heavily with TIA EIA and\nthe category standards there however,\n\n161\n00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.860\nthis is used as\nUTP Unshielded twisted pair.\n\n162\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.270\nIt also uses something\nknown as 8P8C wiring also\n\n163\n00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.120\nknown as TIA/EIAs 568A and 568B standard.\n\n164\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.577\nThis is a wiring standard and\nI'll tell you what,\n\n165\n00:08:57.577 --> 00:09:00.573\nlet's go ahead because I'm\ngonna be mentioning that a lot.\n\n166\n00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:01.942\nLet's go ahead and set the stage for\n\n167\n00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:05.286\nyou, so you know exactly what I'm talking\nabout, rather than telling you at the end.\n\n168\n00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:09.131\nThe Telecommunications\nIndustry Association,\n\n169\n00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:15.900\nElectronics Industry Alliance, they do\nstandardization on telecommunications.\n\n170\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.830\nAnd remember that they not\nonly do the cat cables,\n\n171\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.530\nthey've got what's known as a 56 a 56,\nwhat is it?\n\n172\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.800\n568 commercial building\nstandard is what it is, and\n\n173\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.330\nthen under that you have\ndifferent subsections.\n\n174\n00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.590\nOne of them defines how you wire\n\n175\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.520\ntwisted pair cabling into the back\nof the RJ45 jacks, all right.\n\n176\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.720\nAnd it's really a color scheme,\nright, it's a wiring scheme.\n\n177\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.900\nIn the cable types and connector,\ncable and connector types,\n\n178\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.380\nwe talked about a straight through cable.\n\n179\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.540\nSo this should be familiar with you but\nI wanna go ahead and\n\n180\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.780\ngo over it again since it's really\ngonna be prevalent in this episode.\n\n181\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.750\nRemember that 568b is wired with\norange on pins one and two.\n\n182\n00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.010\nThree and\nsix you have your green connectors and\n\n183\n00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.310\nreally that's the only thing that changes,\nversus 568A.\n\n184\n00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:14.950\nNotice in 568A we have for the transmit\npens we got the green wires or conductors.\n\n185\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.640\nAnd then for the received conductors,\nwe've got the orange.\n\n186\n00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.460\nSo remember, a crossover cable is just\na combination of 568B on one side,\n\n187\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.870\n568 on another side.\n\n188\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.917\nSo that's a little bit about what we're\ntalking about when we say the 568,\n\n189\n00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:31.620\n8a or b wiring standard.\n\n190\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.840\nKeep in mind, just like we talked about\nin other episodes, it's one or the other.\n\n191\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.390\nTypically your straight through\ncables are gonna be 568b today.\n\n192\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.890\nYou could see that like runs\nin the walls would be a,\n\n193\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.520\nagain it really depends on\nwho has set up your network.\n\n194\n00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.445\nAll right,\nlet's see here if I missed anything?\n\n195\n00:10:48.445 --> 00:10:52.310\nThe 10-base T is 802.3i.\n\n196\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.180\nJust in case it comes up on\nthe exam it this does use\n\n197\n00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.480\nthe carrier sense multiple access\ncollision detection, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.800\nAll right, so moving down the field,\nwe've got 10Base and 1000Base right.\n\n199\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.630\nSo you guys should know by now that\nnow we're moving up in speeds, right.\n\n200\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.720\nWe got 100BaseT.\n\n201\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.190\nSo this is going to be what's known\nas fast ethernet versus ethernet.\n\n202\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.850\nThis is what's known as\na fast ethernet standard.\n\n203\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:23.360\nAnd this was originally implemented\nover CAT 5 cables believe it or\n\n204\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.660\nnot Cat 5 cables and Cat 3 cables,\n\n205\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.710\neven though I've mentioned them,\nthey're considered legacy today, guys.\n\n206\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.500\nPrimarily in modern implementations\nusually you're gonna see 5e,\n\n207\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.140\nand a lot of companies now have started\nto just go ahead and lay down Cat 6,\n\n208\n00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.430\nbecause it has the bandwidth.\n\n209\n00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.830\nAnd maybe even Cat 6-A,\nwhich allows you even more\n\n210\n00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.610\nbandwidth when it comes to\nthings like 10G based networks.\n\n211\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.320\nSo, I mentioned some of them,\nkeep in mind that they are kind of legacy,\n\n212\n00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.540\nwhen we talk about Cad five and Cad three.\n\n213\n00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.350\nThis also uses the 8P8C wiring or\n568A or B wiring.\n\n214\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.470\n8P8C by the way is a recap guys.\n\n215\n00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.850\nWe did talk about it in another episode\nEight pins, eight connectors, right?\n\n216\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.818\nThat's the other name for an RJ-45 jack,\nso don't let that confuse you.\n\n217\n00:12:09.818 --> 00:12:17.290\nThis is 802.3U, so just more of\nthose 802 comparisons that you\n\n218\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.640\nshould know just in case they ask you on\nthe exam cuz, it's a real easy question.\n\n219\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.150\nIf you think about it, Dan,\nif I'm making questions I can say, okay,\n\n220\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.840\nwell you've got a 1000BASE-T,\nwhat's the 802 standard for this?\n\n221\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.700\nBoom, chuck it off.\n\n222\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.670\nI've got a question ready to go for\nthe exam, and\n\n223\n00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.350\nI don't know if that's what's gonna be on\nthe exam but we want you to have those\n\n224\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.770\nbases covered because they could ask\nyou the standardization information.\n\n225\n00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unfortunately like we kinda\nmentioned earlier that a lot of this.\n\n226\n00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.180\nThis is just that good old\nrote memorization thing.\n\n227\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.070\nThis is where you go to the store and\nyou get the little index cards and\n\n228\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.600\nyou make flashcards out of them.\n\n229\n00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:53.090\nThis is perfect kind of information for\nthat sort of learning style.\n\n230\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.530\n&gt;&gt; And then I might throw\nthis question back at you.\n\n231\n00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:58.310\nIn outside of the exam,\nif you need to know these specifications,\n\n232\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.330\nhow are you gonna find them?\n\n233\n00:12:59.330 --> 00:12:59.910\n&gt;&gt; Google.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n234\n00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.491\n&gt;&gt; You Google it.\n\n235\n00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:01.954\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly.\n\n236\n00:13:01.954 --> 00:13:05.150\nAnd guys, that's not to cheapen your\ntraining or to cheapen your knowledge.\n\n237\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.640\nDon't short change\nyourself with knowledge.\n\n238\n00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.750\nBut, you know, as you start to get used to\nthis information sometimes you just let it\n\n239\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.030\ngo cuz you're studying more stuff,\nunderstand for\n\n240\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.430\nthe exam we want you to know this.\n\n241\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.330\nBut if I need to know the specification\nokay, if Dawn, or Dan, or Ronny, or\n\n242\n00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.220\nany of the other hosts, say hey man,\nwe need something that supports 10G.\n\n243\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.710\nIt's an SFP, a small-form factor\npluggable that goes into the switch.\n\n244\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.490\nYou do?\n\n245\n00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.740\nWell I'm gonna have to do some research\nhere because I don't have there just\n\n246\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.840\nsitting up there in the brain here.\n\n247\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.800\nSo, what you need to know for the exam\nWe want to give you but keep in mind in\n\n248\n00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.190\npracticality after the certification you\ncan always look this information up.\n\n249\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.130\nAll right, so that's hundred base T, I\ndon't think I forgot anything on that one.\n\n250\n00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.570\nAnd thousand base T,\nwe're just kinda working our way up, so\n\n251\n00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.910\nfar it still twisted pair, still ethernet.\n\n252\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.850\nNow we're getting into gigabit\nethernet just getting faster.\n\n253\n00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.960\nIt really is, and what you will notice\nis as we start raising up the bar here\n\n254\n00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.980\nin speeds, you might start to notice that\nsome things are a little bit different.\n\n255\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.830\nThe original standard was\nimplemented over CAT5 and up.\n\n256\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.610\nAgain, now I know that CAT5\nis kind of legacy today, so\n\n257\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.730\nit's 5e going to be 6, 6a.\n\n258\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:16.340\nAnd that's what we mean when we say that\nand up, I don't think, star topologies.\n\n259\n00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.440\nThat's something that we probably should\nstart throwing in there with all of these,\n\n260\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.990\n100 base t's, 1000 base t.\n\n261\n00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.080\nWe move from the old bus network's that\nwe mentioned earlier, 10 base 2 and 5.\n\n262\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.370\nThose were bus topologies this\nis a star topology, right.\n\n263\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.227\nWe start having that centralized switch\nthat we're plugging into now not just the-\n\n264\n00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:34.132\n&gt;&gt; Up in smoke, right?\n\n265\n00:14:34.132 --> 00:14:34.713\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n266\n00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:35.572\n&gt;&gt; Up in smoke, they call it.\n\n267\n00:14:35.572 --> 00:14:37.500\n&gt;&gt; Up in smoke networks, exactly.\n\n268\n00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.629\nAnd remember like we've\ntalked about in our network\n\n269\n00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:44.550\ntopologies that gives you isolation\nof a single node if it fails.\n\n270\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.710\nYou don't bring down the whole network\nlike the earlier bus networks would.\n\n271\n00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.130\nThe next one guys,\nis not very popular that's the 1000BaseTX.\n\n272\n00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.520\nThis is a way they could try\nto gain some speeds here but\n\n273\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.840\nagain it was implemented at\nthe time with cat-6 cables and\n\n274\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.940\nat the time it was very expensive,\nnow the price has gone down.\n\n275\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.910\nBut the standards have continued\nto rise so implemented over Cat 6,\n\n276\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.090\nI really don't think you need\nto know much more than that.\n\n277\n00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.600\nAgain remember the T is again\ntwist of pair implementations,\n\n278\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.140\nagain I do belive this one requires\nshielded twisted pair sgain more expense,\n\n279\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.840\nwhy it wasn't quite so popular?\n\n280\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.740\nAnd then we get into,\nthen we get into the fun ones, right?\n\n281\n00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.360\nNow we get into the 10G networks and\nthe 10G is ten gigs right?\n\n282\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.260\n10G gigabyte ethernet.\n\n283\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:42.760\nAnd it's kinda interesting that they had\nto kind of,` go back to the drawing board,\n\n284\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.410\nwhen it came to\ncommunication technologies,\n\n285\n00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.990\nonce they got ethernet\nup into the 10G realm.\n\n286\n00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.573\nAnd let me tell you exactly\nkind of what I mean by that.\n\n287\n00:15:51.573 --> 00:15:55.575\n10G now has the speeds that it can\nkeep up, at least for the most part,\n\n288\n00:15:55.575 --> 00:15:58.330\nwith some of our LAN-based technologies.\n\n289\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.528\nSo, they actually rewrote.\n\n290\n00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:07.000\nThe wam physical,\nyou might see it abbreviated wam phy.\n\n291\n00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.120\nThe physical implementation so you could\nnow start having these gateways that\n\n292\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.550\nwould allow your ethernet to change and\nconnect to SONET based networks, right?\n\n293\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.930\nTalking about that fast.\n\n294\n00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:24.420\nSo, do keep that in mind, 10GBASE-T, this\nis really one of the last copper medias.\n\n295\n00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.270\nNotice, I probably should mention that, so\n\n296\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.610\nfar we've been talking about copper media,\nright?\n\n297\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.850\nThis is one of the last copper medias that\nwe're really talking about inside of this\n\n298\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:36.450\nstandard, except a couple more that\nthey're not ethernet standards, all right?\n\n299\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:43.880\nStart topology, IEEE's 802.3an,\ndo keep that in mind as well.\n\n300\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.500\nWhat else do we have here?\n\n301\n00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.270\nThis is interesting.\n\n302\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.410\nIt's implemented over CAT 6A.\n\n303\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.530\nSo you need the CAT 6A augmented.\n\n304\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.720\nNow be careful with that because CAT 6A or\nthe CAT 6 augmented is it just\n\n305\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:01.230\nmeans that you can get 10 G speeds to the\nfull maximum length of that cable, right.\n\n306\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.141\nAll twisted pair, 10Base-T, or\n\n307\n00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:09.170\nBase-T implementations have a maximum\ntransmission distance of 100 meters.\n\n308\n00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.180\nWell, if you're doing 10G,\nthat depends what type of\n\n309\n00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.110\ncable you have if you're gonna get\n10G speeds out to the full distance.\n\n310\n00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.530\nYou'll still have transmission\nspeeds out to the full distance, but\n\n311\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.820\nyou might not have\nthe sustained 10G speeds.\n\n312\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.550\nCat 6A, hundred meter range, right?\n\n313\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:30.290\nCAT6, 55 meters and I believe even\nCAT5E can support 10G in theory but\n\n314\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.560\nit's gonna be even shorter than that.\n\n315\n00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.330\nI don't know,\nI think it's like ten meters, right?\n\n316\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.120\nSo I do keep that in mind.\n\n317\n00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.960\nKinda interesting here, and\nI was talking to Dan about this,\n\n318\n00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.060\nit eliminates half duplex communications.\n\n319\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.780\nYou cannot perform half\nduplex communications, and\n\n320\n00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.020\nI have to tell you I read about that\none within the last few months there.\n\n321\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.430\nThat it completely eliminates half duplex,\n\n322\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.920\nit is going to be a simultaneous\ntwo way full duplex communication.\n\n323\n00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.170\nAnd the other thing that's kind of\ninteresting about this too is it doesn't\n\n324\n00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.900\nbring over the previous\nethernet generations\n\n325\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.356\ncarrier sense multiple\naccess collision detection.\n\n326\n00:18:06.356 --> 00:18:08.842\nWhat else?\n\n327\n00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:12.900\nOkay, so I do wanna mention\na little bit about the SONET too.\n\n328\n00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.155\nIt might come up, remember when we talked\nabout the synchronous optical networking.\n\n329\n00:18:19.535 --> 00:18:24.165\nWhen you connect these over gateways,\nbecause the speed is 10g,\n\n330\n00:18:24.165 --> 00:18:29.830\nthese can connect to SONET's OC 192,\nthe optical carrier 192.\n\n331\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.720\nIt does run slightly throttled,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n332\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.890\nI mean SONET does a fiber technology and\nwe were saying, well wait a second,\n\n333\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.730\nethernet's gonna be throttled or\nslowed down a little bit, not by much.\n\n334\n00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.765\nAnd I don't remember this and\nI don't expect you guys,\n\n335\n00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:45.895\nI don't think you're gonna\nhave to know this on the exam.\n\n336\n00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:50.622\nOC192 runs at 9.95328 gigs.\n\n337\n00:18:50.622 --> 00:18:53.218\nSo that's just under 10 G.\n\n338\n00:18:53.218 --> 00:18:55.700\nI don't know if that's something\nthat we could actually notice.\n\n339\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.330\nI know our network devices notice that.\n\n340\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.740\nBut the only time I notice the network\nslow is when I can't visit a website or\n\n341\n00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.570\nmy email takes forever, right,\nto get off of the networks.\n\n342\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.130\nSo I don't know that, physically,\na human might even notice that, at all.\n\n343\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.430\nAll right, so that kind of rounds up\nour copper technologies that we've\n\n344\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.830\nbeen talking about in ethernet.\n\n345\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:18.820\nAnd now we kind of move into,\nwell other technologies, like for\n\n346\n00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.310\ninstance we have fiber.\n\n347\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.020\nLet me to a little adjustment here so\nwe can move this around.\n\n348\n00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.730\nThere we go,\nmake it easier to move around there.\n\n349\n00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.590\nAnd that is we start talking about\nthings like hundred base FX.\n\n350\n00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.520\nWhat are we talking about there?\n\n351\n00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.170\nWell we're talking about fiber guys.\n\n352\n00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.990\nWhen we start talking about 10 based FX,\n\n353\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.580\nwhat we're talking about,\nis multimode fiber.\n\n354\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.854\nNow I'm gonna hopefully clear up a couple\nof things that might help you in your\n\n355\n00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:47.459\nstudies.\n\n356\n00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:50.660\nYou might see abbreviations when\nyou're looking at these standards,\n\n357\n00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.459\nwhen you're looking at cables maybe go up\nto some place like Cableorganizer.com.\n\n358\n00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:59.007\nTiger Direct and\nyou're considering ordering these cables,\n\n359\n00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:02.360\nyou might see abbreviations like mmf and\nsmf.\n\n360\n00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.820\nWhat does that mean?\n\n361\n00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.270\nMulti mode fiber, single mode fiber.\n\n362\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.850\nSo, just keep that in\nmind if you see that.\n\n363\n00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.880\nOther things that you might see is\nthe wavelengths measured in nanometers.\n\n364\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:20.040\nSo for instance,\n10BaseFX is a 1300 nanometer wavelength.\n\n365\n00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.910\nAnd those larger wavelengths\nare what they call NIR.\n\n366\n00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.850\nThey're near infrared wavelengths.\n\n367\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.840\nSo again, just a little\ntechnical jargon there, guys.\n\n368\n00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.340\nIf you see that NIR.\n\n369\n00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.320\nThink about our electromagnetic spectrum,\nright?\n\n370\n00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.780\nThe fiberoptics, we're talking\nabout optical light source, right.\n\n371\n00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:44.008\nSo, it sits just outside the infrared\nspectrum at 1300 nanometer wavelength.\n\n372\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.070\nAll right, let's see here.\n\n373\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.010\nThe other thing,\nbefore we move into the SR, SW,\n\n374\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.960\nand Dim, I wanna kinda mention\nwhat this R and this W mean.\n\n375\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.520\nSee, I really like little techniques\nthat can help you remember all this\n\n376\n00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.690\ncrazy standard information on the exam.\n\n377\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.540\nR, if you see an R in it,\n\n378\n00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.640\nwhat that typically means is\nthat's land based, all right?\n\n379\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.350\nIf you see W in it,\nyou can see that these are more WAN based.\n\n380\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.790\nWhat I mean by WAN based is they; remember\nhow I told you they had to kind of rewrite\n\n381\n00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.050\nthe physical layer?\n\n382\n00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.695\nWhen you see the W in the mix for fiber\noptics, that means, you can connect it and\n\n383\n00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:28.515\nuse the gateway to connect it to SONET.\n\n384\n00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:31.985\nYeah, the R, excuse me, is dark fiber.\n\n385\n00:21:31.985 --> 00:21:34.305\nW is WAN links, SONET links, okay?\n\n386\n00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:36.005\nSo that's something that\nyou could think of.\n\n387\n00:21:36.005 --> 00:21:38.445\nThey say which one do\nyou use with dark fiber?\n\n388\n00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:40.550\nWhich one do you use with SONET?\n\n389\n00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:43.206\nAll right, well R, that's your dark fiber.\n\n390\n00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:48.500\nW basically means WAN and\nthat's gonna be your sonic connection.\n\n391\n00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.020\nJust and again I don't know\nthey're gonna ask you that, but\n\n392\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.980\nsomethings which you can maybe help you\nremember a little bit easier on the exam.\n\n393\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.420\nWell Dan, that is a little bit,\nI know we've got more to go but\n\n394\n00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.380\nI don't think I'm gonna get all\nthe additional technology, so\n\n395\n00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.110\nI think I'm gonna have to Leave fiber\noptics for a little cliffhanger.\n\n396\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.570\n&gt;&gt; Well, we can definitely do that.\n\n397\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.000\nAnd we're happy to do so, cuz you're\nprobably out there going, my goodness,\n\n398\n00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.270\n10 based this, 100 based that.\n\n399\n00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.850\nYeah, lions, and tigers, and\nbears, my, that's exactly right.\n\n400\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.240\nSo we'll let these good people\nsettle down for a second.\n\n401\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.520\nTake a breather, have a Coke and\na smile and we'll do a part two.\n\n402\n00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.850\nSo, Wes, thanks so much for\n\n403\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.670\nwalking us down this road as far as\nwe have, yellow bricked as it may be.\n\n404\n00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.050\nWe're going to go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n405\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.910\nWe will be back for a part two and\nmove into that fiber stuff,\n\n406\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.630\nso hopefully you'll be back for that,\nbut as for this one, signing off for\n\n407\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.220\nIT Pro TV I've been your\nhost Daniel Lowery.\n\n408\n00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.240\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n409\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.356\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n410\n00:22:44.356 -->

You're\n\n3\n00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:13.071\nwatching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n4\n00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.330\ngreetings everyone, and welcome to\nanother exciting episode of ITPRO.TV\n\n5\n00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.660\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310\nAnd in today's episode, well, we are back\nwith more on our CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.210\nAnd, of course,\njoining us in the studio yet again,\n\n8\n00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.660\ncontinuing on with some cabling standards,\nis our good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.150\nWes, welcome back, my man, how's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.701\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n11\n00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.480\nYeah, we've got a few more\nthat we've gotta tackle here.\n\n12\n00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.400\nAnd I can tell you,\nit's never the fun work, right,\n\n13\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.710\nwhen you have to memorize standards.\n\n14\n00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.510\nWe always want to know,\nhey I wanna configure something.\n\n15\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.000\nI want to plug something into the network.\n\n16\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.723\nI wanna hack the network, right.\n\n17\n00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:52.243\nSo I understand that the topics that we've\nbeen talking about in part one of this,\n\n18\n00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:56.403\nI guess, miniseries that we're\nmaking here, and part two,\n\n19\n00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:59.537\nmight not be the most glorious topics,\nguys.\n\n20\n00:00:59.537 --> 00:01:01.940\nBut it is something that you're\ngonna have to know on the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.220\nSo we wanna make sure that you\ndo have the information and\n\n22\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540\nthe standardized information so\nyou'll do well on the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.780\nNow, in the first part of this,\nwe talked a lot about the copper media.\n\n24\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.720\nIf we could take a look here at my screen.\n\n25\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.640\nRemember, we talked about some\nof the legacies ones, guys.\n\n26\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.340\nAnd we're really just talking about,\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n27\n00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.339\nEthernet, right, ten megabit.\n\n28\n00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.522\nWe're talking about fast Ethernet,\nthat's a 100 megabit.\n\n29\n00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:32.636\nAnd then gigabit Ethernet, 1,000 megs,\nif you will, 1,000 base, right.\n\n30\n00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:33.580\nAnd then 10G.\n\n31\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.000\nBut so far we've been talking\nabout just about copper media.\n\n32\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.235\nAnd our copper media that we use today,\nnot considering the legacy ones of\n\n33\n00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:43.114\nyesterday, are twisted\npair implementations.\n\n34\n00:01:43.114 --> 00:01:45.796\nAnd we kinda started to\ntouch on fiber optics.\n\n35\n00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:49.788\nI mentioned the 100BaseFx.\n\n36\n00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:56.510\nKeep in mind that we are talking\nabout near infrared frequency.\n\n37\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.258\nNow, the next one is the 10GBase and\nthis is the SR.\n\n38\n00:01:59.258 --> 00:02:01.823\nWe kinda mentioned some things\nyou can keep in mind about that.\n\n39\n00:02:01.823 --> 00:02:05.450\nIf the R's at the end and they ask you\nwhat does this connect to, dark fiber.\n\n40\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.243\nRemember, anything that says W in it, it's\ngonna connect to your SONET interface.\n\n41\n00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:12.392\nThere's actually an EW\nthat I didn't put in here.\n\n42\n00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:17.198\nAgain, notice that the characteristics\nof the cable are identical.\n\n43\n00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:20.711\nI didn't bother putting it in here,\nit's not called out on the exam, but\n\n44\n00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:21.800\nthere is an EW as well.\n\n45\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.140\nThey just didn't care to put it in here.\n\n46\n00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.420\nAll right, so\nwhat are some of the characteristics?\n\n47\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.910\nAnd, again, keep in mind that\nwe're talking fiber optics.\n\n48\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.740\nAnd usually when we talk fiber optics,\n\n49\n00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.120\nwe can talk that we have our options\nto go to massive distances, right.\n\n50\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.535\nWhen we talk about Metro Ethernet,\nman-based technology, well,\n\n51\n00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:45.039\nyou say, well, metropolitan,\ncan Ethernet really span that long?\n\n52\n00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.991\nWell, the Standard goes up to 40\nkilometers, I mean, that's what,\n\n53\n00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:50.260\n40,000 meters?\n\n54\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.150\nThat's a sizable range.\n\n55\n00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.204\nAnd that really could, well,\n25 miles, I mean, gosh.\n\n56\n00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.678\nThat's getting pretty popular because\nyou don't have to convert from\n\n57\n00:02:57.678 --> 00:02:58.386\nanything, right.\n\n58\n00:02:58.386 --> 00:02:59.764\nIt's all Ethernet.\n\n59\n00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.446\nIf you've got an Ethernet network,\n\n60\n00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:03.573\nyou plug it in and\nnow you're there on Metro E.\n\n61\n00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:06.212\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you get that wire speed,\nno conversion, right.\n\n62\n00:03:06.212 --> 00:03:07.905\nMakes it easier on the gateways.\n\n63\n00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:10.790\nAnd you already got existing\nEthernet-based technology.\n\n64\n00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.670\nSo that's why you might\neven see these technologies\n\n65\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.700\nmaybe discussed in the context\nof Metro Ethernet, as well,\n\n66\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.190\neven though we're just kind of talking\nabout land communications here.\n\n67\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.155\nWhen it comes to 10BaseSR,\ndo remember this is multi-mode fiber.\n\n68\n00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:32.285\nAll right, we're talking at\nan 850 nanometer wavelength.\n\n69\n00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:37.675\nIt is shorter distances than the Base,\nbut it's a lower expense.\n\n70\n00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:43.225\nWhen we talk about It's very costly,\nvery money hungry, if you will.\n\n71\n00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:47.274\nThis uses what's known as,\nwe've talked about this in other episodes,\n\n72\n00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:51.215\nhow do we do this conversion from\ncopper media to optical light source?\n\n73\n00:03:51.215 --> 00:03:57.220\nAnd we talked about something known as the\nsmall form-factor pluggable modules, SFPs.\n\n74\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.979\nAnd we also talked about the earlier\npredecessor, which was the GBICs,\n\n75\n00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.590\nthe gigabit interface cards.\n\n76\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.680\nWell, SR here would actually\nconnect to something known as SFP+.\n\n77\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.700\nIt's the same standard, but\nit supports 10GBase networks.\n\n78\n00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.370\nIn fact, I just pulled one\nout of the server closet.\n\n79\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.440\nIf we could check it out here.\n\n80\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.937\nI can see, just judging by this.\n\n81\n00:04:18.937 --> 00:04:23.902\nWell, first of all, you could see the SFP+\nright there, right there on the logo.\n\n82\n00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:24.490\n&gt;&gt; Dead giveaway [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n83\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.500\nthat's right, that pretty much\ntells me that's what it is.\n\n84\n00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.503\nBut, Dan,\nI don't know if you can see that.\n\n85\n00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.750\nCan you see that 850nm, right there?\n\n86\n00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.305\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; So we can see kinda going out of\n\n87\n00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:33.808\nthe gate.\n\n88\n00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.246\nAnd you would still\nhave to check this out,\n\n89\n00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.710\nI wouldn't just rely on just\nthis little bit of jargon here.\n\n90\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.848\nBut I would almost be willing to bet\nthat this is a multi-mode fiber SFP.\n\n91\n00:04:44.848 --> 00:04:50.220\nAll right, and you can see, well,\nthe place that it plugs into.\n\n92\n00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.000\nAnd then here at the top, you can see\nthis is where we would put our LC\n\n93\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.960\nconnectors there, two of those LC\nconnectors for duplex communication.\n\n94\n00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.723\nSo that's essentially what that multi-mode\nfiber would connect to if we were\n\n95\n00:05:03.723 --> 00:05:04.878\nimplementing it,\n\n96\n00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:09.584\nwhich I believe we are implementing\nmulti-mode fiber in our server closet.\n\n97\n00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:12.700\nSo we've got a few of these in there,\nas well.\n\n98\n00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.640\nRange, let's go ahead and\ntalk about range.\n\n99\n00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.172\nWhen we talk about multi-mode fiber,\n\n100\n00:05:17.172 --> 00:05:20.370\nmulti-mode fiber has a shorter\ntransmission distance.\n\n101\n00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.460\nIt's cheaper.\n\n102\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.868\nThe core of the cable is,\nlike we talked about in other episodes,\n\n103\n00:05:25.868 --> 00:05:28.766\nthe core is a lot larger,\nso it is cheaper.\n\n104\n00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:34.050\nIt's got a 50 or a 62.5 micron core.\n\n105\n00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.235\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n106\n00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:37.605\nIt does reduce it down\nto about 300 meters.\n\n107\n00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:41.065\nSo these are good for\nthings like backbones in buildings, right.\n\n108\n00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:45.605\nIf I need a lot of bandwidth\non a backbone-based network,\n\n109\n00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:48.670\nI could run this inside of\na building here because, again,\n\n110\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.710\nit's not quite long enough to go\nthe distance that I would need, maybe,\n\n111\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.770\ntraveling up to a few miles\nbetween buildings here.\n\n112\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.680\nI'll go ahead and\nmention the SW as well, guys,\n\n113\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.570\ncuz really we're talking about the same\ncharacteristics of the cable here.\n\n114\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.220\nA little bit out of order\nthan what the objectives are.\n\n115\n00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.110\nSW, again, same thing, multi-mode fiber.\n\n116\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:17.750\nIt's 850 nanometer wavelength,\nlower cost than 10GBaseER, 300 meters.\n\n117\n00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.348\nThe different is, with the SW, keep in\nmind that it is going to connect to SONET.\n\n118\n00:06:22.348 --> 00:06:25.634\nAnd I would almost be willing to bet\nthat that's what this one here is gonna\n\n119\n00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:26.220\nconnect to.\n\n120\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.150\nIt's probably a 10GBaseSW\nconnecting to a SONET network.\n\n121\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.570\nAll right,\nlet's see where we are down here.\n\n122\n00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.210\nI know we got a lot of standards,\nman, a lot to memorize.\n\n123\n00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.830\nSo last one for our Ethernet standards.\n\n124\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.280\nAnd I promise you, guys,\nwe will move into another topic.\n\n125\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.310\n[LAUGH] The 10GBaseER,\nthis is called extended reach.\n\n126\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.660\nThe extended reach here,\nwe're talking about,\n\n127\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.450\nwell, we're talking about\n1,550 nanometer wavelength.\n\n128\n00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.960\nThat wavelength, again,\nsingle mode fiber, SMF, if you will.\n\n129\n00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.140\nRemember, the core is\na lot more concentrated.\n\n130\n00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.160\nWe're talking nine microns, and\nit's a single light source,\n\n131\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.690\nsingle laser versus multi-mode,\nwhich uses multiple lasers.\n\n132\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.030\nAnd it's fired kind of like a rifle\nshot down the center of that core there.\n\n133\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.060\nDistances up to 25 miles.\n\n134\n00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.160\nAgain, this is one that can\ngo up to 40 kilometers.\n\n135\n00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.765\nSo, again, you can see this not only\nin land-based implementations, but\n\n136\n00:07:30.765 --> 00:07:34.205\npotentially even see it in your\nMetro Ethernet-based implementations\n\n137\n00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:36.130\njust because of the distance.\n\n138\n00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.790\nNow, the last couple of\ntopics that we have,\n\n139\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.740\nI really don't have any diagrams for,\nguys.\n\n140\n00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.620\nNot that the diagrams were\ndoing you much when it comes to\n\n141\n00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.820\nmemorization of facts here.\n\n142\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.840\nBut we do have a couple of other\nstandards that they call out.\n\n143\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.880\nOne is a relatively newer standard.\n\n144\n00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.085\nAnd I say at the time that we're\nfilming this, this is 2017,\n\n145\n00:07:52.085 --> 00:07:56.067\nthe standard that we're talking about,\nit's gone through its progressions.\n\n146\n00:07:56.067 --> 00:08:00.931\nIt didn't first come up in 2013, but\nwe're talking about a derivative or\n\n147\n00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:01.972\na version of it.\n\n148\n00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:08.445\nThis is a IEEE's 1905.1-2013,\nthey throw that in the exam.\n\n149\n00:08:08.445 --> 00:08:10.799\nSo we wanna talk a little bit about this,\nand\n\n150\n00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:14.310\nit's interesting if you don't have\nto do this for the exam guys.\n\n151\n00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.460\nBut if you do happen to pull\ndown the IEEE documentation,\n\n152\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.626\nnot like I actually did that.\n\n153\n00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:23.673\n[LAUGH] You could see,\nthis is called the standard for\n\n154\n00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:28.470\nconvergence digital home network for\nheterogeneous technologies.\n\n155\n00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.530\nYeah, you won't have to\nsee that on the exam.\n\n156\n00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.993\nThey could have definitely put that\ninto an acronym, saved us time.\n\n157\n00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:39.777\nThis is interesting, you can hear\na few things that this is called PLN,\n\n158\n00:08:39.777 --> 00:08:41.470\npower line networking.\n\n159\n00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.029\nI want you to think about it,\nwhen we talk about POE.\n\n160\n00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:46.510\nWhat are we doing, right?\n\n161\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.468\nAnd I'll throw that question to you Dan,\nwhat essentially are we doing?\n\n162\n00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:51.638\nVery basically when we\ntalk power over Ethernet.\n\n163\n00:08:51.638 --> 00:08:55.083\n&gt;&gt; Well we're basically just trying to\nsend the network packets over your power\n\n164\n00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:55.719\nconnection.\n\n165\n00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:56.669\n&gt;&gt; It's the opposite, right?\n\n166\n00:08:56.669 --> 00:08:57.363\n&gt;&gt; The other way.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n167\n00:08:57.363 --> 00:08:58.038\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n168\n00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.243\n&gt;&gt; And that leads us to where we\nare cuz you're thinking about where we\n\n169\n00:09:01.243 --> 00:09:01.997\nare right now.\n\n170\n00:09:01.997 --> 00:09:06.854\n[LAUGH] Throw them a question that again,\nwhen we're talking about IEEE's 1905.\n\n171\n00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:09.280\nWe're talking about exactly\nwhat he's thinking, right?\n\n172\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.970\nSo in power over Ethernet,\nwe taking existing data networks, right?\n\n173\n00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.959\nAnd we inject power on, and it powers all\nof our different devices, like [CROSSTALK]\n\n174\n00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:17.504\n&gt;&gt; Like just a copper cable.\n\n175\n00:09:17.504 --> 00:09:18.587\n&gt;&gt; That's all it is.\n&gt;&gt; So it conducts electricity.\n\n176\n00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:19.342\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it.\n\n177\n00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:25.530\nSo somebody said, wait, we've got a lot\nof copper electrical lines everywhere.\n\n178\n00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.873\n&gt;&gt; No, what somebody said was, I hate all\nthese stinking cables underneath my desk,\n\n179\n00:09:28.873 --> 00:09:31.043\nthere's gotta be some way\nto consolidate this crap.\n\n180\n00:09:31.043 --> 00:09:32.883\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's exactly what it was.\n\n181\n00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:34.816\n[LAUGH] And somebody said,\nwell you know what?\n\n182\n00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:38.274\nIf we can take an Ethernet network and\nwe could put power on it,\n\n183\n00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:41.090\nwhy can't we take power and\nput Ethernet over it?\n\n184\n00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.032\nAnd that's what some of\nthis definition defines.\n\n185\n00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:44.920\nIt's not the only thing that it defines.\n\n186\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.510\nIt defines something known\nas powerline networking.\n\n187\n00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.804\nExisting power lines that you can use to\nsend that network communications over.\n\n188\n00:09:51.804 --> 00:09:55.985\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of high-fiving,\nI think in that little meeting.\n\n189\n00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:57.084\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There was, and\n\n190\n00:09:57.084 --> 00:09:58.040\nI've always thought that.\n\n191\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.810\nBecause here at the network plus,\n\n192\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.070\nwe always say, you have to worry\nabout electromagnetic interference.\n\n193\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.976\nDon't you dare take those cables and\nzip tie them into a conduit or anything.\n\n194\n00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:11.450\nAnd then here we're saying,\ntake your electrical lines, and\n\n195\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.623\nwe'll just put data on them.\n\n196\n00:10:12.623 --> 00:10:13.209\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n197\n00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:15.392\nit's kind of interesting how that works.\n\n198\n00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:19.041\nBut these guys are brilliant\npeople out there with the IEEE.\n\n199\n00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:22.340\nThe MIT, I'm sure and\nsome brilliant engineers.\n\n200\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.023\nSo they've figured out a way to do this.\n\n201\n00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:29.420\nYou might also hear things like power\nline carrier, digital subscriber line.\n\n202\n00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.200\nSo what do you think?\n\n203\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.686\nIt's power carry over DSL, right?\n\n204\n00:10:32.686 --> 00:10:37.080\nSo a couple other little\nthings that you might hear.\n\n205\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.726\nPowerline communications, might be PLN\ntoo, powerline networking as well.\n\n206\n00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:45.361\nThey do call out a couple of things again,\nEthernet over powerline, and\n\n207\n00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.070\nthat's exactly what we're talking about.\n\n208\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.630\nImagine that you're in your home and you\ndon't want to run cabling throughout your\n\n209\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.510\nhouse just to get to a specific room,\nall right?\n\n210\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.380\nWell what can I do?\n\n211\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.564\nWell you have these little modules that\nyou can plug right into the 110 outlet and\n\n212\n00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:04.154\nyou can plug your Ethernet jack into them,\nright?\n\n213\n00:11:04.154 --> 00:11:05.777\nAnd it runs through\nthe cable in your house and\n\n214\n00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:07.150\nit comes out the other end in the room.\n\n215\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.780\nAnd I didn't have to run additional\ncables, just like Dan said.\n\n216\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.730\nI don't want anymore rats nest, right?\n\n217\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.290\nExcept for the ones in the attic,\nI don't want anymore rats nest.\n\n218\n00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.110\nI want to use the existing lines now\nwithout having to tear down walls.\n\n219\n00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.170\nWell it gives you that advantage.\n\n220\n00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.001\nNow doesn't mean that you are necessarily\ngonna be running at gigabyte speeds,\n\n221\n00:11:24.001 --> 00:11:24.575\nall right?\n\n222\n00:11:24.575 --> 00:11:29.506\nOne other thing you have to worry about is\nthat well it does give you communications,\n\n223\n00:11:29.506 --> 00:11:33.200\nthere's still gonna be some\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n224\n00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.010\nAnd you're not gonna get\nthe blinding speeds.\n\n225\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:41.640\nI doubt you gonna be doing any\nonline gaming with a Powerline or\n\n226\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.330\nEthernet over Powerline, so\nyou can see speeds fluctuate.\n\n227\n00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.586\nI heard some people that say that\nthey tested the speed on it.\n\n228\n00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:50.929\nIt was like 600k.\n\n229\n00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:52.404\n&gt;&gt; That's not good.\n\n230\n00:11:52.404 --> 00:11:53.843\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so keep in mind,\n\n231\n00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:55.645\nyou're not gonna get blinding speeds.\n\n232\n00:11:55.645 --> 00:11:58.783\nBut you do get the benefit of the fact\nthat if I don't wanna run additional\n\n233\n00:11:58.783 --> 00:12:01.370\nnetworking cables,\nI can piggy back off of existing ones.\n\n234\n00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.950\nNow there's another technology\nthat they put here in networking.\n\n235\n00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.702\nWe also talk about an A+, so\nif you're coming from the A+ show,\n\n236\n00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:13.425\nyou might have already about this one,\nweve talked about the HDMI cable, right?\n\n237\n00:12:13.425 --> 00:12:17.717\nHDMI, things like for instance\nDisplayPort, another one Thunderbolt.\n\n238\n00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:19.170\nThey only call one and\n\n239\n00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:24.519\nthat the HDMI cuz of the fact that it\ncould transfer Ethernet over HDMI as well.\n\n240\n00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:28.165\nI went ahead and threw some additional\ntechnologies in there because,\n\n241\n00:12:28.165 --> 00:12:30.700\nyou might think leaving this one on.\n\n242\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.694\nI just learned HDMI,\nyou could send Ethernet over that.\n\n243\n00:12:33.694 --> 00:12:36.640\nSomebody says what about DisplayPort,\nwhat about Thunderbolt?\n\n244\n00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.478\nNo, you can't do.\n\n245\n00:12:37.478 --> 00:12:38.900\nYes, you can, right?\n\n246\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.940\nSo it's not the only technology out there,\nbut\n\n247\n00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.810\nthis is one of the first that allow\nyou one cable to do everything, right?\n\n248\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.926\nAudio, video and networking as well.\n\n249\n00:12:46.926 --> 00:12:50.734\nSo they've got a built-in HDMI\nstandard that you can put Ethernet\n\n250\n00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:53.930\nframes across an HDMI cable and\nget networking as well.\n\n251\n00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.880\nBut keep in mind too, not only exam, but\n\n252\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.380\nI wanted to let you know dsiplay\nport does the same thing.\n\n253\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.662\nIn fact, I'll disconnect right\nnow disconnect Dan's adapter.\n\n254\n00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:05.043\nWe have Thunderbolt Ethernet\nadaptors plugged into our MacBooks.\n\n255\n00:13:05.043 --> 00:13:08.376\nAnd you also have DisplayPort as\nwell cuz they're pretty much close\n\n256\n00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:09.610\nto the same form factor.\n\n257\n00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.250\nAll right, Dan, we've talked about this,\n\n258\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.242\nwe've talked about the cabling\nstandards as well.\n\n259\n00:13:15.242 --> 00:13:18.786\nThey mentioned ETIAs or\nhowever you say it.\n\n260\n00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:21.980\n568A and B,\nwe've already talked about that.\n\n261\n00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.100\nKnow what the wiring standard is because\nI can tell you, it is such an important\n\n262\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.750\ntopic that you very well might get\na question to test your knowledge, right?\n\n263\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.800\nYou might get something where they just\nsay, do you know the color coordination?\n\n264\n00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.290\nWe're not gonna tell you pins,\njust do you know the colors?\n\n265\n00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.740\nOr maybe we wanna know the PIN.\n\n266\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.190\nSo it is important to memorize\n\n267\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.710\nthose wiring standards that we\ntalked about in the first part.\n\n268\n00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:48.854\nLast thing that we'll talk about\nhere Dan is DOCSIS, right?\n\n269\n00:13:48.854 --> 00:13:50.424\nDan, do you know anything about DOCSIS?\n\n270\n00:13:50.424 --> 00:13:51.384\nHave you heard about that before?\n\n271\n00:13:51.384 --> 00:13:54.624\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I actually have a DOCSIS modem\nat my house because I have cable and\n\n272\n00:13:54.624 --> 00:13:56.578\nthat's how I get my Internet connection.\n\n273\n00:13:56.578 --> 00:13:59.938\nAnd that's what it does,\nit's usually found in cable modems.\n\n274\n00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:02.116\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, man I can't fool\nthis guy and I'm trying here.\n\n275\n00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:03.975\nThat's right, so DOCSIS,\n\n276\n00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:10.100\nif you look at the acronym it's data over\ncable system interface specification.\n\n277\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.701\nNo, you don't have to remember the exam.\n\n278\n00:14:11.701 --> 00:14:14.294\nDo exactly what Dan did, it's cable.\n\n279\n00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:18.302\n[LAUGH] I need an Internet cable I\nuse a cable modem, a DOCSIS modem.\n\n280\n00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:21.339\nSo very good, that's exactly what it is.\n\n281\n00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:25.260\nHigh bandwidth transfer\nover existing CATV lines.\n\n282\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.030\nI think your analogy with we don't\nwanna lay any more cables ever\n\n283\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.930\nis probably right.\n\n284\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.450\nIt's probably why all these\nnew standards are coming up.\n\n285\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.116\nI don't think you have to know this, but\nI will tell you that the standard in ANSI\n\n286\n00:14:36.116 --> 00:14:39.425\ndefines the standard here in\nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n\n287\n00:14:39.425 --> 00:14:42.790\nIf you happen to be watching\nus maybe from Europe, or\n\n288\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.767\nmaybe you're just traveling in Europe,\nit is PAL/DVB-C,\n\n289\n00:14:46.767 --> 00:14:51.290\nthat's what they call the standard,\nI like DOCSIS a little bit more.\n\n290\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.530\nWhen I first looked at the acronym, I was\nlike god that's gonna take me forever.\n\n291\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.453\nBut then I looked at the European\nstandard, and said no,\n\n292\n00:14:56.453 --> 00:14:57.624\nI'll stick with DOCSIS instead.\n\n293\n00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.209\n&gt;&gt; DOCSIS just kind of rolls\nof the tongue a little easier-\n\n294\n00:14:59.209 --> 00:14:59.943\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n295\n00:14:59.943 --> 00:15:01.432\n&gt;&gt; In my opinion.\n\n296\n00:15:01.432 --> 00:15:02.312\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, So\n\n297\n00:15:02.312 --> 00:15:07.587\nI know guys we've talked about\na lot of different technologies.\n\n298\n00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:10.855\nAnd one more that I didn't mention for\nthe IEEE1905,\n\n299\n00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:15.190\nI know it's 1905.1-2013\nthat they point out.\n\n300\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.190\nBut one of the first 1905 standards\nwas what we call BPL, and\n\n301\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.499\nthat's Broadband over Power Line.\n\n302\n00:15:21.499 --> 00:15:25.456\nSo keep in mind that that also falls under\nthe 1905 standard, even though we really,\n\n303\n00:15:25.456 --> 00:15:28.700\nI don't know if it's gonna be called\nout on the exam so know that as well.\n\n304\n00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.576\nAll right, so let me see, yeah guys,\nI know that we've talked about a lot of\n\n305\n00:15:32.576 --> 00:15:35.559\ndifferent standards,\na lot of different technologies.\n\n306\n00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:39.990\nDan mentioned in the first part\nflashcards, flashcards, flashcards.\n\n307\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.480\nIf you guys like doing\ntraditional memorization,\n\n308\n00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.200\nthis will probably be the subject for you.\n\n309\n00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.610\nIf you dont, this will probably be\nthe subject like myself that I struggled\n\n310\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.790\na little bit on untill I finally did like\nyou said, break out of the fresh cards.\n\n311\n00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.315\nWrite them down, take a piece of paper and\nwrite the standards down and\n\n312\n00:15:56.315 --> 00:15:58.847\nwrap that paper up and\nthrow it away or recycle it.\n\n313\n00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:01.538\n&gt;&gt; This is where Wes is dead inside and\ncuts now.\n\n314\n00:16:01.538 --> 00:16:02.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n315\n00:16:02.877 --> 00:16:04.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n316\n00:16:04.573 --> 00:16:07.353\n&gt;&gt; So keep writing it down until you get\n\n317\n00:16:07.353 --> 00:16:08.562\nit memorized.\n\n318\n00:16:08.562 --> 00:16:12.796\nIf on the exam, you pass the exam and\nthen you don't remember the standards,\n\n319\n00:16:12.796 --> 00:16:14.240\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n320\n00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.230\nBut at least you'll have\nsome kind of understanding.\n\n321\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.610\nThings like base standards,\nI don't know the specifics, but\n\n322\n00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.135\nI can look at 100 base T and\nknow what it's about.\n\n323\n00:16:23.135 --> 00:16:25.265\nI can look at 100 based FX and\n\n324\n00:16:25.265 --> 00:16:28.455\nknow that's 100 megabit standard\nbased band transmission.\n\n325\n00:16:28.455 --> 00:16:31.575\nSo, all digital transmission, and\nit's going over some kind of fiber or\n\n326\n00:16:31.575 --> 00:16:33.615\ntwisted pairing implementation.\n\n327\n00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:37.855\nTake the shortcuts to ensure,\ntake the shortcuts for your memorization.\n\n328\n00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:41.925\nRemember that if you can remember that\nfive different standards are all twisted\n\n329\n00:16:41.925 --> 00:16:44.845\npair, you don't have to write\nthat down over and over and over.\n\n330\n00:16:44.845 --> 00:16:47.550\nMake it a little bit easier for yourself.\n\n331\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.420\nI would also, as one final thing,\n\n332\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:54.130\nI would say that you should know the 802\nstandards related to these just in\n\n333\n00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.450\ncase they're asking you about a standard\ncompared to another standard.\n\n334\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.240\nSo that is another thing that I\nwould definitely take a look at.\n\n335\n00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.205\nI don't believe that\nsome of the legacy ones,\n\n336\n00:17:06.205 --> 00:17:10.788\nyour really gonna see it all,\nunless it's a museum.\n\n337\n00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:13.510\nBut even at that, I would still\nknow a little bit about them.\n\n338\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.500\nRemember some of the old ones.\n\n339\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.198\nYou know, bus topology.\n\n340\n00:17:16.198 --> 00:17:22.230\nAs ethernet grew, we have standards today\nthat are really star-based topologies.\n\n341\n00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.110\nAlso remember, if your dealing in 10G or\ncat cable matters, right?\n\n342\n00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.920\nThe quality of the cat cable.\n\n343\n00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.050\nWe're not just talking about\nputting on a cable tester, right?\n\n344\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.920\nRemember, that's just testing\nof electrical currents,\n\n345\n00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.120\nmaking it from one end of\nthe cable to the other.\n\n346\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.130\nWhat you need is a cable certifier.\n\n347\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.923\nThe cable certifier ensures that\nwhen they, when you read, right?\n\n348\n00:17:44.923 --> 00:17:49.320\nWhen you read the side of that cable and\nit says TE6A, well, guess what?\n\n349\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.980\nIf I put a cable certifier on it,\n\n350\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.170\nit better stand 10 gigs all\nthe way out to 100 meters, right?\n\n351\n00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.093\nIf I put it on a six, just a cat 6 cable.\n\n352\n00:17:58.093 --> 00:18:01.203\nI should see putting the cable\ncertifier on it, but then, yes,\n\n353\n00:18:01.203 --> 00:18:04.264\nit will get 10G speeds,\neven if it's only halfway, right?\n\n354\n00:18:04.264 --> 00:18:07.680\nSo, remember, at this point,\nif you're talking about 10G speeds,\n\n355\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.090\nthey're a lot less forgiving, right?\n\n356\n00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.070\nIn the lower standards, right,\nthe 10-based and the 100-based,\n\n357\n00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.430\nthey were a little more forgiving on the\ncables and the twists within the cable.\n\n358\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.080\nAnd even the making, the crimping and\n\n359\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.640\nthe terminating of a cable\nwas a little bit easier.\n\n360\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.505\nCat 6 have their own connectors.\n\n361\n00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:27.470\nThey're still RJ-45 jacks, but because\nthey have a plastic sheathing in them and\n\n362\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.650\na little bit of extra material in them.\n\n363\n00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.260\nThey're not the same type of RJ45 jack\nwhen it comes to crimping them down.\n\n364\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.620\nThey don't tolerate undoing of the twists,\nright?\n\n365\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.060\nUsually, you have people, like I know\nthat we had people that came in here and\n\n366\n00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.210\ndid the Cat 6A cable that\nwe have in our building.\n\n367\n00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.568\nThese are professionals that\nknow exactly what they're doing,\n\n368\n00:18:46.568 --> 00:18:50.352\nbecause you have to maintain the twist\nper inch in those cables to make sure\n\n369\n00:18:50.352 --> 00:18:53.605\nthat you fall under compliance\nwith the 10G based standard.\n\n370\n00:18:53.605 --> 00:19:00.710\nWhether you're talking about 10G based T,\nand really for all of them.\n\n371\n00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.035\nFiber's a lot less forgiving\nwhen it comes to the cables.\n\n372\n00:19:03.035 --> 00:19:06.742\nBut definitely know that, and\nkeep studying, keep practicing.\n\n373\n00:19:06.742 --> 00:19:10.346\nKeep writing them down, so that you'll be\nsuccessful when you take that NET+ exam.\n\n374\n00:19:10.346 --> 00:19:11.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n375\n00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.780\nWell, visiting the land\nof Oz has been fun.\n\n376\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.450\nAs we say, there's no place like home.\n\n377\n00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.010\nSo, everybody, grab your pencils,\ngrab your flashcard.\n\n378\n00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.490\nGo to work cuz like we've said over and\nover again, this is memorization land and\n\n379\n00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.245\nyou're gonna have a lot of fun doing it.\n\n380\n00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.630\nSo, there's my fictitiousness for the day.\n\n381\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.960\nWes, thanks so much from dropping by.\n\n382\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.660\nThanks for\n\n383\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.450\nexplaining each one of these different\ntechnologies that we need to know.\n\n384\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.610\nThe standards, the cables,\nthe distances, the types, you name it.\n\n385\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.350\nIt was all there, my.\n\n386\n00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.030\nWe do thank you guys for watching as well.\n\n387\n00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.265\nHopefully you got a lot out of this.\n\n388\n00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:42.440\nWe've spend a lot of hard work bringing\nit to you, so, hopefully that pays off.\n\n389\n00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.097\nThat being said, it looks like it is that\ntime for us to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n390\n00:19:46.097 --> 00:19:47.860\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n391\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.815\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm Wes standards memorization Bryan.\n\n392\n00:19:49.815 --> 00:19:52.488\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n393\n00:19:52.488 --> 00:19:58.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n394\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.179\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.964\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your CompTIA Network+\nseries, I'm your show host,\n\n4\n00:00:14.964 --> 00:00:16.596\nCherokee Boose and this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:20.690\nwe'll be looking at implementing different\ntypes of policies and procedures.\n\n6\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.920\nNow, this may not be\nthe most favorite topic, but\n\n7\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.350\nit is definitely a necessary one,\nand with us today,\n\n8\n00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.490\nwe have Mister Wes Bryant in studios,\nthank you for joining us today Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.769\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah,\nit's great to be here, and\n\n10\n00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.830\nI tell you, we're gonna get into\na little bit of the bureaucracy, right,\n\n11\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.260\nthe stuff that everybody wants to go,\nwe're talking about nothing but paperwork.\n\n12\n00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.091\nAnd the answer is, well, not really,\nnow, when we talk about policies and\n\n13\n00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.334\nprocedures, keep in mind you have things\nlike corporate security policies, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:48.492\nA corporate security policy is nothing\nmore than a definition of what security\n\n15\n00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:52.839\nmeans to a company, how you adhere to it,\nbest practices, things like advice and\n\n16\n00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.170\nhow to adhere to it and then.\n\n17\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.813\nMaybe, what is the possibility,\nif you violate a security policy,\n\n18\n00:00:59.813 --> 00:01:02.303\nyou know, what's the litigation?\n\n19\n00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:03.660\nWhat's gonna happen?\n\n20\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.340\nSo, there are all different kinds\nof policies but keep in mind,\n\n21\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.790\nwe also have many different\ntypes of policies and\n\n22\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.025\nit doesn't always have to be policies\nthat are just handwritten out.\n\n23\n00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:18.079\nSo, for instance, one of the first things\nthat they talk about are security policies\n\n24\n00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.102\nand like I mentioned, if you're talking\nabout paper security policy, then it is.\n\n25\n00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:25.768\nIt's a formal definition, a statement\nof what security means to the company,\n\n26\n00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:29.340\nhowever, that's not the only type of\nsecurity policy that we have, right?\n\n27\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.341\nWe have for instance,\nthey talk about consent to monitoring.\n\n28\n00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.790\nHave you ever gone, maybem some of you\nguys have done this when you go to,\n\n29\n00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.014\nmaybe like a public library,\nif you've ever logged into a computer\n\n30\n00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.408\nat the public library, you might have\nseen a little message that says,\n\n31\n00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:45.400\nby logging onto this machine,\nyou're consenting to be monitored, right?\n\n32\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440\nYou're agreeing to things like\nan acceptable use policy.\n\n33\n00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.401\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\nshow you what I mean,\n\n34\n00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.059\nI've got an old Windows 7 machine here and\nif I couldn't log into it.\n\n35\n00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.350\nRight, I hit control alt delete,\n\n36\n00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.890\nnotice that I have to say okay to this,\nbut what is it that I'm agreeing to?\n\n37\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.653\nWell, in this case the company's\ntold me that, hey attention,\n\n38\n00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:09.528\nby logging into this workstation\nyou agree to monitoring, right?\n\n39\n00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.710\nThat's your consent to monitoring.\n\n40\n00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.130\nNotice that it also says by logging onto\nthis workstation, not only do you consent\n\n41\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.360\nto monitoring but you also agree to and\nhave read the acceptable use policy.\n\n42\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.940\nWhat is an acceptable use policy?\n\n43\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.960\nIt's not necessarily a security policy,\nbut\n\n44\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.857\nwhat it defines are things like\nintellectual property, how can we use it?\n\n45\n00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.020\nAll right,\ncan we store it on our cell phones?\n\n46\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.415\nAre we even authorized to\nhave access to it, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:37.145\nWireless networks,\nwhat is the acceptable way?\n\n48\n00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:37.675\nRight?\n\n49\n00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:40.795\nWhat is the standard,\nwhen we're using a wireless network?\n\n50\n00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:42.215\nCan we use our home devices?\n\n51\n00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:43.365\nCan we use our private device?\n\n52\n00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:45.520\nCan we use things like our mobile phones,\n\n53\n00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.030\nmaybe you're in a very secure environment\nand you don't want company data or\n\n54\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.290\ncorporate information going\nacross the wireless network,\n\n55\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.260\njust due to some of the vulnerabilities\nthat we can see on wireless.\n\n56\n00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.920\nOr maybe,\nyou don't even want that information\n\n57\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.560\ngoing down to a mobile device\nwhere it has the potential\n\n58\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.710\nto be leaked out on things\nlike maybe even social media.\n\n59\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.810\nSo remember, security policies can be like\nthis where they are electronic, right?\n\n60\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.080\nIn the fact that this is a group\npolicy that was pushed out, right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.117\nIt's pushed out from a domain controller\nand it's applied to this work station and\n\n62\n00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.886\nit defines things like configurations and\nin this case,\n\n63\n00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:20.901\nit let's us know that, hey you are,\nyou could be monitored.\n\n64\n00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:26.390\nYou could be held liable\nto things like AUPs.\n\n65\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.880\nSo, let's go ahead, and\nlet's take this a little farther, right.\n\n66\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.290\nI've also got, so,\n\n67\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.730\nI've got my domain controller here,\nother types of policies that we have.\n\n68\n00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.480\nWe have, like I mentioned,\ngroup policies, right?\n\n69\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.060\nFor instance, a group policy is a type\nof policy that we can define things like\n\n70\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.680\nsecurity settings, right?\n\n71\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.130\nFor instance,\nlet me give you a classic example\n\n72\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.210\nof an attribute of one of the policies\nthat are security-centric, right?\n\n73\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.203\nIf you will, if I look at\na default domain policy, right?\n\n74\n00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:55.501\nAnd I look at some of the settings, well,\n\n75\n00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.010\nnotice that we have\nsecurity settings here.\n\n76\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.090\nOne of the security settings\nthat are inside of this policy.\n\n77\n00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.750\nWell, one of the most important ones\nare things like, account policies, right?\n\n78\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.340\nPassword policies,\nthings like lock out policies, right?\n\n79\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.310\nAnd a really, really important to us,\nprobably more so,\n\n80\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.960\nthan a lot of them are things likes,\npassword policies, right?\n\n81\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.083\nThis is a security policy, notice that, I\nknow my head's kinda covering it up here,\n\n82\n00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:24.888\nbut notice if I can get all that in the\nscreen here, it force password history.\n\n83\n00:04:24.888 --> 00:04:28.940\nNotice that we have 24\npasswords remembered, right?\n\n84\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.520\nSo, it's defining how we use our\npasswords, how we reuse passwords.\n\n85\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.390\nHow we formulate our passwords,\nwhat can we and can't we do?\n\n86\n00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.430\nNow, with these type of security policy,\nyou can adhere to a written policy.\n\n87\n00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.090\nMaybe, your written policy,\nthe paper policy,\n\n88\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.440\nthe bureaucracy that we're talking about,\nit's not so fun, says.\n\n89\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.630\n&gt;&gt; They should compliment each other.\n\n90\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.330\n&gt;&gt; They really should, so, we can have\nthings like that, where it's an electronic\n\n91\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.810\ntype policy that defines configurations\nthat help us adhere to the paper policy.\n\n92\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.650\nRight, we also have things for instance,\nthings that are specific to security.\n\n93\n00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.750\nFor instance if I,\n\n94\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.429\nlet's do this, we'll go ahead and\nlet me launch up.\n\n95\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.961\nFor instance, the local security policy,\nso, I can do things like secpol.msc and\n\n96\n00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.553\nwhen I launch this,\nnotice this is my local security policy.\n\n97\n00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:24.160\nWell, how does this differ from\nthings like group policies?\n\n98\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.870\nWell not much, one of the big differences\nhere, is that the local security policy\n\n99\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.420\nonly applies to this local machine, versus\na group policy, a domain based group\n\n100\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.040\npolicy that applies to every computer,\npotentially within the domain.\n\n101\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.210\nLocal security policies says,\nhey you know what?\n\n102\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.820\nLet's take that group policy, and let's\npull out the security-centric settings and\n\n103\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.400\nwe'll put them in here,\nright in one location.\n\n104\n00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.650\nSo, you can define things like,\nhow the firewall is going to interact.\n\n105\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.490\nWhat's your network location gonna be,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.000\nDefining firewall settings\nwithin the profile,\n\n107\n00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.445\nthings like your public key,\nencrypt EFS, data protection.\n\n108\n00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:03.060\nSo, you can see that we can set\nthings like security policies\n\n109\n00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.350\nthrough simple configurations like this.\n\n110\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.558\nSecurity policies are very,\nvery important because like I said, or\n\n111\n00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:12.450\nactually like Cherokee said,\nthey compliment each other, right.\n\n112\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.670\nI adhere to a corporate security policy\n\n113\n00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.600\nby using more of these electronic\ntype policies, as well.\n\n114\n00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.550\nAll right, so, that's an example of some\ntypes of policies that we might have.\n\n115\n00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.800\nThe other thing that you might have,\n\n116\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.170\nis you might have things like for\ninstance, network policies.\n\n117\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.180\nNow, with network policies, they're\na little bit different in well, and\n\n118\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.310\nthey can't be different, right?\n\n119\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.770\nThey can do a lot of things, as well.\n\n120\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.580\nSo, let's go ahead and, what we're gonna\ndo, let's check out network policies.\n\n121\n00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.250\nAll right, here on my server here, we'll\ngo ahead and we'll launch, for instance,\n\n122\n00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.170\nMPS, in this case,\nI'm using this as our example.\n\n123\n00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.490\nAnd this is the network policy server.\n\n124\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.120\nAnd once the snap in loads,\n\n125\n00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.630\nyou'll see that we can do things like,\nwhen it comes to network policy like for\n\n126\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.200\ninstance, designate who is authorized\nto connect to the network.\n\n127\n00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.050\nSometimes these network policies\ncan perform things like for\n\n128\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.280\ninstance authorization and authentication.\n\n129\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.243\nWe could do things which\nis kinda interesting here,\n\n130\n00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:10.290\nis we could couple these things with for\ninstance like health policies, right.\n\n131\n00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.471\nWhen we looked at network access control,\nremember,\n\n132\n00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:18.036\nwe were doing DHCP NAP enforcement,\nnetwork access protection, that said,\n\n133\n00:07:18.036 --> 00:07:20.470\nyou have to have your firewall turned on.\n\n134\n00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.910\nIf you remember, it had to, and\n\n135\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.510\nif the firewall was turned off,\nyou couldn't even join the network, right.\n\n136\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.330\nSo, not only authorization,\nauthorization can be conditional, right,\n\n137\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.770\nwe have things like conditions and\nconstraints.\n\n138\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.330\nAnd again, it's really specific to\nthe vendor, we just happen to be using\n\n139\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.230\nWindows server box here, so,\nit's Windows based environment.\n\n140\n00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.667\nBut for instance, if I look at,\nlet's take one network policy,\n\n141\n00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:46.745\nwe're just gonna bring a random one up\nhere and kinda look at it's property.\n\n142\n00:07:46.745 --> 00:07:52.224\nRight, so, you'll notice that inside\nof this network policy here, right?\n\n143\n00:07:52.224 --> 00:07:55.126\nAnd let me also show you this.\n\n144\n00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:56.346\nLook what it tells us.\n\n145\n00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:59.213\nNetwork policies allow you to designate\nwho's authorized to connect to\n\n146\n00:07:59.213 --> 00:07:59.830\nyour network.\n\n147\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.590\nAnd the circumstances under which\nthey're allowed to connect, right?\n\n148\n00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.360\nIt's one of the reasons we\nuse these network policies.\n\n149\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.170\nAnd you can see that well,\nwhat does it say?\n\n150\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.060\nThe policy for our purposes here,\npolicies enabled, right.\n\n151\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.500\nWhat's the access permission?\n\n152\n00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.970\nNotice that this network policy in\nthis case is granting access, right.\n\n153\n00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.480\nAnd then some other things,\nwhat type of server.\n\n154\n00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.390\nIn this case,\nwe're doing DHCP NAP enforcement,\n\n155\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.970\nthe network access server's gonna be DHCP.\n\n156\n00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.410\nSo those are some of the attributes.\n\n157\n00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.260\nBut what about things like conditions and\nconstraints?\n\n158\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.620\nWell, conditions are kind of interesting,\nbecause in this case,\n\n159\n00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.510\na condition is when we look\nat the conditions, right?\n\n160\n00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.740\nConditions are something that needs\nto be met, but if they're not met,\n\n161\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.740\nwe don't automatically reject\nthe connection, right?\n\n162\n00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.820\nFor instance, a connection says in this\ncase, you need to be NAP compliant, right?\n\n163\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.690\nIf you were not NAP compliant, right?\n\n164\n00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.280\nYou didn't have your\nfirewall turned on and\n\n165\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.840\nwe automatically rejected your connection,\nwell, that's not really good, right?\n\n166\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.860\nIf we said you had to turn your firewall\non and we automatically rejected you cuz\n\n167\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.350\nyou didn't have the firewall on, well,\nyou don't connect to the network.\n\n168\n00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.410\nBut in this case, we want you to\nbe able to remediate, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.310\nThe other thing too is that we can\nhave multiple conditions here.\n\n170\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.420\nIf I don't meet this condition,\ncould be another condition like so for\n\n171\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.930\ninstance, I could say,\n\n172\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.390\nI can add another condition that says\nit's gonna be a Windows group, right?\n\n173\n00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:29.070\nAnd we can look in here and\nI could add, and you know what?\n\n174\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.410\nIt's not gonna add because it's not gonna\nreach out to the domain controllers, so\n\n175\n00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.710\nthere's probably,\nwe should cancel this out.\n\n176\n00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.530\nBut I can add another condition.\n\n177\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.550\nWhen I add that second condition,\nit means okay, not NAP compliant.\n\n178\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.450\nActually, it is connecting.\n\n179\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.120\nBut we'll just go ahead and\nshut this down.\n\n180\n00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.320\nI could add another condition.\n\n181\n00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:50.618\nIf you don't meet the condition,\nyou're not instantly rejected.\n\n182\n00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:53.440\nWhat it's gonna do in this case is\nit'll go to the next condition.\n\n183\n00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.440\nAnd see, does this connection.\n\n184\n00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.670\nDoes it meet that condition?\n\n185\n00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.840\nSo keep in mind in this case, conditions\ndon't automatically mean that your\n\n186\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.750\nconnection is gonna be rejected\nif you don't meet the condition.\n\n187\n00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.920\nIt's gonna keep processing these\nadditional conditions until it\n\n188\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.970\nfinds something that matches the condition\nthat's necessary to connect.\n\n189\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.190\nThe other thing that we have are for\n\n190\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.580\ninstance constraints,\nnow this is important.\n\n191\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.060\nKeep in mind that when we have\nconstraints, constraints are different in\n\n192\n00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.780\nconditions in the fact that\nif I don't meet a constraint,\n\n193\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.870\nwe're gonna get rejected, right.\n\n194\n00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:30.150\nSo let's say that the condition says you\nneed to have a health policy, right.\n\n195\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.400\nAnd you need to be compliant with whatever\nthe health policy says, dictates, right.\n\n196\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.320\nBut I don't meet that.\n\n197\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.500\nBut it also says okay,\nyou need to be part of the routing or\n\n198\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.770\nremote access group, right?\n\n199\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.300\nSo it'll process that and\nif I'm part of the routing and\n\n200\n00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.740\nremote group,\nI didn't meet the first condition.\n\n201\n00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.130\nIt skipped down to the next one.\n\n202\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.090\nIt sees that I'm a part of the routing and\nremote access group.\n\n203\n00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.270\nWell, I've met that condition.\n\n204\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.310\nNow we go to the constraints,\nright, the next portion.\n\n205\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:02.200\nNow, what if it says the constraint, says\nyou have to use MS Chat version 2, right?\n\n206\n00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.720\nAnd for whatever reason,\nI'm not using MS Chat version 2 for\n\n207\n00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.099\nmy authentication, I'm using MS Chat.\n\n208\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.810\nHere's where the difference\nis in the constraints.\n\n209\n00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.700\nConstraints say if you don't meet\nthe constraint, the connection's rejected.\n\n210\n00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.070\nSo you have to pay attention\ninto your network policies.\n\n211\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.290\nAnd again, this tends to be a little\nvendor specific on this one, but\n\n212\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.890\nthey're all different types of network\npolicies that you can set, right?\n\n213\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:27.210\nWe can set additional settings\nhere as well, right for\n\n214\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.310\ninstance we can do things like encryption,\nIP settings.\n\n215\n00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.120\nRight, we can set the level of encryption\nand encryption strength, right?\n\n216\n00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.720\nSo you can define all different\nparameters when it comes to something\n\n217\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.160\nlike a network policy.\n\n218\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.720\nIt is important to just make sure\n\n219\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.260\nthat when you're implementing your network\npolicies that you're paying attention to.\n\n220\n00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.940\nAgain, in this case things like\nconstraints, conditions, your settings,\n\n221\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:52.190\nmake sure that you pay attention to\nwhatever the vendors specifics are.\n\n222\n00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.740\nAnd even following things like\nadhering to best practices,\n\n223\n00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.840\nthere's a lot of vendor\ndocumentation out there that show\n\n224\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.260\nyou appropriate ways that you\nshould be implementing these.\n\n225\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.490\nAll right.\n\n226\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.610\nNow the other thing that they call\nout that's kind of interesting.\n\n227\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:12.070\nThey call out things like for\ninstance, standard business documents.\n\n228\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.890\nNow when we talk about standard business\ndocuments, there's quite a few out here.\n\n229\n00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.150\nAnd this is where we get a little bit\nboring with some of the terms, but\n\n230\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.150\nyou need to know what these terms are.\n\n231\n00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.610\nSo the very first one they call out,\n\n232\n00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.490\nthey call out what's known as\na service level agreement.\n\n233\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.740\nA service level agreement when you look at\nit, what it does is it defines the minimum\n\n234\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:37.150\nacceptable level of performance\ntypically between some kind of provider.\n\n235\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.530\nAnd some kind of end user, right?\n\n236\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.266\nFor instance, if you have an ISP, right?\n\n237\n00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:43.475\nAn ISP-\n&gt;&gt; An unnamed ISP.\n\n238\n00:12:43.475 --> 00:12:44.310\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,\n\n239\n00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.740\nI should be careful with that one.\n\n240\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:46.880\nLet's say you have an ISP.\n\n241\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.405\nAny local Internet service provider\nthat you guys have in the region that\n\n242\n00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:53.193\nyou're watching, right?\n\n243\n00:12:53.193 --> 00:12:55.393\nWhen you get your Internet connection,\n\n244\n00:12:55.393 --> 00:13:00.580\nyou can typically go up to some companies\nwebsite and you can find what the SLA is.\n\n245\n00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.600\nNow what that SLA,\nthat service level agreement,\n\n246\n00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.300\nwhat it's doing is it's defining what\nis the level of performance that\n\n247\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.000\nyou as an end user should have,\nright, they should give you.\n\n248\n00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.290\nThink about the cloud,\nwe talk about high availability.\n\n249\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:20.580\nA lot of stuff is in the cloud today, so\nwhen you have a cloud provider, right?\n\n250\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.300\nThe cloud provider could\ngives you an SLA that says,\n\n251\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.060\nhow close to high availability do you get,\nright?\n\n252\n00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.682\nHigh availability, about the highest\navailability that you can get is what's\n\n253\n00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:31.042\nknown as five nines, right?\n\n254\n00:13:31.042 --> 00:13:35.900\n99.999% up time and Cherokee,\ndo you remember how many minutes is it?\n\n255\n00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:36.690\nJust under five?\n\n256\n00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.080\n&gt;&gt; Five?\nAnd I think five minutes, five seconds.\n\n257\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.\n\n258\n00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.740\nSo think about that.\n\n259\n00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.180\nYou're service level\nagreement says in one year,\n\n260\n00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.730\nyou're gonna have no more than let's\nsay five minutes in changed down time.\n\n261\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.830\nOr not have access to your information.\n\n262\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.080\nThat's a pretty hefty\nservice level agreement.\n\n263\n00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.280\nNot a lot of cloud providers\nare gonna give you that, right.\n\n264\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.870\nBut if you look at things like Amazon,\nyou look at Azure out there, you might see\n\n265\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:09.463\nthat the service level agreement says\nyou're gonna have 99.95% uptime, right.\n\n266\n00:14:09.463 --> 00:14:13.140\nAnd they need to make sure\nthat they adhere to that, why?\n\n267\n00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:19.390\nCuz when it comes to the contract,\nthey might end up having to compensate you\n\n268\n00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.990\nwhen you don't have access to the service\nthat their providing or your information.\n\n269\n00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, so what is defined\nhere, is it one end, is it both ends of\n\n270\n00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.975\nthe spectrum, I mean both parties here,\ndo we have an example we can look at?\n\n271\n00:14:30.975 --> 00:14:32.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no.\n\n272\n00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:37.720\nAnd let me tell you one in which you might\nhave, in your service level agreement,\n\n273\n00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.420\nboth sides of the agreement might have\nto have certain responsibilities.\n\n274\n00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.974\nFor instance, let's say you're in AWS.\n\n275\n00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:47.939\nYou're out there in the cloud, you're\ndealing with Amazon web services, right.\n\n276\n00:14:47.939 --> 00:14:49.560\nAnd you're talking about security, right.\n\n277\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.250\nThere's a portion of their network\nthey're responsible for securing.\n\n278\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.900\nHowever, there's a portion of the\nconfiguration like the operating systems\n\n279\n00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.890\nand the security techniques that they\ngive you that you're gonna be responsible\n\n280\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.430\nfor securing.\n\n281\n00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.680\nSo you might see in that situation\nwhere a service level agreement says,\n\n282\n00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.060\nyou have a responsibility just as much\nas the provider has a responsibility.\n\n283\n00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.680\nIn other service level agreements,\nit really might just be the provider.\n\n284\n00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.730\nThat as their customer,\n\n285\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.850\nthey have a responsibility to give\nyou an adequate level of performance.\n\n286\n00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.350\nBefore there's maybe some\nmonetary compensation for\n\n287\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.210\nnot performing what they say\nthey're gonna be performing.\n\n288\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.990\nIn fact,\nI just got an example here of a random and\n\n289\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.400\nyou can see it's kind of old\nservice level agreement.\n\n290\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.061\nIn this one here, you can see it defines\nthe version, the date, company name,\n\n291\n00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:40.182\nservice provider, right, and\nwho signs it, and this is important.\n\n292\n00:15:40.182 --> 00:15:44.600\nAnd it's also important for\nboth sides of the agreement or\n\n293\n00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.576\nboth sides of this SLA to\nestablish this agreement.\n\n294\n00:15:48.576 --> 00:15:51.972\nNow Cherokee, I can tell you that this\nis really just an example of an SLA.\n\n295\n00:15:51.972 --> 00:15:56.987\nThere are many different attributes of\nan SLA that's gonna be customized and\n\n296\n00:15:56.987 --> 00:16:01.000\nconfigured to your company's needs,\nand your company's,\n\n297\n00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.330\nwhatever the service provider is.\n\n298\n00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.630\nIt could be an end user, I almost said\nend point, it could be an end user,\n\n299\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.010\nit could be an entire company.\n\n300\n00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.120\nBut they're gonna be customized, just\nremember for the exam, when it comes to\n\n301\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.540\na service level agreement,\nthis is just defining the acceptable\n\n302\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.640\nminimum level of performance, that\na provider has to give to an end user.\n\n303\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.930\nNow the next one that they call out,\n\n304\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.720\nthey call out something known as\na memorandum of understanding.\n\n305\n00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.687\nWith the memorandum of understanding,\nthis is one of those documents that's,\n\n306\n00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:30.813\nit's not legally binding right?\n\n307\n00:16:30.813 --> 00:16:37.980\nIt's kind of like when we have two parties\nthat they've got a common goal right?\n\n308\n00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:43.400\nThey don't need a formal contract\nbecause that's a lot of work\n\n309\n00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.880\nto develop and draft up a formal contract,\nyou got to get a lot of lawyers involved.\n\n310\n00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.630\nMake sure that the speak is right if\nyou will, the lawyer-speak is right.\n\n311\n00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.750\nSo a memorandum of understanding\nis just typically,\n\n312\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.050\nwhere you have an agreement\nbetween maybe two companies.\n\n313\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.090\nAnd again they have some kind of end\ngoal that they're both striving for.\n\n314\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.370\nBut again it's not legally binding in\nfact, I've gotta kind of an example up\n\n315\n00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.520\nhere, of an MOU there,\na memorandum of understanding.\n\n316\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.740\nAnd you can see, this memorandum of\nunderstanding is entered into by and\n\n317\n00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.340\nbetween and you can see the two\ndifferent parties here.\n\n318\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:24.920\nPurpose, the term of the MOU,\nthe responsibility, even though it's not\n\n319\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.470\nlegally binding let's say Cherokee\nowns a company that creates toys.\n\n320\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.870\nI have a company that creates toy parts.\n\n321\n00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.373\nWe don't want a legally binding contract\nbut we're working towards a common goal.\n\n322\n00:17:35.373 --> 00:17:38.840\nWe wanna make sure that well,\nprofits increase, right?\n\n323\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.420\nSo we have to figure out,\nwhat's the responsibility of her company,\n\n324\n00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.570\nwhat's the responsibility of my company?\n\n325\n00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.850\nAnd it really could be that the MOU,\nor the memorandum of understanding,\n\n326\n00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.190\nis the precursor to the actual,\nformal contract.\n\n327\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.480\nAnd again, these are all,\nthere's all different types,\n\n328\n00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.849\nthis is just a sample of one, if you will.\n\n329\n00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:03.260\nNow the next one that we have is something\nknown as a statement of work, all right?\n\n330\n00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.674\nAn SOW, and it's kinda interesting,\nwhen we talk about statement of work.\n\n331\n00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:12.387\nThis is really just a contract\nthat defines how a specific task,\n\n332\n00:18:12.387 --> 00:18:14.569\nhow is gonna be implemented,\n\n333\n00:18:14.569 --> 00:18:20.000\nhow do we measure the success of this\nproject or task that we're gonna do.\n\n334\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.300\nAnd defining things like,\nhow it's laid out,\n\n335\n00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.610\nthe procedures that you have to implement.\n\n336\n00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:30.850\nNow the statement of work can be\na part of a larger documentation and\n\n337\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.820\nthis is really one of the last ones here.\n\n338\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.360\nAnd that is something known as a master\nservice agreement, an MSA if you will.\n\n339\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.712\nWith the Master Service Agreement\nright this\n\n340\n00:18:41.712 --> 00:18:46.458\nis an overall formal binding\ncontract between two parties right?\n\n341\n00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:50.561\nIt dictates the responsibility on both\nsides, you can have multiple in fact,\n\n342\n00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:54.414\nCherokee and I were talking about this\nbefore we started the the episode,\n\n343\n00:18:54.414 --> 00:18:57.290\nthat you can have multiple\nstatement of work, right?\n\n344\n00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.740\nThe master citement agreement\ncould have multiple things that\n\n345\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.770\neach party's responsible for.\n\n346\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.670\nAnd under that, you could have multiple\nstatements of work, you could have things\n\n347\n00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.900\nlike multiple SLA's under it,\nand this is your formal contract.\n\n348\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.790\nNow the good thing about a master site\nagreement, and having this in placed prior\n\n349\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:20.840\nto going into the agreement is\nbecause it takes a lot of work, right.\n\n350\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.300\nSo for instance, I got an example\nof a master service agreement here.\n\n351\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.176\nYou can see things like approved vendors,\nwork orders, the labor, the equipment.\n\n352\n00:19:29.176 --> 00:19:32.630\nAnd you notice the labor, equipment,\nmaterials, supplies and services.\n\n353\n00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.850\nEach one of these, right,\n\n354\n00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.670\ncould have multiple avenues that we have\nindividual statements of work for, right?\n\n355\n00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.388\nIf it's different types of equipment,\nmaybe it's cloud equipment, right?\n\n356\n00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:43.031\nAnd then cloud equipment,\n\n357\n00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:47.540\nwe're gonna have some kind of SLA that\nthe cloud provider has provided us.\n\n358\n00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.550\nAnd that could be part of\nour master side agreement so\n\n359\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.660\nagain, remember these documents, right?\n\n360\n00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.160\nRemember the SLA, service level agreement.\n\n361\n00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.280\nKeep in mind that the service level\nagreement is just a contract that says\n\n362\n00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.120\nif you're getting provided a service,\n\n363\n00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.450\nwhat is the minimum level of\nperformance that they need to provide?\n\n364\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.190\nMemorandum of understanding, keep in mind\nwith the memorandum of understanding,\n\n365\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.930\nit is agreement between two parties,\nbut it isn't legally binding.\n\n366\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.760\nWhat else, the statement of work, right?\n\n367\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.500\nThat defines the policies and\nthe procedures to get a specific task or\n\n368\n00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.840\nproject done and how it's going to be\ndone as well as how do we know it's done.\n\n369\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.610\nSo how do we define success of what,\nthe project might be.\n\n370\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.300\nAnd then last but not least,\n\n371\n00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.940\nwe have the formalized statement\nthat requires a lot of planning.\n\n372\n00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.400\nMost likely you're gonna get your\nlawyers involved, right, and\n\n373\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.780\nthat's the master side agreement.\n\n374\n00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.550\nAnd that can have multiple of these other\nstandard business documents all wrapped up\n\n375\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.820\nunder one umbrella term.\n\n376\n00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:46.850\nNot the most fun stuff,\n\n377\n00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.600\nbut it's definitely something you might\nsee on the exam, so it is something that\n\n378\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.100\nyou're gonna wanna know before you\ntake your net+ certification exam.\n\n379\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Wes.\n\n380\n00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.240\nNow, even if you're not in-charge\nof creating these documents.\n\n381\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.890\nUsually an IT, you're at least\ninvolved in enforcing those and\n\n382\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.090\nenforcing those policies.\n\n383\n00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.000\nSo thank you for taking the time to\nexplain that, and thank you ladies and\n\n384\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.310\ngentlemen for joining us today.\n\n385\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.927\nBut stay tuned we do have\nmore Netplus headed your way.\n\n386\n00:21:11.927 --> 00:21:14.930\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off as\nyour show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n387\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:15.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n388\n00:21:15.700

00:00:17.280\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.850\nIn this episode, we'll be summarizing\nvarious types of safety practices.\n\n8\n00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.123\nWith us today we have\nMr Wes Bryan in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.840\nThank you for joining us, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.223\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Cherokee.\nThanks for having me here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:30.756\nAs always great to be with the ITPro.TV\ncrew, that's right we're gonna be looking\n\n12\n00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:33.987\nat some of the techniques and some of\nthe things you should be aware of, when it\n\n13\n00:00:33.987 --> 00:00:37.400\ncomes to being inside of your network\nenvironment and keeping yourselves safe.\n\n14\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.043\nEspecially when it comes to being around\nelectricity and the equipment too.\n\n15\n00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:44.123\nSome of the things that they talk\nabout when we first jump in here.\n\n16\n00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:47.798\nThey talk about electrical safety and\nI can tell you I can't stress this enough.\n\n17\n00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:51.127\nAnd I know that I've said this in\nother classes that I've taught or\n\n18\n00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:52.323\nother courses as well.\n\n19\n00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:56.400\nI know enough about electricity to\nlet the professionals handle it.\n\n20\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.040\nRemember that when it comes to\nany kind of electrical safety,\n\n21\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.600\nwork within your skill set.\n\n22\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.222\nDon't try to work outside of your\nskill set because electricity,\n\n23\n00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:06.457\nit's obvious right?\n\n24\n00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:07.830\nIt can kill you.\n\n25\n00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.971\nAnd it can kill you very quickly.\n\n26\n00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:12.600\nSo it's not something that we really\nwant to just be taking lightly.\n\n27\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.272\nIf you're working with a workstation,\nwe're talking 110, 120 if you will,\n\n28\n00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:18.218\nhowever you wanna call\nit here in the states.\n\n29\n00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:22.730\nProbably 220,\n240 over in European countries.\n\n30\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.740\nBut not a lot of power,\nnot a lot of amperage there,\n\n31\n00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.350\ncould still definitely reach out and\ngrab you, but man,\n\n32\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280\nwhen you start moving into things like\ndata centers and network closets,\n\n33\n00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.820\nyou can get up to some very,\nvery high voltage, high amperage.\n\n34\n00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.820\nAnd it can cause a problem.\n\n35\n00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.453\nAnd one of the things that they\ntalk about is grounding, right.\n\n36\n00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:44.280\nOur network devices today\nare pretty much grounded.\n\n37\n00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.230\nThe device themselves do the grounding.\n\n38\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.720\nRemember that your server\nclosets need a path to ground.\n\n39\n00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.630\nWe do this to shunt the electrical\nnoise that's within the system.\n\n40\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.050\nMaking sure that it has\nthat path to earth there,\n\n41\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.980\nwhich essentially is\nwhat grounding is right.\n\n42\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.436\nIt gives us a path to earth and\nit takes any of the excess signal,\n\n43\n00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:07.429\nthe unwanted electricity, that is in\na line, and it shunts it to earth.\n\n44\n00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.952\nNow if you're gonna be following these\nguide lines, there's different guidelines\n\n45\n00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:16.537\nout there, you have things like regulatory\nbody's like OSHA the Occupational Safety\n\n46\n00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:20.280\nand Health Administration,\nyou have VENDOR documentation as well.\n\n47\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.360\nIn fact let me give you an example here.\n\n48\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.230\nI wanna head in the, just brought\na Google search engine here, and\n\n49\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.250\nwe've got electrical grounding procedures.\n\n50\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.180\nAnd if I wanna find some\nregulations on this,\n\n51\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.600\nsome best practices if you will, you'll\nsee that OSHA has something right here.\n\n52\n00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.040\nYou got documentation for\nelectrical implementations here.\n\n53\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.950\nAnd you can always open this up, right?\n\n54\n00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.660\nAnd you can find guidelines like this.\n\n55\n00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.570\nAgain, these are for\nthe electricians, right?\n\n56\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.730\nOne the great things is,\na lot of times, we don't,\n\n57\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.860\nunless we're building the data center,\nor if we're building the network closet,\n\n58\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040\na lot of times we don't have to worry\nabout it, but you need to be aware that\n\n59\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.340\nyour devices, your network equipment\ndoesn't run on alternating current, right?\n\n60\n00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.390\nSo that's one of the reasons\nwe definitely need the ground.\n\n61\n00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.370\nVendor documentation,\ntoo for network closets.\n\n62\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.200\nI got one here for Cisco.\n\n63\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.442\nCisco's got some good information for\nbest practices for\n\n64\n00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.191\nthe installation of\ntheir products as well.\n\n65\n00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:21.190\nAnd if you open up one of these PDFs here\nyou can get a lot of good information.\n\n66\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.564\nA lot of detailed information,\na lot of definitions, right.\n\n67\n00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:26.397\nA lot of specifications, and\nyou can see things like for\n\n68\n00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:30.436\ninstance maintenance schedules, and\nthe best practices in access control and\n\n69\n00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:33.278\nall kinds of stuff for\nyour data networking equipment.\n\n70\n00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.116\nSo again, keep in mind,\n\n71\n00:03:35.116 --> 00:03:41.360\nfollow whatever your local regulatory\nlaws are, it could be state laws.\n\n72\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.240\nRemember to let\nthe electricians do this right.\n\n73\n00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.920\nIf you don't have an electrical degree,\nyou really shouldn't be dealing with\n\n74\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.050\nthe electricity and\nespecially the electrical schematics and\n\n75\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.590\nwiring, do leave that\nto the professionals.\n\n76\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.720\nNow there's another form of electricity\nthat we have to worry about as well and\n\n77\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.290\nthat's something that we can do inside of\njust about any kinda computing environment\n\n78\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.840\nand they call out things like\nelectrostatic discharge, right?\n\n79\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.885\nESD Now if you are coming over from A+,\nyou probably remember this,\n\n80\n00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.628\nwe talked about this in A+ but\n\n81\n00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:15.690\nmaybe this is the first certification\nexam that you are trying for.\n\n82\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.014\nAnd you don't have that information, so\nwe can kinda talk about it here, right.\n\n83\n00:04:19.014 --> 00:04:22.740\nWhat is electrostatic discharge, right?\n\n84\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.729\nWell that's when you have a transfer\nof electrical charge from one body to\n\n85\n00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.101\nthe other, right?\n\n86\n00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:33.960\nAnd as far as humans go, a lot of\ntimes this doesn't bother us, right?\n\n87\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.980\nIf it's a cold day and I reach out,\nand I go to shake Cherokee's hand,\n\n88\n00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.070\nI might zap her or she'll zap me.\n\n89\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.440\nWe feel that, right?\n\n90\n00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.920\nWell, here's the thing.\n\n91\n00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.570\nThat's usually when we feel it.\n\n92\n00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.010\nSometimes when we feel static electricity,\nright,\n\n93\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.970\nthe hair on the back of\nyour neck will stand up.\n\n94\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.798\nOr you probably once or twice maybe rubbed\na balloon on like wool or something,\n\n95\n00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:55.643\nyou put it by the hair on your arms and\nit starts to stand up.\n\n96\n00:04:55.643 --> 00:04:59.610\nLet me give you some interesting\ninformation about that.\n\n97\n00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.380\nWhen you start to feel\nelectrostatic discharge,\n\n98\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.110\nyou're somewhere between two and 1,000\nvolts that is in your body currently.\n\n99\n00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.610\nWhen you arc out, and you see a spark.\n\n100\n00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.170\nYou're between 20 and 30, 000 volts.\n\n101\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.710\nRight now there's not a lot of amperage in\nit, that's why it doesn't kill us right.\n\n102\n00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.350\nSo there's not a lot of amperage,\nbut if you look at circuitry and\n\n103\n00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.950\nany kind of computer circuitry it only\ntakes about 10 volts of electricity,\n\n104\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.990\nelectrical voltage to completely\nruin electrical circuitry.\n\n105\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.630\nSo I want you to think about it now.\n\n106\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.470\nStep back when I said 2000 Volts.\n\n107\n00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.070\nBy the time you can feel the static\nelectricity in your body,\n\n108\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.720\nyou're already 300 times past what it took\nto damage certain sensitive components\n\n109\n00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.220\nwithin motherboards,\nwithin networking equipment.\n\n110\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.300\nSo keep in mind,\nwith electrostatic discharge\n\n111\n00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.540\nit's not about what you can feel that's\ndamaging to the components, right?\n\n112\n00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.265\nIt's about what you can't feel\nthat's damaging to the components.\n\n113\n00:05:52.265 --> 00:05:55.530\nSo, we need to take preventive steps,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.540\nPreventive measures use different\npreventive techniques to ensure\n\n115\n00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.990\nthat we don't have\nelectrostatic discharge.\n\n116\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Okay Wes, so what type of\ntechniques can we use to reduce ESD?\n\n117\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.530\n&gt;&gt; Well one of the basic things\nthat we can do is use like for\n\n118\n00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.280\ninstance, ESD risk traps.\n\n119\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.420\nI actually got a little bit of a list here\nand we're gonna go shopping today here.\n\n120\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.296\n[LAUGH] We're gonna look at some of these\nbecause there are a lot of different\n\n121\n00:06:18.296 --> 00:06:21.999\nthings that you can do to prevent\nelectrostatic discharge inside of your\n\n122\n00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.560\nsystems.\n\n123\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.390\nOne of the first things they talk about\nare things like ESD Wrist Straps, right?\n\n124\n00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.127\nLittle strap goes around your hand,\nusually has a little clip at the end\n\n125\n00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:33.317\nof the wire that you Can ground\nthe inside of a computer case.\n\n126\n00:06:33.317 --> 00:06:37.407\nYou find an unpainted portion of\nlike if you got like for instance,\n\n127\n00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:42.079\na rack mount server, you can clip it to\nthe bare metal portion of the inside of\n\n128\n00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:44.820\nthe server if you have to get into it.\n\n129\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.520\nOther things that they have\nare things like ESD Ankle Straps.\n\n130\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.480\nIn fact, let's go ahead, and I think I\nstill got my documentation open here.\n\n131\n00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.830\nWe'll go ahead and shut that down.\n\n132\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.090\nLet's do a little bit of shopping here.\n\n133\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.490\nWe'll do ESD protection and\nwe'll just shop here on Google here.\n\n134\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.202\nThat'll make it a little bit easier.\n\n135\n00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:06.590\nThis right here, this first one, let me\ntell you this is called an ESD smock.\n\n136\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.231\nA ESD smock is where they're so worried\nabout electrostatic discharge that they\n\n137\n00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:14.508\ndon't want your clothes giving\noff any bit of charge, so\n\n138\n00:07:14.508 --> 00:07:16.298\nyou wear the smock around you.\n\n139\n00:07:16.298 --> 00:07:20.524\nAnd what it's supposed to do is keep\nthings like from your clothes being what\n\n140\n00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:23.120\nare called known charge generators.\n\n141\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.740\n&gt;&gt; So I actually worked at a printed\ncircuit board manufacturing company and\n\n142\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.720\nwe had to wear this.\n\n143\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.870\nEveryone had to wear these.\n\n144\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.990\nWe used ESD mats.\n\n145\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.660\nWe had the bracelets.\n\n146\n00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.310\nNo carpeting on the production floors,\nso extreme precaution here.\n\n147\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.697\n&gt;&gt; So your company just went all\nin with no charge generators.\n\n148\n00:07:39.697 --> 00:07:41.660\nWe have to make sure.\n\n149\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.820\nAnd you see that a lot in\nthings like clean rooms too.\n\n150\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.080\nLike when you see commercials and\nit's not quite that serious.\n\n151\n00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.229\nWhat's more serious in a clean room cuz\neven dust particles you have to worry\n\n152\n00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:50.729\nabout too.\n\n153\n00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:54.697\nSo Smocks, you can have those definitely\nand again keep in mind that's when\n\n154\n00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:57.983\nthey don't even want your clothes\nbeing a charge generator and\n\n155\n00:07:57.983 --> 00:07:59.848\ngiving electrostatic discharge.\n\n156\n00:07:59.848 --> 00:08:03.091\nNow the next one here that I\nwas wanting to talk about About\n\n157\n00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:05.397\nit is this ESDE Anti Static Wrist Strap.\n\n158\n00:08:05.397 --> 00:08:07.025\nYou can see one of these right here.\n\n159\n00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:12.440\nFor instance, you can see that it's just\na little strap that goes around your hand.\n\n160\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.220\nIts got a little bare piece of metal here.\n\n161\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.280\nIt makes contact with your skin, and then\nyou can see that it has this cable, right?\n\n162\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.950\nAnd the cable just kind of clips\non to a bare portion of metal and\n\n163\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.750\nit just takes that electrical static,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.290\nAnd it just dissipates or\ndischarges it down into the frame or\n\n165\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.430\nthe chassis of the computer.\n\n166\n00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.030\nNow you also have ankle straps as well.\n\n167\n00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.330\nNow do you have to wear these?\n\n168\n00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.680\nWell, you might have to wear them\nif you're doing warranty work or\n\n169\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.170\nlike you're working for a company like\nCherokee worked, it might be part of-\n\n170\n00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.130\n&gt;&gt; Or shackled to your desk.\n\n171\n00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.921\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it might be part-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n172\n00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.096\n&gt;&gt; Of the policy, but\n\n173\n00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:45.890\nsome people don't even wear these, right?\n\n174\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.570\nSome people, what they do is they'll\ntouch the inside of the case and\n\n175\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.530\nthat'll basically discharge\nany of that electricity\n\n176\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:54.780\nout of their body into the case.\n\n177\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.530\nBut you have to keep in mind,\nif you're still walking around, well,\n\n178\n00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.240\nyou're gonna generate charge,\nright, back in your body.\n\n179\n00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.040\nSo, that's one of the good\nthings about the strap is that\n\n180\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.210\nyou're constantly grounded.\n\n181\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.990\nAnd it is definitely important, especially\nwhen you're talking about things like\n\n182\n00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.210\nmemory banks, when you're talking about\nmotherboards, circuitry or chips on\n\n183\n00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.830\nthe motherboards, surface mount devices,\nthat are on those motherboards as well.\n\n184\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.650\nAnd, like I said, servers as well.\n\n185\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.260\nYour networking devices too.\n\n186\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.540\nSome of the other things\nwe need to consider,\n\n187\n00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.130\nwe also have the Anti-static format,\nor Work Mat, excuse me, and\n\n188\n00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.130\nthis is usually a mat where you can\nactually take the cord from that strap.\n\n189\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.620\nYou can see sometimes what'll happen is,\nthey have different types of cords.\n\n190\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.450\nOne cord will have the little clip\non it to ground off to a case.\n\n191\n00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.990\nThe other one will have a little snap at\nthe end, and what it does is essentially,\n\n192\n00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.810\nyou can use a combination of\na electrically resistant mat.\n\n193\n00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.070\nSometimes, they're electrically resistant\nof up to like three million Ohms.\n\n194\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.100\nAnd it just increases the path and\nthen the resistance, right?\n\n195\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.640\nAnd you push that little snap, it snaps\nright onto the edge of the work mat and\n\n196\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.100\nyou're basically shunning the electricity\ndown to the table or bench itself.\n\n197\n00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.550\nThe other thing that we have too,\nanti-static bags, right?\n\n198\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.600\nLittle silver bags, the anti-static bags.\n\n199\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.040\nWhat they allow us to do is,\nbasically, store or transport\n\n200\n00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.190\ndifferent kinds of equipment that might\nbe sensitive to electrostatic discharge.\n\n201\n00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.110\nIf you buy things like hard drives,\nif you buy things like network adapters,\n\n202\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:29.260\nif you buy things like motherboards,\nthey'll be in huge ESD anti-static bags.\n\n203\n00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.110\nYou could see gloves as\nwell as entire kits too.\n\n204\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.740\nSo keep in mind that when it comes to\nelectrostatic discharge, it's not about\n\n205\n00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.390\nwhat you can feel that's really\ndetrimental to your computer circuitry,\n\n206\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.060\nit's more about what you can't\nfeel that is detrimental.\n\n207\n00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.950\nBecause if you could feel it you'd be\naware of it and you'd take precautions and\n\n208\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.014\npreventative measures to stay away from\nit, it's because you can't feel it.\n\n209\n00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:51.590\nAnd it's so\neasy to damage those components.\n\n210\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.290\n&gt;&gt; Now talking about office products\nthat you can purchase to go ahead and\n\n211\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:55.990\nprevent ESD.\n\n212\n00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.980\nWell, what can you remove to prevent ESD?\n\n213\n00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.306\nAlso things like jewelry as well, right?\n\n214\n00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:06.470\nPerfect conductors for that electricity\nthere, and also just loose jewelry and\n\n215\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.620\nloose clothing in general to get\nsnagged and hung up on things.\n\n216\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.600\nWorking in IT isn't always\nthe most super glamorous\n\n217\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.890\njob like I'd mentioned before, you kinda\nhave to dress for the occasion at times.\n\n218\n00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, like with\nyourself with the longer hair, too.\n\n219\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.330\nYou have to worry about that because\nyou just do not want things,\n\n220\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.690\nespecially with moving parts and stuff, if\nyou happen to have fans that are running.\n\n221\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.880\nSo definitely be mindful when you're\nworking around equipment that's open, that\n\n222\n00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.790\nyou need to either do servicing or you\nneed to replace some kind of component.\n\n223\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.360\nNormally, when you're replacing\ncomponents, know the power is off.\n\n224\n00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.100\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n225\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.460\nOther things that they talk about\ntoo are installation safety.\n\n226\n00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.130\nNow when it comes to installation safety,\nweight, right?\n\n227\n00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.500\nWeight is a factor.\n\n228\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.310\nSome people maybe look at a server and\nthey say that's a 1U server,\n\n229\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.730\nso it's not that big, it's probably\nnot going to be that heavy, right?\n\n230\n00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.560\nOr you see a 2U server, you think\nit's not gonna be that heavy, but\n\n231\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.230\nyou have to keep in mind that that server\ncould have 10 or 15 hard drives in it.\n\n232\n00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.060\nIt could have 60 something\nprocessors in it.\n\n233\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.540\nAnd if it's got 60 processors in it,\n\n234\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.160\nchances are its got 60 heat sinks on\ntop of every one of those processors.\n\n235\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.250\nSo you talk about redundant power\nadapters, you could have two,\n\n236\n00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.140\ncould have four power\nadapters in a server.\n\n237\n00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.010\nAnd what you have to think about is\nwhether you are lifting the server to put\n\n238\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.320\nit in a rack, or\nyou're actually taking it out of the rack,\n\n239\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.400\nyou always want to work with a partner,\nright?\n\n240\n00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.740\nWe want to exercise good\nlifting techniques,\n\n241\n00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.080\nbend at the knees,\nput it all in your lower back, right?\n\n242\n00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.522\n&gt;&gt; My exercise instructor, she always says\nyou would hover over a public toilet.\n\n243\n00:12:41.522 --> 00:12:44.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The other thing too,\n\n244\n00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.280\nthey talk about things like\nrack installation, right?\n\n245\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.060\nWhen you're installing your racks and\nyou start to load up your servers, right?\n\n246\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.710\nOr you start to load up\nthe racks in the server closet,\n\n247\n00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.590\nyou typically start with\nthe heaviest equipment first, right?\n\n248\n00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.600\nRacks get very top heavy very quick,\nright?\n\n249\n00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.390\nSo you always take your\nheavier equipment and\n\n250\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.470\nyou start stacking and populating a rack\nfrom the bottom to the top, right?\n\n251\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.000\nWe don't start at the top and\nwork out way to the bottom.\n\n252\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.320\nAgain, because of the fact\nthat it tends to be top-heavy.\n\n253\n00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.210\nPlacement, and\nthat goes along with placement.\n\n254\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.190\nWhere do I place the devices\nwithin the rack,\n\n255\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.070\nif we are doing a rack installation,\nright?\n\n256\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.557\nFor instance, if you got UPSs,\na lot of times your UPSs, right?\n\n257\n00:13:24.557 --> 00:13:28.914\n14, 15, 20 batteries in it\ndepending on how big the UPS is.\n\n258\n00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:30.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Typically you're gonna want them to sit\n\n259\n00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.270\non the bottom, right?\n\n260\n00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.500\nIf you have one of those 200 plus port\nswitches with a lot of blades in them,\n\n261\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.620\nyou're gonna want those\ntypically towards the bottom and\n\n262\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.920\nyou work your way all the way up to\nthe top to where you have maybe your 1U\n\n263\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.860\ndevices at the top of the rack.\n\n264\n00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.980\nSo, keep in mind that same thing with,\nfor instance, tool safety.\n\n265\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.400\nThe other thing when it comes to tool\nsafety is be aware of your environment.\n\n266\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.480\nThat's one of the best things that you can\ndo is just be aware of your environment\n\n267\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.000\nbefore you start working in it.\n\n268\n00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.840\nKind of do a, not really a reconnaissance\nor anything like that, but\n\n269\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.210\njust kinda survey the area, right?\n\n270\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.560\nKnow where you're working,\nknow where your tools are laying,\n\n271\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.610\ndon't just scatter them\nall over the place.\n\n272\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.090\nOne tool, if that's all you need,\n\n273\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.600\nthat should be the only thing\nyou have out at the time.\n\n274\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.490\nDon't do like Wes has done on some of his\nweekend hobbies where we've got tools\n\n275\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.040\neverywhere, and I can't find what I need.\n\n276\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.400\nBefore I know it I might\nbe tripping on something.\n\n277\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.970\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n278\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you want to be careful if you're\nusing any kind of magnetized tool sets,\n\n279\n00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.000\nand also make sure you're holding those\ntools by the rubber of plastic handles.\n\n280\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not a good idea.\n\n281\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.480\nYou might see some mechanic's\ntools that are very, very handy.\n\n282\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.940\nThey have the magnets in them.\n\n283\n00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.930\nAny kind of magnetic type of tool,\ndefinitely, I would agree.\n\n284\n00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.230\nDefinitely stay away with,\naway from, excuse me.\n\n285\n00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.990\nSome of the other things they call\nout are emergency procedures.\n\n286\n00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.980\nAnd these emergency procedures\nare more of just a common things.\n\n287\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.000\nKeep in mind that every\ncompany has to tailor make\n\n288\n00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.230\ntheir own emergency procedures to their\nbuilding, their building's layout,\n\n289\n00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.000\nyou should have a building plan that\nthoroughly lays out the building for you,\n\n290\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.610\nas well as things like, for\ninstance, fire escape plans.\n\n291\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.350\nYour emergency and\nsafety exits should be well lit.\n\n292\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.830\nThis is something that we had to do\nwhen we moved into our new building.\n\n293\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.040\nWe have to make sure that\nall the exits are covered.\n\n294\n00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.720\nWe had a fire Marshall come in here, and\nshe does the inspection and she makes sure\n\n295\n00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.160\nthat we are operating within the\nboundaries, or under the fire code, right?\n\n296\n00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.450\nSo we had to make sure that all of our\nsafety exits are really well lit and\n\n297\n00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.240\nthat they are there.\n\n298\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.640\nNow, they call out a couple\nof other things too.\n\n299\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.880\nWhich is kinda interesting in emergency\nprocedures, they call out two terms,\n\n300\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.110\nthey call out fail open and fail close.\n\n301\n00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.470\nThese terms are really kinda simplistic,\n\n302\n00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:44.330\ndon't think that they're\nanything highly technical here.\n\n303\n00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.570\nI'll start out with fail open.\n\n304\n00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.880\nFail open is a device that when an\nemergency happens, the device itself, or\n\n305\n00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.160\nsystem if you will,\ndoes not shut down during the emergency.\n\n306\n00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.814\nI'll give you an example, sometimes\nfire doors will fail close, right?\n\n307\n00:15:57.814 --> 00:16:01.080\nAnd fail close means that they're gonna\nclose you, they're gonna shut down,\n\n308\n00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.892\nthere's more to fail close than just that.\n\n309\n00:16:02.892 --> 00:16:08.673\nBut your exit points,\nwe don't want them to close down, right?\n\n310\n00:16:08.673 --> 00:16:10.028\nWe don't want them to lock down, right?\n\n311\n00:16:10.028 --> 00:16:10.904\nSo they'll fail open.\n\n312\n00:16:10.904 --> 00:16:15.494\nWhere at that point, the exiting\nof the building is more important.\n\n313\n00:16:15.494 --> 00:16:18.182\nThe safety of the people in\nthe building is more important\n\n314\n00:16:18.182 --> 00:16:22.280\nthan an authenticated door being closed,\ncuz we don't wanna let anybody in, right?\n\n315\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.640\nSo that'll be something that's fail open,\nthings like health care systems, right?\n\n316\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.844\nEmergency management systems, right?\n\n317\n00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:30.410\nWe keep them on, right?\n\n318\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.690\nFor instance, if you work for\na company that's in a hospital and\n\n319\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.190\nthey have some sort of emergency, they're\nnot gonna kick off life support, right?\n\n320\n00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.040\nThat's the far right side of it, but keep\nin mind, it gives you an example that some\n\n321\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.917\nsystems and devices will stay\non during emergency purposes.\n\n322\n00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:47.903\nUnlike other devices which\nwill fail closed, right?\n\n323\n00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:49.343\nAnd that's just the opposite\nside of the coin.\n\n324\n00:16:49.343 --> 00:16:51.793\nThat just means that the device\nis going to shut down-\n\n325\n00:16:51.793 --> 00:16:52.700\n&gt;&gt; The air conditioning.\n\n326\n00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, at the time of the emergency.\n\n327\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.406\nAnd it could be controlled\nvia things like software,\n\n328\n00:16:57.406 --> 00:16:59.611\nit should be physically shut down as well.\n\n329\n00:16:59.611 --> 00:17:03.260\nFor instance, if you have UPSs, right?\n\n330\n00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.008\nA UPS is a device that we use to\nfail close our servers, right?\n\n331\n00:17:07.008 --> 00:17:09.205\nWe want our servers to perform\na graceful shutdown, so\n\n332\n00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:12.358\nthat they don't have additional damage\nthat goes onto the data in case there is\n\n333\n00:17:12.358 --> 00:17:13.958\nsome additional emergency like that.\n\n334\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:19.706\nSo just to understand the difference\nbetween fail open and fail closed.\n\n335\n00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:24.620\nSome of the other things that they have,\nfor instance, fire suppression systems.\n\n336\n00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.945\nNow the fire suppression systems, this is\nan interesting one because we have to pay\n\n337\n00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:31.319\nattention to what kind of chemicals that\nwe're using in fire suppression systems,\n\n338\n00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:33.185\nbecause of the fact that\nwe have people there.\n\n339\n00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:35.774\nNot only the cleanup and\nthe damaging of components, right?\n\n340\n00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:39.152\nYou don't want a sprinkler system\ngoing off in the middle of your server\n\n341\n00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:40.005\ncloset, right?\n\n342\n00:17:40.005 --> 00:17:42.551\nWhy?\nWell obviously it's gonna cause probably\n\n343\n00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:43.305\nmore damage and\n\n344\n00:17:43.305 --> 00:17:46.910\nprobably increase the emergency more\nthan it's gonna do anything else.\n\n345\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.064\nSo we have to have adequate\ndetection systems, the alarm or\n\n346\n00:17:51.064 --> 00:17:54.566\nan emergency alert system\nthat triggers alarms.\n\n347\n00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:58.544\nSo we know that there is an emergency\nthings like that portable extinguishers\n\n348\n00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:01.970\nother things like for\ninstance an emergency cut off valve.\n\n349\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.477\nNow you guys are probably,\nif you drive cars and\n\n350\n00:18:04.477 --> 00:18:06.740\nthose of you that have vehicles out there.\n\n351\n00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.443\nAnd you go to a gas station you'll\nprobably have seen one of these on\n\n352\n00:18:09.443 --> 00:18:11.920\nthe side of wall works and\nemergency cut off switch, right?\n\n353\n00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.154\nYou could have one of those\ninside of your building.\n\n354\n00:18:15.154 --> 00:18:19.613\nMaybe cutting power if it has to be,\nso you could also have those two.\n\n355\n00:18:19.613 --> 00:18:23.016\nI call out a couple of a chemicals,\nthe dry chemicals that you might see.\n\n356\n00:18:23.016 --> 00:18:28.676\nOne's that well are good for\nextinguishing fires in computer closets or\n\n357\n00:18:28.676 --> 00:18:35.746\ndatacenters if you will, and that's\nthe HFC-227ea and the other one is FM-200.\n\n358\n00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:41.324\nThese are chemicals that basically,\nthey will put out the fire.\n\n359\n00:18:41.324 --> 00:18:44.186\nBut if you think about what\nyou need to put out a fire,\n\n360\n00:18:44.186 --> 00:18:46.150\nyou need to extinguish the oxygen.\n\n361\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.233\nSome of these earlier chemicals\nwould extinguish the oxygen or\n\n362\n00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:50.520\njust suffocate the room.\n\n363\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.530\nWell you have to think about that,\nif they're gonna suffocate the room.\n\n364\n00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.500\nChances are they're gonna\nsuffocate the employees too.\n\n365\n00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.830\nSo we wanna put the fire out, but\nwe don't wanna kill our employees as well.\n\n366\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.216\n&gt;&gt; Wes I know if theres a fire,\nI don't wanna be hanging around for\n\n367\n00:19:04.216 --> 00:19:04.946\nthat regardless.\n\n368\n00:19:04.946 --> 00:19:08.147\nBut also we should keep in mind for\nthe handheld fire extinguishers,\n\n369\n00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:09.814\nthose are gonna class C, correct?\n\n370\n00:19:09.814 --> 00:19:12.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes, non-halon, right?\n\n371\n00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.380\nHalon is a chemical that we\nreally don't use anymore.\n\n372\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.420\nI think there's some stockpiles of it\nstill used in things like aviation\n\n373\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.024\nsystems.\n\n374\n00:19:20.024 --> 00:19:23.051\nBut we don't see that stuff inside\nof our server closets anymore.\n\n375\n00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:27.012\nThe other thing that they call out too,\nis HVAC, know what HVAC is,\n\n376\n00:19:27.012 --> 00:19:31.055\nwhat it stands for, it's heating,\nventilation and A/C systems.\n\n377\n00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:35.918\nAlso be aware of that when it comes\nto things like your best practices.\n\n378\n00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:37.966\nKeep in mind air handling spaces.\n\n379\n00:19:37.966 --> 00:19:42.535\nRemember that in air handling spaces,\nfire can pass through, so\n\n380\n00:19:42.535 --> 00:19:45.203\nthey do pose a safety concern as well.\n\n381\n00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:48.654\nNow one of the last things that we're\ngonna talk about and unfortunately,\n\n382\n00:19:48.654 --> 00:19:50.421\nhere comes the bureaucracy, right?\n\n383\n00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:52.400\nWe have to talk about documentation.\n\n384\n00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.370\nAnd that's something know as the material\nsafety data sheet, the MSDS.\n\n385\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.796\nNow, if you guys are watching out there,\nwhich I hope you are.\n\n386\n00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:04.012\nYou guys that are watching out there\nprobably have seen that the MSDS maybe\n\n387\n00:20:04.012 --> 00:20:06.258\neven heard of it at one time or another.\n\n388\n00:20:06.258 --> 00:20:11.008\nAnd actually had a little bit of\na standards change by OSHA and\n\n389\n00:20:11.008 --> 00:20:15.122\nthat is the fact that it is\nno longer called the MSDS.\n\n390\n00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:19.440\nIt's actually called the safety\ndata sheet and that's the SDS.\n\n391\n00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.934\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, what kind of information would\nbe covered inside of that data sheet?\n\n392\n00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:25.758\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing that's very important\nto know, not only for your company but\n\n393\n00:20:25.758 --> 00:20:26.740\nalso for this exam.\n\n394\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.476\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram\nhere again, and it kind of goes over.\n\n395\n00:20:29.476 --> 00:20:31.755\nAnd I made a point to kind\nof update it there, so\n\n396\n00:20:31.755 --> 00:20:34.104\nyou see that it's the safety data sheet,\nSDS.\n\n397\n00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:36.396\nThat's actually the current\nstandard from OSHA.\n\n398\n00:20:36.396 --> 00:20:38.101\nBut MSDS is so widespread,\n\n399\n00:20:38.101 --> 00:20:43.230\nwe still think of it that way even though\nthat might not be what it's called today.\n\n400\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.880\nJust kinda like we talk about standards,\nright?\n\n401\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.549\nWe still call IANA just about everything,\nthe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.\n\n402\n00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:53.776\nWhen today really it's ICANN, eventhough\nwe call a lot of the stuffs still IANA, so\n\n403\n00:20:53.776 --> 00:20:55.054\nit'skinda one of those things.\n\n404\n00:20:55.054 --> 00:20:56.226\n&gt;&gt; All timers.\n\n405\n00:20:56.226 --> 00:20:57.245\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's exactly.\n\n406\n00:20:57.245 --> 00:20:58.387\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:20:58.387 --> 00:21:00.448\n&gt;&gt; It's time to live in the now,\n\n408\n00:21:00.448 --> 00:21:05.982\n[LAUGH] but the SDS if you will the MSDS\nis basically 16 sections that outlines.\n\n409\n00:21:05.982 --> 00:21:10.042\nIt's basically developed by the OSHA,\nthe Occupational Safety and\n\n410\n00:21:10.042 --> 00:21:14.032\nHealth Administration to identify\nthings like physical hazards,\n\n411\n00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:15.650\nreally three main things.\n\n412\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.913\nPhysical hazards, chemical hazards and\n\n413\n00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:21.863\nhealth hazards that might present that\nto be presented to the end users.\n\n414\n00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:23.944\nA result of dealing with their chemical or\n\n415\n00:21:23.944 --> 00:21:26.271\nproduct you might find\nwithin your building.\n\n416\n00:21:26.271 --> 00:21:30.682\nSo when we look at Section 1 here, we're\njust gonna talk about these sections here.\n\n417\n00:21:30.682 --> 00:21:34.569\nWhen we look at Section 1, that's\nabout identification of the product,\n\n418\n00:21:34.569 --> 00:21:37.113\nyou need to know what\nthe product is first of all.\n\n419\n00:21:37.113 --> 00:21:39.713\nYou'll see that we also\nhave of instance Section 2.\n\n420\n00:21:39.713 --> 00:21:41.699\nSection 2, if it's a hazard,\n\n421\n00:21:41.699 --> 00:21:46.934\nif it's a hazardous material we need to\nhave hazard identification on it likewise.\n\n422\n00:21:46.934 --> 00:21:50.430\nSo many other things you\ncan see inside here.\n\n423\n00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:51.067\nThe ingredients, right?\n\n424\n00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.700\nWe need to know the composition.\n\n425\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.120\nWhat is the ingredients information?\n\n426\n00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.080\nThat's Section 3.\n\n427\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.725\nInside of Section 4, you have things\nlike your first aid measures, right?\n\n428\n00:21:58.725 --> 00:22:03.044\nIf you come into contact with\nthe substance, what is it that we have to\n\n429\n00:22:03.044 --> 00:22:07.146\ndo in order to treat the person\nthat's come into contact with it.\n\n430\n00:22:07.146 --> 00:22:10.009\nLet's see, Section 5,\nfire fighting measures.\n\n431\n00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:12.915\nIs this material flammable?\n\n432\n00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:16.932\nIf it is flammable or it does present\nsome kind of combustible nature,\n\n433\n00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:20.418\nour firefighters,\nour first responders to the emergency.\n\n434\n00:22:20.418 --> 00:22:23.713\nThey need to know how they\ncan deal with this as well.\n\n435\n00:22:23.713 --> 00:22:26.847\nLet's see, what else?\n\n436\n00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:29.870\nSection 6, Accidental Release Measures.\n\n437\n00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.875\nWhat happens if we have things\nlike spills, if it's chemical.\n\n438\n00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:36.830\nIf it might not even be a chemical,\nmight be a gaseous state.\n\n439\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.614\nMight be in chemical form\nwhen it's in a bottle, but\n\n440\n00:22:39.614 --> 00:22:41.396\nwhat happens if it hits open air.\n\n441\n00:22:41.396 --> 00:22:43.110\nDoes it turn into a gas?\n\n442\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.030\nSo things like accidental release\nmeasures are in there likewise.\n\n443\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.520\nSection 7,\nhow do we store the stuff, right?\n\n444\n00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.958\nI worked for a company that we were doing\nbasically industrial building maintenance.\n\n445\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:58.813\nAnd we were taking care of\nthings like state buildings too.\n\n446\n00:22:58.813 --> 00:23:01.769\nAnd some of the chemicals we had to\ndeal with, the boss that I worked with,\n\n447\n00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:03.021\nhe had to get a special closet.\n\n448\n00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:07.905\nA special fire proof place to store to\nsome of these chemicals just because\n\n449\n00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:11.388\nof the fact that they did\nhave a combustible nature.\n\n450\n00:23:11.388 --> 00:23:14.270\nSo how do we handle them and\nhow do we store them?\n\n451\n00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.434\nDo we need protective measures when\nwe are dealing with these chemicals?\n\n452\n00:23:19.434 --> 00:23:21.077\nSection 8 is the exposure controls and\n\n453\n00:23:21.077 --> 00:23:23.726\nyou can see personal protection\nif I am going to be using these.\n\n454\n00:23:23.726 --> 00:23:27.002\nDo I have to wear things like for\ninstance gloves?\n\n455\n00:23:27.002 --> 00:23:32.157\nAnd if somebody needs to rush in and\nhelp somebody in an emergency situation,\n\n456\n00:23:32.157 --> 00:23:36.775\ndo I have to wear like a respirator,\ndo I have to have a respirator on?\n\n457\n00:23:36.775 --> 00:23:39.520\nSo things like that.\n\n458\n00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.570\nSection 9, the physical and chemical\nproperties of whatever the chemical might\n\n459\n00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.105\nbe that you're dealing with.\n\n460\n00:23:45.105 --> 00:23:48.462\n10 is the stability and\nreactivity is it volatile,\n\n461\n00:23:48.462 --> 00:23:52.724\nis it some kind of volatile substance\nwe have to be aware of that too.\n\n462\n00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:56.683\nThen you'll see Section 11,\ntoxicology information, right?\n\n463\n00:23:56.683 --> 00:23:58.363\nWe have to know if it's toxic.\n\n464\n00:23:58.363 --> 00:24:00.168\nWe need to know that information.\n\n465\n00:24:00.168 --> 00:24:04.235\nNow probably, I'd say most of\nthe chemicals you deal with are toxic, but\n\n466\n00:24:04.235 --> 00:24:07.595\nyou never know and\nit is important to have that information.\n\n467\n00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:09.866\nEcological information, right?\n\n468\n00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.228\nWe need to know that,\n\n469\n00:24:11.228 --> 00:24:16.171\ndo we have to have somebody like the EPA\ncome in if there is enough of this that?\n\n470\n00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:18.379\nIf it happens to be in a parking lot,\nright?\n\n471\n00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:22.003\nAnd it's heading towards storm drains, we\nneed to know what is the effect gonna be\n\n472\n00:24:22.003 --> 00:24:24.798\nand how how are going to do things\nlike quarantine and contain.\n\n473\n00:24:24.798 --> 00:24:28.498\nIncluding things like disposal measures or\nconsiderations.\n\n474\n00:24:28.498 --> 00:24:33.751\nI will tell you pay attention\nto whatever your local state and\n\n475\n00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:36.434\nfederal regulatory laws are.\n\n476\n00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:40.736\nBecause disposal might be at\na collection agency that specializes in\n\n477\n00:24:40.736 --> 00:24:42.227\nchemical disposable.\n\n478\n00:24:42.227 --> 00:24:45.576\nIt could just be a local collection agency\nthat's no different than where you take\n\n479\n00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:46.117\nyour trash.\n\n480\n00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:49.592\nBut definitely that has\nto be on the manual.\n\n481\n00:24:51.508 --> 00:24:55.045\nAll right, and\ntransport information in Section 14.\n\n482\n00:24:55.045 --> 00:24:59.860\nAnd then we also have in Section 15,\nwe've got the regulatory information.\n\n483\n00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:04.022\nAnd then last but not the least\nSection 16, and this is interesting.\n\n484\n00:25:04.022 --> 00:25:07.175\nCuz it just says, other information,\nincluding the date of preparation or\n\n485\n00:25:07.175 --> 00:25:08.812\nlast revision of this documentation.\n\n486\n00:25:08.812 --> 00:25:12.757\nSo again, this is their little hey,\nif we need to add stuff later,\n\n487\n00:25:12.757 --> 00:25:14.811\nwe'll put section 16 in there.\n\n488\n00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:19.782\nSo keep in mind really be information that\nis really important as Section 1 through\n\n489\n00:25:19.782 --> 00:25:20.712\nSection 15.\n\n490\n00:25:20.712 --> 00:25:22.825\nBut I know it's a lot of information,\n\n491\n00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:26.334\nI don't expect them to ask you\nevery little detail on the exam.\n\n492\n00:25:26.334 --> 00:25:30.863\nBut what's an MSDS, but definitely know\nsome of the things that you could see\n\n493\n00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:33.581\ninside of the MSDS like\nproduct information,\n\n494\n00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.452\nhandling, disposal procedures, emergency.\n\n495\n00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:39.924\nIf you got into contact,\ndo we have to call the Poison Center?\n\n496\n00:25:39.924 --> 00:25:42.866\nSo things like this, because it is\ngoing to be something that could\n\n497\n00:25:42.866 --> 00:25:46.552\npotentially save somebody's life, so\nit is very, very important information.\n\n498\n00:25:46.552 --> 00:25:50.072\nI would say probably one of the ast things\nthat I would mention when it comes to\n\n499\n00:25:50.072 --> 00:25:50.681\nany safety.\n\n500\n00:25:50.681 --> 00:25:54.436\nThe best thing that you can do is just\nbe aware of your environment, know what\n\n501\n00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:58.860\nyou're going into so that you're prepared\nin case something like this happens.\n\n502\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.763\nYou don't have to figure out at the last\nsecond, if their's an emergency.\n\n503\n00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:05.192\n&gt;&gt; Good words of advice there, Wes.\n\n504\n00:26:05.192 --> 00:26:07.671\nIt's better to be prepared\nthan scurrying around and\n\n505\n00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:11.152\ntrying to throw things together at\nthe last minute, so thank you for that.\n\n506\n00:26:11.152 --> 00:26:13.939\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\nfor tuning in but stay tuned.\n\n507\n00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.886\nWe do have more NetPlus headed your way.\n\n508\n00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:17.218\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n509\n00:26:17.218 --> 00:26:18.188\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n510\n00:26:18.188 --> 00:26:20.314\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro.TV.\n\n511\n00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:27.531\n[MUSIC]\n\n512\n00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:29.485\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

watching ITPRO.TV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome\n\n4\n00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.680\nto your CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.540\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.250\nIn this episode we'll be\nlooking at different types\n\n7\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.840\nof installation techniques.\n\n8\n00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.180\nWith us today we have Mr.\nWes Bryan in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.450\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n10\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee.\n\n11\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.290\nAs always thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.010\nGreat to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.241\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\nsome of the different infrastructure you\n\n14\n00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.298\nsee, well,\nwhen you decide to implement a network.\n\n15\n00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:32.438\nNow the reality is,\n\n16\n00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:36.799\nmost likely you're probably not going\nto be implementing a new network, but\n\n17\n00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:42.150\nyou might go into an existing one, and\nthey have the infrastructure in place, so.\n\n18\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.290\nBe nice to know what\nthe infrastructure is.\n\n19\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.080\nSo, that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.740\nWe'll also be looking at just some\ndifferent concepts that they mention,\n\n21\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.160\nlike power management,\ndevice placements, cable management.\n\n22\n00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.630\nSo these are some things that\nwe will be looking at today.\n\n23\n00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.560\nNow, let's go ahead, we'll dive right in.\n\n24\n00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.018\nAnd one of the first topics\nwe're going to talk about,\n\n25\n00:01:02.018 --> 00:01:04.830\nreally boils down to what's\nknown as premise wiring.\n\n26\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.350\nYou have some terms as non-standard terms,\n\n27\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.670\nterms that are interchangeable but\nwe're gonna look at things like for\n\n28\n00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.450\ninstance main distribution frames and\nintermediate distribution frames.\n\n29\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.490\nSo, what are we talking about here?\n\n30\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.470\nLet's go ahead, I've got a diagram here.\n\n31\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.550\nWe'll talk about the MDFs,\nand the IDF's here.\n\n32\n00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.950\nThe main distribution frame, when you\ntalk about things like premise wiring,\n\n33\n00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.430\nyou might hear this called\nthe equipment room.\n\n34\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.410\nAnd the main distribution\nframe is typically where,\n\n35\n00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.250\nthe majority of your servers, right?\n\n36\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.850\nIf you think of a server closet,\nthat's where the majority of your servers\n\n37\n00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.880\nare gonna be in, a lot of times,\nit's gonna be on the first floor.\n\n38\n00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.610\nUnless you work on a high rise building,\n\n39\n00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.180\nthen maybe your company works\non the hundredth floor.\n\n40\n00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.250\nIt's usually going to be not to be\ntoo far from your demarcation point.\n\n41\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.620\nI'll tell you, I'll come back\nto the demarcation point here.\n\n42\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.430\nIt really is where all,\n\n43\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.600\nit's kind of like the,\nwhen we say all roads lead to Rome, right?\n\n44\n00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380\nIt's a center point where\neverything connects back into.\n\n45\n00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.740\nYou might even hear these other terms\ninstead of main distribution frame.\n\n46\n00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.520\nYou might hear something like main\ncross connect, MCC if you will,\n\n47\n00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.770\nbut again a lot of times you're gonna see\nmore of just the main distribution frame.\n\n48\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.430\nNow I mentioned that term, Demarc, right.\n\n49\n00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.530\nWhat is the Demarc?\n\n50\n00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.500\nWell that's just short for\ndemarcation point.\n\n51\n00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.665\nWe have commercial Demarcs,\nwe have residential Demarcs.\n\n52\n00:02:25.665 --> 00:02:29.020\nSo if you're sitting at your house\nright now as you're watching this and\n\n53\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.045\nyou obviously have an Internet\nconnection to be able to watch us,\n\n54\n00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:34.425\nyou might see that on\nthe outside of your building.\n\n55\n00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:35.855\nYou have a little box, right?\n\n56\n00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:39.405\nAnd you got your cable provider,\nor your Internet provider,\n\n57\n00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:44.570\nISP's got their cables going right\nto the outside of your house.\n\n58\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.315\nIt's right there, right?\n\n59\n00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.800\nWell that's the demarcation point.\n\n60\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.350\nAnd really what demarcation point\nis the point of responsibility.\n\n61\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.770\nIf you look like for\n\n62\n00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.850\ninstance your house, anything to the going\nout back maybe towards the road, right?\n\n63\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.080\nThat's all gonna be the ISP's\nresponsibility, right?\n\n64\n00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.380\nIf something happens, if somebody\nhappens to be doing construction.\n\n65\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.600\nMaybe your neighbor is doing construction,\nright?\n\n66\n00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.340\nAnd they cut one of the lines and\nyou lose cabling, or\n\n67\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.338\nyou lose your internet connection, right?\n\n68\n00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:12.120\nIt's not gonna be you\nthat's going out there and\n\n69\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.060\ndigging that up and trying to repair that.\n\n70\n00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.099\nAt least we hope not.\n\n71\n00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.760\nThat's gonna be your ISP's responsibility.\n\n72\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.350\nIn order to take care of that.\n\n73\n00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.540\nHowever, on the other side of\nthe demarkation point, right, the cabling,\n\n74\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.630\nif you will, that's going into your\nbuilding, into your home, right,\n\n75\n00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.550\nif something happens there.\n\n76\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.590\nLet's say, for instance,\nif squirrels get up into your attic,\n\n77\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.210\nI know there's a problem\nwe have in Florida,\n\n78\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.970\nmaybe you guys don't have this problem,\nhopefully you don't.\n\n79\n00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.890\nBut sometimes squirrels can\nget up into your attic and\n\n80\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.490\nthey start chewing on wires,\nthey love to chew on the wires.\n\n81\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.740\nWell, that's not gonna be the ISP that\nhas to come in and fix that point, right?\n\n82\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.377\nThat's gonna be something\nthat you have to do.\n\n83\n00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:48.945\nSo, again, demarcation point,\nthe demarc if you will,\n\n84\n00:03:48.945 --> 00:03:51.365\nis really the point of responsibility.\n\n85\n00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:56.625\nIt's where the carrier's network\nconnects to your on-premise equipment.\n\n86\n00:03:56.625 --> 00:04:00.390\nAnything that's too, let's say\nthe on-premise side of it is gonna be\n\n87\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.440\nyou as the customer's responsibility\nto ensure that it is up and running.\n\n88\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.250\nAnything to the other side for instance,\nlike I give you an example here,\n\n89\n00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.360\nout to the local loop, right.\n\n90\n00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.810\nThat's going to be something\nthat's gonna be the Internet\n\n91\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.950\nprovider's responsibility in order to fix.\n\n92\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.208\nAll part of some more of these larger\npremise concepts that we are gonna take\n\n93\n00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:19.827\na look at.\n\n94\n00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:23.122\n&gt;&gt; Now depending on your ISP,\nit might be slightly different,\n\n95\n00:04:23.122 --> 00:04:24.682\na couple feet here or there.\n\n96\n00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:28.006\nBut if you have any questions then\nwhat's the document you would look at,\n\n97\n00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:29.936\nwe just spoke about the previous episode,\n\n98\n00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.740\nthat's going to be our service\nlevel agreement, right Wes?\n\n99\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.470\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and that's where\nthat documentation comes in handy.\n\n100\n00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.860\nEven though we like to think about\nit as more on the bureaucratic side,\n\n101\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.890\nI mean it does come in handy.\n\n102\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.420\nYou might say that the demarkation\npoint like Cherokee says\n\n103\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.640\nposition wise they can move, and\neven what they look like are different.\n\n104\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.460\nLet me give you an example,\n\n105\n00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.010\nour demarcation point in here's\ngot a 10 gig fiber optic line.\n\n106\n00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.170\nAgain same concept right, we've got our\ncarrier side of the network, but we got\n\n107\n00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.610\na 10 gig line that comes into our building\nhere, and it's in our server closet.\n\n108\n00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.220\nIt's not on the outside of the building,\nright.\n\n109\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.350\nSo you gotta understand that they're\nnot always in the same location.\n\n110\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.400\nBut on one side of that demarcation\npoint is going to be things like for\n\n111\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.350\ninstance here in Gainesville\nwe've got GRU.com and\n\n112\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.392\nCox communication as our Internet\nservice providers around here.\n\n113\n00:05:15.392 --> 00:05:19.160\nIt's gonna be up to them to fix the fiber\noptic line, if it's cut on the other side.\n\n114\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.690\nHowever, inside of our server closet,\nthe rest of the wiring\n\n115\n00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.970\ngoing throughout our building,\nthat's gonna be our responsibility.\n\n116\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.360\nAnd speaking of that wiring, we've got\na couple of different wiring types, right.\n\n117\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.780\nWe have vertical wiring.\n\n118\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.865\nAnd the vertical wiring,\njust like you would think, right,\n\n119\n00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:36.764\nit goes up through the building,\nright, vertically.\n\n120\n00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:38.195\n&gt;&gt; No trick questions here!\n\n121\n00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:38.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n122\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.990\nIt goes up to the building vertically and\nit's usually a backbone type wiring and\n\n123\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.620\nit's because, what is it doing?\n\n124\n00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.620\nWell it's taking all the intermediate\ndistribution frames, right?\n\n125\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.700\nWe have multi floors in a building.\n\n126\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.550\nEach individual floor can have its\nintermediate distribution frames.\n\n127\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.820\nSo you're talking about taking\nall of the information.\n\n128\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.630\nPretty much from almost the entire network\nand putting it on a single backbone.\n\n129\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.670\nSo usually you have some high\nspeed cabling there that\n\n130\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.340\ncan handle the bandwidth.\n\n131\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.610\nAnd the vertical wiring a lot of times\nwill connect the different intermediate\n\n132\n00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.140\ndistribution frames back to\nthe main distribution frame.\n\n133\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.990\nNow, there's another that\nway we can look at this.\n\n134\n00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.990\nYou look at it from,\nagain from another logical standpoint.\n\n135\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.188\nWe have our main distribution frame,\nagain think about your big server closets.\n\n136\n00:06:25.188 --> 00:06:28.654\nAnd all your intermediate distribution\nframes are servicing the floors that\n\n137\n00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:29.380\nthey're on.\n\n138\n00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.570\nAnd they ultimately lead back\nto what's known as a work area.\n\n139\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.570\nNow, there's another way that\nwe can look at this too.\n\n140\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.610\nSo if we look at our equipment room,\nright, first floor.\n\n141\n00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.200\nIf we look at the equipment room on the\nfirst floor, notice that this is where all\n\n142\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.290\nof the equipment that we have pretty\nmuch the majority of our servers are.\n\n143\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.340\nAnd then we have an additional type of\nwiring and this wiring that runs across\n\n144\n00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.680\nthe ceiling, well you might understand\nthat's called horizontal wiring, right?\n\n145\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.140\nAnd this usually feeds\nout to our work area.\n\n146\n00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.210\nAnd the work area usually consists\nof the horizontal wiring,\n\n147\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.760\nthe drop cables, if you will,\ncoming out of the wall, as well.\n\n148\n00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.980\nSo we do have those.\n\n149\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.400\nKeep that in mind that we have that for\nthe first floor.\n\n150\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.860\nNow the other thing, too about\nthe first floor, or the equipment room.\n\n151\n00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.180\nA lot of times what you'll see is\ninside of this equipment room,\n\n152\n00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.260\nsomewhere in here will be\nthat demarcation point.\n\n153\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.430\nCould be on the outside of the building.\n\n154\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.130\nA lot of times,\nit's inside of your server closet.\n\n155\n00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:31.570\nAnd they will call that, I believe\nthey call that, entry facilities.\n\n156\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.820\nAnd that's the point where the demarcation\npoint connects to your network.\n\n157\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.940\nAgain, notice the vertical backbone\ntype wiring is connecting to\n\n158\n00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.100\na telecommunications closet.\n\n159\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.272\nThese are intermediate\ndistribution frames, right.\n\n160\n00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.274\nThink about distribution.\n\n161\n00:07:46.274 --> 00:07:47.320\nWhat do we talk about?\n\n162\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.270\nWe have got two major types\nof nodes on your networks.\n\n163\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.659\nYou've got N systems.\n\n164\n00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:56.421\nN systems are typically where we\nare communicating with things like\n\n165\n00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:58.077\nworkstations, if you will.\n\n166\n00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.143\nAnd then your intermediate systems, right?\n\n167\n00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:02.903\nThese are this redistribution points,\n\n168\n00:08:02.903 --> 00:08:06.400\nhence the term intermediate\ndistribution frame.\n\n169\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.240\nAnd again, you can see the vertical wiring\ngoing up, all the way in this case by this\n\n170\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.710\nexample, up to the fourth floor here where\nwe have our horizontal wiring as well.\n\n171\n00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.420\nSo a few different terms that\nyou're gonna have to be aware of\n\n172\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.520\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n173\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.840\n&gt;&gt; So I see you have some\nblue cabling there, Wes.\n\n174\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.950\nI know that TIA calls out specific colors\nfor different types of implementations.\n\n175\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.220\nBut certain companies may adhere to\nthose rules, some may not, right?\n\n176\n00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, the only one that\nI've seen that kinda seems consistent is\n\n177\n00:08:34.658 --> 00:08:37.909\nwhen you have a fiber optic cable,\nit seems to be a real light blue, right?\n\n178\n00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:41.515\nAnd I'm not sure why that is,\nbut the fiber optic cable,\n\n179\n00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:43.980\na lot of time seems to be a light blue.\n\n180\n00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.310\nWe have patch panel cables that are blue,\nbut sometimes we've seen orange, as well.\n\n181\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.220\nAnd I say we, because you and\nI used to work in a building\n\n182\n00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.030\nthat all the patch cables that go into the\npatch panels, if you will, were orange.\n\n183\n00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.640\nSo color coordination, ultimately,\n\n184\n00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.681\nit's gonna be down to whatever\nthe person is implementing.\n\n185\n00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:08.179\nWhen it comes to the color coordination\nthat's really, really important is when\n\n186\n00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:13.084\nyou're filing things like TIA ES568 A and\nB standard each for the wiring schematics.\n\n187\n00:09:13.084 --> 00:09:17.430\nIf you have An RJ48 jack that\nterminates into the T1DS1 line,\n\n188\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.091\nagain, remember that that color\ncoding's gonna be very important on\n\n189\n00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:26.110\nthat cuz you have to make sure\nyou wire the jacket right.\n\n190\n00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:32.090\nOr the jack right, if you will, in order\nto get the signal the way you need it.\n\n191\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.860\nAll right, so one of the next things that\nI wanna talk about is going to be power\n\n192\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.840\nmanagement.\n\n193\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.950\nWhen they call out power management, guys,\n\n194\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.520\nyou don't have to be electrical engineers\nor electricians to pass this exam.\n\n195\n00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.250\nCuz if you did, I wouldn't pass it.\n\n196\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.220\nI know enough about electricity to\nlet the professionals handle it.\n\n197\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.020\nAnd that's pretty much what I'd\nlike to preface talking about\n\n198\n00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.840\nany power management about.\n\n199\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.236\nIs the fact that if you don't have\nthe experience, don't work with the power.\n\n200\n00:09:57.236 --> 00:09:58.848\nCall an electrician.\n\n201\n00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.982\nKeep in mind, though, there are some\nthings that that you might need\n\n202\n00:10:01.982 --> 00:10:04.862\nto be aware of, right,\nwhen it comes to the power management.\n\n203\n00:10:04.862 --> 00:10:08.361\nAnd a couple of the concepts\nthat they call out,\n\n204\n00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:11.810\nthey call out things like inverters,\nright?\n\n205\n00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.000\nWell, what's an inverter?\n\n206\n00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.330\nWell, I got a little diagram here.\n\n207\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.629\nLet's start with what a converter is,\nright?\n\n208\n00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:21.954\nA converter is something that takes\nalternating current right from its source\n\n209\n00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.930\nand then it inputs it into a device.\n\n210\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.230\nAnd then the output is changed\nto a direct current, right?\n\n211\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.024\nGive you an example of a basic inverter,\n\n212\n00:10:30.024 --> 00:10:33.320\nthe power supplies on your computers,\nright?\n\n213\n00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:33.867\nThey're inverters, right?\n\n214\n00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:38.180\nThey take alternating current and\nthey convert it to direct current.\n\n215\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.830\nThe inverter, on the other hand,\nwe're just reversing the flow.\n\n216\n00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.629\nThat's all it is, right?\n\n217\n00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:45.381\nWe're taking direct current,\ninputting it into a device and\n\n218\n00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:49.990\nthen the output is alternating current,\nso they do talk about those.\n\n219\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.270\nSo again,\nyou have power converters, right?\n\n220\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.010\nYou also have inverters.\n\n221\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.239\nThe other thing that they\ncall out are the circuits.\n\n222\n00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:01.800\nKeep in mind, that with circuits,\nall your equipment needs to be grounded.\n\n223\n00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.840\nWe've talked about that in the electrical\nsafety episode that we did.\n\n224\n00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.740\nBut remember,\nall your equipment needs to be grounded.\n\n225\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.440\nThat is important.\n\n226\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.080\nCircuits, however, they can have\na couple of different types of grounds.\n\n227\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.170\nThey can have a common ground or\nan isolated ground.\n\n228\n00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.900\nAnd you gotta kinda figure out\nwhich one you're gonna implement.\n\n229\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.480\nSo with a common ground, that means all\ncircuits share that single path to Earth.\n\n230\n00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.760\nThat means if I get electrical magnetic\ninterference in any one of those lines,\n\n231\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.280\nit can affect all circuits that\nare attached to that single ground, right?\n\n232\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.640\nAnd that's the purpose of a ground, right?\n\n233\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.129\nIt shunts electrical noise,\nthe signal that you don't want, to Earth.\n\n234\n00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:39.260\nIf you have an isolated ground, though,\nit could be a little bit more expensive.\n\n235\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.110\nBut an isolated ground means that each\ncircuit has its own path to Earth.\n\n236\n00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:49.090\nWhich means that if I get electrical, if\nI can say it, electrical interference in\n\n237\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.842\none circuit, then since it's\ngot its own dedicated ground,\n\n238\n00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:56.551\nwe don't have to worry about\nit affecting another circuit.\n\n239\n00:11:56.551 --> 00:12:00.780\nSo you also have that and\nthat you need to be aware of too.\n\n240\n00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.619\nSome of the other things\nthat we've talked about,\n\n241\n00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:05.380\nit's kinda really a recap from\nwhat we've mentioned before.\n\n242\n00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.335\nThey talk about power redundancy.\n\n243\n00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:11.038\nThe level of redundancy really revolves\naround how much money do you have to throw\n\n244\n00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:13.060\nat the problem, right?\n\n245\n00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.131\nWe can have a lot of redundancy if we've\ngot $500,000 to throw at just power alone.\n\n246\n00:12:17.131 --> 00:12:18.501\nI mean, you'll have a lot of redundancy.\n\n247\n00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:23.080\nSo it really comes down to how much\nmoney can you throw at the issue.\n\n248\n00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.190\nSo power redundancy even in its own right,\n\n249\n00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.380\ncould be things like your servers and\nyour network like a router and stuff.\n\n250\n00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.210\nThey can have redundant power supplies.\n\n251\n00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.400\nAnd keep in mind that when you\nhave a redundant power supply,\n\n252\n00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.230\nwe have power distribution units\nthat are inside of the server racks.\n\n253\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:44.287\nYou don't wanna take two power supplies\nand plug them into the same PDU.\n\n254\n00:12:44.287 --> 00:12:46.160\nAnd why is that?\n\n255\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.210\nI want you to think about it.\n\n256\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.922\nIf you take and you have dual power\nsupplies, think about plugging them\n\n257\n00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:57.020\ninto the same circuit,\nthe same wall or the same wall outlet.\n\n258\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.650\nWhat happens if that outlet goes bad?\n\n259\n00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.090\nYou have no power redundancy.\n\n260\n00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:08.290\nSo the better thing to do is that if you\ndo have multiple power sources like that.\n\n261\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.105\nOr you plugged them into\nmultiple power sources, right?\n\n262\n00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:14.910\nRedudant circuits as well, again,\ndepending on how much money you have.\n\n263\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.115\nThe other thing that you need\nto think about are UPSs,\n\n264\n00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:18.737\nthe Uninterruptible Power Supplies.\n\n265\n00:13:18.737 --> 00:13:21.497\nKeep in mind that an uninterruptible\npower supply is not\n\n266\n00:13:21.497 --> 00:13:24.912\nabout powering your machines until\nyour power comes on back online.\n\n267\n00:13:24.912 --> 00:13:27.904\nUPSs are really only used for\none reason, and\n\n268\n00:13:27.904 --> 00:13:33.210\nthat's to make sure that all of your\ndevices can do graceful shutdowns.\n\n269\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.530\nNow what is a graceful shutdown?\n\n270\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.285\nA graceful shutdown is like me saying,\nCherokee,\n\n271\n00:13:37.285 --> 00:13:39.276\ndo you mind turning your laptop off?\n\n272\n00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:40.480\nPlease don't, I was just kidding.\n\n273\n00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.846\n[LAUGH] But turn your laptop off and\nshe goes over and\n\n274\n00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:48.189\nshe pushes the start button and\nshuts the machine down, right?\n\n275\n00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:52.698\nA non-graceful or and ungraceful, not so\ngraceful shutdown would be me walking over\n\n276\n00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:56.730\nand pulling the power on the device,\nand it shuts itself down.\n\n277\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.690\nWhy is that bad?\n\n278\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.907\nWell, I want you to think about the fact\nthat, well, maybe with our network\n\n279\n00:14:00.907 --> 00:14:04.244\nconnection devices or our redistribution\npoints, it's still gonna be bad.\n\n280\n00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:06.361\nBut it's not gonna be as\nbad as a SQL database.\n\n281\n00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:09.255\nYour server's in the middle\nof a write operation and\n\n282\n00:14:09.255 --> 00:14:11.580\nwe have a critical kernel power failure.\n\n283\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.595\nAnd now you have data corruption, right?\n\n284\n00:14:13.595 --> 00:14:14.714\n&gt;&gt; It's like corruption, yeah.\n\n285\n00:14:14.714 --> 00:14:15.794\n&gt;&gt; It's all about our data.\n\n286\n00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:18.195\nAnd what do you think, what is the most\nimportant thing about our networks, right?\n\n287\n00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:20.901\nIt's about communication and\nthe sharing of the resources.\n\n288\n00:14:20.901 --> 00:14:24.977\nAnd if we can't communicate and\nwe corrupt the resources, we haven't done\n\n289\n00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:29.770\nour jobs as administrators, so\npower redundancy is definitely important.\n\n290\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.360\nAnd then as you scale,\nI guess this wouldn't even be scaling up,\n\n291\n00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.520\nscale out, right?\n\n292\n00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.290\nScaling horizontally is whn you add,\nsay, another UPS.\n\n293\n00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.690\nScaling up would be when you\ntake the old UPS out, and\n\n294\n00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.340\nyou put one that provides more power.\n\n295\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.620\nSo whether you have to scale out,\nor you have to scale up,\n\n296\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.580\nis gonna be contingent on\nyour power requirements.\n\n297\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:56.990\nSo again, if any of this ever sounds\nconfusing, allow the electrician to do it,\n\n298\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.300\nbut we do have to be\naware of it nonetheless.\n\n299\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.717\nAll right, so a couple of other\nthings that they call out too.\n\n300\n00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:07.120\nThey call out things like cable trays.\n\n301\n00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.220\nNow when it comes to cable trays,\nI've kinda just made a little diagram,\n\n302\n00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.050\na little list of some of the common\ntray types that you'll see out there.\n\n303\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.360\nI wouldn't worry so much, guys,\nunderstanding that each one of these for\n\n304\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.960\nthe exam.\n\n305\n00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.560\nJust know that it's part\nof cable management, right?\n\n306\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.790\nAnd some of these\nare sometimes the same too.\n\n307\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.620\nThey look the same.\n\n308\n00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.590\nLike a basket tray and a snake tray.\n\n309\n00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.290\nBasket tray is exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n310\n00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.950\nIt's a basket that holds your wires.\n\n311\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.770\nA snake tray is kinda like a basket\ntray but only it snakes around.\n\n312\n00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.110\nYou also have things like under flooring,\nright?\n\n313\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.888\nThe under flooring trays.\n\n314\n00:15:38.888 --> 00:15:42.765\nWhen we have things like\nour raised flooring, right,\n\n315\n00:15:42.765 --> 00:15:46.574\nin our server closets,\nin our data centers, right?\n\n316\n00:15:46.574 --> 00:15:50.272\nBecause we've got\na climate control system.\n\n317\n00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:55.980\nWe have things like hot aisle, cold aisles\nthat pushes the air along the data center.\n\n318\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.450\nSo you also have those.\n\n319\n00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.681\nYou also have things like\nsuspension trays too.\n\n320\n00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:03.428\nAnd in fact, rather than just kinda talk\nabout these, I've got a couple over here.\n\n321\n00:16:03.428 --> 00:16:05.938\nFor instance, a cable basket Tray.\n\n322\n00:16:05.938 --> 00:16:08.394\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll go to Cable Organizer.\n\n323\n00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:13.770\nThat's a company that I've\nactually used before in the past.\n\n324\n00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.140\nAnd you can see something like\none of these snake trays, right?\n\n325\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.490\nSo if we zoom in here,\nthis is a basket tray.\n\n326\n00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:22.600\nProbably trying to sell me something,\nthere we go.\n\n327\n00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.040\nSo you can see one of those.\n\n328\n00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.860\nBut again, the basket trays can\nalso be called snake trays because\n\n329\n00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.565\nif it goes horizontal like this,\nit's the same principle, but\n\n330\n00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:36.810\nit's just, it has a little bit more\nflexibility in how you use it.\n\n331\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.860\nSo you can see this one right here,\nhence the name of snake tray.\n\n332\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.140\nYou can see how it kind of snakes around.\n\n333\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.090\nSo that gives you\nan example of one of those.\n\n334\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.090\nSome of the other ones that we have,\ntoo, we have things like, for instance,\n\n335\n00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.350\nthe under the floor tray, right?\n\n336\n00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.280\nAnd you can see how the cable management\nis going under the raised floor.\n\n337\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.840\nOops.\nI'm clicking on stuff there.\n\n338\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.170\n&gt;&gt; So we're basically just trying to\nkeep our cabling, number one, safe.\n\n339\n00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.170\nAnd our employees, number two, safe.\n\n340\n00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.680\nI'm not putting it in a certain order.\n\n341\n00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.790\nBut it's really nice to have that cable\nmanagement have everything nice and\n\n342\n00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.639\npretty, woo-sa.\n\n343\n00:17:05.639 --> 00:17:07.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, and ultimately,\n\n344\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.240\nit's gonna help you like when\nyou're routing your cables,\n\n345\n00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.950\nyou gotta make sure that you're not\nrouting them near electrical conduits.\n\n346\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.880\nYou're not routing them through things\nlike fluorescent lighting and stuff.\n\n347\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.450\nAnd this helps to isolate that for sure.\n\n348\n00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.460\nSo that gives you an example of some of\nthe different tray types that we have.\n\n349\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.000\nAnd we definitely gotta be aware of them.\n\n350\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.650\nLet's see, I think I have one more, okay.\n\n351\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.030\nSo, they also talk about airflow,\nsince we are talking about management,\n\n352\n00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.676\nwe gotta keep in mind airflow, too.\n\n353\n00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:38.230\nNow, inside of your server racks,\n\n354\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.020\nwhich we'll get into here in a bit,\nusually have ventilated doors, right?\n\n355\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.880\nA lot of times they won't even put the\ndoors on them because they want the air to\n\n356\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.490\ngo in and out and be exhausted out\nthe back of the server closet.\n\n357\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.740\nUsually have temperature climate control\nsystems inside of your server closet.\n\n358\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:18:00.050\nOur server closet, I'm not sure right\nnow what it's actually sitting at, but\n\n359\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.570\nI would venture to say it's\nprobably around 68, 69 degrees.\n\n360\n00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:09.330\nAnd again, we have to keep it constantly\ncool cuz we have devices that are all\n\n361\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.890\nabout generating heat.\n\n362\n00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.070\nAnd we certainly don't want\nthermal temperature failures.\n\n363\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.590\nThermal temperature like damage as well.\n\n364\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.830\nThermal damage to our system.\n\n365\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:22.280\nSo we need to make sure that we\nhave those placed appropriately.\n\n366\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.560\nNow, for things like your\nrack mount servers, right?\n\n367\n00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.870\nYour rack mount servers,\nI got a picture of one here.\n\n368\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.900\nThey're built and designed to take air in.\n\n369\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.780\nYou can see, for instance right here,\nall of these fans.\n\n370\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.320\nThis one's got one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven.\n\n371\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.392\nSeven fans on this one, and they're all\nproprietary, they don't follow a standard.\n\n372\n00:18:42.392 --> 00:18:46.272\nMaybe your coming from A Plus and\nwe talk about things like the ATX standard\n\n373\n00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:50.528\nwhich is, I know that if Cherokee's got\na ATX system and I've got an ATX system,\n\n374\n00:18:50.528 --> 00:18:53.345\nwe pretty much we might not\nget the vendors wrong, but\n\n375\n00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:56.627\nwe almost know what the layout\nis before we even open the case.\n\n376\n00:18:56.627 --> 00:19:00.110\nWell, fortunately,\nit's not really that way with servers.\n\n377\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.690\nServers are just uber proprietary,\nand no one system will be identical.\n\n378\n00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.320\nSo you have to keep this in mind.\n\n379\n00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.940\nHowever, with an overall generality or\ncommonality, they are common to have this\n\n380\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.850\nsituation where they are blowing\nair strategically out the back.\n\n381\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:17.750\nAnd then, for instance,\n\n382\n00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.380\nright here is the redundant power\nsupplies I was talking about.\n\n383\n00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.700\nYou can see that there's two\npower supplies in this one.\n\n384\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.790\nIt's just a shell on the outside.\n\n385\n00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.880\nAnd this is kind of interesting because\nthe fans are actually in this case\n\n386\n00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.360\npulling air in,\nblowing it in through this fan,\n\n387\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.740\nand it cycles back around and\nit comes out the back.\n\n388\n00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.070\nSo, airflow is definitely something\nyou have to keep in mind, right?\n\n389\n00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.990\nYour servers,\nthey got built-in cooling systems.\n\n390\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.510\nYour network connectivity devices,\n\n391\n00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.190\nthey also have built-in\ncooling systems as well.\n\n392\n00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.620\nIt is important that when you have\nyour servers in the racks through,\n\n393\n00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.520\nthat you make sure that there's\nplenty of ventilation inside\n\n394\n00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.940\nof the rack systems as well.\n\n395\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.830\nNow, speaking of rack systems,\n\n396\n00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.790\nthat's the next thing that\nwe're gonna take a look at.\n\n397\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.431\nSo, when it comes to your rack systems,\nit's important to understand that there\n\n398\n00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:06.820\nare many different types\nof server racks out there.\n\n399\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.940\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n400\n00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.780\nwe're gonna take a look at a few different\nkinds that they call out on the exam.\n\n401\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.510\nSo I went ahead and\nI opened up one that we have.\n\n402\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.770\nI'm here on CDW's site here, and\n\n403\n00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.450\nthey give you an example of one of\nthe rack frame types that they call out.\n\n404\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.918\nAnd this is what's known as a two post.\n\n405\n00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:27.140\nYou might hear it called open frame rack,\nand you can see why.\n\n406\n00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.630\nNow, you gotta be careful with\nthese types of rack systems here.\n\n407\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.900\nAnd that's because,\n\n408\n00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.640\nwhile they certainly have their place,\nthey're considerably different.\n\n409\n00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.720\nIn not just the fact that one has two\nposts and the other has four posts, but\n\n410\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.000\nhow they're mounted.\n\n411\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.980\nAgain, they're sometimes\ncalled the open-rack frame.\n\n412\n00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.280\nThey use two vertical posts, and if you\nwill, the support is either in the front,\n\n413\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.160\nit's a front mount or\nit's a center mount, all right?\n\n414\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.490\nYou have to be careful with these because\nif you, you do have a benefit, and\n\n415\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.580\nyou have a drawback, right?\n\n416\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.020\nOne of the benefits is you can typically\nsee the entire device for inspection.\n\n417\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.600\nHowever, getting the device out,\nyou have to be very careful, right?\n\n418\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.680\nCuz you usually have just the two mounts.\n\n419\n00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.520\nAnd again, a center mount, or\nyou'll have a front mount, but\n\n420\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.420\nyou can see that pretty\nmuch everything's exposed.\n\n421\n00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.076\nSo that's why it'll be very,\n\n422\n00:21:16.076 --> 00:21:20.155\nvery important if you are using these two\npost racks to make sure that you have\n\n423\n00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:24.430\nan adequate climate control system\ninside of your server closet.\n\n424\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.370\nBut that's one of the ones\nthat they call out.\n\n425\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.240\nAnd again, you can see a couple\ndifferent kinds here, like I said.\n\n426\n00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.740\nBut for the most part, just keep in mind\nthat these are typically the 19 inch\n\n427\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.480\nracks, they follow the standard,\n19 inches wide, if you will.\n\n428\n00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.780\nAnd then 42u.\n\n429\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.539\nIt might be 19 inches\ndeep if I think about it.\n\n430\n00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:45.529\n&gt;&gt; I think it's 19 inches wide.\n\n431\n00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:46.922\n&gt;&gt; 19 inches wide, yeah.\n\n432\n00:21:46.922 --> 00:21:49.406\nAnd then it's up to 42u.\n\n433\n00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:52.455\nAnd those are, they're called unites.\n\n434\n00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:55.467\nThey're technically called rack units,\nbut we call them Us.\n\n435\n00:21:55.467 --> 00:22:00.712\nIt's 1.75 inches, and each U,\nyou say one U rack bound server,\n\n436\n00:22:00.712 --> 00:22:04.239\nthat means it's gonna\ntake one of the 42 Us,\n\n437\n00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.230\npotential 42 U's that\nare inside of these racks.\n\n438\n00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.360\nAll right, let's see.\n\n439\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.380\nSo the next one that they\ncall out is the four post.\n\n440\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.890\nAnd you guys have probably\nguessed it by now that, well,\n\n441\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.160\nwhen we talk about four post,\nwell, what's the difference here?\n\n442\n00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.310\nWell, there's two extra posts, right?\n\n443\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.190\nWhen it comes down to it.\n\n444\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.460\n&gt;&gt; A little more stable.\n\n445\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.093\nAnd I know we mentioned this in the\nprevious episode, but like Wes had said\n\n446\n00:22:28.093 --> 00:22:31.611\nbefore, you wanna use common sense\nwhen you're implementing these,\n\n447\n00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:34.740\nand stack it from the heaviest\ncomponents down at the bottom.\n\n448\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.340\nOtherwise you might wanna look at using\nsomething like balance ballasts to\n\n449\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.630\nkind of equal out that\nweight distribution there.\n\n450\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.160\nOtherwise you might have something\nthat's a little top heavy.\n\n451\n00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.710\n&gt;&gt; And that is a great point,\nespecially, and\n\n452\n00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.990\nlet me double-back with that\nmindset on the two post.\n\n453\n00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.980\nI want you to notice that as they\nstarted they can get top heavy.\n\n454\n00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.530\nBut look at the mounting points on my\ndesktop here with the two posts, right?\n\n455\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.110\nThis thing can sway.\n\n456\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.040\nAnd again, kind of like the common\nsense says that that thing can move.\n\n457\n00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.730\nAnd it might not take\nall of the equipment.\n\n458\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:14.400\nThe massive amount of equipment that\nthe four post might give you access to.\n\n459\n00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.950\nIn fact, the majority of our systems\nhere are four post rack systems.\n\n460\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.900\nAnd these are the ones that, again,\nyou can have the doors on, right?\n\n461\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.440\nYou can see they make it a little bit\neasier to inspect when you do have to\n\n462\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.050\ndo the inspection of\nthe devices that are in them.\n\n463\n00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.830\nKeep in mind, though,\nthat these do require server rails.\n\n464\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.150\nWe'll go into server\nrails here in a second.\n\n465\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.890\nBut it makes it easier, like I said,\nto do device inspection, right?\n\n466\n00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.490\nWith things like server rails,\nwe can actually pull the device out and\n\n467\n00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.860\nit's still mounted in\nthe four-post system.\n\n468\n00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.280\nWe also get the benefit of doing things\nlike putting ventilated doors on the front\n\n469\n00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.520\nand back if we need to,\nif we're in a heavily secured device so\n\n470\n00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.560\nwe can secure those\nservers closets as well.\n\n471\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.730\nSo you also have that, keep that in mind.\n\n472\n00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:05.400\nMake sure, yeah, well,\nI'm kind of looking at it.\n\n473\n00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.865\nI think we have some more bullet points,\nbut I think Miss Cherokee's\n\n474\n00:24:08.865 --> 00:24:11.435\ntelling me that I don't know if\nwe have any time in this episode.\n\n475\n00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:14.605\n&gt;&gt; That's okay, Wes, we'll go ahead and\npick back up in a part two.\n\n476\n00:24:14.605 --> 00:24:18.285\nSo stay tuned, ladies and gentlemen, we\ndo have more information headed your way.\n\n477\n00:24:18.285 --> 00:24:19.785\nBut we'll go ahead and sign out now.\n\n478\n00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:21.015\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n479\n00:24:21.015 --> 00:24:21.875\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n480\n00:24:21.875 --> 00:24:24.294\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n481\n00:24:24.294 --> 00:24:30.899\n[MUSIC]\n\n482\n00:24:30.899 --> 00:24:33.861\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

--> 00:00:12.920\nwatching ITPro TV\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\n\n4\n00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.440\nCompTIA Network+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.550\nI am your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.280\nThis is actually a part 2, continuation\nwhere we were looking at different types\n\n7\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.460\nof installation best practices, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.120\nwe left off talking about some systems, so\nI think that's were we'll pick up today.\n\n9\n00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.540\nWith us in studios we have Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.940\nThank you for joining us today Wes\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Cherokee, thanks for\n\n11\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.600\nhaving me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.980\nYeah we have got just a few more\nthings that we got to wrap up.\n\n13\n00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.048\nSo this might be a little\nbit of a short episode.\n\n14\n00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:41.140\nBut we wanna make sure that we get\nall of the objectives here for\n\n15\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.890\nwhat ultimately is CompTIA's\ngiven a scenario, install and\n\n16\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.170\nconfigure equipment in the appropriate\nlocation using best practices.\n\n17\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.380\nSome of the best practices that we've\nalready talked about are electrical\n\n18\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.500\nsafety best practices.\n\n19\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.730\nIf you don't have the training,\nmake sure that you call someone that does.\n\n20\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.430\nSome of these things aren't things\nthat you wanna just jump in and\n\n21\n00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.580\nsay you know if you don't know.\n\n22\n00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.460\nFor instance, when it comes to installing\nyour equipment, if we're gonna talk about\n\n23\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.240\nbest practices, we talk about\nsafe lifting techniques, right?\n\n24\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.510\nNow, we talked about safety\nstandards in another episode, but\n\n25\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.410\nif it is best practices with installation,\nyou always have to think about it, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.240\nSevers are very heavy.\n\n27\n00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.610\nNetwork equipment is very heavy.\n\n28\n00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.170\nIt is something that should not be taken\nlightly cuz you can hurt yourself.\n\n29\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.090\nIf a rack isn't installed properly and\nit's fully loaded and\n\n30\n00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.190\nit falls over on you,\nyou're not gonna survive.\n\n31\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.232\nYou just have to understand what kind\nof weight we're talking about, here.\n\n32\n00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:44.260\nThey could be 700 to 1500 pounds.\n\n33\n00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.409\nIn fact, one of the other hosts was\ntelling me about a data center that he\n\n34\n00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.044\nworked in, that the data center got so\nheavy that they were just under exceeding\n\n35\n00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:57.223\nthe maximum floor load for the entire\nfloor on that high rise building.\n\n36\n00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:02.214\nSo we are talking about a lot of weight,\nso yeah keep that in mind.\n\n37\n00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:04.620\nThe next rack system that\nwe are gonna talk about,\n\n38\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.390\nwe have already talked about the two post,\nwe have talked about the four post.\n\n39\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.220\nThey have got another one out there and\nthat's called the free standing rack.\n\n40\n00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.810\nWe have actually got a couple of\nfree standing racks around here,\n\n41\n00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.680\nI know one of our other hosts Mr. Ronnie\nWong when he's doing Cisco shows here,\n\n42\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.820\nhe's got a free standing rack that he can\nmove around, he can roll around in it.\n\n43\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.483\nBut it's the same thing,\nit's 19 inches wide and\n\n44\n00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:30.238\nit follows the standard rack unit\nsystem so that it's more mobile.\n\n45\n00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.510\nIn fact we can show you some of them,\nsome of them are mobile,\n\n46\n00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.860\nnot all of them are mobile, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470\nSo we've got on stage.\n\n48\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.640\nThis ones, you can see,\ntable top, rack mount.\n\n49\n00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.360\nWe got some,\nthere's an example of one right here.\n\n50\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.330\nThis is an 18u, so you can see it\neven has a power distribution unit,\n\n51\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.450\na PDU built right into the rack itself and\nit is on wheels.\n\n52\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.570\nWe've had, like I said here,\nin the ITV PROTV studios, before we moved\n\n53\n00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.740\nto the new building, we had one\nthat had a lot of the equipment on,\n\n54\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.770\nI'm sure that's probably\nstill around here somewhere.\n\n55\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.570\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie uses it, the one with custards\nfor demonstrations for Cisco equipments,\n\n56\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.200\nit could move it to different studios,\nwhich makes sense for us here.\n\n57\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.121\n&gt;&gt; There you go, you got a mobile\nnetwork learning platform [LAUGH]\n\n58\n00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.668\nI don't know if we should\ncopyright that or whatever.\n\n59\n00:03:10.668 --> 00:03:15.070\nBut it works right, so this might be\nsomething that if you're in a smaller\n\n60\n00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.265\ncompany that you might use,\nif you're into audio and\n\n61\n00:03:18.265 --> 00:03:22.530\nvideo it'd be perfect system for\nyou again because they can be mobile.\n\n62\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.960\nNow one of the things that we\nmentioned in the previous episode was\n\n63\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.920\nthe four post rack system.\n\n64\n00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.619\nAnd part of that four post rack system,\n\n65\n00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.944\nI kind of mentioned something\nknown as server rails.\n\n66\n00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:37.200\nYou might hear rail kits.\n\n67\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.940\nThey actually, what do they call them?\n\n68\n00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.210\nThey call them server rail rack.\n\n69\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.660\nSometimes we just say server rails.\n\n70\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.290\nAnd these are kinda\ninteresting in the fact that,\n\n71\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.550\nwe'll rackmount server rails\nhere to rack solutions here.\n\n72\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.840\nNotice that these are not just for\nlike servers,\n\n73\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.860\nI keep saying servers\nlike one new servers.\n\n74\n00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.800\nNotice that these are Cisco\nequipment likewise.\n\n75\n00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.880\nWe scroll down here, I think they've\ngot the DLs series, yeah, DL320.\n\n76\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.498\nHere's one where you can actually see\nthe device inside of the rack mount.\n\n77\n00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:15.410\nNotice what it does here.\n\n78\n00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.500\nNotice how it holds it into position,\nright?\n\n79\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.655\nThe racks are mounted to\nfour different posts.\n\n80\n00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:27.100\nThese would simulate the four posts that\nwould be within a four-post rack system.\n\n81\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110\nYou can see that it gives you the ability,\nyou can see the rails there on the sides.\n\n82\n00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.512\nAnd what's good about these rails is\nit allows you when you're servicing\n\n83\n00:04:35.512 --> 00:04:37.310\nthe the device or\nyou're doing maintenance,\n\n84\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.120\ndoing an inspection on the device.\n\n85\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.140\nThe fact that these rails slide,\nand I can pull them out, right, and\n\n86\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.190\nwe can look at the server,\nwe can take the server out if we need to.\n\n87\n00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.030\nBut again, do keep in mind that it\ndoesn't necessarily have to be ones like\n\n88\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.050\nthis that are built for the servers.\n\n89\n00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.590\nLike I said, you have your things\nlike your routers and your switches.\n\n90\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.380\nAre very heavy, and then you'd\nslide in and out on racks, as well.\n\n91\n00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.120\nSo if you have those,\n\n92\n00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.470\nit makes it very convenient rather\nthan just doing a static mount,\n\n93\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.130\nwhere a static mount, to do anything\nwith it, you have to undo the bolts.\n\n94\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.380\nYou have to hold, make sure that\nsomebody's here and on each side is\n\n95\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.140\nholding the device when we take the bolts\nout, cuz the whole thing can fall, right?\n\n96\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.070\nAnd that's one of the good thing about the\nserver rails is the fact that they allow\n\n97\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.920\nyou a more user friendly or\nadministration friendly\n\n98\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.210\nexperience when it comes to managing\nthe devices inside of the server closet.\n\n99\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.466\n&gt;&gt; Well we do see a lot of different\nproducts available to really customize\n\n100\n00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.426\nthe design of your infrastructure there.\n\n101\n00:05:35.426 --> 00:05:38.860\nAnd like Wes had mentioned before,\nlike hot aisles and cold aisles.\n\n102\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.560\nAnd just by simply using science to\nhelp you design your environment,\n\n103\n00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.380\nit's really gonna help keeping\nyour equipment in place.\n\n104\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.478\nThe fronts where they're\npushing the air out the back.\n\n105\n00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:50.550\nSo you got your cold aisle, and\nthen the hot air running over all\n\n106\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.570\nthe internal components,\npushing out the back end of the CPU.\n\n107\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.720\nIf you just kind of plan\na little bit ahead here,\n\n108\n00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.940\nit's really gonna take you pretty far\nin the design of your server rooms.\n\n109\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.300\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and\nI would add to that,\n\n110\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.220\nreally the only thing I would add is\njust your vendor documentation, right?\n\n111\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.010\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; Cisco's got a lot of great\n\n112\n00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.840\ndocumentation on the requirements,\n\n113\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.860\npower requirements, electrostatic\ndischarge concerns, grounding concerns.\n\n114\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.290\nSo keep in mind that from ground up,\nit's not just the racks, right?\n\n115\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.840\nThere's the electrical side of\nit that we've got to consider.\n\n116\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.564\nThere's the cooling side, making sure\nthat we don't have thermal failures,\n\n117\n00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:27.747\nthermal temperature failures if\nyou will inside of those systems.\n\n118\n00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:32.720\nNow the next thing that they talk about\nis they talk about labeling, right?\n\n119\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.410\nAnd when it comes to labeling,\n\n120\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.060\nthere are all different ways that\nyou could do labeling, right?\n\n121\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.640\nThey've got very expensive systems.\n\n122\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.650\nI've seen some systems that are $600 for\nthe labeling system alone.\n\n123\n00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.648\nAnd all it is is a very expensive,\n\n124\n00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:51.062\nover-glorified label maker,\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n125\n00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:54.556\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I think some of those Brother\nlabelers are about $10, so, yeah,\n\n126\n00:06:54.556 --> 00:06:56.232\nI'm not gonna be spending 600.\n\n127\n00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:57.784\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't either.\n\n128\n00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:02.676\nAnd in fact, we have one here that's even\nbetter than that, it's a disposable,a and\n\n129\n00:07:02.676 --> 00:07:04.720\nit's literally like 10 bucks.\n\n130\n00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.290\nAnd all it is,\nit's just little labels you pull out.\n\n131\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.600\nYou mark on it, you pull the label out,\nyou wrap it around the wiring.\n\n132\n00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.150\nThey do talk about port labeling,\nport labeling, that's kinda interesting.\n\n133\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.120\n&gt;&gt; That's kinda touchy, yeah.\n\n134\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kinda interesting.\n\n135\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.070\nI don't know if that's gonna happen\nbecause usually the ports are labeled on\n\n136\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.350\nthe interface or\nthe patch panel or the switch.\n\n137\n00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.550\nHowever logically, maybe inside, you could\ndo the port labeling through software.\n\n138\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.222\nBut cable management,\npart of that is marking the cables.\n\n139\n00:07:33.222 --> 00:07:36.383\nIn fact,\nhere in the studios we just had to run,\n\n140\n00:07:36.383 --> 00:07:41.123\nin fact I had to do this about a week ago,\nI wanna say a good 200 feet and\n\n141\n00:07:41.123 --> 00:07:44.320\nit was coaxial cable that we had to pull.\n\n142\n00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.729\nWe had to pull and run these cables.\n\n143\n00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.070\nAnd it takes a lot.\n\n144\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.550\nI mean, it's one of those things that\nafter you've done all that cable.\n\n145\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.044\nSpreading the cables out and running\nthem through where they need to be.\n\n146\n00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:57.916\nYou wanna make sure that\nwhen you plug them in,\n\n147\n00:07:57.916 --> 00:07:59.503\nyou're plugging the right cables in.\n\n148\n00:07:59.503 --> 00:08:03.209\nEspecially those long runs that\nyou can really lose track of.\n\n149\n00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.643\nWhich cable am I looking at?\n\n150\n00:08:04.643 --> 00:08:08.560\nSo one of the first things that we did\nbefore we started to run the cable,\n\n151\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.710\nis we took each cable, and\nwe labeled both ends, right?\n\n152\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.500\nThis is cable one,\nthis is cable one on the other side.\n\n153\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.960\nSo that if, by the time it got all\nthe way over to our server closet, and\n\n154\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.950\nwe've got this bundle of cables, we can\ntell which ones are the right cables.\n\n155\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.140\nNow, honestly guys, there's other\nways we can do that, too, right?\n\n156\n00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.660\nWe could terminate the ends and\nplug them into a cable tester and\n\n157\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.685\nsee what kind of electrical continuity\nwe have from one side to the other.\n\n158\n00:08:33.685 --> 00:08:37.790\nSo you can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.970\nWe did have a question in\nthe chatroom about port labeling, and\n\n160\n00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.710\nthat's exactly what I believe\nthat they are talking about.\n\n161\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.570\nIn the port labeling, I think it's more\nof a logical implementation that they're\n\n162\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.820\ntalking inside of the switch itself.\n\n163\n00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.150\nWhat else do they call,\ncircuit labeling, right?\n\n164\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.670\nWell, circuit labeling is important,\nright?\n\n165\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.530\nWe need to know,\ncuz we could have many different types of\n\n166\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.520\npower circuits in our server closets,\nacross our buildings as well.\n\n167\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.620\nWe could dealing with 110 or\n120, if you wanna call it that.\n\n168\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.350\n220, 208, 240 I believe,\nmaybe even things like 440,\n\n169\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.578\ndepending on what kind of work load or\nelectrical load your system's under.\n\n170\n00:09:12.578 --> 00:09:15.963\nSo they do need to be\nmarked appropriately.\n\n171\n00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:18.863\nWe, a lot of times there will be\nthings like UL listings on them,\n\n172\n00:09:18.863 --> 00:09:21.252\nyou will know exactly like\nwhat the connectors are.\n\n173\n00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:24.583\nThe connectors follow their\nown standards likewise.\n\n174\n00:09:24.583 --> 00:09:27.340\nSo keep that in mind, too.\n\n175\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.940\nWhat else?\n\n176\n00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.880\nSystem labeling.\n\n177\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.890\nAgain, system labeling, depends on what\nkind of system you're talking about.\n\n178\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.810\nIf you're talking about, logically,\nif I need to find it on the network,\n\n179\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.550\nthen we have to worry about\nthings like naming conventions.\n\n180\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.680\nWhen we talk about naming conventions, one\nof the best things I can tell you is that\n\n181\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.480\nwhatever you name your devices,\nmake it a user friendly and\n\n182\n00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.210\na, like a purpose driven name,\na purpose identifiable name.\n\n183\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.750\n&gt;&gt; You mean I can't just make something\nup random like sprinkles and rainbows?\n\n184\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.260\n&gt;&gt; That's perfect.\n\n185\n00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.310\nWhat the geek in me says is I'm going\nto name every one of my servers.\n\n186\n00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.340\nI'm going to have Optimus Prime,\nI'm going to have Bumble Bee, right?\n\n187\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.480\nSo we got Transformers, and that's great\nfor the kids that are watching out there,\n\n188\n00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.540\nor the big kid that's watching here.\n\n189\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.680\n&gt;&gt; But the problem is let's say that I\ncalled in one of our other show hosts in,\n\n190\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.250\nright?\n\n191\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.880\nI called in Ronnie.\n\n192\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.960\nI'm like, Ronnie,\nI really need you to look at this machine.\n\n193\n00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.310\nI don't know what's going wrong with it.\n\n194\n00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.520\nAnd he looks at Optimus Prime.\n\n195\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.351\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie's never even seen Transformers-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n196\n00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.814\nhe's never seen Transformers\na day in his life.\n\n197\n00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:25.110\nHe says I don't know what\nthis Optimus Prime is, right?\n\n198\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.310\nBut, and joking aside,\nif I name it SMTP01,\n\n199\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.135\nwell, now he knows, well,\nit’s got to be an e-mail server, right?\n\n200\n00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:36.020\nCuz its simple mail transfer protocol,\nwe know what it’s doing.\n\n201\n00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.180\nIf I see DNS 01, if I see DC01, right?\n\n202\n00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.580\nWe know that it’s a domain controller,\nright?\n\n203\n00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.260\nIf we say FW1,\nI know it might be a firewall, right?\n\n204\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.570\nSo, your naming conventions\nneed to be important.\n\n205\n00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.080\nIt needs to be something that you\nrecognize, and a lot of times,\n\n206\n00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.130\nit helps even more if you name the device\ntypically after the service that it might\n\n207\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.110\nbe providing on your network\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and if you're in a really\n\n208\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.660\nhigh secure environment like, I don't\nknow, maybe you're in the White House.\n\n209\n00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.720\nYou don't wanna put\nPresident's office right there.\n\n210\n00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.620\nSo you kinda use judgment\nwhenever you're developing these.\n\n211\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.050\nAnd also,\ndocumentation is really key, too.\n\n212\n00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.630\nAnd when you were talking about\ndesigning those server rooms, I don't\n\n213\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.940\nknow about you guys, but I've definitely\nhad lemons as far as as equipment goes.\n\n214\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.570\nSo anytime you can save your receipts, the\ndate of purchase, keep that all together\n\n215\n00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.560\nbecause it's better to have it than not\nwhen you get in a crunch like that.\n\n216\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know you've been\na part of project management.\n\n217\n00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.860\nSo would you,\nI'll throw a question back to you here.\n\n218\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.770\nWouldn't you think that would be\npart of overall asset inventory and\n\n219\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.810\nasset management,\nis to have that documentation?\n\n220\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.300\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\nEven the most basic.\n\n221\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.970\nI mean, if you don't have any\nkind of inventory system,\n\n222\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.260\nyou could use an Excel spreadsheet at\nleast, so that's not really en excuse.\n\n223\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.220\nYou should always organize your documents.\n\n224\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.000\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n225\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.990\nIn fact, that's what I use when it comes\nto things like IP spreadsheets to do,\n\n226\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.110\nwhat's your IP lists are.\n\n227\n00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.140\nWell, you gotta know what the names of\nyour devices are in the networks as well.\n\n228\n00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.990\nAnd you have to make sure that, again,\nthat it's just easily identifiable.\n\n229\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.370\n&gt;&gt; I mean, for insurance purposes and\neverything, there's so\n\n230\n00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.110\nmany reasons why you wouldn't want to.\n\n231\n00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.670\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n232\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.340\nAnd then, also things like Service Level\nAgreements and Vendor Warranties, too.\n\n233\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.470\nSo, documentation is important.\n\n234\n00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.370\nThe other thing that's important, and\nI might have already mentioned this, but\n\n235\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.290\nin case I didn't, consistency, right?\n\n236\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.870\nBe consistent in what you're doing, right?\n\n237\n00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.793\nIf you're using 568B for,\nwhich typically even standard\n\n238\n00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:28.062\npre-made cables from\nvendors are usually 568B.\n\n239\n00:12:28.062 --> 00:12:29.650\nStick with it, right?\n\n240\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.780\nDon't change it up, and because\nthe consistency need, the consistency and\n\n241\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:40.010\ndocumentation means that I could say,\nokay, I'm going on vacation for a week.\n\n242\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.340\nCherokee, I really need you to take care\nof the server, the server closets, right?\n\n243\n00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.920\nWell, I could hand her this documentation,\nand she already knows the standards,\n\n244\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.550\nshe already knows the technologies.\n\n245\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.480\nAll she has to do is look\nat the documentation, say,\n\n246\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.310\nokay, I can figure out what I need\nto do on these devices, if anything.\n\n247\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.430\nIt's not something that you wanna do.\n\n248\n00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.350\nAgain, have those names like,\nI don't know, turtle, bill and\n\n249\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.649\nbob on your devices on your network, and\ntell somebody, hey, I'm going on vacation.\n\n250\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.540\nAnd then you have a problem with the\nnetwork and the poor administrator that's\n\n251\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.000\ntrying to cover you, and help you out on\nyour vacation can't get anything done.\n\n252\n00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.990\nSo please keep in mind.\n\n253\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.850\nSome of the types when it\ncomes to patch panels and\n\n254\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.350\npatch panel labeling that we need.\n\n255\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.030\nYou got all kinds, wire traps, cable tags,\npatch panel labels, labels software that\n\n256\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:29.950\nwe kind of talk it goes in combination\nwith things like your label makers.\n\n257\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.610\nKeep in mind, you do not have to spend\na lot of money on these devices.\n\n258\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.040\nIt really could be a pen,\na Post-it note and some Scotch tape.\n\n259\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.820\nI mean, when it comes down to it.\n\n260\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.070\nBut the key here is to make sure\nthat you are labeling these devices.\n\n261\n00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.812\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't wanna end up with one\nof those, and I know you guys have seen\n\n262\n00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:51.205\nthem, if not to Google or use a browser\nto look up messy server rooms,\n\n263\n00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:53.690\nspaghetti server closet,\nsomething like that.\n\n264\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.760\nYou'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n265\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.470\nBut it seems ridiculous,\nlike that would never happen.\n\n266\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.020\nBut I promise you, I've been to\ncouple organizations, and it happens.\n\n267\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.820\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n268\n00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.090\nIn fact, I can tell you an example of one\n\n269\n00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.430\nthat actually happened to me when\nI worked for another company.\n\n270\n00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.800\nThey acquired another location, and\n\n271\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.620\nwe went to that location and we learned\nthat their server closet, it was a closet.\n\n272\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.100\nThe only reason we called it a server\ncloset is cause there was a server\n\n273\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.130\nin the closet.\n\n274\n00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.400\n&gt;&gt; Wes, I don't, it's crazy,\nthough, when you think about that.\n\n275\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.470\nIt's literally, like you said,\nbeing in a closet.\n\n276\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.430\nAnd I've had situations\nwhere I was looking for\n\n277\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.480\nthe MTV Punk'd camera because\nI thought it was a joke.\n\n278\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.860\nThere's bubble gum all over the cabling,\nand I'm like is this a joke?\n\n279\n00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.870\nBut, no.\n\n280\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and they had like 200\ncables just all haphazard.\n\n281\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.050\nActually, you can see in the background,\n\n282\n00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.370\nit kinda looked like that that's\nright behind my head there.\n\n283\n00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.710\nAll these haphazard cables.\n\n284\n00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.810\nSo it looks like they're,\nit looks like their server closet,\n\n285\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.970\ntheir server infrastructure\nhappened all by accident.\n\n286\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.530\nSo we don't want that to happen.\n\n287\n00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.190\nThe other thing that, and\nthey don't call this out on the exam,\n\n288\n00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.810\nthey specifically call out TES568A,\n568 in general,\n\n289\n00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.320\n568 A and B, the wiring standards\nthat we've talked about.\n\n290\n00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.270\nBut believe it or not,\nTIAEIA as being that what,\n\n291\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.980\nTelecommunication Industry Association\nElectronic Industries Alliance,\n\n292\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.860\nI believe is what the acronym stands for.\n\n293\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.040\nThey standardize just about everything\nunder the sun when it comes to\n\n294\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.130\ncommunications and\nelectrical communications.\n\n295\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.972\nCherokee and I were joking about\nthis before we come on camera.\n\n296\n00:15:24.972 --> 00:15:28.060\nWe're like, yeah, if you wanna put\na toothpick in the closet, server closet,\n\n297\n00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.250\nthey probably got a standard for that.\n\n298\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.970\nBut again,\nremember this implements consistency and\n\n299\n00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.490\na lot of times interoperability,\nso that you don't get vendor lock.\n\n300\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.048\nI do wanna mention TIAEIA's, what is it?\n\n301\n00:15:41.048 --> 00:15:43.320\nThe 606B?\n\n302\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.560\nAnd in fact, let me just do\na little Google search here.\n\n303\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.530\nAnd I'll do TIAEIA 606-B.\n\n304\n00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:54.512\nAnd what you'll see is that this\nis the labeling standard, right?\n\n305\n00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:55.662\nIt's approved for publication.\n\n306\n00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:58.314\nAnd again, it is about how you label.\n\n307\n00:15:58.314 --> 00:16:02.882\nSo believe it or not, TIAEIA does\nhave A labeling standard, as well.\n\n308\n00:16:02.882 --> 00:16:06.451\nKeep, in mind guys, it's not on the exam,\nI just put it there just so\n\n309\n00:16:06.451 --> 00:16:10.160\nyou guys are aware of it, if you never\nheard about it, that it is there.\n\n310\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.960\nLike I said, more commonly inside\nof our communications closets,\n\n311\n00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.390\nwe worry more about the 568 standard\nmore than we worry about these.\n\n312\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.580\nBut, you do have that.\n\n313\n00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.550\nAlright ,so some of the last\nthings that they talk about\n\n314\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.610\nthat I want to mention here,\njust to kind of round up the episode.\n\n315\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.553\nThey talk about things\nlike rack monitoring.\n\n316\n00:16:30.553 --> 00:16:34.300\nAnd when it comes to rack monitoring,\nguys a lot of time what you\n\n317\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.520\ncan do is set surveillance cameras,\nthey do have software out there.\n\n318\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.980\nYou can have a physical IDS, and\n\n319\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.440\nthe servers themselves a lot\nof times will have these.\n\n320\n00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.920\nNot necessarily the closets themselves, so\nit's up to you to pay attention to what\n\n321\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.380\nsecurity you have within\nyour individual components.\n\n322\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.510\nAnd keep in mind, when I say IDS,\nI'm not talking about necessarily a piece\n\n323\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.890\nof software that's looking for outbound\nto inbound intrusions on your network.\n\n324\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.820\nWhat I'm talking about is quite\nliterally a little button\n\n325\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.450\nthat is pressed down when\nthe server's got its lid on.\n\n326\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.860\nYou open up the server and\nyou lift up that lid, and\n\n327\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.795\nthat little switch triggers something\ninside the server that says, hey.\n\n328\n00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:14.375\nHey, there's an intrusion.\n\n329\n00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:17.345\nSo keep in mind that, cuz I know when\nwe talk about security, the first thing\n\n330\n00:17:17.345 --> 00:17:20.105\nsomebody, if you mention IDS thinks,\nthe first thing I would think is,\n\n331\n00:17:20.105 --> 00:17:23.825\nyou're talking about that software\nthat keeps network attacks at bay.\n\n332\n00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:25.835\nOr at least makes you aware of them.\n\n333\n00:17:25.835 --> 00:17:29.690\nThat's not necessarily\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n334\n00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.983\nWhat else?\nYou also have third-party monitoring\n\n335\n00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:32.660\nsystems.\n\n336\n00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.870\nThey do have them.\n\n337\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.740\nI've got one that we could pull up here,\njust as an example.\n\n338\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.800\nYou do have, sometimes,\nthird-party systems.\n\n339\n00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.052\nThis one's called Rack Armor, and\nit's exactly what it sounds like.\n\n340\n00:17:43.052 --> 00:17:45.730\nAnd again, maintain maximum\ncontrol of the server racks, and\n\n341\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.900\nidentify who's accessing your servers.\n\n342\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.980\nIf you don't have money to expend,\n\n343\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.918\nto spend on this type, you know you\nmonitor who accesses your servers?\n\n344\n00:17:53.918 --> 00:17:58.934\nAuditing, access logs,\nright, security locks,\n\n345\n00:17:58.934 --> 00:18:05.320\ncipher locks, door locks, right,\nsome kind of keycard system.\n\n346\n00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.820\nAnd then checking those logs.\n\n347\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.390\nThat's one of the ways\nthat you can monitor it.\n\n348\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.760\nAgain, if you can't afford\nsomething like this.\n\n349\n00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.730\nAll right, what else?\n\n350\n00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.120\nRack security.\n\n351\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.470\nRack monitoring, surveillance cameras,\nthat is part of security.\n\n352\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.460\nWhen it comes to rack security itself,\n\n353\n00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.920\na lot of times it's the fact that your\nserver doors will have locks on them.\n\n354\n00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.680\nAnd one of the best physical\nsecurity implementations that's been\n\n355\n00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.970\naround since well pretty much since we've\nhad doors, is the good old lock and key.\n\n356\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.820\nNow, you could get a little\nbit more fancy with this.\n\n357\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.490\nYou could have the potential to have\nthings like biometrics built into them,\n\n358\n00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.500\nbut again that's really\ngonna raise the cost here,\n\n359\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.490\nwhen you can do just simple lock and key.\n\n360\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.200\nThe other thing they could do to\nthe individual devices that are within\n\n361\n00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.560\nthe rack itself is on the face plates.\n\n362\n00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.560\nAll right, the face plate kinda\nlooks almost like a blanking plate,\n\n363\n00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.190\nexcept it has vents in it,\ncuz we gotta pull air into the system.\n\n364\n00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.680\nAnd it goes right over the front\nof the server, and it locks.\n\n365\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.210\nJust like the old vending machines locks,\nright?\n\n366\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.240\nIt's a little circular lock and\nyou lock it in place and\n\n367\n00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.270\nit keeps the face plate\non the individual device.\n\n368\n00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.120\nAnd then as you shut the door,\nyou lock the door as well.\n\n369\n00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.740\n&gt;&gt; Talk about our defense in-depth, right?\n\n370\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.572\n&gt;&gt; That's right, a layered defense\nsystem is what we always need.\n\n371\n00:19:17.572 --> 00:19:20.189\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So those are really it.\n\n372\n00:19:20.189 --> 00:19:25.570\nAnd then, just in totality, having\na server closet with access control.\n\n373\n00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.160\nRight?\nThat's one of the best physical security.\n\n374\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.120\nOn your server closet itself,\nhaving some kind of access lock,\n\n375\n00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.880\nhaving some kind of auditing system so\nyou know who is going in and\n\n376\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.380\nout of your servers,\nyour network closets, your data centers.\n\n377\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.360\nWhether it be people that\nactually work for the company,\n\n378\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.130\nwhether it be third-party contractors,\nwhether it be vendors that might be coming\n\n379\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.690\nin, is just to make sure that you\nare logging access into your systems.\n\n380\n00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.990\nRemember, you can spend all the money you\nwant, you can spend 100,000, $500,000\n\n381\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:59.750\non a security system, and everything can\nbe bypassed by a simple door step holder.\n\n382\n00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.420\nThe door jamb.\n\n383\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:01.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n384\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.910\nSomebody goes through\n\n385\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.120\nputs a little piece of paper\nright there in between the door,\n\n386\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.210\nit's caught it and now,\nyeah you got a $500,000 system.\n\n387\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.750\nBut I just stopped it with a little\npiece of 50 cent block of wood.\n\n388\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.090\n&gt;&gt; And that's the thing, Wes.\n\n389\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.790\nYou could have all the book smart,\nand all that knowledge and\n\n390\n00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.278\nnow this paper searches in the world.\n\n391\n00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:22.760\nBut, when you're talking about\nreal life and holding a job,\n\n392\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.400\nmaintaining a job, it is gonna require\na good mixture of both of those things.\n\n393\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.420\nI mean, you wanna think also forward.\n\n394\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.150\nYou wanna have a little bit of\nbusiness mindset as well, and\n\n395\n00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.120\nthen forward thinking.\n\n396\n00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.530\nBecause you might get a budget for\na cabling project.\n\n397\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.050\nBut you might not get that budget for\na few more years.\n\n398\n00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.320\nSo you kind of wanna\njust use your experience,\n\n399\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.250\nif you have an opportunity with\nan organization to do this.\n\n400\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.120\nIt's so fun.\n\n401\n00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.490\nYou can learn so much.\n\n402\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.680\n&gt;&gt; And the thing too is,\n\n403\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.770\njust how much money do you have\nto throw at the problem, right?\n\n404\n00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:54.300\n&gt;&gt; This is true.\n\n405\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.750\n&gt;&gt; The more money you have\nto throw at a problem,\n\n406\n00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.200\nsometimes you can take care of it easier.\n\n407\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.890\nWell, I really think, you know,\n\n408\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.490\nthat's it when it comes to\ninstallation best practices.\n\n409\n00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.620\nMaybe one last thing that I would\nsay is just know your limitations.\n\n410\n00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.380\nRight?\n\n411\n00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.780\nKnow what you're capable of.\n\n412\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.660\nDon't say that you're capable of doing\nsomething without having the experience or\n\n413\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.750\ntraining, because once you say\nyou're capable of it, well,\n\n414\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.350\nthen you're going to be held responsible.\n\n415\n00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.540\nRight?\n&gt;&gt; There are expectations.\n\n416\n00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.376\nThat's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n417\n00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.800\n&gt;&gt; You said, you lift the bar.\n\n418\n00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.490\n&gt;&gt; Don't lift the bar and then walk away\nand expect somebody else to hold it.\n\n419\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.400\nif you can't lift the bar,\ndon't touch it in the first place and\n\n420\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.860\nthat's one of the things.\n\n421\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.090\nBe aware of your environment and\nkeep yourself safe.\n\n422\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.600\nNo matter how many blisters you have on\nyour finger after you do the hundredth and\n\n423\n00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.670\ncouple thousands of cables,\nwho knows it can happen.\n\n424\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.410\nBut ultimately it like,\nit is just a really good time.\n\n425\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.610\nSo thank you so much for tuning in today,\nhopefully this information can be used for\n\n426\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.110\nboth your exam certification,\nand also in real life.\n\n427\n00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.600\nAnd I think that's about it for this\nepisode, so we'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n428\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.790\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n429\n00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:08.379\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.790\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.327\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCompTIA Network+ theories.\n\n6\n00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:16.640\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.220\nIn this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.070\nwe'll be looking at different types\nof change management procedures.\n\n9\n00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.085\nWith us today we have Mr.\nWes Bryan in studio.\n\n10\n00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.990\nThank you for joining us today, Wes.\n\n11\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.061\n&gt;&gt; Hey Cherokee, thanks for\n\n12\n00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.598\nhaving me back always good to\nbe here with the ITPro.TV crew.\n\n13\n00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:32.437\nThat's right, we're gonna looking at some\nof the basics when it comes to change\n\n14\n00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:35.420\nmanagement, so\nyou can understand what is going on.\n\n15\n00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.248\nHopefully, be able to answer the questions\nthat they might ask you on that\n\n16\n00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:40.640\nCompTIA Network+ exam.\n\n17\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.260\nSo let's go ahead and just basically,\n\n18\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.510\nI don't know why would we even implement\nsomething like change management?\n\n19\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.400\nWell change management,\n\n20\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.080\na good change management system is\nreally about a couple of things, right?\n\n21\n00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.749\nIt is a systematic approach to the way\nwe apply changes to systems within our\n\n22\n00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.360\nnetworks that maximizes our uptime and\nminimizes our down time, right?\n\n23\n00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360\nI think about home environment, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.925\nIn my home environment, maybe my\nwife comes to me and she says, hey,\n\n25\n00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:09.351\nI can't get this device to connect, right?\n\n26\n00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.738\nWell hold on a second, let me go in\nthere and let me change some settings.\n\n27\n00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:16.780\nAnd hopefully that works, sometimes\nits just as simple as a reboot, right?\n\n28\n00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.780\nThat's okay for a home enviroment, right?\n\n29\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.650\nOr maybe I need too add port\nforwarding rule on my home router,\n\n30\n00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.050\nbecause I've got an online game that\nI wanna be able to connect to, right?\n\n31\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.130\nSo I go in there, and I go into the port\nforwarding rules in the home router and\n\n32\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.070\nI set them up, right?\n\n33\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.440\nWell in a home environment that's okay,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.660\nBecause if I break the network,\n\n35\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.633\nthe worst I have to deal with is\nwhy isn't the Netflix running?\n\n36\n00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:42.740\nI really wanna watch my show, right?\n\n37\n00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.924\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well in a business environment, right?\n\n38\n00:01:46.924 --> 00:01:52.891\nChanges to the network, changes to system\ncan cause outages, can cause downtime.\n\n39\n00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:58.050\nAnd downtime in an Enterprise business\nthat can cost a lot of money, right?\n\n40\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.880\nNot to mention it could\ncosts you you're job, right?\n\n41\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.860\nWe just don't make changes, right?\n\n42\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.780\nSo it is important to implement a good\nchange management process through\n\n43\n00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.844\ndocumentation, through review,\nthrough testing and implementation.\n\n44\n00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:15.840\nSo that you again, like I said,\nyou maximize your up time and stability.\n\n45\n00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.490\nMinimize the downtime or\nthe outages that you might have.\n\n46\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.947\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive in to\nsome of the components when it comes to\n\n47\n00:02:23.947 --> 00:02:25.841\na changed management process.\n\n48\n00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:27.892\nOne of the first things you have to do,\n\n49\n00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:30.980\nis you have to start with\na little bit of documentation.\n\n50\n00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.990\nNow I got a little bit of change\nmanagement, kind of a flow chart here.\n\n51\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.032\nAnd if we can take a look at it real\nquick, so a lot of bullet points here\n\n52\n00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.933\nguys, but we'll try to break some\nof these down for you, right?\n\n53\n00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:44.935\nOne of the very first things we have to do\nis we have to develop a change proposal,\n\n54\n00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:45.680\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.120\nWe're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ndesign what it is that we need to change.\n\n56\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.105\nNow the next process is once the change\nproposal is implemented, right?\n\n57\n00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:58.511\nOnce we've structured it, the next thing\nthat we're gonna do is we're gonna submit\n\n58\n00:02:58.511 --> 00:02:59.992\nit to what's known as a cab, right?\n\n59\n00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:01.939\nThe CAB is the change advisory board and\n\n60\n00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.017\nchange advisory board could be\nthings like your CIO, right?\n\n61\n00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:08.222\nCould be CEO it could be\nthings like stake holders,\n\n62\n00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:13.710\nshare holders if you will, that\nbasically are gonna review this process.\n\n63\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.570\nSo you could say that they'll go through a\nsort a portion of time where they're gonna\n\n64\n00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.460\ngo to the change advisory board review.\n\n65\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.614\nNow how fast or how slow this might be\nis really, a lot of times it's probably\n\n66\n00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:26.981\ncontingent on how big your company is,\nand how many divisions you have, right?\n\n67\n00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.573\nThe more departmental head you have it\ncould probably take the longer time.\n\n68\n00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:37.270\nSo keep in mind that these and\nagain this is not like iTel as.\n\n69\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.037\nas you go into maybe higher\nlevel certifications.\n\n70\n00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:44.896\nYou might see that you're gonna follow\nsomething like the IT infrastructure or\n\n71\n00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:49.040\nlibrary, and they'll have documented\nsteps to implement these.\n\n72\n00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.508\nBut again these are just\nsome commonalities.\n\n73\n00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:56.127\nNow the next thing that we're gonna look\nat is well creating the change, right?\n\n74\n00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:59.208\nSo that'll be the next thing,\nwe're gonna create the change\n\n75\n00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:02.240\nin an isolated environment and\nthat's important, right?\n\n76\n00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.303\nNotice the testing environment,\nthe isolated environment,\n\n77\n00:04:05.303 --> 00:04:06.639\nwhy do we want it isolated?\n\n78\n00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.204\nWell like I was telling you,\nif I'm on my network at home.\n\n79\n00:04:10.204 --> 00:04:14.436\nAnd I make a change and\nit causes problems, no big deal.\n\n80\n00:04:14.436 --> 00:04:17.345\nI might just be out of some\nInternet connection for a while,\n\n81\n00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:20.030\nbut I am certainly not\ngonna be using money.\n\n82\n00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.573\nOne of the things you don't wanna do,\nis as you are testing a change,\n\n83\n00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:26.891\nyou are creating the change to\nimplement it right away, right?\n\n84\n00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.190\nSo we have to test the change, right?\n\n85\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.800\nWe might test it in an isolated\nenvironment first and then\n\n86\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.380\nafter that's done, we document the results\nof the test, and we might turn around.\n\n87\n00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.630\nYou may not do this part,\nbut you turn around and\n\n88\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.540\nyou submit the results of the test back\nto the change advisory board, right?\n\n89\n00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.980\nWhen you submit the results back to\nthe change advisor board of the CAB,\n\n90\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780\nthey might review it to see if we\nshould further in this process.\n\n91\n00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.957\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and deviate from\nthis slide or this diagram just for\n\n92\n00:04:56.957 --> 00:04:57.579\na little bit.\n\n93\n00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:03.060\nBecause I did talk about the very first\nprocess is developing a change proposal.\n\n94\n00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.630\nWhat are some of the components that\nmight be inside a change proposal?\n\n95\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.560\nWell let's go ahead and\ntalk about some of those components.\n\n96\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.408\nWhen you're implementing a change request,\nyou have all that.\n\n97\n00:05:12.408 --> 00:05:16.387\nAnd again these are commonalities\nmore than they're set stone,\n\n98\n00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:20.010\nyou might have to modify them\nto meet the company's needs.\n\n99\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.389\nSome of these steps might be here,\nsome of these steps might not be,\n\n100\n00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.555\nmight even have additional steps\nthat aren't included in this list.\n\n101\n00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:30.724\nSo it's just a basic guideline, so\nfor instance, we'll have the date and\n\n102\n00:05:30.724 --> 00:05:31.390\ntime, right?\n\n103\n00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.069\nWe we got our documentation, we have\nto have a date and time on it, right?\n\n104\n00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.864\nJust about any other request, even if\nit's things like a PTO request, right?\n\n105\n00:05:38.864 --> 00:05:40.930\nYou have to have a date and\ntime on it, all right.\n\n106\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.995\nIs this an individual person, that's\ngonna make the change or is it team,\n\n107\n00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:47.651\na group of people that\nare gonna make the change?\n\n108\n00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.410\nCould be a security team, right?\n\n109\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.899\nCould be your network administration team,\n\n110\n00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:51.845\ncould be your-\n&gt;&gt; Projects.\n\n111\n00:05:51.845 --> 00:05:52.727\n&gt;&gt; Network engineers?\n\n112\n00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:53.672\nProject management, absolutely.\n\n113\n00:05:53.672 --> 00:05:55.900\nSo you're gonna have this here too.\n\n114\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.002\nThe change category,\nyou know what it was that we're changing.\n\n115\n00:05:59.002 --> 00:06:01.016\nAre we doing some kind of patch?\n\n116\n00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:04.370\nAnd sometimes change management and patch\nmanagement can be closely intertwined.\n\n117\n00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.956\nSo maybe we're doing updates versus maybe\nwe're doing a reconfiguration of hardware.\n\n118\n00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.204\nAnd if we're doing\na reconfiguration of hardware,\n\n119\n00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.022\nwe have to find out are we going to\ndo this at on hours or peak hours.\n\n120\n00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:18.740\nAre we gonna do this in off hours,\nso what is the allowed down time,\n\n121\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.790\nwhat is the maximum authorized down time?\n\n122\n00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.794\nSo that might help us to discover\nhow long it's gonna take for\n\n123\n00:06:27.794 --> 00:06:32.159\nthe change when we classify it, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:37.110\nWhat systems will the change effect?\n\n125\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.974\nThis is something we have to understand.\n\n126\n00:06:37.974 --> 00:06:40.327\nYou could just really boil\nthis down to scoping, right?\n\n127\n00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:42.506\nWe have to define the scope of the change.\n\n128\n00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:46.646\nIf this is a line of business let's say\nfor instance, I give you an example,\n\n129\n00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:49.577\nlike for\ninstance a web application server, right?\n\n130\n00:06:49.577 --> 00:06:53.339\nMaybe we've been noticing that the web\napplication server isn't performing\n\n131\n00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.030\nadequately.\n\n132\n00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.495\nAnd we're trying to figure out should\nwe cluster another application server\n\n133\n00:06:57.495 --> 00:06:58.410\ntogether, right?\n\n134\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.341\nSo we scale out or\nshould we scale up, right?\n\n135\n00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:03.625\nShould we maybe add some more memory?\n\n136\n00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:06.890\nMaybe add some more memory to\nthe server and that will help us out.\n\n137\n00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.186\nMaybe add some higher RPM drives, right?\n\n138\n00:07:09.186 --> 00:07:12.610\nMaybe move to solid state drives, but\nagain, we have to scope the issue.\n\n139\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.170\nSo what system or systems are gonna be\naffected by this change, all right?\n\n140\n00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.065\nWhat change is actually being requested,\nright?\n\n141\n00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:26.120\nNot just categorizing, but what are we\nactually going to make changes to, right?\n\n142\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.740\nThe reason for the change, why do we\nhave to do a change at all, right?\n\n143\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.703\nSo for instance, if it is that web\napplication server, we might say well,\n\n144\n00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.494\nwe've noticed at 2 o'clock everyday\nwhen we have our peak traffic.\n\n145\n00:07:36.494 --> 00:07:42.056\nAnd people are constantly using that web\napplication that the performance degrades,\n\n146\n00:07:42.056 --> 00:07:42.597\nright?\n\n147\n00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:45.350\nSo that might be the reason that\nwe need to implement that change.\n\n148\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.269\nThe other thing we got to think\nabout is things like that risks.\n\n149\n00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:51.959\nWhat are the risks of\nimplementing the change, right?\n\n150\n00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:54.198\nBecause as you'll see as we\ngo through our flow chart,\n\n151\n00:07:54.198 --> 00:07:57.524\nwe're also gonna have to worry about\nthings like roll back procedures, right?\n\n152\n00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:02.720\nIf we implement this change how far\ndo we go before we realize that.\n\n153\n00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.559\nThis isn't actually working\nthe way we want it to.\n\n154\n00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:06.657\nThat's the reason for\n\n155\n00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:10.790\ntesting off of the production environment\nin a test lab first, all right?\n\n156\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.580\nWhat is the cost?\n\n157\n00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.810\nWhat is it gonna cost in order\nto make the change, right?\n\n158\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.610\nIf I'm adding more servers,\nor if I'm adding more CPUs,\n\n159\n00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.160\nif I'm adding more RAM, right,\nit's gonna cost us something.\n\n160\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.150\nWhat about the downtime?\n\n161\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.342\nDowntime's gonna be a cost\nright at the bottom line, too,\n\n162\n00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:32.474\nso we have to understand,\nwhat is the cost of this change?\n\n163\n00:08:32.474 --> 00:08:35.328\nAnd then, things like the expected\nimplementation time, right?\n\n164\n00:08:35.328 --> 00:08:38.180\nCan also think about, again,\nwhat is the expected downtime?\n\n165\n00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.980\nHow long is it gonna take\nto implement this change?\n\n166\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.320\nThat's something we have to be aware of,\ncuz again,\n\n167\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.921\nyou're gonna have a certain\nmaintenance window, right?\n\n168\n00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.581\nYou're gonna have an authorized\nperiod of downtime and\n\n169\n00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:50.738\nthese change requests\nhave to reflect that.\n\n170\n00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:54.276\nSo, the CAB or Change Advisory Board\nis aware of what you're gonna do and\n\n171\n00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.620\nhow long it's gonna take.\n\n172\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.141\n&gt;&gt; It's pretty cool because even if\nthere's some kind of notification that\n\n173\n00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:00.956\nneeds to be sent out to any employees or\n\n174\n00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:04.327\npeople who may be affected by\nthe changes that you're implementing.\n\n175\n00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:07.961\nThey go on and log on their system and\nmaybe they get a particular error message,\n\n176\n00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:09.535\nso that they are expecting that and\n\n177\n00:09:09.535 --> 00:09:12.910\nthey say, West already told us\nwhat we should be doing here.\n\n178\n00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.720\nMaybe I just have to screenshot it and\nsend it to them.\n\n179\n00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.690\nThey already know who to contact,\nyou're good to go.\n\n180\n00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.540\n&gt;&gt; Definitely.\n\n181\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.440\nSo for instance, I got an example here\nof a, this cool company out there and\n\n182\n00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.318\nI gotta give them props for\nthis one because it's free.\n\n183\n00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:27.860\n&gt;&gt; It's called ProjectManagementDocs.com\nbut they've got a template form for you\n\n184\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.810\nand they freely give this out, they say\njust modify it to suit your needs right?\n\n185\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.115\nSo you can see the Change Request, right.\n\n186\n00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.440\nWe have the company name,\nstreet address, address, date, right.\n\n187\n00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.420\nWe need date and time of course.\n\n188\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.500\nAnd then if we scroll down here,\n\n189\n00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.969\nwe'll start getting to the meat\nof the documentation here.\n\n190\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.680\nCherokee mentioned project, right?\n\n191\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.330\nSo we have a Project field right here.\n\n192\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.380\nWe've got our Date, so\nobviously date and time, right?\n\n193\n00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.320\nWho is making the request?\n\n194\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.018\nIf I'm gonna make the change,\nI need to maybe fill out here, and\n\n195\n00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:58.154\nI need to put my name in here, right.\n\n196\n00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:02.356\nOr maybe it's a group, right, maybe it's\na team of people, right, and we say okay,\n\n197\n00:10:02.356 --> 00:10:06.619\nit's the security staff, right, maybe\nwe're gonna implement some ACL's, right,\n\n198\n00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:07.565\nthat we need to do.\n\n199\n00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:11.070\nOr maybe we're network engineers and\nwe're gonna implement some kinda of\n\n200\n00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.090\nnetwork segregation because of the fact\nthat we've got too much broadcast traffic.\n\n201\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.350\nSo I'm just giving you some ideas here.\n\n202\n00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.430\nAgain, the change category.\n\n203\n00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.360\nYou could see what does\nthis change affect and\n\n204\n00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.790\nyou can see some additional\ninformation here too.\n\n205\n00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.120\nWhat change is being requested, right?\n\n206\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.880\nWhat is the reason for the change?\n\n207\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.380\nYou can see now this one's interesting,\n\n208\n00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.180\ncuz they actually include things\nlike alternatives, right.\n\n209\n00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.720\nIf you think you need to change this have\nyou considered some alternatives of what\n\n210\n00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.310\nyou're changing, right.\n\n211\n00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.380\nBecause you need to think\nof all possibilities.\n\n212\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.030\nAnd you can see some other ones in here\ntoo, for instance, you can see risks.\n\n213\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.060\nWe have to understand what are the risks\nif we implement this change.\n\n214\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.380\nWe gotta be aware of that, right.\n\n215\n00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.500\nIn other episodes, we talk about\nthings like risk assessment, right,\n\n216\n00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.680\nrisk management.\n\n217\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.733\nWe can't eliminate all the risk but we can\nbring it down to an acceptable level over\n\n218\n00:10:59.733 --> 00:11:01.118\nthese change documentation forms.\n\n219\n00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:03.100\nAt least it can make somebody prepared,\n\n220\n00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.810\nthey're aware of the changes happening\nthat there is a potential for risk, right.\n\n221\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.770\nAnd you could see here's our CAB, right?\n\n222\n00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.750\nThe Change Board Approval.\n\n223\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.690\nWho is it that approved it?\n\n224\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.810\nWho's on that CAB,\n\n225\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:19.010\nthat Change Advisory Board that is\ngoing to approve the change request?\n\n226\n00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.390\nNow, they don't have to\nbe as drawn out as this.\n\n227\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.710\nIn fact, I was talking to one of\nthe other host that worked here.\n\n228\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.520\nHe used to work at an insurance company,\ntheir change request forms were very,\n\n229\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.770\nvery brief, right?\n\n230\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.062\nThey would look more something like this,\nright, where you have a change control.\n\n231\n00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:34.180\nThat's what's interesting.\n\n232\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.220\nI like that, I like the way\nthey put this change control.\n\n233\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.410\nYou wanna have some control\nover the changes, right?\n\n234\n00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.610\nAgain, I can't stress enough.\n\n235\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.060\nIt's not like our home networks, right?\n\n236\n00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.160\nWhere I can just go in,\nI can implement the change and\n\n237\n00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.470\nif something goes wrong, well it's okay.\n\n238\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.260\nLike I said, I can't watch Netflix for\nan hour, I can't play the video game for\n\n239\n00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.240\nan hour, or right I have to figure\nout what I need to do and undo it.\n\n240\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.070\nYou could see.\n\n241\n00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.330\nBut the basics are still the same,\nwho's making the request?\n\n242\n00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.410\nWhat office or department,\ncontact information, right?\n\n243\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.320\nThe request definition, right,\nwhat is the proposed change?\n\n244\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.290\nJustification, why should we even\ndo the change to begin with?\n\n245\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.480\nWhat's the impact if we ignore it, right?\n\n246\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.534\nWell the web application every day at\n2 o'clock's not gonna be servicing\n\n247\n00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:18.470\nthe people the way it should be, so\nwe start to lose customers, right?\n\n248\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.440\nIf it happens to be E-Commerce or\nsomething.\n\n249\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.100\nSo we do have to take all of\nthese into the consideration.\n\n250\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.050\n&gt;&gt; And it's kind of interesting,\n\n251\n00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.310\nbecause you might not even be aware of\nwhat it could impact, so if you do have to\n\n252\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.010\nsubmit it to a higher authority\n&gt;&gt; If your company's large enough to\n\n253\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:36.620\nactually have a project management office,\na PMO, they might have multiple\n\n254\n00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.090\nprojects or different things\ngoing on at the same time.\n\n255\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.984\nAnd they have to schedule their\nresources out accordingly.\n\n256\n00:12:43.984 --> 00:12:47.148\nAnd you don't wanna impact any other\nprojects that are happening that you\n\n257\n00:12:47.148 --> 00:12:48.230\nmay not even be aware of.\n\n258\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.260\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n259\n00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.400\nWe've talked about this too\nin other episodes, Cherokee.\n\n260\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.220\nWhere we've talked about that\ninter-departmental relationship, right.\n\n261\n00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.059\nYou've got to have the communication,\n\n262\n00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:59.254\nwhether you're talking a security\nstandpoint, patch management,\n\n263\n00:12:59.254 --> 00:13:02.625\nchange management, there has to be\ninterdepartmental communication.\n\n264\n00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:05.660\nBecause what one does usually\naffects the whole, right?\n\n265\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.260\nSo we do have to keep that in mind, for\ninstance, let me give you an example.\n\n266\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.850\nIf we make a change on the ACL on\nthe firewall, that's our gateway.\n\n267\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.930\nWho does that affect potentially,\neverybody in the building right?\n\n268\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.830\nSo it's not just affecting one department.\n\n269\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.820\nIt's affecting multiple departments, and\nit could be project heads that you're\n\n270\n00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.610\ngonna be getting ahold of,\nproject managers, right.\n\n271\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.940\nIt could go all the way up to the CIO,\ndoesn't certainly have to.\n\n272\n00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.290\nBut it is something to\ntake into consideration.\n\n273\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.120\nNow once you've tested this in a lab type\nenvironment, you submitted the results of\n\n274\n00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.590\nthat test back to the CAB or\nthe Change Advisory Board.\n\n275\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.720\nYou might move on from there.\n\n276\n00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.450\nSo for instance,\n\n277\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.430\nthe next part of the flow chart here\nmight go something like this, right?\n\n278\n00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.650\nThe change of advisory board\nreviews it and they approve.\n\n279\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.020\nThey like the results that they see.\n\n280\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.020\nSo what's the next step.\n\n281\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.617\nYou prepare your rollback\nprocedures,right?\n\n282\n00:13:54.617 --> 00:13:58.779\nSo for instance, if we are going\nto be implementing these changes,\n\n283\n00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.684\nwe've considered the risks.\n\n284\n00:14:00.684 --> 00:14:05.124\nBut going along with that risk, goes a way\nto kinda roll back that and eliminate or\n\n285\n00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:10.200\nmitigate, again you can't really eliminate\nit, but mitigate the risk, right.\n\n286\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.690\nSo if we are implementing\nchanges what are we gonna do?\n\n287\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.780\nWell we should already be running backups,\nright?\n\n288\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.100\nWe should have configuration snapshots,\nso that we know what the configuration of\n\n289\n00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.700\nthe device was or\nsystem before we made the change.\n\n290\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.570\nAnd that's the point that we go on and\nwe actually implement the change.\n\n291\n00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.760\nNow, once you implement the change you\nmight think okay, we implement the change,\n\n292\n00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.890\nwe documented that we implement it,\ndocumentation's done and\n\n293\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.080\nthat really isn't the case.\n\n294\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.860\nBecause then you have to make sure and\n\n295\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.280\nensure that the change\nimplementation was successful.\n\n296\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.130\nAnd then after that you document,\nyou log those results.\n\n297\n00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.650\nBut you're not done there, right?\n\n298\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.850\nAfter you've made the change,\nright, I'm giving you an example of\n\n299\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.220\na web application server\nnot performing adequately.\n\n300\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.780\nYou've made the change,\nyou see it 2 o'clock the next day.\n\n301\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.670\nIt seems like the problem's fixed, right?\n\n302\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.090\nWell, we gotta do things, for\ninstance, ongoing monitoring.\n\n303\n00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.230\nRight, we have to make sure,\nmaybe we have a performance baseline\n\n304\n00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.130\nof the first time we put this web\napplication server into production and\n\n305\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.660\nwhat the expected performance should be.\n\n306\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.140\nIs it meeting that now after\nyou've submitted the change?\n\n307\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.351\nWell I don't know,\nit's kind of hard to tell, right?\n\n308\n00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:17.590\nYou don't wanna think that\nyou fixed the problem.\n\n309\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.190\nGive you an example, right?\n\n310\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.390\nI know that I've got a laptop\nhere that's got an SSD and\n\n311\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.710\nit's got 16 gigs of RAM and\nI remember when I first got it.\n\n312\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.720\nRight, I said man, this thing is fast.\n\n313\n00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.140\nI've had it for a year and\na half i think it's slow.\n\n314\n00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.580\nIs it slow?\n\n315\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.730\nI don't know right.\n\n316\n00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.260\nIf I really wanted to know\nwhether that's the truth or\n\n317\n00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.380\nnot I should have some kind of performance\nbaseline of when I first got this thing.\n\n318\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.400\nAnd I performed a baseline on it, and\nthey see what the statistical snapshot is\n\n319\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.020\nof the performance of\nthe device when I first get.\n\n320\n00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.262\nAnd then I run that test a year and\n\n321\n00:15:46.262 --> 00:15:46.817\na half later-\n\n322\n00:15:46.817 --> 00:15:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Benchmark\n&gt;&gt; And compare them, right.\n\n323\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.020\nBenchmark, absolutely.\n\n324\n00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.130\nNow I can tell.\n\n325\n00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.270\nIs it just me thinking that it's slow?\n\n326\n00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.598\nBecause I'm so used to it being fast.\n\n327\n00:15:54.598 --> 00:15:55.276\n&gt;&gt; Probably.\n\n328\n00:15:55.276 --> 00:15:56.630\n&gt;&gt; And that's probably what I think.\n\n329\n00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.930\nI say the faster computers get,\nthe more impatient I get.\n\n330\n00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.031\nSo that could be the truth,\nbut you don't know.\n\n331\n00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:06.216\nSo that's why, like I said the last\nprocess here is very, very important.\n\n332\n00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:08.613\nKeep in mind that once\nyou've submitted the change,\n\n333\n00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:11.496\nyou still have to go through\na little bit of ongoing monitoring.\n\n334\n00:16:11.496 --> 00:16:16.529\nTo ensure that the change that you've\nimplemented has fixed the problem right,\n\n335\n00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:18.500\nif it happens to be a problem.\n\n336\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.000\nIt could just be some fact that a change\ncould just be some reconfiguration right.\n\n337\n00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.060\nMaybe we don't even need a web\napplication server anymore,\n\n338\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.835\nwe've moved to a Cloud-based product,\nright.\n\n339\n00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:29.550\nCould be the simple fact that we're\ndecommissioning the web server,\n\n340\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.450\nso again, it really depends on\nwhat the implementation is,\n\n341\n00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.810\nwhat the change is and that's why it's\nimportant in serving a documentation\n\n342\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.230\nto make sure that you go through things\nlike the configuration procedures.\n\n343\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.980\nYou look at things like\nthe potential impact, right?\n\n344\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.130\nWe do things like,\n\n345\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.539\nwe go through the change advisory\nboard's approval process, right.\n\n346\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.620\nYou don't just flip switches inside of\nan enterprise based network because again\n\n347\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.510\nyou stand to ruin equipment,\nruin your career and\n\n348\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.490\nthen you know you can essentially\nlose a lot of money from the company.\n\n349\n00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.710\nThen it comes to documentation.\n\n350\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.180\nDocumentation we said was\nthe last part of it and\n\n351\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.360\nthen it could be updated\ndocumentation too.\n\n352\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.040\nBecause you have changed management logs,\nright.\n\n353\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.190\nJust because you've got an approval\ndoesn't mean that your job stops there.\n\n354\n00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.680\nYou have to thoroughly document.\n\n355\n00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.120\nWe have to make changes\nto the change management.\n\n356\n00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.487\nIf it's a patch management system and\nwe have deployed that,\n\n357\n00:17:26.487 --> 00:17:27.952\nthat might run in hand in hand with it.\n\n358\n00:17:27.952 --> 00:17:33.130\nAnd it also, the documentation itself\nmight be configuration documentation.\n\n359\n00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.080\nRight, if I implement or\nmake a change to an ACL now,\n\n360\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.570\nI have to update the configuration\ndocumentation too.\n\n361\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.010\nRight, my network configurations.\n\n362\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:46.260\nRemember I told you that maybe we're\ngonna cluster the web application server.\n\n363\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.530\nSo now what are we doing?\n\n364\n00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.288\nWell, we're actually adding or\n\n365\n00:17:49.288 --> 00:17:53.131\nmaking additions to the network where\nthe device wasn't there before.\n\n366\n00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:57.673\nSo there could be several different types\nof documentation that we have to update\n\n367\n00:17:57.673 --> 00:17:59.960\njust in the change management process.\n\n368\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.790\nNot only your change management logs but\n\n369\n00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:07.320\nagain patch management,\ncurrent configuration as well.\n\n370\n00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.490\nIf you happen to have things\nlike physical location changes,\n\n371\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.170\nright maybe you have\na branch office you move.\n\n372\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.000\nWhen you document that,\nthat's a pretty drastic move, but\n\n373\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.030\nit's still,\nsomething that should be documented.\n\n374\n00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Wes it looks like we're\nnearing the end of the episode,\n\n375\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.620\ndo you have any thoughts or\nanything you'd like to add at this point?\n\n376\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it comes down to it,\n\n377\n00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.830\nwe're really just setting\nsome basic guidelines here.\n\n378\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.860\nKeep in mind that for\n\n379\n00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.560\ndifferent companies, different types\nof change management documentation.\n\n380\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.930\nIt could be like for instance,\nthis one on my screen here, right?\n\n381\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.941\nIt could be something that is\nmore complex like this where\n\n382\n00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:43.955\nyou have a lot of categories, right.\n\n383\n00:18:43.955 --> 00:18:47.930\nYou could add categories to something\nlike this so for your company it might be\n\n384\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.905\nsomething that's you know a few more\nthings that you have to implement in it or\n\n385\n00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:55.698\ncould be something that's a little bit\nmore basic like this where you just\n\n386\n00:18:55.698 --> 00:18:57.260\nhave a description.\n\n387\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.770\nWhy are we doing this?\n\n388\n00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.350\nAnd what's the impact of not doing that?\n\n389\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.390\nAnd one of the things I would say,\n\n390\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.630\nis definitely to make sure that you\nare following some kind of process,\n\n391\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.980\nbecause not only does it make sure\nthat your system stay online.\n\n392\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.847\nAgain, it's a systematic approach, so\nsomebody isn't just flipping a switch and\n\n393\n00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:17.170\nthen when things go offline, now we\nhave to figure out do we have to go from\n\n394\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.508\nchange management into disaster recovery.\n\n395\n00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:23.988\nBecause that's not really the solution so\nremember it's not a one size fits all and\n\n396\n00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:28.440\nit sometimes it can be something that\nhas to be modified to suit your needs.\n\n397\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.930\n&gt;&gt; You know I've actually seen\nthis happen here, ITProTV,\n\n398\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.440\nmaybe with a smaller company.\n\n399\n00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.270\nIt was very informal at the beginning.\n\n400\n00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.860\nHey, I'm just gonna shoot you an email\nto let you know what's going on so\n\n401\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.010\nyou don't lock up and lock me in the\nbuilding, or something like that, right?\n\n402\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.800\nBut as you start incorporating\nadditional gears and\n\n403\n00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.060\nmoving components within your\norganization, the need for\n\n404\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.410\nthese types of formal change management\ntechniques are really important.\n\n405\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.190\n&gt;&gt; The other thing I might say as\na piece of advice, don't wait till 5:30\n\n406\n00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.780\nto implement your changes on a Friday,\nunless you're getting paid overtime.\n\n407\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.360\nIf you're getting paid overtime then maybe\nFriday at 5:00 is a good time to implement\n\n408\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.100\nyour changes, because at 5:30\nyou typically wanna go home.\n\n409\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.740\nWhat's the rule of IT,\ndon't start a project right at the end of\n\n410\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.420\nday on Friday unless you don't\nmind working on Saturday.\n\n411\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.124\nSo whatever approach that you apply, just\nmake sure that you do apply that approach.\n\n412\n00:20:19.124 --> 00:20:23.090\nAnd if it's a company policy you know\nthat you have to apply that approach.\n\n413\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.830\nSo a systematic approach to maintaining\nstability and uptime for your systems.\n\n414\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.560\nAll right, well, thank you so much Wes,\nfor taking the time to show us how to\n\n415\n00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.230\nproperly submit these forms and\nwhat should even be including on them.\n\n416\n00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.830\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for joining us today.\n\n417\n00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.700\nBut stay tuned because we have\nmore Net plus headed your way.\n\n418\n00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.690\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign out as your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n419\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:43.580\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n420\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.198\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n421\n00:20:45.198 --> 00:20:52.269\n[MUSIC]\n\n422\n00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:55.086\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

00:00:12.425\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:13.945\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone,\n\n5\n00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.205\nand welcome to another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.245\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, that's right,\n\n7\n00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:22.295\nwe're back with more for our Net+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:24.295\nAnd, of course, joining us in the studio,\n\n9\n00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.805\nthe man that knows all\nthings networking and plus.\n\n10\n00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:28.285\nThat is our good friend, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:29.165\nWes, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:29.825\nHow's it going?\n\n13\n00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:30.565\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n14\n00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:33.355\nIt's always fun to be here, and\nyes we are continuing along.\n\n15\n00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.030\nWe have ports and protocols.\n\n16\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.780\nI will tell you guys if you're following\nalong with your objectives out there.\n\n17\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.880\nI went ahead and what I did in this one\nis I put a couple objectives together.\n\n18\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.570\nBecause I really only had a handful\nof ports and protocols apiece.\n\n19\n00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.261\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we are going\nto do what is on the objectives 5-9 and\n\n20\n00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:51.970\n5-10.\n\n21\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.800\nSo we just want to go ahead and\nlet you guys know that.\n\n22\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.420\nSo you aren't looking everywhere under\nthe sun for just a handful of protocols.\n\n23\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.280\nWe'll go ahead and we'll put them all in\nthis episode and make it a lot easier for\n\n24\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.970\nyou to study.\n\n25\n00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.030\nSo that being said, let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into some protocols and\n\n26\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.760\nsome ports.\n\n27\n00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.270\nWell, when we start talking about\nprotocols one of the first ones they call\n\n28\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.190\nout, actually, it's been around for\na very long time.\n\n29\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.387\nThis is one of the oldie but\n\n30\n00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.150\ngoodies, goes back to the days\nof the early days of ARPANET.\n\n31\n00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.723\nAnd this is something known as\nthe file transfer protocol, FTP.\n\n32\n00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:25.672\nNow, the file transfer protocol's been\naround, and one of the reasons it stays\n\n33\n00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:29.345\naround is because well, it's highly\noptimized for large file transfer.\n\n34\n00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:34.705\nIt makes it very easy to do exactly that,\nto move a file to a file\n\n35\n00:01:34.705 --> 00:01:39.065\nFTP server, to grab a file and\npull it down off that FTP server.\n\n36\n00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.535\nBut one of the things that we\nalways want to keep in mind is that\n\n37\n00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.425\nwhen this protocol was first invented.\n\n38\n00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:48.335\nI think we had only like five entities\non the backbone of the Internet in those\n\n39\n00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:48.965\ndays anyway.\n\n40\n00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:52.670\nSo there's not any security, there\nisn't any security built into this one.\n\n41\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.670\nWhich is one of the reasons we kind\nof shy away from it by itself.\n\n42\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.894\nAgain, I say that because we still can\ncouple it with things like secure copy\n\n43\n00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:03.342\nprotocol, SSH and we get things like SFTP.\n\n44\n00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:05.355\nSo it's still a great protocol but\n\n45\n00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:09.600\nit needs to be coupled with encryption\nbecause of its plain text nature.\n\n46\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.790\nIt uses a couple of ports.\n\n47\n00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.410\nAnd this is one that's interesting\nbecause, for the most part,\n\n48\n00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.050\na handful of these or less use a couple\nof ports, and not just a single port.\n\n49\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.397\nThis is one of the ones that uses two.\n\n50\n00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:25.680\nIt uses port 20 and it uses port 21.\n\n51\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.570\nRemember that your data is\nactually transferred over port 20.\n\n52\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.620\nAnd then over 21 is where you're\nsending the commands to and\n\n53\n00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220\nfrom the device that is\nacting as the FTP server.\n\n54\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.130\nSo do remember that.\n\n55\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.370\nI remember that when I was studying it,\none of the ways that I would remember it.\n\n56\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.018\nI would always think well,\ndata's more important than commands.\n\n57\n00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:45.749\nSo data over commands, 20, 21.\n\n58\n00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:48.480\nSo that might help you for\na little tip there in the exam.\n\n59\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.713\nIf you're trying to do some\nof these crazy memorization\n\n60\n00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:54.270\nthat sometimes can be\na little bit tedious.\n\n61\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.653\nSo, let's go ahead and\nshow you a little bit more about FTP.\n\n62\n00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:58.570\nIn fact, I'm on a Windows Server\nmachine machine here.\n\n63\n00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.550\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n64\n00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.500\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna bring up an FTP server.\n\n65\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.830\nFairly straightforward process,\nnot really too complex.\n\n66\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.360\nNow I will tell you before I start\nthat one of the prerequisites is that\n\n67\n00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.970\nyou have to have Microsoft's Web\nserver install a role, and that's IIS.\n\n68\n00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.800\nSo I've already got that installed.\n\n69\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.290\nThere's no reason to show you guys going\nthrough that process of installing IIS.\n\n70\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.390\nSo if you're in a lab environment,\nmaybe you're trying this at home,\n\n71\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.140\nmaybe you're working with a lab right now.\n\n72\n00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.870\nKeep in mind that you have to hit your\nIIS default installation installed.\n\n73\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.880\nAnd then you can come back and\njoin with us here.\n\n74\n00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.620\nSo now, this is actually\na feature that you have to add.\n\n75\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.140\nSo we're gonna go up to our server\nManager here, and up towards the top,\n\n76\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.440\nyou'll see we have this Add Roles and\nFeatures option.\n\n77\n00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.760\nWe're gonna go ahead Add Roles and\nFeatures.\n\n78\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.325\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and move through\na couple of these dialogue boxes.\n\n79\n00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:52.891\nThe dialogue boxes are great because,\nagain,\n\n80\n00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:55.240\nthey do give you a lot\nof information here.\n\n81\n00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.390\nBut for sake of demonstration,\nwe're gonna kinda skip through this.\n\n82\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.590\nWe are doing a roll based, or in this\ncase, a feature based installation.\n\n83\n00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.970\nWe'll go ahead and choose Next on this.\n\n84\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.080\nAnd you'll see that the server\nthat we're looking for\n\n85\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.060\nis the one by default\nthat is in this pool.\n\n86\n00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.120\nOne of the things I do kinda\nlike about Server Manager.\n\n87\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.140\nEven though sometimes it's a pain\nwaiting for it to start up and\n\n88\n00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.260\nrefresh its information.\n\n89\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.390\nIs the fact that you can manage all of\nyour servers from a single console.\n\n90\n00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.920\nNow that's kinda cool, especially when it\ncomes to centralized administration, but\n\n91\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.360\nthat's for another show.\n\n92\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.340\nAll right, we'll go ahead and choose Next.\n\n93\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.500\nAnd I'm not selecting a role.\n\n94\n00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.710\nAgain, if you guys are following along,\nmaybe you're setting this up.\n\n95\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.660\nOne of the things I will\ntell you is to go down here.\n\n96\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.000\nYou can actually add this feature\nof this role under the web server.\n\n97\n00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.018\nAll right, and you can see that I've\npretty much already got this installed for\n\n98\n00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:48.090\nyou, just to save a little\nbit of time here.\n\n99\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.200\nBut if it isn't installed,\nyou can install the web server itself.\n\n100\n00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200\nAnd these are just\nthe default installation.\n\n101\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.110\nI didn't add anything to this.\n\n102\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.640\nAnd then, I also do add,\n\n103\n00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.400\nas part of the non-default installation\nof IIS, is add FTP, the FTP server role.\n\n104\n00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.505\nAll right, so once that's done, you'll\ngo through the installation process and\n\n105\n00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:10.861\nthen it'll allow you to\nstart configuring it.\n\n106\n00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.370\nNow, once that's done, we get\nthe ability to go into our Tools option.\n\n107\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.370\nAnd the one that I'm looking for\nis the Internet Information Services.\n\n108\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.250\nI know I just kind of abbreviated IIS, but\n\n109\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.570\nthat's the Internet\nInformation Services Manager.\n\n110\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.930\nAgain, that's Microsoft's Web Server.\n\n111\n00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.380\nI know that some of you guys, if you're\nworking public facing web servers,\n\n112\n00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.140\nmost often they're going\nto be Apache servers.\n\n113\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.650\nThey're probably not going\nto be an IIS server.\n\n114\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.310\nBut at least this gives you\nthe idea of what's going on here.\n\n115\n00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.278\nSo let's go ahead, and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna go through just a very\n\n116\n00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:42.408\nsimplistic installation of FTP.\n\n117\n00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:46.860\nI'm gonna go over here, and\nwe're gonna expand out our server.\n\n118\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.350\nWe're gonna expand out Sites.\n\n119\n00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.010\nAnd you can see I've actually already got,\n\n120\n00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.630\nit looks like I've already got\na FTP server ready to go here.\n\n121\n00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.270\nBut tell you what, let's go ahead and\n\n122\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.630\nwe'll add another one just for\nthe heck of it.\n\n123\n00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.480\nSo you guys can see how that's done,\nall right?\n\n124\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.180\nWe're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna add an FTP site, all right?\n\n125\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.570\nIt's gonna ask us what the name is.\n\n126\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:13.290\nI'm gonna call this Demo Net for Net Plus,\nwe'll call it DemoNetPlusFTP, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.240\nPhysical path, I'm gonna put this in\nthe default route directory here, and\n\n128\n00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.820\nthat's inetpub.\n\n129\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.335\nAnd that is located under the local\ndisk C, you will see inetpub.\n\n130\n00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:27.580\nAnd if we open that up,\nyou will see there is ftproot right here.\n\n131\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.050\nAnd again guys,\nthese are all the defaults,\n\n132\n00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.060\nby the way, Nothing fancy on\nthis installation by any means.\n\n133\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.900\nI'm gonna choose Next.\n\n134\n00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.340\nNow remember the ports that\nwe were talking about.\n\n135\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.720\nBy default is on port 21,\n\n136\n00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.790\nI could change this but well, then it's\nnot gonna really be a good episode.\n\n137\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.690\nBecause then we're teaching\nyou non standard ports.\n\n138\n00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.570\nSo that's why I'm not changing it here.\n\n139\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.290\nSometimes people will change these ports.\n\n140\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.646\nIf they're only using it\ninternally they might say, well,\n\n141\n00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:51.995\neverybody knows it's port 21.\n\n142\n00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.969\nLet's just put it on port 2121.\n\n143\n00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.830\nBut If you've ever seen some\nof Dan's episodes on Nmap.\n\n144\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.177\nYou know that really only stops\nthe legitimate people when it\n\n145\n00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:00.875\ncomes down to it.\n\n146\n00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.233\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'll leave the defaults.\n\n147\n00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:04.726\nWe're not gonna do SSL,\n\n148\n00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:09.530\nI don't wanna set up a PKI just to\nget my FTP server involved with this.\n\n149\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.130\nBut remember what I told you.\n\n150\n00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.100\nThat's going to be clear text\ncommunication, that's bad.\n\n151\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.290\nThat's bad on an open network.\n\n152\n00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.700\nAnd it's one of the reasons we\nalways typically secure this.\n\n153\n00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.490\nBut it's a lot of\ninfrastructure to put in place.\n\n154\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.614\nSo we'll go ahead and just choose Next.\n\n155\n00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:26.131\nHere's another thing about FTP that we\nhave to worry about when it comes to\n\n156\n00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:26.705\nsecurity.\n\n157\n00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.080\nIs that it allows for\nanonymous log ons, right.\n\n158\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.165\nAnd that could lead to things\nlike FTP bounce attacks.\n\n159\n00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:34.225\nWhere if I could takeover your FTP server,\n\n160\n00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:37.365\nI can launch an attack\nfrom your FTP server.\n\n161\n00:07:37.365 --> 00:07:41.225\nSo this is not the way you\nwanna be doing this, but\n\n162\n00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:44.045\nit suits the purpose of\nshowing these ports.\n\n163\n00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:47.051\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and\nlet all users go ahead and\n\n164\n00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:48.420\nhave read and write access.\n\n165\n00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.840\nAnd we will finish this up, all right.\n\n166\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.772\nNow, once the FTP server's ready to go,\nthen we have to test it, right?\n\n167\n00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:57.610\nWe gotta connect to it, all right.\n\n168\n00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.920\nSo let's go ahead and let me make sure.\n\n169\n00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.188\nI'm pretty sure I still have\na document there in the FTP root.\n\n170\n00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:09.008\nThere we go,\nwe got our demo dock, all right.\n\n171\n00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:11.604\nNow, let's go ahead and let's test FTP.\n\n172\n00:08:11.604 --> 00:08:13.640\nWe're gonna come over to another machine,\nright?\n\n173\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.497\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n174\n00:08:15.497 --> 00:08:19.555\nI'm gonna launch up my\nCommand Prompt here, all right.\n\n175\n00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:20.976\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n176\n00:08:20.976 --> 00:08:24.250\nWe'll bump up the font just\na little bit here for you, guys.\n\n177\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.241\nMake it just a little bit easier to see.\n\n178\n00:08:27.241 --> 00:08:29.220\nAnd I'll change the font.\n\n179\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.785\nThere we go, all right.\n\n180\n00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:33.220\nSo now what we have to do is,\nwe're gonna type FTP.\n\n181\n00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.880\nAnd it takes us right into the FTP prompt.\n\n182\n00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.880\nNext thing we have to do\nis open the connections.\n\n183\n00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.257\nSo we're gonna type, open.\n\n184\n00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:42.549\nAnd then we're gonna type in either\nthe IP address, or we can in this case,\n\n185\n00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.585\nbecause they're on the same network and\nit's a domain controller,\n\n186\n00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:46.810\nI can use name resolution.\n\n187\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:47.620\nSo that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n188\n00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.878\nI'm gonna do SRV02.\n\n189\n00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:51.050\nAnd I'm gonna hit Enter.\n\n190\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.970\nNotice it says right here\nthat we've gotta successful.\n\n191\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.690\nThe command was successful.\n\n192\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.690\nNow I need to authenticate.\n\n193\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.520\nAll right, I need to prove who I am.\n\n194\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.434\nSo in this case I'm gonna do anonymous.\n\n195\n00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:10.030\nAnd notice it says\nanonymous access allowed.\n\n196\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.280\nThis is the first problem in your network\nif you've got somebody like Dan on your\n\n197\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.750\nnetwork that's got the nice little\nadministrative tools to check this out.\n\n198\n00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.120\nSo you do not want to do this\nin a production environment.\n\n199\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.200\nIt's for demonstration purposes and\nmy password is an a.\n\n200\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.910\nAnd I'm logged in.\n\n201\n00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.680\nThat's one of the reasons you gotta be\ncareful with anonymous logon, because it\n\n202\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.290\nsets a password, but the password isn't\nused to actually authenticate you.\n\n203\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.340\n&gt;&gt; Not only that, but you set read and\nwrite access for everyone, so\n\n204\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.120\nyou log in anonymously, and now you can\nstore files on Wes's anonymous login.\n\n205\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.100\nSo, the security's not great\non what we're showing you.\n\n206\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.360\nBut for demonstration purposes,\n\n207\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.770\nyou're getting the idea of\nwhat's going on with FTP.\n\n208\n00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.490\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely.\n\n209\n00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.189\nSo let's go ahead and let's do a get, and\nwe'll do, I have a demo doc up there, so\n\n210\n00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:53.360\nwe'll do demo doc.\n\n211\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.000\n.txt, all right, and\nit's opening the port.\n\n212\n00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.960\nNow my purpose here is to show\nyou that if I'm on this machine.\n\n213\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.390\nLet's go ahead and fire up WireShark,\nDan, and let's see what's going on here.\n\n214\n00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.760\nLet's see if we can find some\nof that FTP information.\n\n215\n00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.520\nI'm gonna go ahead and\npick the right interface.\n\n216\n00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.905\nMy virtual machine has prompted me\nto go into promiscuous mode here.\n\n217\n00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.631\nAll right, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna do,\n\n218\n00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:19.650\nlet's see if I can do a CTRL+C on this.\n\n219\n00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.880\nAnd then I'm gonna a disconnect,\nall right?\n\n220\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.275\nAnd then we will do an open one more time,\nSRV02.\n\n221\n00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:32.992\nAll right, we'll say anonymous,\nwe'll hit Enter, and\n\n222\n00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:36.656\nd is now my password,\nI've changed my mind.\n\n223\n00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:42.740\n[LAUGH] We're gonna do get,\nand we'll do demo doc.txt.\n\n224\n00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.730\nAnd it's gonna open that port again.\n\n225\n00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.260\nNow if I go ahead and I stop my wire,\nmy packet analysis or\n\n226\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.350\npacket analyser, protocol analyzer,\nand I do a filter for FTP.\n\n227\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.540\nI see a lot of information in here.\n\n228\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.710\nI see all of those FTP requests.\n\n229\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.150\nI see when I disconnected.\n\n230\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.869\nDisconnected, it gives\nyou a goodbye message.\n\n231\n00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:04.971\nI see the password.\n\n232\n00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:06.860\nLook at that, the password.\n\n233\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.720\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n\n234\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.328\n&gt;&gt; That's why Dan's saying, you just leave\nthis server on and wait till I get to it.\n\n235\n00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:14.240\nYou've gotta be careful.\n\n236\n00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.670\nAnd I'm kidding about that with Dan, but\n\n237\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.900\nthis was in a production environment,\nthat very well could happen.\n\n238\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.495\n&gt;&gt; Heads would roll.\n\n239\n00:11:19.495 --> 00:11:20.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.\n\n240\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.090\nIt might be what we call an RGE,\na resume generating event.\n\n241\n00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.130\nSo let's go ahead and\nI wanna look down here.\n\n242\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.260\nRemember that when we talk about ports,\nI should probably mention this,\n\n243\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.200\nFTP is an application layer protocol, but\n\n244\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.680\nthe ports get tacked on at\nthe transport layer, right?\n\n245\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.640\nI can see application layer FTP,\nand here's a transport layer.\n\n246\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.180\nWe talked about that,\nOSI Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n247\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.500\nAnd look at the Src Port, Src Port at 21.\n\n248\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.460\nAll right, so\nwe can see that the commands,\n\n249\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.748\nagain are being sent over Port 21,\ndata delivery is gonna be over Port 20.\n\n250\n00:11:54.748 --> 00:11:58.015\nSo that gives you an example of FTP.\n\n251\n00:11:58.015 --> 00:12:00.655\n&gt;&gt; Question, you almost got a two for\none sale on that one,\n\n252\n00:12:00.655 --> 00:12:03.162\nbecause you had to sell off the ISS and\nWindows.\n\n253\n00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:05.985\nWhich is a web server\nwhich resides on port 80.\n\n254\n00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:08.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It really does,\nyeah, so he has, that's right,\n\n255\n00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.448\nwe've got our two-for-one sale today,\nso port 80 for HTTP.\n\n256\n00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:14.860\nAnd I am going to show you some\nof those on live machines.\n\n257\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.607\nWhere we're gonna actually\nconnect out to the Internet.\n\n258\n00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:20.847\nAnd you could see some of the DNS\nname resolution that goes on aa well.\n\n259\n00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:24.975\nSo I was gonna try to do that with IIS,\nbut I was like, well,\n\n260\n00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:26.825\nthat's not very exciting.\n\n261\n00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:29.073\nI just connected with the local host and\nthat was it.\n\n262\n00:12:29.073 --> 00:12:33.615\nSo we're gonna see that in action it'll\nbe something that you could see in\n\n263\n00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:35.110\nthe real world here.\n\n264\n00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.540\nSNMP, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nmention this one, port 161,\n\n265\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:45.370\nwe've talked about SNM, Simple Network\nManagement Protocol in other episodes,\n\n266\n00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.480\nknow that it uses port 161, I'd say what?\n\n267\n00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.770\nWe'll go crazy here.\n\n268\n00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:56.520\nI'll show you how to set up\nSNMP of Windows machines here,\n\n269\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.140\nit's a feature within Windows.\n\n270\n00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.630\nSo we can go to my computer here.\n\n271\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.270\nWe're gonna go ahead, and we're gonna\nright-click on our Windows charm.\n\n272\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.960\nWe'll choose Programs and\nFeatures, all right?\n\n273\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.420\nAnd then I need to turn this feature on,\nbecause by default it isn't turned on.\n\n274\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.470\nSo we'll go ahead.\n\n275\n00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.560\nWe'll turn that on.\n\n276\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.440\nAll right, and we'll choose Next.\n\n277\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.980\nWe're gonna go through the installation\nof a feature, role or feature.\n\n278\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.710\nIn this case, it's gonna be\na feature-based installation.\n\n279\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:27.180\nAll right, it's not on the roles location,\nit's actually in features,\n\n280\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.970\nand if I scroll down here,\nyou can see this SMTP service, all right?\n\n281\n00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:39.510\nWindows has a little bit minor variation\non there, they also do something known as\n\n282\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.590\nWMI, Windows Management Instrumentation\nfiltering.\n\n283\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.870\nAnd when you open up SNMP,\nyou can see that,\n\n284\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.240\nby turning on SNMP,\nyou can also add the SNMP WMI Provider.\n\n285\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.020\nAgain, that's that Windows\nmanagement instrumentation.\n\n286\n00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.960\nWe'll choose next and\nwe'll choose install.\n\n287\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.820\nThat's really it.\n\n288\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.790\nNow it's up to us to configure\nthings like the communities.\n\n289\n00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:04.400\nIf it's gonna be a read-only community,\nif it's gonna be a read-write community,\n\n290\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.740\nin version two there, and\nwe can set that up as well.\n\n291\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.050\nVery, very easy process to do for\nthe most part.\n\n292\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:15.380\nJust gonna be something that you're going\nto do inside of your SNMP Services within\n\n293\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.510\nthe services console.\n\n294\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.471\nSo remember, SNMP?\n\n295\n00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:21.177\nThis is gonna be over port 161.\n\n296\n00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:23.666\nNow, the next one we have.\n\n297\n00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:24.740\nThe next one we have,\n\n298\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.679\nin fact I'm gonna kind of just go out of\norder just a little bit here on this one,\n\n299\n00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:32.960\nDan, so we can understand why SSH is\ngood [LAUGH] versus an older one, right?\n\n300\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.271\nSo far we've been talking\nabout some protocols.\n\n301\n00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:39.350\nFTP goes back to the earlier days of the\nARPANET, before we even had the Internet.\n\n302\n00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.360\nAnd this one also goes back that far too,\nand that's called Telnet.\n\n303\n00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.950\nTelnet is a remote log-on, basically\nit's a terminal emulation software.\n\n304\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.330\nAnd when you need to basically appear\nlike you're a terminal to connect in,\n\n305\n00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.230\nyou would use Telnet.\n\n306\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.760\nTelnet is over port 23, but\nthere's a problem, just like FTP.\n\n307\n00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.110\nIf you use Telnet, it is a clear,\n\n308\n00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:05.620\nor plain text protocol, so\nin connecting remotely, guess what?\n\n309\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.116\nI've been picking on Dan a lot, but\nlet's just keep on picking on Dan.\n\n310\n00:15:08.116 --> 00:15:10.836\nWhat if he's out there with\na protocol analyzer forming a man in\n\n311\n00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:12.540\nthe middle attack?\n\n312\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.850\nIt's very easy with Telnet.\n\n313\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.750\nAll he's got to do is scrape that\ninformation and it's going to output and\n\n314\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:21.680\nclear text and then he can use it to sit\nthere and hopefully, well, I say hopefully\n\n315\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.670\nfor his benefit, reverse engineer that or\nuse that information on an attack.\n\n316\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.779\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna say that I've done that,\nbut I've done that.\n\n317\n00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:30.326\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n318\n00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:32.010\n&gt;&gt; He didn't say that, that's right.\n\n319\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.450\nSo, that leads us to and\nI'll go ahead and minimize this for now,\n\n320\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.150\nthat leads us to our next\nprotocol which is SSH.\n\n321\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.290\nAnd in fact, Telnet,\nyou might ask yourself, well,\n\n322\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.104\ndoes Telnet not really hae\na use in our networks?\n\n323\n00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:46.610\nNo, not really, it does.\n\n324\n00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.590\nYou can use it to test things\nlike whether ports are open.\n\n325\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.683\nLet me give you an example here.\n\n326\n00:15:51.683 --> 00:15:55.895\nFor instance,\nif I'm on my other machine here,\n\n327\n00:15:55.895 --> 00:16:00.428\nand I'll go ahead and\nclose that down and reopen it.\n\n328\n00:16:00.428 --> 00:16:05.193\nIf I wanted to, let's say for instance\nI wanted to find out Port 3389 for\n\n329\n00:16:05.193 --> 00:16:08.263\nremote desktop protocol\nis open on that server.\n\n330\n00:16:08.263 --> 00:16:13.348\nWell, I could always do a telnet,\nand I could do, in this case I'll do\n\n331\n00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:18.890\nthe IP address of that server, and\nthen I could do something like 3389.\n\n332\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.110\nNotice how it's blinking?\n\n333\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.340\nIf it's blinking that lets me\nknow that that port's open.\n\n334\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.360\nAll right, now I don't know if it's gonna\naccept any commands and I highly doubt\n\n335\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.850\nit's gonna accept any commands but\nI can tell, yeah, port 3389 is open.\n\n336\n00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.900\nNow there's other things that are a lot\neasier to do this with like nmap, Dan and\n\n337\n00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.050\nI were talking about this before.\n\n338\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.130\nJust do a port scan against it\nyou can find that port too.\n\n339\n00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.450\nBut what if I don't have that port, right?\n\n340\n00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.040\nWell I do have sometimes a telnet client\nbuilt into the systems that I can use.\n\n341\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.740\nAnd if I don't have Internet access at\nleast I can do it this way as well.\n\n342\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.800\nTelnet does have some usage\ninside of our networks,\n\n343\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.840\njust not the way I think it was\noriginally designed to do remote log-ons.\n\n344\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.610\n&gt;&gt; May have some legacy systems\nlying around that do not support\n\n345\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.980\nan encrypted protocol so you got to go\nwith telnet because it does support that.\n\n346\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.450\nThat does happen from time to time.\n\n347\n00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.510\n&gt;&gt; And I believe, on that note, I belive\nIBM had their proprietary telnet So\n\n348\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.600\nthey have their own Telnet and\nown Telnet switches.\n\n349\n00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.280\nNow that's pretty old, though.\n\n350\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.330\nSo there might be a use for that.\n\n351\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.280\nHere's another one that\nwe might wanna look at.\n\n352\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.610\nHow about SSH?\n\n353\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.300\nNow SSH, the Secure Shell,\nthat goes over port 22.\n\n354\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.830\nNow, what is it doing for us?\n\n355\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.550\nWell unlike telnet, when I use SSH,\n\n356\n00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:36.010\nit uses a series of keys in order\nto encrypt the information.\n\n357\n00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.280\nSo I get a tunnel, if you will and\nthat information going\n\n358\n00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.510\nover that tunnel is encrypted so\nnow if somebody's out there and\n\n359\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.500\nthey're performing a man in the middle\nattack, I don't want to say that you can't\n\n360\n00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.350\nbreak it but it'll be a lot more difficult\nto find out what that information is.\n\n361\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.380\nLet’s see if I can show you that.\n\n362\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.760\nIn fact, we got a machine over here and\nI'm going to go ahead and\n\n363\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.960\nI'll fire up Putty and we'll make\n\n364\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.080\na connection to a sent off server\nthat I've got in the background here.\n\n365\n00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.070\nSo, see if I can remember\nwhat that IP address was.\n\n366\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.330\nI think it was .231 and\nI'll go ahead and do an open here.\n\n367\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.330\nAnd I got a login screen here.\n\n368\n00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.210\nLet's go ahead and let's fire up Wireshark\nbefore we start making this connection.\n\n369\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.590\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ndo a continue without saving.\n\n370\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.120\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna log on here.\n\n371\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.800\nSo let me go ahead and\nlog on as root, right?\n\n372\n00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.640\nJust kidding I won't do that.\n\n373\n00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.490\nAll right this is gonna take a second.\n\n374\n00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.520\nIt's going to send that over to the sent\nserver and it should challenge me for\n\n375\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520\na password here in a second.\n\n376\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.640\nIt might take just a second here.\n\n377\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.990\nI've seen before where it takes\nthere we go it takes a little bit.\n\n378\n00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.950\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n379\n00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.140\nAnd we are logged in and\n\n380\n00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.040\nDan what is that you name dash r\nI believe shows you the version?\n\n381\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.790\nOkay so I just wanted to show\nyou guys that this is box here.\n\n382\n00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.970\nAnd you can see\nthe information right there.\n\n383\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.930\nNow, Dan, it looks like I left my ftp\nfilter in, so that's not gonna help.\n\n384\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.000\nI probably should remove that.\n\n385\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's always a good idea to\nremove the filter so that you can see all\n\n386\n00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.860\nthe other traffic, unless you wanted\nthe ftp traffic, then that would be good.\n\n387\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.105\n&gt;&gt; No, and I don't think that's really\ngonna help us with the SSH protocol there.\n\n388\n00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:06.235\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n389\n00:19:06.235 --> 00:19:09.785\nLet me remove that filter and\nwe'll put SSH here.\n\n390\n00:19:09.785 --> 00:19:14.615\nNow you can that there is encrypted\ninformation and it's not like, for\n\n391\n00:19:14.615 --> 00:19:17.180\ninstance FTP,\nI can see passwords and stuff.\n\n392\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.360\nWe got a bunch of garbled output, but\nthat's not really what I care about,\n\n393\n00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.750\nwhat I wanna see is this right here,\n\n394\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.060\nif you see that's there's\na destination port for SSH,\n\n395\n00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:34.010\nif you see that port 22 there, and\nthat's the default port, just like in FTP,\n\n396\n00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:38.030\nand probably you can change the port that\nit's on but it doesn't necessarily mean\n\n397\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.500\nthat whoever the end is that's listening\nis gonna be listening on a non standard\n\n398\n00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:47.805\nport so again we do want to make sure that\nwe understand that that is on port 22.\n\n399\n00:19:47.805 --> 00:19:52.355\nAll right so\nthat brings us to a couple of other\n\n400\n00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:55.945\nreally really cool protocols but\nthen looking at that clock I don't know,\n\n401\n00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:58.355\nyou wanna do one or two more,\nyou wanna safe that for part two.\n\n402\n00:19:58.355 --> 00:20:01.815\n&gt;&gt; We got some time we can go\na little longer if we need to.\n\n403\n00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:05.745\n&gt;&gt; All right sounds good so\nlet's go ahead and let's look at another\n\n404\n00:20:05.745 --> 00:20:10.130\nvery very important protocol and\nthat is one well, known as DNS, right.\n\n405\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.940\nDomain name system in fact I bet you\nI can almost bet you that if I took\n\n406\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.280\nthe filter off and hit enter that I\nwill find some kind of DNS in here.\n\n407\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.490\nNow, I can say things like our\nInternet control message protocol.\n\n408\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.160\nI could see transmission\ncontrol protocol happened.\n\n409\n00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.120\nAll kinds of hard times doing\nreassembles and stuff like that.\n\n410\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.040\nBut what I really want in here let's see\nif we could find some DNS There we go.\n\n411\n00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:38.480\nAll right, so DNS, you'll notice that with\nDNS we have a destination port of 53.\n\n412\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.860\nNow this one's interesting because, and\nI do wanna call this out, we had talked\n\n413\n00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.000\npretty extensively about TCP, transmission\ncontrol protocol, being connection\n\n414\n00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.690\noriented and user datagram protocol being\nthe best ever delivery connections.\n\n415\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.950\nPut it in the mail, walk away from it and\ndarn I hope it gets there.\n\n416\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:58.070\nBut here's where it gets a little tricky,\n\n417\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:03.090\nmaybe a little more confusing if anything\nelse is DNS uses both TCP and UDP.\n\n418\n00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.910\n&gt;&gt; And it's the same port.\n\n419\n00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:05.770\n&gt;&gt; And it's the same port.\n\n420\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.470\nSo what the heck is going on with that.\n\n421\n00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.380\nWell, the user datagram\nprotocol version of this, UDP,\n\n422\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:19.310\nor port 53 over UDP, or DNS over UDP,\nis when I just need a response.\n\n423\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.690\nI have a name, I need an ID address,\nI need to resolve them.\n\n424\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.610\nI don't need\na connection-oriented service.\n\n425\n00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.170\nI just need my answer back, right?\n\n426\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.590\nSo, it's sent over UDP.\n\n427\n00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:34.020\nBut then there's times where you'll\nsee that this port is over TCP,\n\n428\n00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.850\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n429\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.430\nNow what kind of communication\ncould DNS be giving me\n\n430\n00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:44.660\nthat would require\na connection-oriented service, nothing.\n\n431\n00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.240\nIt's not when he talks or it talks to you.\n\n432\n00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.220\nIt's when it talks to another DNS server\nand it needs to do a zone transfer.\n\n433\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.130\nI don't want that zone transfer,\nthat important information that\n\n434\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.110\ncontains the DNS zone file\ninformation being corrupted.\n\n435\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:04.020\nSo you better believe when two DNS servers\ntalk together they're gonna do it over\n\n436\n00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.490\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n437\n00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.430\nNow let me throw you a little caveat.\n\n438\n00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.610\nIf for whatever reason that server\nneeded to do name resolution,\n\n439\n00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.870\nit's gonna use UDP as well so,\n\n440\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.590\ntechnically I believe you could say\nthat the DNS server would be using both.\n\n441\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:21.430\nIf it just needs to resolve a name,\njust as a DNS client that's gonna use UDP.\n\n442\n00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.950\nWhen it can edge to another DNS server,\nand it needs to transfer that zone file\n\n443\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.980\nand the zone information whether it's\ndoing an AFXR an IFXR, the incremental or\n\n444\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.130\nthe full zone transfer, it's gonna be\nusing transmission control protocol.\n\n445\n00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:41.000\nAnd that's where you see the two\ndifferent communication types.\n\n446\n00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.060\nOne of the last ones we'll throw\nin here Dan is well good old DHCP.\n\n447\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.180\nAnd how do we see DHCP?\n\n448\n00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.740\nWell, it's fairly easy.\n\n449\n00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.320\nLet me go ahead and stop this zone,\nnow I've got DNS on mine.\n\n450\n00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.730\nLet me stop this capture here and\nI'm gonna start a new one and\n\n451\n00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.840\nI'm gonna start it without saving.\n\n452\n00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.980\nAll right, so we've got another\none that's going off right here.\n\n453\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.200\n&gt;&gt; Don't forget to remove your filter.\n\n454\n00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.700\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna remove my filter.\n\n455\n00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.850\nThank you Dan I appreciate it,\ngot my back on that one.\n\n456\n00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:09.670\nAnd here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n457\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.450\nI'm gonna kinda fake this\ninto doing the door process.\n\n458\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.950\nWell it's not gonna fake anything, it's\njust gonna try it, it's just gonna fail.\n\n459\n00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.570\nAnd the goo thing I can show\nyou this is because DHCP\n\n460\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.820\nuses two completely different ports.\n\n461\n00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.880\nPort 68 and port 67.\n\n462\n00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.140\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n463\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.360\nI'm just gonna go in here\nto my network adapter.\n\n464\n00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.290\nAll right, I've got my capture on.\n\n465\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:34.690\nI'm gonna right click on ethernet one,\nI'm gonna choose properties.\n\n466\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.330\nAnd from the properties,\nTCPIP properties, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n467\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:45.055\nswitch over to DHCP and\nI'm gonna choose close, all right?\n\n468\n00:23:45.055 --> 00:23:47.315\nNow this happened before on me so\nlet me go ahead,\n\n469\n00:23:47.315 --> 00:23:50.736\nI'm gonna let this finish cuz now what\nit's doing is it's technically in\n\n470\n00:23:50.736 --> 00:23:53.352\nthe background it's going\nto that door process again.\n\n471\n00:23:53.352 --> 00:23:56.045\nIt's calling out, it's saying hey,\nanybody out there got an IP address?\n\n472\n00:23:56.045 --> 00:23:58.826\nBut one of the things I can see\nis I didn't get any information.\n\n473\n00:23:58.826 --> 00:24:04.053\nSo I know now what that is It didn't like\nfor some reason starting a new wire or\n\n474\n00:24:04.053 --> 00:24:08.066\na packet capture, so\nI'm going to reopen the interface.\n\n475\n00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:09.073\n&gt;&gt; Easy enough.\n&gt;&gt; And we'll do that again.\n\n476\n00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:10.194\nYeah, we'll do that again.\n\n477\n00:24:10.194 --> 00:24:13.943\nI know we're a little pressed for\ntime on this one, but let's go ahead and\n\n478\n00:24:13.943 --> 00:24:15.895\nlet's configure that one more time.\n\n479\n00:24:15.895 --> 00:24:18.745\nWe're going to just go back to\na static assignment real quick.\n\n480\n00:24:21.397 --> 00:24:24.806\nNow, all right 10.150.\n\n481\n00:24:24.806 --> 00:24:26.389\nAnd it doesn't really matter.\n\n482\n00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:30.230\nSo we'd just go ahead it'd be 10.10, oops.\n\n483\n00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.318\nWe'll say that 10.10.10.100.\n\n484\n00:24:33.318 --> 00:24:35.792\nWe choose okay and close.\n\n485\n00:24:35.792 --> 00:24:37.870\nLet me minimize this.\n\n486\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:38.700\nAll right, there we go.\n\n487\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.760\nWe can see some traffic going.\n\n488\n00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.630\nThat's what I wanted to see.\n\n489\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.694\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; I wanted to see that\n\n490\n00:24:41.694 --> 00:24:43.180\ninformation moving there.\n\n491\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.060\nAnd for whatever reason,\nWireshark didn't like me stopping that and\n\n492\n00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.440\nstarting a new capture.\n\n493\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.330\nSo now we'll see it.\n\n494\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.535\nAnd I'm going to do the same\nexact process, guys.\n\n495\n00:24:50.535 --> 00:24:55.050\nAgain, if you're watching at home and\nyou've got access to the Wireshark or\n\n496\n00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.830\nsomething like that,\nyou can do this very thing.\n\n497\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.800\nAll I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change\nit from a static assignment to DHCP, so\n\n498\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.190\nit starts the DHCP process.\n\n499\n00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.270\nAnd I'm gonna choose Close.\n\n500\n00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.350\nAnd now what it's doing is it's\ngoing through that door process.\n\n501\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.640\nAnd it's calling out with the discovery\npacket, it's saying, hey,\n\n502\n00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.880\nanybody out there?\n\n503\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.160\nGot an IP address?\n\n504\n00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.840\nSo how is it doing that?\n\n505\n00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.080\nWell, it's actually sending it.\n\n506\n00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.770\nWe've talked about the default route\n0.0.0.0, that's everybody on the network,\n\n507\n00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.540\nall networks.\n\n508\n00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.200\nAnd that all 255s in\nthe network broadcast range,\n\n509\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.990\nit basically calls out to everybody.\n\n510\n00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.650\nLet's see what we're talking about here,\nall right.\n\n511\n00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.220\nNow that that's done,\nI'm gonna go ahead and stop this.\n\n512\n00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.335\nAnd I'm going to put in a filter of DHCP.\n\n513\n00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:40.460\nBut Dan I know you've\nseen Wireshark before.\n\n514\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.028\nApparently I got a problem here right,\nDHCP is not there.\n\n515\n00:25:43.028 --> 00:25:43.701\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't like that red.\n\n516\n00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:44.845\n&gt;&gt; What is that?\n\n517\n00:25:44.845 --> 00:25:50.356\nWell, technically the very\nfirst part of the DORA process\n\n518\n00:25:50.356 --> 00:25:56.438\nis actually done by this\nprotocol's ancestor, called bootp.\n\n519\n00:25:56.438 --> 00:26:01.572\nAnd that is something you can see if\nyou change it to the bootp protocol.\n\n520\n00:26:01.572 --> 00:26:05.001\nBut what's interesting,\nWireshark still labels it as DHCP.\n\n521\n00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:08.493\nSo I just wanted to let you know if you,\nthat one tripped me up for a while,\n\n522\n00:26:08.493 --> 00:26:10.348\nI'm like, I know there is a door pro.\n\n523\n00:26:10.348 --> 00:26:12.028\nI've been teaching this for seven years,\n\n524\n00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:13.950\nthere is a door process\ngoing on here somewhere.\n\n525\n00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.080\n&gt;&gt; And that's a Wireshark weirdness,\nright?\n\n526\n00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.246\nDon't think,\nwe were gonna go see the Net+ exam and\n\n527\n00:26:18.246 --> 00:26:20.328\nthey are gonna try to hit\nyou with BOOTP versus DHCP.\n\n528\n00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:22.386\nThey're gonna say, what is BOOTP?\n\n529\n00:26:22.386 --> 00:26:23.081\nWhat does it do?\n\n530\n00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:25.990\nWhat courses it rely on and there you go.\n\n531\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.490\nIt's going to stick with the DHCP.\n\n532\n00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.290\n&gt;&gt; And I'm glad you said that.\n\n533\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.150\nKnow the door process,\nknow what associated with DHCP.\n\n534\n00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:38.270\nThe point of this is to show you\nthat it is using the DHCP ports.\n\n535\n00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.834\nRemember I said two ports there?\n\n536\n00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:41.431\nPort 68 and port 67?\n\n537\n00:26:41.431 --> 00:26:43.040\nWell, what's going on there?\n\n538\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.670\nHow is it using two ports?\n\n539\n00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.680\nWell, the client.\n\n540\n00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.690\nThe client uses port 68 to call out and\nsay, hey, I need something.\n\n541\n00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.450\nWhen the offers come back,\nin this case they didn't, but\n\n542\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.100\nwhen the offers do come back,\nthey're gonna come to you over port 67.\n\n543\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.340\nSo there's another example like\nFTP of one that uses two ports.\n\n544\n00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.790\nRemember, 68 is the client and 67, that's\ngonna be, did I say that right Mike?\n\n545\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.550\nYeah, 68 is the client and\n67 is the server.\n\n546\n00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.820\nSo know those ports.\n\n547\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.960\nNow, I've got a few more ports\nthat we're going to show you,\n\n548\n00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.010\nbut I don't think we have\nenough time in this episode.\n\n549\n00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now we've kind of exhausted\nthe time we have left in the show.\n\n550\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.930\nSo we'll see definitely have to\nmove on to a part two on that.\n\n551\n00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.390\nLooking forward to it,\nhope to see you there, Wesley,\n\n552\n00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.830\nI hope to see our good\nviewer there as well.\n\n553\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.210\nLooks like we have come to that time on\nthe show, though, for us to sign off.\n\n554\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.172\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n555\n00:27:28.172 --> 00:27:29.165\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n556\n00:27:29.165 --> 00:27:30.518\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n557\n00:27:32.620 -->

greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.426\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:18.110\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.260\nAnd today's episode we are continuing\nall of more Net Plus series specifically\n\n10\n00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.300\nback for a part two on ports and\nprotocols.\n\n11\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.490\nAnd joining us back in the studio yet\n\n12\n00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.560\nagain to continue that conversation,\nour good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n13\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.332\nWes, welcome back man.\n\n14\n00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:31.661\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man, it's going great.\n\n15\n00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:33.900\nYeah, we had a few more protocols\nthat we had to round off.\n\n16\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.628\n&gt;&gt; One or two.\n\n17\n00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:37.328\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe talked about in the first episode,\n\n18\n00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:40.570\nwe talked about things like FTP and\nwe mentioned the porch there.\n\n19\n00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.983\nAnd demonstrated it as well,\nthings like SSH, Telnet, and DNS.\n\n20\n00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.212\nWe also talked about what\nelse other than DHCP?\n\n21\n00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:52.805\nWe talked about the port values, we talked\na little bit about the difference between\n\n22\n00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:55.473\nport 68, port 67 client versus the server.\n\n23\n00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.594\nOther one that I wanted to, and\nI could have mentioned it on\n\n24\n00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:03.560\nthe first part of this but\nI didn't, and that's TFTP.\n\n25\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.069\nThat's trivial file transfer protocol,\nthis is pretty much\n\n26\n00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:13.130\nthe same protocol is FTP, but\none of the big differences is over UDP.\n\n27\n00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.697\nSee, file transfer protocol is you\nneed a connection oriented service and\n\n28\n00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:19.312\nthe transmission protocol's\nwhat you're gonna be.\n\n29\n00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:22.440\nBut with the trivial file\ntransfer protocol, it's used for\n\n30\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.969\nthings like downloading\nconfiguration files.\n\n31\n00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.190\nLike for instance, if I got a network\nsetup with a bunch of thin clients, right?\n\n32\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.819\nWhat's gonna happen is they don't\nhave their operating system or\n\n33\n00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.642\ntheir configurations locally.\n\n34\n00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:38.843\nThey have a slim line operating system,\nbut\n\n35\n00:01:38.843 --> 00:01:42.893\nwhat they're gonna do is they're gonna\nuse TFT to pull down their configuration\n\n36\n00:01:42.893 --> 00:01:45.500\nfile to the local device\nin order to configure it.\n\n37\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.724\nOther things that might use TFTP as well,\nyou could see things like for\n\n38\n00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:53.893\ninstance PXE boot as well when I'm\nlooking for an operating system.\n\n39\n00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:58.670\nI'm calling out to the network, so just\nkeep in mind that TFTP doesn't support\n\n40\n00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.825\na lot of the commands that FTP does.\n\n41\n00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:05.873\nAgain a very stripped down in nature and\nyou're not going to do a lot of\n\n42\n00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:10.760\ncommand work if you will with it,\nso that uses port 69 by the way.\n\n43\n00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.169\nA couple of other ports that we have too.\n\n44\n00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:18.784\nWe've got one that's been around for\na while, that's SMB, Server Message Block.\n\n45\n00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:22.966\nWhat we're currently using and\nbelieve it or not is version two, but\n\n46\n00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:26.512\nthe good thing about it is we\ncan see SMB ports on port 45.\n\n47\n00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:27.664\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you that.\n\n48\n00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:32.369\nI've got our wire shut network\nanalyzer here and we'll go ahead.\n\n49\n00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.444\nAnd we'll start a packet capture here,\nand then let's go ahead and\n\n50\n00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:39.673\nwhat we are gonna do is we\nare gonna use share, right?\n\n51\n00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:42.613\nWe are gonna connect to\na share over the network and\n\n52\n00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:45.066\nsee if we can generate some traffic here.\n\n53\n00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.783\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nuse a backslash backslash here and\n\n54\n00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:51.110\nI'll talk about some of the stuff\nthat's going on the background here.\n\n55\n00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.799\n&gt;&gt; Now like you already have\npackets being used slash slash.\n\n56\n00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.430\nOkay, and this is a network share.\n\n57\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.670\nIt's already starting to\nlook at that information.\n\n58\n00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.558\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n59\n00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:03.586\nSo let's go ahead and we'll do that\ntraditional UNC path like Dan mentioned,\n\n60\n00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.773\nwe'll do and srvo,\napparently I keep closing it down there.\n\n61\n00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:11.214\nIt might end up having to bring\nup my runline there, srv01.\n\n62\n00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:15.961\nAnd it might help to\nactually use a UNC path 1\\.\n\n63\n00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:16.629\n&gt;&gt; That's fun.\n\n64\n00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.554\n&gt;&gt; That's fun,\nI'm just gonna use the runline here.\n\n65\n00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:20.683\nWe're gonna use \\\\.\n\n66\n00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.381\n&gt;&gt; More than one way to skin a cat.\n\n67\n00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.658\n&gt;&gt; There is, there is apparently.\n\n68\n00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:27.690\n[LAUGH] Srv, and\nit does help if you spell it right.\n\n69\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.489\nWe'll do C$, and\nwe'll go ahead and connect.\n\n70\n00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.705\nAnd you know what?\n\n71\n00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.876\nHere's something that I forgot,\nthat will not help me,\n\n72\n00:03:36.876 --> 00:03:41.253\nif you remember at the end of the last\nepisode, I showed you guys how to do DHCP.\n\n73\n00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.479\n&gt;&gt; Kind of fiddled with\nthe adapter settings-\n\n74\n00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.999\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.573\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A little bit.\n\n76\n00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:48.032\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead and let's do some\nnetwork management here real quick.\n\n77\n00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:49.946\n&gt;&gt; This is real networking,\n[LAUGH] we're happening right here.\n\n78\n00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:50.963\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Why is this not\n\n79\n00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.870\ngetting access to the network share?\n\n80\n00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.655\nWell you're not on the network\nthat has the network share, so\n\n81\n00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:55.490\nthat's gonna be a problem.\n\n82\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.521\n&gt;&gt; That is definitely gonna be\nthe problem and let's go ahead, and\n\n83\n00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:00.610\nwe'll use our DC as our domain controller.\n\n84\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.800\nThere we go, and let's try that again.\n\n85\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.180\nIt does help to be on the same\nnetwork as the share.\n\n86\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.537\nBoom, it shows up.\n\n87\n00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.041\nBoy, networks are great, aren't they?\n\n88\n00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:09.113\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n89\n00:04:09.113 --> 00:04:10.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And so I'm essentially,\n\n90\n00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:14.440\nyou guys are coming over for me plus\nprobably know what's going on here.\n\n91\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.742\nI've connected to the administrative share\nin this case on the domain controller.\n\n92\n00:04:17.742 --> 00:04:22.741\nBut the purpose is not so much to show\nyou what an administrative share is.\n\n93\n00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:26.411\nBut we'll go ahead and\nstop this name capture here or I'm sorry,\n\n94\n00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.955\nthis packet capture here.\n\n95\n00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:31.499\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna look up SMB.\n\n96\n00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:37.840\nAnd you might see that it tells me right\naway that hey, this is SMB version 2.\n\n97\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.890\nSo we'll go ahead we'll enter that filter.\n\n98\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.326\nAnd boy,\nI got a lot of traffic going on here.\n\n99\n00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:44.378\nAnd you can see the source\nport is port 445,\n\n100\n00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:47.130\nthat's one of the things that\nI want you to keep in mind.\n\n101\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.830\nYou could see that\na negotiation's going on.\n\n102\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.086\nThe source port is 445, but\nI bet if we went to the request here,\n\n103\n00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:55.748\nI'd see the destination port is 445.\n\n104\n00:04:55.748 --> 00:04:59.469\nAgain this is one of the reasons\nwhen we talk about ports,\n\n105\n00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:01.413\nyou can modify them, right?\n\n106\n00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:05.271\nAnd in fact when we get to showing\nyou some of our local traffic here,\n\n107\n00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.875\nwhen we talk about web traffic\nit's not using a standard port.\n\n108\n00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.316\nWhich is why I wanna show you\nconnecting to an outbound web server,\n\n109\n00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:15.404\na web server out there on the Internet,\nso you can see that.\n\n110\n00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:17.330\n&gt;&gt; Plus the whole client server thing,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.959\nThe server is running on port 445,\nso if I'm on the client,\n\n112\n00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.747\nI'm contacting port 445.\n\n113\n00:05:22.747 --> 00:05:26.383\nIf I'm the server,\nI'm sending information from port 445.\n\n114\n00:05:26.383 --> 00:05:29.122\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you could think of it\nalmost like an extension, right?\n\n115\n00:05:29.122 --> 00:05:33.528\nIf you're on extension 445,\nbut I dial extension 4445.\n\n116\n00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:34.208\n&gt;&gt; You got the wrong guy.\n\n117\n00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.521\n&gt;&gt; I do, Dan's like,\nyou should have called me.\n\n118\n00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:37.937\nI told you what my extension was, right?\n\n119\n00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.065\n&gt;&gt; I like that analogy, actually.\n\n120\n00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:40.394\nIt's a really good way\nof thinking about it.\n\n121\n00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:44.041\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nyou can use any extension number you want.\n\n122\n00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:45.723\nBut it doesn't mean somebody's\ngonna pick up and the phone and\n\n123\n00:05:45.723 --> 00:05:46.941\nyou're gonna be listening\non the other end.\n\n124\n00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:50.137\nSo yes,\nsometimes we do modify standard ports.\n\n125\n00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:53.566\nBut that's not what they're gonna\nbe asking you on the exam, so\n\n126\n00:05:53.566 --> 00:05:55.357\nplease do know all of these port.\n\n127\n00:05:55.357 --> 00:05:59.244\nSo there is our SMB, and if we get\ndown here to the application layer,\n\n128\n00:05:59.244 --> 00:06:02.140\nwe could say that we are just negotiating,\nright?\n\n129\n00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.370\nI believe somewhere in here, you can\nactually see if I scroll back out and\n\n130\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.220\nget out of the application layer here.\n\n131\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.379\nYou can sometimes even see\nthe information because again,\n\n132\n00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.108\nwe're not talking about\nencrypted traffic here.\n\n133\n00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:19.876\nIn fact, if I go back and\nscroll back up, yeah look,\n\n134\n00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:22.968\nit even knows what the UNC path is, right?\n\n135\n00:06:22.968 --> 00:06:28.772\nIt sees my server name, and I don't know,\nI wanna say even if I create a folder,\n\n136\n00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:32.670\nit's gonna show you that\ninformation in here.\n\n137\n00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.222\nSo you gotta be really careful with SMB,\nagain application layer protocol there.\n\n138\n00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:40.578\nAnother one that they call out,\nand did I mention the port?\n\n139\n00:06:40.578 --> 00:06:42.920\nYeah, I did mention the port, it's 445.\n\n140\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.121\nRemember the destination port like Dan\nsaid earlier, and that's gonna be what\n\n141\n00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:50.326\nthe server's listening on\nbecause this is the source port.\n\n142\n00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.769\nIt means that it's the server\nresponding back to me,\n\n143\n00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:54.953\nthat's all I can tell\nthe difference between.\n\n144\n00:06:54.953 --> 00:06:57.890\nIs it the client that's talking or\nis it the server that's talking?\n\n145\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.275\nBecause you'll see that for\ninstance in a set up request,\n\n146\n00:07:02.275 --> 00:07:05.686\nnotice that the destination port is 445.\n\n147\n00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:09.999\nThe source port,\nhigh level port above that 49152 or\n\n148\n00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.532\n151 into the 152 range is a private port.\n\n149\n00:07:13.532 --> 00:07:18.350\nLet's mean no, that is my computer,\nand I'm sending it to the server.\n\n150\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.488\nAnd notice the session setup response\nright here, if I go ahead and\n\n151\n00:07:23.488 --> 00:07:28.369\nselect that there,\nyou can see that the source port is 445.\n\n152\n00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:32.960\nThat tells me that it's actually coming\nfrom the server back to this computer.\n\n153\n00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.758\nNow speaking of ports and stuff here,\n\n154\n00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:40.404\nyou might notice this NetBIOS over here,\nand if I open this up.\n\n155\n00:07:40.404 --> 00:07:44.883\nI don't know if we're gonna actually\nsee the information in here.\n\n156\n00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:49.393\nBut NetBIOS is another one of these\nports that we find in windows,\n\n157\n00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:52.109\nit's been around for a very long time.\n\n158\n00:07:52.109 --> 00:07:56.565\nWe've been saying for a while it is gonna\ngo away, because it's a flat naming space.\n\n159\n00:07:56.565 --> 00:08:01.151\nIt uses broadcast communications, but\nyou do have to know a little bit about it.\n\n160\n00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.351\nAnd this is interesting cuz its got\nthree different port like for instance,\n\n161\n00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.791\nI can see, NetBIOS section server is here.\n\n162\n00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:10.671\nSession servers are actually a port 139,\n\n163\n00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:13.716\nyou'll also see things\nlike naming services.\n\n164\n00:08:13.716 --> 00:08:19.435\nAnd athose are port 137 which is what name\nNetBIOS is, it's a naming service, right?\n\n165\n00:08:19.435 --> 00:08:21.971\nAnd let me show you that, inside,\n\n166\n00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.735\nif you're doing a Wireshark\npacket capture here.\n\n167\n00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:33.047\nInstead of putting NetBIOS in Wireshark,\nyou would do NB, for NetBIOS, NS.\n\n168\n00:08:33.047 --> 00:08:36.591\nAnd what that stands for\nis the NetBIOS naming service.\n\n169\n00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.539\nThe naming service actually\ngoes over port 137,\n\n170\n00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.760\nwhich is one of the ports\nthat they call out.\n\n171\n00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.571\nI'm not sure if we're gonna get any,\n\n172\n00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:47.068\nit doesn't look like we're\ngonna get any NetBIOS.\n\n173\n00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.287\nI'll tell you what,\nhow about this, we can start.\n\n174\n00:08:50.287 --> 00:08:52.482\nLet me go ahead and\nstart my packet capture over.\n\n175\n00:08:52.482 --> 00:08:55.691\nWe'll just go ahead and\nquit this, all right?\n\n176\n00:08:55.691 --> 00:08:59.919\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start\nthe Wireshark packet capture up again,\n\n177\n00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.170\nmake sure I got the right network adapter.\n\n178\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.905\nAnd we're gonna do that same thing,\nbecause believe it or not, I'm using\n\n179\n00:09:05.905 --> 00:09:10.160\nNetBIOS to find that administrative\nshare that we just connected.\n\n180\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.672\nIt was just back there in the earlier\nparts of that conversation between\n\n181\n00:09:13.672 --> 00:09:14.850\nthe client and server.\n\n182\n00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.821\nSo I'll go ahead and\n\n183\n00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:19.086\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nbring up another wire capture here.\n\n184\n00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:21.639\nWe've got in running and\ndoesn't it look amazing?\n\n185\n00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.813\n&gt;&gt; It's awesome, lot of data there.\n\n186\n00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.693\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\nwe're gonna generate some NetBIOS traffic.\n\n187\n00:09:27.693 --> 00:09:30.701\nSo I'm gonna go back to well,\nI'm gonna go back to the runline here.\n\n188\n00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:31.814\n&gt;&gt; You mean,\nyou actually have to do stuff?\n\n189\n00:09:31.814 --> 00:09:32.759\n&gt;&gt; You got to do stuff here.\n\n190\n00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:33.500\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n191\n00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.910\n&gt;&gt; And what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna browse that same network share,\n\n192\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.930\nand there we go.\n\n193\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.236\nI'm gonna go ahead,\nI'm gonna close it down, and\n\n194\n00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:43.339\nyou might see something\nright here at the top.\n\n195\n00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:45.300\nIn fact, let's just go ahead and\nfilter this out.\n\n196\n00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.998\nI know it's only a single one,\nbut why not?\n\n197\n00:09:48.998 --> 00:09:50.293\nNow actually there's actually-\n&gt;&gt; A couple of them.\n\n198\n00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:51.261\n&gt;&gt; A couple of them, perfect.\n\n199\n00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:53.358\nAnd you could see here a name query,\nright?\n\n200\n00:09:53.358 --> 00:10:00.310\nThat's what NetBIOS laws it was that\n16 byte name, it was actually 15 bytes.\n\n201\n00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.793\nAnd then one byte would\ndesignate the service code and\n\n202\n00:10:02.793 --> 00:10:07.280\nyou can only really see the service code\ninside of a wire capturing utility here.\n\n203\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.950\nBut what I wanna see here,\nis the fact that we got port 137, right?\n\n204\n00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.061\nThey call up other ports for NetBIOS,\nkeep in mind that NetBIOS can use three\n\n205\n00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:18.839\ndifferent ports really,\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n206\n00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:24.813\nThe naming service that you can see right\nhere trying to resolve who is srv01,\n\n207\n00:10:24.813 --> 00:10:28.215\nthat's named server sequence port 137.\n\n208\n00:10:28.215 --> 00:10:31.630\nAnd that is UDP by the way cuz I\ndon't need a connection oriented\n\n209\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.601\nservice on that.\n\n210\n00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:36.203\nIf you got datagram services\nthat's gonna be port 138.\n\n211\n00:10:36.203 --> 00:10:38.501\nThe other one that they do\ncal out is port 139 and\n\n212\n00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:42.375\njust know that that once your session is\nestablished, that's the session for it.\n\n213\n00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:44.153\nNetBIOS works at the session layer.\n\n214\n00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:49.203\nAnd actually SMB will work\nright on top of that too.\n\n215\n00:10:49.203 --> 00:10:53.376\nFor instance, if I am\ncommunicating to another server and\n\n216\n00:10:53.376 --> 00:10:58.960\nI'm using SMB, you'll see that it'll\nbe on top of a NetBIOS session.\n\n217\n00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.390\nSo you could see how\nthey interact together.\n\n218\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.607\nAll right, well that pretty much\nhas it for most of the ports.\n\n219\n00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:09.221\nWe've got a few more that I kind\nof want to just talk about here.\n\n220\n00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:11.270\nWe've got our email ports, right?\n\n221\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.170\nNow the email ports, I really can't show\nyou, I didn't setup a email server here.\n\n222\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.634\nBut we talked about things\nlike your POP version 3,\n\n223\n00:11:17.634 --> 00:11:19.654\nPost Office Protocol version 3, right?\n\n224\n00:11:19.654 --> 00:11:21.608\nThat as port 110.\n\n225\n00:11:21.608 --> 00:11:24.804\nWe also have things like IMAP,\nyour Internet Message or\n\n226\n00:11:24.804 --> 00:11:27.531\nMail Access Protocol and that's port 143.\n\n227\n00:11:27.531 --> 00:11:29.787\nAnd then we've got another\none that's out there too and\n\n228\n00:11:29.787 --> 00:11:31.615\nthat's the simple mail transfer protocol.\n\n229\n00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:35.678\nAnd that is going to be your port 25,\nso do keep those in mind.\n\n230\n00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:38.435\nA couple of the different\nones that they talk about and\n\n231\n00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:40.647\nwe've mentioned them in other episodes.\n\n232\n00:11:40.647 --> 00:11:46.115\nSession initiation protocol for\nthings like Voice over IP,\n\n233\n00:11:46.115 --> 00:11:49.580\nthat is ports 5060 and 5061.\n\n234\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.671\nThere's another protocol that's\nused inside of Voice over IP along\n\n235\n00:11:54.671 --> 00:12:01.441\nwith things like H.323 which H.323,\nthey also call out, that's port 1720.\n\n236\n00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:04.004\nBut the one that I'm\nspecifically talking about is\n\n237\n00:12:04.004 --> 00:12:07.640\nthe Media Gateway Control Protocol\nthat literally controls closing and\n\n238\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.931\nopening ports when you're using\nVoice over IP communications.\n\n239\n00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:17.019\nThat's port 2427 and\nport 2727, so do know that.\n\n240\n00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:22.250\nAnother one there that we have as well\nis the Real-time Transport Protocol.\n\n241\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.600\nAlso used in things like high definition\nvideo conferencing, if you will.\n\n242\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.416\nVTC, video teleconferencing as well as\nvoice over or really just with your video.\n\n243\n00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:35.901\nThat's port 50 or 5004 or\n\n244\n00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:41.200\n5005 depending on which\nport you are using.\n\n245\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.110\nBut then we've got a couple more here\nthat I actually wanna show you and\n\n246\n00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.440\nthat is our HTTP.\n\n247\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.500\nNow with HTTP,\nI wanna show you default ports and\n\n248\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.810\nwhat we were talking about as well when\nwe said things like non standard ports.\n\n249\n00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.945\nThey can be beneficial, but\nthey can also get you in trouble too,\n\n250\n00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.624\nif your clients aren't\nconfigured to connect to them.\n\n251\n00:13:02.624 --> 00:13:03.968\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n252\n00:13:03.968 --> 00:13:07.300\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nlaunch up on my computer here.\n\n253\n00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.660\nI'm gonna launch up just a regular web\nbrowser, and I've actually got Wireshark.\n\n254\n00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.812\nThis is not a virtual\nmachine by the way guys.\n\n255\n00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:16.773\nThis is actually,\nI'm running on my Mac locally here.\n\n256\n00:13:16.773 --> 00:13:21.414\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntake for instance, the Thunderbolt port,\n\n257\n00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:25.110\nand I'm gonna go ahead, and\noops, that's not the right port.\n\n258\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.080\nLet's go ahead and start that over again,\nwrong Thunderbolt port.\n\n259\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.580\nThere we go, that's the one we want.\n\n260\n00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.968\nAnd we'll go ahead, and what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna start capturing on that.\n\n261\n00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:37.427\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna do www.microsoft and\n\n262\n00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:40.067\nin fact, we'll do their trust center here.\n\n263\n00:13:40.067 --> 00:13:42.130\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll connect to that.\n\n264\n00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.600\nAnd you could see that\nthe connection has been made.\n\n265\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.067\nMaybe we'll go ahead and we'll do HTTP.\n\n266\n00:13:48.067 --> 00:13:51.784\nSo we'll do forward slash,\nwe'll do our normal HTTP.\n\n267\n00:13:51.784 --> 00:13:55.858\nBy the way, HTTPS is port 443.\n\n268\n00:13:55.858 --> 00:13:58.273\nHTTP is port 80, so mention that too.\n\n269\n00:13:58.273 --> 00:13:59.659\n&gt;&gt; And just going to Google,\n\n270\n00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:03.050\nyou had to access port 443\nbecause Google is all secure.\n\n271\n00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.150\n&gt;&gt; That it is, there's a lot of websites\nthat have defaulted to HTTPS because of\n\n272\n00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.699\nthat very thing that you know\nyou've got secure communications.\n\n273\n00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:14.703\nWe'll go to the ITPro.TV website as well,\nwe'll let that go ahead and\n\n274\n00:14:14.703 --> 00:14:16.115\nwe'll let that finish.\n\n275\n00:14:16.115 --> 00:14:17.355\nAnd then we're gonna come back here and\n\n276\n00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:23.607\nwe're gonna stop the Wireshark packet\ncapture and we're gonna use HTTP.\n\n277\n00:14:23.607 --> 00:14:27.157\nNow here you can see some\nactual HTTP information, but\n\n278\n00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:31.597\nI want you to be careful because the first\nset of ports aren't gonna be standard.\n\n279\n00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:34.257\nBut I want you to know first of all,\nall right,\n\n280\n00:14:34.257 --> 00:14:36.687\noop, that's not even\na standard port at all.\n\n281\n00:14:36.687 --> 00:14:39.108\nHere we go.\nNotice that the destination port here is\n\n282\n00:14:39.108 --> 00:14:40.375\nport 8080, right?\n\n283\n00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:45.715\nIt is HTTP traffic, but\nthis is HTTP traffic that you'll see.\n\n284\n00:14:45.715 --> 00:14:49.589\nYeah, you'll recognize anything special\nabout those IP addresses just in general?\n\n285\n00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:51.456\nLike a 10 dot address, what's-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n286\n00:14:51.456 --> 00:14:53.819\nthe fact that they're\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n287\n00:14:53.819 --> 00:14:55.890\n&gt;&gt; They're private IP addresses, right?\n\n288\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:56.969\nWhy would you do something like that?\n\n289\n00:14:56.969 --> 00:14:59.570\nWell maybe we have an internal\nweb server that's using port 80.\n\n290\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.258\n&gt;&gt; Intranet.\n\n291\n00:15:00.258 --> 00:15:01.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n292\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.270\nBut then I need an Intranet and\n\n293\n00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.930\nI can't have two websites\nboth listening on port 80.\n\n294\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.530\nSo I have one that listens\non a non standard port.\n\n295\n00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.410\nAnd this is something that they\ndo from time to time, port 8080.\n\n296\n00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.193\nHowever, if I look at public IP addresses\nin here, and let's see, let's scroll down.\n\n297\n00:15:17.193 --> 00:15:19.520\nMaybe I've got some, maybe I don't.\n\n298\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.450\nAll right, let's see if we can\nfind some of this traffic.\n\n299\n00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.883\nWe found the non standard\nports like port 8080, but\n\n300\n00:15:26.883 --> 00:15:31.048\nI'm trying to find,\nlet's TCP, there we go.\n\n301\n00:15:31.048 --> 00:15:34.429\nWe got one going outbound to a public\nserver there, that's what we want.\n\n302\n00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:39.275\nSo let's go ahead, and if we zoom in here,\nyou'll see the source port is port 80.\n\n303\n00:15:39.275 --> 00:15:42.220\nIf the source port ort is port 80,\njust kinda like we've seen before,\n\n304\n00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.110\nthat means that's the server\nresponding back to me.\n\n305\n00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.110\nIf the destination port is 80,\n\n306\n00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:53.000\nthat means it's the client communicating\noutbound to the web server itself.\n\n307\n00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.180\nNow if we were to happen to see\nin the source destination ports\n\n308\n00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.550\nhere at any point, depending on\nwhich way the traffic was going.\n\n309\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.153\nAnd we see port 443 that would\nlet us know that it's HTTPs.\n\n310\n00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:05.533\nAnd this is an encrypted communication\nbetween the source and the destination,\n\n311\n00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:08.081\nwhich really out there across\nthe internet is what you want.\n\n312\n00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:13.642\nBecause remember if you are using\nsomething like the HTTP here that we see,\n\n313\n00:16:13.642 --> 00:16:18.335\nthat is essentially going to be\nsent over a plain text, right?\n\n314\n00:16:18.335 --> 00:16:22.731\nAnd there's a potential that we could\nget down into this information, and\n\n315\n00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:24.979\nwe could really read what is going on.\n\n316\n00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:27.467\nEven to the point of knowing\nwhat browser you're using and\n\n317\n00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:30.330\nthe version of the browser you're using,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n318\n00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.447\nBut we're not really\ntalking security here,\n\n319\n00:16:32.447 --> 00:16:34.679\nother than the fact that\nHTTPS is port 4443.\n\n320\n00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:39.514\nAnd that's encrypted web traffic with port\n80, that's gonna be your HTTP, that's\n\n321\n00:16:39.514 --> 00:16:44.520\nunencrypted traffic which is really going\nto be something that we need to consider.\n\n322\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.820\nShould we be securing it or\nshould we not be securing it?\n\n323\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.520\nBut I'll leave that for another episode.\n\n324\n00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes.\n\n325\n00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.756\nLot of ports, lot of protocols, and thank\ngoodness for Wireshark going in there.\n\n326\n00:16:53.756 --> 00:16:56.654\nSo we can actually kind of\nsee this things as they work,\n\n327\n00:16:56.654 --> 00:16:58.609\nas they travelling across the wire.\n\n328\n00:16:58.609 --> 00:17:01.264\nSee look inside of the actual\ndata gram itself and\n\n329\n00:17:01.264 --> 00:17:03.610\nsee those ports destination source.\n\n330\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.817\nAll the good stuff and some of the more\ncommon force in which we're going to be\n\n331\n00:17:07.817 --> 00:17:10.531\nworking with and\njust about every environment.\n\n332\n00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:13.916\nYou need to know them as\nan Network Plus technician.\n\n333\n00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:16.556\nWith that being said, we do thank\nyou Wes for joining us today, and\n\n334\n00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:18.980\nwalking us through all this\ndifferent ports and protocols.\n\n335\n00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.696\nBut it looks like it is that time for\nus to sign off for yet again for ITPro.TV.\n\n336\n00:17:22.696 --> 00:17:24.146\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n337\n00:17:24.146 --> 00:17:25.104\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n338\n00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:26.657\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n339\n00:17:29.025 --> 00:17:34.984\n[MUSIC]\n\n340\n00:17:34.984 --> 00:17:37.010\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",
