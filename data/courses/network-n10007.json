Obtaining Network+ certification shows that the holder possess the same knowledge and skills of someone who has worked for nine months as a Network Technician. The Network+ exam covers topics ranging from theory (terminology, topology and design) to hardware (routers, switches and cabling) and provides users with a broad, vendor neutral perspective on the topics required to work in the field of Network Administration.",

be looking\nat CompTIA's Net+ exam.\n\n4\n00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:09.817\nWe'll be looking at,\nwell, what is Network+?\n\n5\n00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:14.936\nWho is this course for, what will be\ncovered, and what are some of the exam\n\n6\n00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:19.990\ndetails, should you decide to sit For\nyour certification exam.\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.810\nLet's go ahead and let's dive right in and\ntalk about well, what is CompTIA's Net+?\n\n8\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.230\nWell, it's actually a benchmark for\nentry level network technicians.\n\n9\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.569\nIt's also accredited as\na 17024 certification by your\n\n10\n00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:37.323\nInternational Organization\nof Standardization.\n\n11\n00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:42.169\nIt's also FISMA compliant as well and\nit is a worldwide accreditation.\n\n12\n00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:46.312\nMeaning that it doesn't matter if\nyou're here where we are at ITPro.TV in\n\n13\n00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.440\nthe United States.\n\n14\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.883\nIf you get certified here, your\ncertification is recognized, well, let's\n\n15\n00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.500\nsay in Barcelona, Spain or if you're maybe\nin the UK and you get certified there.\n\n16\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.596\nWell, guess what?\n\n17\n00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:58.243\nIf you move or\ntravel over here to the states,\n\n18\n00:00:58.243 --> 00:01:00.690\nyour certification will be valid there.\n\n19\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.980\nSo it's worldwide recognization,\nif you will.\n\n20\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.940\nWorldwide recognized.\n\n21\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.478\nNow, the next part is well,\nwho is this course for.\n\n22\n00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.290\nWell, candidates that\nrequire certification.\n\n23\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.866\nWe're gonna go heavy into\nthe exam objectives and\n\n24\n00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.620\nfollowing by those exam objectives,\nwe will be covering those topics.\n\n25\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.353\nCandidates that need to understand\nthe basic concepts of setting up and\n\n26\n00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:29.706\nmaintaining network communications or\ncandidates that are going\n\n27\n00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:36.420\nto take the exam that is based on\nCompTIA's Net+ N10-007 exam objectives.\n\n28\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.874\nSo what will be covered here?\n\n29\n00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:42.020\nLike we said, the objectives for\nspecifically exam code N10007.\n\n30\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.590\nWe'll be looking at things like\nthe fundamental networking concepts.\n\n31\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.937\nThe knowledge that you need to establish,\nmaintain and\n\n32\n00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:53.643\nto troubleshoot your network connections.\n\n33\n00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:58.335\nWe'll also be looking at establishing\na basic understanding of enterprise level\n\n34\n00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:02.007\ntechnologies and that conclude\nanything from small networks,\n\n35\n00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.020\nlarge networks to cloud and\nvirtualization technologies likewise.\n\n36\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.150\nWe'll also be looking at the basis for\nnetwork security and access control.\n\n37\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.030\nLikewise, you're gonna learn an\nunderstanding of the common communication\n\n38\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.560\nprotocols and the network connection\nmodels and standardizations and\n\n39\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.530\nspecifications that we need when\nsetting up and understanding networks.\n\n40\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.000\nSo what are some of the exam details?\n\n41\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.377\nWell, when you do decide to\nsit the CompTIA Net+ 007 exam,\n\n42\n00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:39.120\nyou're gonna have 90 questions and\nright around 90 minutes.\n\n43\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.202\nThis is gonna be a multiple choice or\nperformance and\n\n44\n00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:44.242\nperformance-based questions.\n\n45\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:45.770\nWe say, multiple choice.\n\n46\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.204\nThat means you can choose\none of the answers.\n\n47\n00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:50.970\nIt'll also have multiple answer questions.\n\n48\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.351\nIn the performance-based questions,\nyou might see where it says, choose two.\n\n49\n00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.481\nEach of these two answers represents or\n\n50\n00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:59.650\neach of these two answers\nrepresent a complete solution.\n\n51\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.506\nPerformance-based questions can also be\nthings like simulations where they ask\n\n52\n00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:09.360\nyou to perform some kind of functionality\nin order to get the answer right.\n\n53\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.018\nIt could be things like drag and\ndrops where they give you a list of items\n\n54\n00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:17.431\nthat you can drag from one column, and put\nthem in the right order in another column.\n\n55\n00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:22.047\nYou could see things like even diagrams\nthat ask you to solve a networking\n\n56\n00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:23.160\nquestion.\n\n57\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.467\nSo keep that in mind that it is not\njust going to be multiple choice.\n\n58\n00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:32.290\nWhen you sit this exam,\nthe exams that CompTIA offers\n\n59\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.051\nhave a scoring range of 100 to 900.\n\n60\n00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.825\nAnd for the Net+ exam or Network+ exam,\n\n61\n00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:44.280\nyou're gonna have to achieve a 720 or\nhigher in order to pass this exam.\n\n62\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.020\nAt the time of this recording,\nthe exam price was $294.\n\n63\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.432\nAlways keep in mind, check out CompTIA's\nwebsite to ensure that you have\n\n64\n00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.075\nthe latest update at pricing information.\n\n65\n00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:01.623\nNow it is recommended, but not required\nthat you have A+ certification and\n\n66\n00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:06.510\nsomewhere between 9 to 12 months\nof IT networking experience.\n\n67\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.752\nLet's go ahead and\ntake this a little further and\n\n68\n00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:14.905\nlook at how the domains break up for\nour Net+ exam, and here are our domains.\n\n69\n00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.670\nAs you can see,\nwe have five domains total.\n\n70\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.385\nYou can see that we have networking\nconcepts comprised 23% of\n\n71\n00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:22.497\nthe overall exam.\n\n72\n00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:27.323\nWe will be looking at things like\ninfrastructure as well at 18% of the exam.\n\n73\n00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:30.360\nLikewise, you'll see that\nthere are network operations.\n\n74\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.077\nDomain 3.0 comprised of\n17% of your overall exam.\n\n75\n00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:36.730\nWe also have network security.\n\n76\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.551\nIt's gonna be important to\nkeep those networks secure.\n\n77\n00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.950\nThat comprises over 20%\nof your overall exam.\n\n78\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.421\nAnd then last, but certainly not least,\n\n79\n00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:49.717\nwhat's always on everybody's mind when the\nnetwork is the network troubleshooting and\n\n80\n00:04:49.717 --> 00:04:52.542\nthe tools that help assist\ntroubleshooting and\n\n81\n00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.721\nthat is going to be 22% of your\noverall exam for a total of 100%.\n\n82\n00:04:56.721 --> 00:05:02.330\nSo these are some of the domains\nthat you could see on your exam.\n\n83\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.212\nIf this interests you and\nyou are looking to sit a pass and\n\n84\n00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:10.435\ntake that Netwrok+,\nN10007 exam, then stay tuned.\n\n85\n00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:14.110\nCuz we got a lot more\nCompTIA Network+ coming up.\n\n86\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.574\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
