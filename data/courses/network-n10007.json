Obtaining Network+ certification shows that the holder possess the same knowledge and skills of someone who has worked for nine months as a Network Technician. The Network+ exam covers topics ranging from theory (terminology, topology and design) to hardware (routers, switches and cabling) and provides users with a broad, vendor neutral perspective on the topics required to work in the field of Network Administration.",

be looking\nat CompTIA's Net+ exam.\n\n4\n00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:09.817\nWe'll be looking at,\nwell, what is Network+?\n\n5\n00:00:09.817 --> 00:00:14.936\nWho is this course for, what will be\ncovered, and what are some of the exam\n\n6\n00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:19.990\ndetails, should you decide to sit For\nyour certification exam.\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.810\nLet's go ahead and let's dive right in and\ntalk about well, what is CompTIA's Net+?\n\n8\n00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.230\nWell, it's actually a benchmark for\nentry level network technicians.\n\n9\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.569\nIt's also accredited as\na 17024 certification by your\n\n10\n00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:37.323\nInternational Organization\nof Standardization.\n\n11\n00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:42.169\nIt's also FISMA compliant as well and\nit is a worldwide accreditation.\n\n12\n00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:46.312\nMeaning that it doesn't matter if\nyou're here where we are at ITPro.TV in\n\n13\n00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:47.440\nthe United States.\n\n14\n00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.883\nIf you get certified here, your\ncertification is recognized, well, let's\n\n15\n00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.500\nsay in Barcelona, Spain or if you're maybe\nin the UK and you get certified there.\n\n16\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.596\nWell, guess what?\n\n17\n00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:58.243\nIf you move or\ntravel over here to the states,\n\n18\n00:00:58.243 --> 00:01:00.690\nyour certification will be valid there.\n\n19\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.980\nSo it's worldwide recognization,\nif you will.\n\n20\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.940\nWorldwide recognized.\n\n21\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.478\nNow, the next part is well,\nwho is this course for.\n\n22\n00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:12.290\nWell, candidates that\nrequire certification.\n\n23\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.866\nWe're gonna go heavy into\nthe exam objectives and\n\n24\n00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.620\nfollowing by those exam objectives,\nwe will be covering those topics.\n\n25\n00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.353\nCandidates that need to understand\nthe basic concepts of setting up and\n\n26\n00:01:24.353 --> 00:01:29.706\nmaintaining network communications or\ncandidates that are going\n\n27\n00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:36.420\nto take the exam that is based on\nCompTIA's Net+ N10-007 exam objectives.\n\n28\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.874\nSo what will be covered here?\n\n29\n00:01:37.874 --> 00:01:42.020\nLike we said, the objectives for\nspecifically exam code N10007.\n\n30\n00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.590\nWe'll be looking at things like\nthe fundamental networking concepts.\n\n31\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.937\nThe knowledge that you need to establish,\nmaintain and\n\n32\n00:01:50.937 --> 00:01:53.643\nto troubleshoot your network connections.\n\n33\n00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:58.335\nWe'll also be looking at establishing\na basic understanding of enterprise level\n\n34\n00:01:58.335 --> 00:02:02.007\ntechnologies and that conclude\nanything from small networks,\n\n35\n00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.020\nlarge networks to cloud and\nvirtualization technologies likewise.\n\n36\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.150\nWe'll also be looking at the basis for\nnetwork security and access control.\n\n37\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.030\nLikewise, you're gonna learn an\nunderstanding of the common communication\n\n38\n00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.560\nprotocols and the network connection\nmodels and standardizations and\n\n39\n00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.530\nspecifications that we need when\nsetting up and understanding networks.\n\n40\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.000\nSo what are some of the exam details?\n\n41\n00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.377\nWell, when you do decide to\nsit the CompTIA Net+ 007 exam,\n\n42\n00:02:33.377 --> 00:02:39.120\nyou're gonna have 90 questions and\nright around 90 minutes.\n\n43\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.202\nThis is gonna be a multiple choice or\nperformance and\n\n44\n00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:44.242\nperformance-based questions.\n\n45\n00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:45.770\nWe say, multiple choice.\n\n46\n00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.204\nThat means you can choose\none of the answers.\n\n47\n00:02:48.204 --> 00:02:50.970\nIt'll also have multiple answer questions.\n\n48\n00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.351\nIn the performance-based questions,\nyou might see where it says, choose two.\n\n49\n00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.481\nEach of these two answers represents or\n\n50\n00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:59.650\neach of these two answers\nrepresent a complete solution.\n\n51\n00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.506\nPerformance-based questions can also be\nthings like simulations where they ask\n\n52\n00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:09.360\nyou to perform some kind of functionality\nin order to get the answer right.\n\n53\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.018\nIt could be things like drag and\ndrops where they give you a list of items\n\n54\n00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:17.431\nthat you can drag from one column, and put\nthem in the right order in another column.\n\n55\n00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:22.047\nYou could see things like even diagrams\nthat ask you to solve a networking\n\n56\n00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:23.160\nquestion.\n\n57\n00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.467\nSo keep that in mind that it is not\njust going to be multiple choice.\n\n58\n00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:32.290\nWhen you sit this exam,\nthe exams that CompTIA offers\n\n59\n00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.051\nhave a scoring range of 100 to 900.\n\n60\n00:03:36.051 --> 00:03:38.825\nAnd for the Net+ exam or Network+ exam,\n\n61\n00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:44.280\nyou're gonna have to achieve a 720 or\nhigher in order to pass this exam.\n\n62\n00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.020\nAt the time of this recording,\nthe exam price was $294.\n\n63\n00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.432\nAlways keep in mind, check out CompTIA's\nwebsite to ensure that you have\n\n64\n00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:56.075\nthe latest update at pricing information.\n\n65\n00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:01.623\nNow it is recommended, but not required\nthat you have A+ certification and\n\n66\n00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:06.510\nsomewhere between 9 to 12 months\nof IT networking experience.\n\n67\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.752\nLet's go ahead and\ntake this a little further and\n\n68\n00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:14.905\nlook at how the domains break up for\nour Net+ exam, and here are our domains.\n\n69\n00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.670\nAs you can see,\nwe have five domains total.\n\n70\n00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.385\nYou can see that we have networking\nconcepts comprised 23% of\n\n71\n00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:22.497\nthe overall exam.\n\n72\n00:04:22.497 --> 00:04:27.323\nWe will be looking at things like\ninfrastructure as well at 18% of the exam.\n\n73\n00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:30.360\nLikewise, you'll see that\nthere are network operations.\n\n74\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.077\nDomain 3.0 comprised of\n17% of your overall exam.\n\n75\n00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:36.730\nWe also have network security.\n\n76\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.551\nIt's gonna be important to\nkeep those networks secure.\n\n77\n00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.950\nThat comprises over 20%\nof your overall exam.\n\n78\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.421\nAnd then last, but certainly not least,\n\n79\n00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:49.717\nwhat's always on everybody's mind when the\nnetwork is the network troubleshooting and\n\n80\n00:04:49.717 --> 00:04:52.542\nthe tools that help assist\ntroubleshooting and\n\n81\n00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.721\nthat is going to be 22% of your\noverall exam for a total of 100%.\n\n82\n00:04:56.721 --> 00:05:02.330\nSo these are some of the domains\nthat you could see on your exam.\n\n83\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.212\nIf this interests you and\nyou are looking to sit a pass and\n\n84\n00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:10.435\ntake that Netwrok+,\nN10007 exam, then stay tuned.\n\n85\n00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:14.110\nCuz we got a lot more\nCompTIA Network+ coming up.\n\n86\n00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.574\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:11.942\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:15.810\nHello and thank you for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn whereever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.590\nI'm your host Zach Memos, for CompTIA Net+\nand this is gonna be ports and\n\n6\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.960\nprotocols, this episode.\n\n7\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.590\nAnd the person who's bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n8\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.497\nonly IT expert himself, Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:28.150\n[LAUGH] Hey, how you doing tonight?\n\n10\n00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.400\nI could barely get that one out.\n\n11\n00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.370\nThere we go.\n\n12\n00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.090\nWell I tell you it's great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.830\nAnd that's right,\nwe're gonna be looking at, well,\n\n14\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.140\nsome communication types,\nports and protocols.\n\n15\n00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.699\nSo before we dive into\nall the various ports and\n\n16\n00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.026\nprotocols that we have to look at, let's\njust kind of step back for a second and\n\n17\n00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:46.802\nlet's break down what a protocol is,\nall right.\n\n18\n00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.071\nWhen we look at a protocol,\n\n19\n00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.670\na protocol is nothing more than a\nstructured set of rules for communication.\n\n20\n00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.100\nWe have different communication types,\ndifferent services,\n\n21\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.610\ndifferent applications that need to make\ncommunications across our network today,\n\n22\n00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.770\nmore specifically,\nare TCP/IP based networks.\n\n23\n00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.700\nAnd in other episodes,\nwe will talk more about something known as\n\n24\n00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.790\nthe Transmission Control Internet Protocol\nmodel.\n\n25\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.830\nThe TCP/IP model is responsible for\nmoving traffic along the Internet.\n\n26\n00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.591\nWhile we need to know what services,\ncertain, well,\n\n27\n00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:17.930\nwhat protocols I should say,\ncertain services are gonna use.\n\n28\n00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.360\nSo that's what we're gonna\nlook here in this episode at.\n\n29\n00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.860\nNow the next thing I also wanna\ntalk about are ports all right.\n\n30\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.300\nWith the protocol is a rule for\ncommunication and\n\n31\n00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.800\nit means that if you're gonna use that\nform of communication, both the source and\n\n32\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.890\ndestination of the communication have\nto be using the same protocol, right?\n\n33\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.650\nWe don't really mix and match.\n\n34\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.290\nSo for instance if I'm gonna send email,\nfor my client.\n\n35\n00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.860\nThe application that is sending that email\nis gonna send it out a certain port.\n\n36\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.620\nWell guess what?\n\n37\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.230\nOn the other end of that communication,\nthat protocol and\n\n38\n00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.220\nport It have to be the same or we're not\ngonna get that intercommunication, right.\n\n39\n00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.420\nPorts if you will are a logical\nidentifier, right, what do they do is they\n\n40\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.820\nlogically identify what's known as\nan endpoint of a connection, right.\n\n41\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.267\nSo again if I'm gonna send communications\nfrom my host machine let's say my laptop\n\n42\n00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:10.283\nto an email server, right, how do we\nidentify that that is coming from me?\n\n43\n00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:12.938\nWell we associate that\nwith a transport protocol,\n\n44\n00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:16.766\nwhich we're gonna talk about in this\nepisode, as well as an IP address and\n\n45\n00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:21.490\nthen identify the traffic with a port\nnumber that's associated at the end.\n\n46\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.640\nNow, I do want you to understand that when\nwe talk about ports, we've got a series of\n\n47\n00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.960\nports that IANA,\nthe Internet Assigned Numbering Authority.\n\n48\n00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.770\nToday, it's ICANN, the International\nCorporation for Assigned Names and\n\n49\n00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.050\nNumbers have basically just allocated\nfour different types of services, right.\n\n50\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.360\nAnd they're basically broken up\ninto three categories, right.\n\n51\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.870\nWe have what is known\nare well-known ports.\n\n52\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.570\nAll right,\nour well-known ports are zero to 1023.\n\n53\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.498\nAnd inside of this port,\nthese ports if you will,\n\n54\n00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:56.382\nwe identify all of our common networking\nservices, all the communication types,\n\n55\n00:02:56.382 --> 00:03:01.960\nthings like DHCP are in this range, things\nlike what you're gonna see here, SSH.\n\n56\n00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.710\nAll of these commonly used services\nfall under this port range.\n\n57\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.800\nNow the next port range we have is 1024,\nagain 1,024 all the way to 49151.\n\n58\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.370\nAnd these are what are known\nas register port ranges.\n\n59\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.510\nAnd register port ranges are certain\napplications and services.\n\n60\n00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.324\nCompanies would go to IANA and\n\n61\n00:03:22.324 --> 00:03:26.160\nIANA would allocate them for\ntheir different services right?\n\n62\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.500\nNow the register port range you\nwill see sometimes is used for\n\n63\n00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.530\napplications such as things like for\ninstance remote desktop protocol.\n\n64\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.670\nA remote desktop connection if you\nwill software inside of Windows.\n\n65\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.840\nIt's been in Windows for\na very long time right?\n\n66\n00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.060\nThat uses something known as port 3389.\n\n67\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.440\nAnd you can see that Microsoft,\n\n68\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.800\nlet's say if you were to identify that\ntype of traffic out on your network.\n\n69\n00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.210\nWe could see that port 3389,\n\n70\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.930\nif we have that traffic traversing our\nnetwork using things like protocol\n\n71\n00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.060\nanalyzers, we know that it's associated\nwith a protocol known as RDP.\n\n72\n00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.417\nAll right, now the last range,\nthe last range is that 49152.\n\n73\n00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:11.251\nThat's right 49152,\nall the way up to 65535.\n\n74\n00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.909\nDon't worry,\nI don't have any of these individual.\n\n75\n00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.118\nWell, a few of them I have memorized and\nyou're gonna have to memorize some of them\n\n76\n00:04:17.118 --> 00:04:21.220\nfor the exam, but you don't have to\nmemorize all 65,535 ports, right?\n\n77\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.645\nBut the port range, again as a recap,\n\n78\n00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:29.660\n49152 to 65535.\n\n79\n00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.370\nThese are ports, if you will,\nthey're temporary ports.\n\n80\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.530\nSometimes you'll hear them\ncalled dynamic port range,\n\n81\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.450\nthe private port range, if you will.\n\n82\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.150\nAnd this is a way, basically,\n\n83\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.210\ncomputers will use these ports\njust to set up a communication so\n\n84\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.000\nthat we can identify the endpoint of\nwhere that communication is going.\n\n85\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.934\nAnd then once the communication is done,\n\n86\n00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:50.927\nthey get reserve basically thrown\nback over in that large pool.\n\n87\n00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:54.631\nAnd your computer is, again, they use them\ndynamically, so that's why they have a few\n\n88\n00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.630\ndifferent names, dynamic,\nprivate ports, if you will.\n\n89\n00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.420\nDynamic because of the fact that\nmy computer might be using one\n\n90\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.140\nof those ports now and when that\nport closes down, well, guess what?\n\n91\n00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.588\nIt could use a completely different\nport after the fact, all right.\n\n92\n00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:13.420\nThey also call them ephemeral ports or\ntemporary port if you will because, again,\n\n93\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.370\nthey associate the endpoint\nof the connection.\n\n94\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.939\nOnce those ports are used,\n\n95\n00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.514\nthey're not necessarily associated with\nreally any type of communication and\n\n96\n00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:25.826\nyou can see all different types of\ncomputers and devices using them today.\n\n97\n00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:29.742\nAnd once they're no longer needed,\nthey go back over into that pool but\n\n98\n00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:33.009\nnothing in that pool specifically\nis typically reserved by\n\n99\n00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.950\nour Internet standards\nbodies within that range.\n\n100\n00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.540\nSo the three range is, again, well-known\nport range, we have the registered port\n\n101\n00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.800\nrange, and, last but not the least,\nwe have the dynamic port range.\n\n102\n00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.160\nThese ranges are gonna be important for\nyou to know in the exam because they might\n\n103\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.220\ngive you some of these ports that we're\ngonna talk about here in this episode.\n\n104\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.830\nAnd essentially what they're gonna\nsay is what port range is that in?\n\n105\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.690\nAnd it's gonna be up to you\nto understand and know and\n\n106\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.200\nidentify those on the exam, All right.\n\n107\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.870\nSo with that being said, let's talk\na little bit about the protocols that we\n\n108\n00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.580\nhave that we need to be aware of or\nthe Net+ exam.\n\n109\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.494\nThe very first one, all right,\nI'm gonna talk about,\n\n110\n00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.920\nI'm actually gonna kinda go out\nof order here on this one, Zach.\n\n111\n00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.080\nI'll throw Zack a curveball.\n\n112\n00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.305\nI'm gonna write down my notes and\nthen I'm not gonna use them at all.\n\n113\n00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:19.950\n[LAUGH] And there's a reason here.\n\n114\n00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.060\nBecause one of the first ones that\nthey call out is something known\n\n115\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.830\nas Secure Shell, SSH.\n\n116\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.250\nBut I'm gonna skip down the list and\nI wanna talk about another one here and\n\n117\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.330\nthat's something known as Telnet,\n\n118\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.700\nthe telecommunication networking\nprotocol if you will, Telnet.\n\n119\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.570\nTelnet's an oldie but\n\n120\n00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.300\na goodie it's been around on the Internet\nbefore the Internet was even the Internet.\n\n121\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.346\nIt goes back to the days of ARPANET,\nit's been around since the 70s.\n\n122\n00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:45.997\nAnd it is again a tried and true protocol\nthat allows you to make a remote log\n\n123\n00:06:45.997 --> 00:06:48.710\non to another computer, to another host.\n\n124\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.639\nAnd what I mean by that is I have a\ncomputer right here and I need to connect\n\n125\n00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.520\nto another computer and I need to be\nable to issue commands against it.\n\n126\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.560\nNow Wes I know you're terrific with\nhistory, was it called Telnet because of\n\n127\n00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.050\ntelephone Telnet,\nI mean was that involved with that or no?\n\n128\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.033\nWell, a little bit but not the telephone\njust the telecommunications part, so\n\n129\n00:07:07.033 --> 00:07:09.720\nthat side could be cuz\na phone is telecommunication.\n\n130\n00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.766\nI remember in high school we had the huge\ncomputer room, phones in cradles and\n\n131\n00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:14.770\nthings like that.\n\n132\n00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.230\nWell, this goes back to those days.\n\n133\n00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.990\nYeah.\nLet me go ahead and expand on that because\n\n134\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.191\nI know that back when you have\nfive people connected to ARPANET.\n\n135\n00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:26.570\nI say five people, five entities or\nuniversities or military.\n\n136\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.360\nI used to, I would listen to stories.\n\n137\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.770\nSome of the guys that are in\nSilicon Valley as now,\n\n138\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.050\nwhen they were going through\nuniversity and saying hey I'd love to\n\n139\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.220\njump on that ARPANET with Telnet and\ncontrol that remote computer right?\n\n140\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.860\nAnd that's what it's for,\nit's called remote log on.\n\n141\n00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.690\nIt goes over what is known as port 23 and\nI want to remember that.\n\n142\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.372\nSo if I have a protocol analyzer, and\nI want to find out what type of traffic,\n\n143\n00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:51.194\nwhat kind of communications\nare going on on the network and\n\n144\n00:07:51.194 --> 00:07:53.340\nI see there's traffic bound for port 23.\n\n145\n00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.753\nI know it's gonna be\na Telnet communication.\n\n146\n00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:59.943\nNow Oldie but goodie,\nTelnet when those days,\n\n147\n00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:05.449\nbecause there wasn't in the early days\nof our Internet working communications,\n\n148\n00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.210\nthere wasn't a lot of necessity for\nprivacy, and why is that?\n\n149\n00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.790\nWell because in those days you didn't\nhave a lot of people connected to\n\n150\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.540\nnetworks, right?\n\n151\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.440\nBut, this is well past the dot com boom,\nthat's long since not been true.\n\n152\n00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.250\nAnd that's one of the drawbacks to Telnet.\n\n153\n00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.330\nTelnet as a terminal emulation software,\n\n154\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.846\nit sends its information in plain text,\nright?\n\n155\n00:08:28.846 --> 00:08:30.484\nAnd what we mean by plain text or\n\n156\n00:08:30.484 --> 00:08:34.908\nclear text as we'll talk about a little\nbit security through Network Plus as well.\n\n157\n00:08:34.908 --> 00:08:38.642\nIs the fact that,\nlet's say I'm sending commands to, and\n\n158\n00:08:38.642 --> 00:08:42.390\nZach we're gonna play a little\nmake believe here, right?\n\n159\n00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.545\nI'm gonna send communications to Zach,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:47.010\nAnd I'm gonna do it with Telnet and\nI'm gonna issue some commands.\n\n161\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.590\nMaybe it's a file transfer or maybe it's\njust a remote command on that not really\n\n162\n00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.580\na file transfer, but maybe just\na remote command on that machine.\n\n163\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.230\nThe problem is, if I'm sending\ncommunications like that to Zach and\n\n164\n00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.700\nit's sending plain text, somebody\ncould be out here on the sidelines.\n\n165\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.510\nAnd they could be scraping\nthat information and\n\n166\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.280\ngathering it doing packet capture.\n\n167\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.930\nAnd they can see all of the information\nthat is in those type of packets, right?\n\n168\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.510\nSo, It's a security vulnerability.\n\n169\n00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.290\nAnd that leads us into our one,\nI've got one up here on our computer and\n\n170\n00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.950\nthis is something known as SSH.\n\n171\n00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:22.320\nAnd that's why I wanted to preface SSH,\njust talk about Telnet prior to SSH.\n\n172\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.440\nBecause today's day and\nage we need encrypted communications,\n\n173\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.810\nwe need secure communications, right?\n\n174\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.070\nSo for instance, let's say that I'm,\nlet's say that I am going to issue some\n\n175\n00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.000\ncommands against maybe a switch or\nrouter, right?\n\n176\n00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.170\nI don't want Zach to be out there and\n\n177\n00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.770\nif I am doing this in Telnet,\nbe able to scrape that information, and\n\n178\n00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.310\nsee the configurations,\nthe configuration database.\n\n179\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.640\nAny of that information\nthat I am issuing against.\n\n180\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.020\nSomething like a router or\nsomething like a switch if you will,\n\n181\n00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.090\nsomething like a server, right?\n\n182\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.820\nBut, if we use SSH, the secure shell and\nwe connect to port 22,\n\n183\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.730\nwhat we're doing is, we're actually\nsending an encrypted communication and\n\n184\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.750\nit goes through an interesting process.\n\n185\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.500\nVery basically, what you have is, you have\na client, remember these are client server\n\n186\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.870\nprotocols, and\nI probably should have said that too.\n\n187\n00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.640\nIn services we have clients that are\nrequesting a service in these protocols.\n\n188\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.610\nAnd the servers are actually out there\nlistening for that incoming communication.\n\n189\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.750\nJust remember that clients,\nlike we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n190\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.560\na client is a computer that requests\nresources from another computer.\n\n191\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.960\nA server is that computer that\nprovides those resources.\n\n192\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.160\nSo there's a client initiation in SSH\nit mean hey, I need to connect, rIght?\n\n193\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.760\nWell what happens is the server or the\ndevice on the other end, that's providing\n\n194\n00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.230\nthat service you're gonna connect to,\nwhat it does it it sends a public key.\n\n195\n00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.730\nWe'll also talk about asymmetric\nencryption in other episodes as well, but\n\n196\n00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.940\nfor now.\n\n197\n00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.950\nAnd if you're not aware of that,\n\n198\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.600\ngo check out some of our\npublic key cryptology, right?\n\n199\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.940\nSends a public key and\nthen from there, what we do is,\n\n200\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.070\nmy computer, now that I have\ngot the server's public key.\n\n201\n00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.125\nWe can generate these session keys.\n\n202\n00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:55.315\nThey call it a symmetric key,\n\n203\n00:10:55.315 --> 00:10:59.235\nit just means that there's one key\nversus asymmetric, which is two.\n\n204\n00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:05.005\nAnd then I generate that session key, and\nI encrypt it with a server's public key.\n\n205\n00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:10.285\nNow the only key that can unencrypt that\ninformation, is the server's private key.\n\n206\n00:11:10.285 --> 00:11:13.165\nWell, there's a reason it's called\nthe private key, only the server has it.\n\n207\n00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:17.092\nSo when I sent that encrypted package\nback over with the session key,\n\n208\n00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:21.428\nessentially what the server can do is\nbasically strip off that encryption,\n\n209\n00:11:21.428 --> 00:11:24.019\nsee the secret session\nkey that we've sent.\n\n210\n00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:28.244\nAnd not from here on out we're gonna\nsend encrypted secure communication and\n\n211\n00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:32.020\nmy client can log on and then can\nalso shoot commands after that fact.\n\n212\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:36.720\nSo, SSH is a very good protocol when\nyou need to make a remote log on and\n\n213\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.390\nyou don't want anybody else\nto know what's going on,\n\n214\n00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.060\nyou don't want anybody else to\neavesdrop on that information.\n\n215\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.320\nIt allows us that confidentiality that we\ntalked about in the CIA triad the three\n\n216\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.260\nprinciples of security, confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n217\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.820\nRemember, confidentiality is done\nthrough encrypting your information and\n\n218\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.200\nnot sending it over\na network in clear text.\n\n219\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.380\nAll right, and let me make one\nmention of something else about SSH.\n\n220\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.800\nThere's a couple of version of SSH.\n\n221\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.610\nThe first one is considered vulnerable.\n\n222\n00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.240\nIt has some security vulnerabilities,\nso they have SSH version two.\n\n223\n00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.280\nAnd that's what you should be using today.\n\n224\n00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.720\nAgain, the old one isn't really good.\n\n225\n00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.585\nI always write down in my notes,\nversion one's bad.\n\n226\n00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:16.330\n[LAUGH] Version two is good.\n\n227\n00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.720\nAnd that's just because in version two,\n\n228\n00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.720\none of the things is that they\nhave this enhanced key exchange.\n\n229\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.210\nThat just makes it a lot of\nit more secure, if you will.\n\n230\n00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.810\nAll right, so that's SSH, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.020\nNow, the next thing that we need to\nknow about is what is known as DNS.\n\n232\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.500\nNow, when we look at DNS,\n\n233\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.790\nand we'll talk more about the DNS\nhierarchies, Zach, in other episodes.\n\n234\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.200\nUnderstand that we just wanna know the\nprotocols and their ports in this episode.\n\n235\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.510\nBecause there's a lot more DNS than\nwhat I'm about to tell you, but\n\n236\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.970\nyou'll get the basics here for now.\n\n237\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.760\nJust knowing that well,\ndomain name system, right?\n\n238\n00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.310\nSo if we can look at My Computer here,\nright?\n\n239\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:57.280\nSo, I have what's known as DNS client,\nthe DNS client basically sends out\n\n240\n00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.750\na resolution request, says, hey, I have\nthis name and I can't find the IP, right?\n\n241\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.410\nThat's what DNS is responsible,\ntaking those names and mapping them to IP\n\n242\n00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:12.060\naddresses like we'll talk about or have\ntalked about in our DNS episodes, right?\n\n243\n00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.350\nSo what happens is, my computer the DNS\nclient says hey, i need an IP or,\n\n244\n00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.670\nI have got a name and I need you\nto resolve that to an IP address.\n\n245\n00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.280\nSo that I can communicate with it.\n\n246\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.520\nIn this case we are using\nwww.google.com right?\n\n247\n00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.732\nSo when I launch up my web browser here,\nright?\n\n248\n00:13:27.732 --> 00:13:30.576\nI launch up my web browser and\nI am going to do a search right?\n\n249\n00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.448\nIt's not my web browser but\n\n250\n00:13:32.448 --> 00:13:36.790\nthat my web browser needs to\nknow how to find Google, right?\n\n251\n00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.060\nAnd how does it find Google?\n\n252\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.140\nWell, it basically sends out\na name resolution request out to,\n\n253\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.310\nin this case,\ncould be your internal company server.\n\n254\n00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.810\nIf you're in a home network,\n\n255\n00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.890\nthen you probably don't have a DNS\nserver on your local network.\n\n256\n00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.250\nYou're like,\nI didn't install a computer, well,\n\n257\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.590\nthat's gonna be your ISP's DNS server,\nright?\n\n258\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.020\nAnd what your home router's gonna do is,\nit's gonna say, you need a name request?\n\n259\n00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.850\nLet me go ahead and send it out to\nyour Internet service provider, and\n\n260\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.250\nthey'll provide the IP address.\n\n261\n00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.870\nSo that's basically what's happening here,\nright?\n\n262\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:11.220\nEssentially, a client request is\nsent to the DNS server, all right?\n\n263\n00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.850\nNow the DNS server goes\nthrough this process, right?\n\n264\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.890\nWhere it says, I don't own Google.\n\n265\n00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.840\nWell let me go ahead and let me send\nyou out to Google's DNS server.\n\n266\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.705\nAnd another process again, like I said, it\nis a little more complex than that but for\n\n267\n00:14:24.705 --> 00:14:26.836\nthe basics, it's happening over port 53.\n\n268\n00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:28.171\nSo when name requests,\n\n269\n00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:32.870\nresolution requests through DNS happen,\nthey happen over port 53, all right?\n\n270\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.100\nNow from the server side,\nthis is just the client side.\n\n271\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.819\nFrom the server side what happens is, DNS,\n\n272\n00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:42.875\nin this case we'll just say\nGoogle's DNS server says, Yeah.\n\n273\n00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:47.348\nI could find,\nI know where www.google.com is.\n\n274\n00:14:47.348 --> 00:14:52.139\nYou could find it at this address, and it\nresponds back to in this case the company\n\n275\n00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:54.540\nDNS server or your ISP's DNS server.\n\n276\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.590\nGoogle's DNS server responds back,\nand says, guess what?\n\n277\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.120\nYou can find www.google.com\nat this IP address.\n\n278\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.054\nAnd again, the big thing here,\nthe big takeaway is that it's port 53.\n\n279\n00:15:05.054 --> 00:15:05.760\nMm-hm.\n\n280\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.290\nThat's our DNS port, all right?\n\n281\n00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:08.500\nWe get our answer back, and\n\n282\n00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.830\nthe answer's delivered back to the\noriginal client who asked the question.\n\n283\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.370\nAnd again,\nthis is over something known as UDP.\n\n284\n00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.350\nNow, I haven't mentioned\nuser datagram protocol, and\n\n285\n00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.450\nI haven't mentioned\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n286\n00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.480\nSo, we'll just put the brakes on that one,\nand we'll come back to that at the end\n\n287\n00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.790\nbecause it is important to understand\nthose two transport protocols, all right?\n\n288\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.470\nNow we also have a series\nof file protocols,\n\n289\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.590\nfile transfer protocols if you will,\nright?\n\n290\n00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.470\nThere's been quite a few\nof them over the years, and\n\n291\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.330\none of them that has been\naround just as long as Telnet.\n\n292\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.030\nIs the file transfer protocol right?\n\n293\n00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.769\nFTP.\n\n294\n00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:46.075\nFTP is another one of those oldie but\ngoodies and it's still\n\n295\n00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:50.715\nkept around because it's highly optimized\nfor large file transfers, all right?\n\n296\n00:15:50.715 --> 00:15:54.029\nSo if we could take a look at my\nscreen here, file transfer protocol\n\n297\n00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:57.637\nis a weird one and the fact that for\nthe most of these protocols that we talk\n\n298\n00:15:57.637 --> 00:16:01.640\nabout you're gonna see there\nare a couple of exceptions to that.\n\n299\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.015\nIt typically has a single port, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:04.015 --> 00:16:05.117\nNot so with FTP.\n\n301\n00:16:05.117 --> 00:16:08.307\nFTP's one of those ones that's\na little bit more greedy [LAUGH],\n\n302\n00:16:08.307 --> 00:16:09.890\nit takes two ports.\n\n303\n00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.730\nAnd what we mean by that\nis when I need to initiate,\n\n304\n00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.780\nlet's say I need to connect to a file\ntransfer protocol server, an FTP server.\n\n305\n00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.070\nAnd I need to upload or\nI need to download a file.\n\n306\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.170\nI have to initiate the command that starts\nthat exchange, whether it's pulling that\n\n307\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.700\nfile down to my local computer, or\nsending it up to the FTP server.\n\n308\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.150\nAnd when that happens,\nthat happens over port 20.\n\n309\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.090\nOr excuse me, I'm sorry, port 21.\n\n310\n00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.910\nLet me be specific, don't get\nthose wrong on the exam, port 21.\n\n311\n00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.970\nSo the commands that I issue to tell\nthe FTP server what I'm going to do,\n\n312\n00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.740\nit goes over port 21.\n\n313\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:49.240\nNow when the data exchange happens,\nagain, remember file transfer protocol.\n\n314\n00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.050\nYou could be sending\nit up to the server or\n\n315\n00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.230\nwhat they say pulling the file\ndown to maybe your local client.\n\n316\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.950\nThat's gonna happen over port 20.\n\n317\n00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.090\nSo keep in mind two ports and I always\nremember this on the CompTIA exams when\n\n318\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.000\nI was taking it data over commands.\n\n319\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000\nRight, 20, 21 data over commands,\nit was just something that I did.\n\n320\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.820\nAgain use your memorization techniques on\nthis one because well unfortunately when\n\n321\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.600\nit comes to the port numbers,\nit is just sheer memorization.\n\n322\n00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.710\nAll right, so\nthat takes care of one of those protocols.\n\n323\n00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.950\nNow, FTP just like Telnet\nalso has a vulnerability.\n\n324\n00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.670\nAgain because when FTP came out,\n\n325\n00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.260\nunderstand that we didn't have a lot of\nentities on the backbone of the Internet.\n\n326\n00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.780\nLet alone it even being calling\nthe Internet at that point.\n\n327\n00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.840\nSo, what's its issue?\n\n328\n00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.390\nJust like Telnet, it is a clear\ntext protocol, plaintext, right?\n\n329\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.590\nThat means again, I am loading a file,\nmaybe it's a sensitive document and\n\n330\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.850\nI am loading it up or\ntransferring it up to the file server.\n\n331\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.450\nWell, guess what?\n\n332\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.334\nIf Zach is out there\nwith protocol analyzer,\n\n333\n00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:54.375\nhe can be out there scraping that\ninformation, and guess what?\n\n334\n00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:57.790\nHe can break down those layers of\nthe OSI model and he can potentially see\n\n335\n00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.880\nthe information that's in there and\ngain access to the data.\n\n336\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.940\nSo what we wanna do, is we wanna go\na little bit further with our file\n\n337\n00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.480\ntransfer protocol, and\nthere's something known as SFTP.\n\n338\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.030\nAlright now be careful, alright SFTP,\nsometimes you'll see it abbreviated,\n\n339\n00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.630\nyou'll see other abbreviations I should\nsay that look just like it, right?\n\n340\n00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.695\nSFTP is secure file transfer protocol,\nbut there's also one,\n\n341\n00:18:25.695 --> 00:18:29.090\nan old one, called simple file transfer\nprotocol that's completely obsolete.\n\n342\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.070\nI don't want you to worry about it,\nbut it's got the same darn acronym.\n\n343\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.580\nWe're not shy of acronyms\nhere in the NetPlus Series.\n\n344\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.240\nThe other one that I also want you\nto know about is you could see it,\n\n345\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.810\nif they're not talking in the context\nof protocols, screen foil twisted pair.\n\n346\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:50.240\nThis is basically a type of category\ncable for ethernet networks that\n\n347\n00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.020\nhas a lot of shielding in it and sometimes\nI've seen it abbreviated that way.\n\n348\n00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.510\nJust want to help you\nout with your acronyms.\n\n349\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.840\nWhat we want is secure\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n350\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.350\nSo what is happening?\n\n351\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.450\nRemember our little protocol\nwe started out with?\n\n352\n00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.400\nSSH how it encrypts communications between\nend points to do things like remote\n\n353\n00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.100\nlog ons.\n\n354\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.060\nWell guess what?\n\n355\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.330\nWe set an SSH tunnel up and\nwe connect to that FTP server.\n\n356\n00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.300\nThat's it, we pulled the blinds\ndown on anybody that's gonna\n\n357\n00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.210\nbe trying to gather our information.\n\n358\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.650\nSo if we could take a look here.\n\n359\n00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:23.400\nAn SFTP client starts what's\nknown as an SSH tunnel.\n\n360\n00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.810\nAll right, and that's that encrypted\ntunnel, no different than SSH.\n\n361\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.570\nAnd then when we connect all of the\ninformation that we're either transferring\n\n362\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:36.830\nto the FTP server or pulling down from\nthe FTP server now becomes encrypted.\n\n363\n00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.990\nAnd guess what, it's great for\nconfidentiality.\n\n364\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.798\nIt means, picking on Zach,\nZach you have been a good sport so far.\n\n365\n00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:46.480\nZach is our hacker and he wants to\nget access to that information.\n\n366\n00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.700\nEthical hacker.\n\n367\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.660\nThat's right, that's right.\n\n368\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.770\nWe'll remind it.\n\n369\n00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.760\n[LAUGH] Zach's got his white hat on,\nnot the black hat, right?\n\n370\n00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:59.010\nAnd all seriousness, though, keep in mind,\nyou want to be using something like SFTP.\n\n371\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:05.306\nNow, FTP and SFTP, these are\nconnection-oriented services, all right?\n\n372\n00:20:05.306 --> 00:20:09.170\nAnd FTP has a lot\n\n373\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.880\nof overhead in the fact that you can\nissue commands, you can transfer files.\n\n374\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.830\nBut sometimes what you need\nis just a very simplistic way\n\n375\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:24.460\nto send files across the network, right?\n\n376\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:26.170\nAnd that's the other one\nI want to talk about.\n\n377\n00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.030\nAnd if I didn't mention it,\nSFTP uses the same port as SSH.\n\n378\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.780\nSo Port 22.\n\n379\n00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.878\nAnd Zach, [LAUGH] I absolutely love\nthat when you can remember two ports,\n\n380\n00:20:35.878 --> 00:20:39.343\ntwo protocols, and they've got,\nthe ports are identical.\n\n381\n00:20:39.343 --> 00:20:43.430\nSSH, and if you need to remember,\nremember SFTP uses SSH so\n\n382\n00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.950\nyou can remember it also\nuses its associated port.\n\n383\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.400\nNow sometimes like I said,\neven as highly optimized as FTP is,\n\n384\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.340\nright sometimes you don't\nneed those commands.\n\n385\n00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.400\nYou need just a really quick minimalistic\nway to send things like even small\n\n386\n00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.520\nfirmware files or\nconfig files, if you will.\n\n387\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.790\nThat's where something known as\nTrivial File Transfer Protocol comes in.\n\n388\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.820\nNow this is a little bit different because\nwhat it uses is something known as\n\n389\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.460\nuser datagram protocol right?\n\n390\n00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.430\nSo it's a little bit more streamlined,\na little bit faster and it doesn't have\n\n391\n00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.520\nthe overhead if you will, network\noverhead, communication overhead as FTP.\n\n392\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.520\nSo, know that Trivial File Transfer\nProtocol, again it's a stripped down\n\n393\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.260\nversion that runs over the User Datagram\nProtocol and it uses port 69, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.840\nSo important stuff to remember there.\n\n395\n00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.480\nAll right, so that takes care of a handful\nof the ports that we need to talk about.\n\n396\n00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.660\nI think the last one, Zach, looks like\nwe've got enough time, we might have to go\n\n397\n00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:48.350\ninto a part two on this one, that I wanna\ntalk about are the email protocols.\n\n398\n00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.020\nAnd the email protocols are important.\n\n399\n00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.580\nAnd they are important to understand\nbecause even if you're not gonna be, let's\n\n400\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.990\nsay, a networking guru, we definitely\nwant you to be a networking guru.\n\n401\n00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.290\nAnd if you're gonna go\ninto a networking position\n\n402\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.010\nyou're definitely gonna\nhave to know these.\n\n403\n00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.790\nBut even from basic client\nconfiguration on the email side you're\n\n404\n00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.336\ngonna have to know these ports, all right?\n\n405\n00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:10.770\nAnd if we could take\na look at the screen here,\n\n406\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:14.270\nI've got one of the first ones\nI wanna talk about, all right?\n\n407\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.920\nThis is known as SMTP, all right?\n\n408\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.260\nThis is another one of\nthose email protocols.\n\n409\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.760\nBeen around for a while, right?\n\n410\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.090\nThis is what's known as\nthe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n411\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.300\nNow I want you to pay attention to\nthe direction of the arrows, right,\n\n412\n00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.560\nbecause this is one that you\nmight overlook if you're not\n\n413\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.470\npaying attention close\nattention all right.\n\n414\n00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.760\nSometimes I get these arrows out here and\nit looks nothing more than like I don't\n\n415\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.170\nknow a road map to downtown New York but\nin this case what we're talking about is\n\n416\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:45.080\nwe're actually sending information\noutbound to the server right over port 25.\n\n417\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.980\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol\nis responsible for\n\n418\n00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.360\nforwarding traffic from\na client to a server.\n\n419\n00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.280\nAnd the other thing I want you to\nunderstand too is notice that we have\n\n420\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.190\nan SMTP server here and\nan SMTP server here as well.\n\n421\n00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:03.030\nWell why do we have SMTP being\nforwarded between servers?\n\n422\n00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.390\nWell, guess what?\n\n423\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.090\nServers also use port 25 and\n\n424\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.700\nwhen they're sending SMTP that\nmeans they're forwarding traffic.\n\n425\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.850\nSo if company A has an SMTP server and\ncompany B has an SMTP server, guess what?\n\n426\n00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.010\nFrom server to server communication,\nrather than just the client,\n\n427\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.370\na little piece of software\nrunning on my client here,\n\n428\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.978\nthey are also going to use port 25,\nall right.\n\n429\n00:23:22.978 --> 00:23:28.590\nSo port 25 for\nsending email SMTP, all right?\n\n430\n00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.900\nAnd the reason I make mention\nof that is because that is in\n\n431\n00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.880\na contrast to the next one here.\n\n432\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.600\nPost Office Protocol version 3, I don't\nknow what the heck happened to version 2.\n\n433\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.170\nBut we've been on version 3 for\n\n434\n00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.310\na while now, Post Office Protocol\nversion 3 is what POP 3 is.\n\n435\n00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.930\nNow notice the direction\nof the arrow on this one.\n\n436\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.590\nAll right, just a little bit\ndifferent here, all right?\n\n437\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.781\nThis is for retrieving email, all right,\nthis is for downloading your email.\n\n438\n00:23:55.781 --> 00:23:58.901\nPOP3, and I'm always gonna say POP V3, but\n\n439\n00:23:58.901 --> 00:24:03.520\nPOP3 is what I would use to\nconnect to an email server.\n\n440\n00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.728\nPull the email, or retrieve it.\n\n441\n00:24:04.728 --> 00:24:08.370\nPull the email down from\nthe server to my local hard drive.\n\n442\n00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.896\nNow, I do want you to understand that POP3\nhas a specific port as well, all right.\n\n443\n00:24:13.896 --> 00:24:17.660\nIf you are gonna connect to a POP3 server,\nyou're gonna be connecting on port 110.\n\n444\n00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.537\nAgain remember, identifying\nthe endpoint of the connection, right?\n\n445\n00:24:20.537 --> 00:24:22.770\nThat's what those ports are there for.\n\n446\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.811\nIt is retrieving email though.\n\n447\n00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:28.430\nThere is one thing that you\ngotta worry kind of about.\n\n448\n00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.373\nThere's a little concern over POP3.\n\n449\n00:24:30.373 --> 00:24:35.361\nAnd that's the fact that when I connect\nto my POP3 server or a POP3 server and\n\n450\n00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:38.060\nI download my email, guess what it does.\n\n451\n00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.991\nIt erases the copy of that\nemail off of the server.\n\n452\n00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:44.430\nNow, that doesn't seem\nlike a big deal all right?\n\n453\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.920\nBecause we're so used to using the third\nemail protocol which we'll talk about here\n\n454\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.590\nin a second,\nthat we don't think about it right?\n\n455\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.410\nIf you think Zach, I don't know if\nyou're like me, but I use Gmail a lot,\n\n456\n00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.654\nor I use Office 365.\n\n457\n00:24:56.654 --> 00:25:01.500\nAnd it doesn't matter where I go to log\nin, I have access to my email right?\n\n458\n00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.814\nWell, with the POP3 server,\nlet's say that you're at home and\n\n459\n00:25:04.814 --> 00:25:09.213\nyou connect to your company's POP3 server\nand you download your email, and it's got\n\n460\n00:25:09.213 --> 00:25:13.392\na copy of some important statistics that\nyou need to present to your boss, right.\n\n461\n00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:17.423\nWell, when you connect to that POP3 server\nand download or retrieve your emails,\n\n462\n00:25:17.423 --> 00:25:20.431\nit erases those emails from the server and\nthen you go to work.\n\n463\n00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:24.450\nGet them into work and you connect\nto the POP3 server and guess what?\n\n464\n00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.775\nThose emails are gone.\n\n465\n00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.330\nYou downloaded them locally to\nthe client when you first connected.\n\n466\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.245\nNow I do know and\n\n467\n00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:34.058\nI am aware that there is an option\nto leave a copy up on the server.\n\n468\n00:25:34.058 --> 00:25:39.390\nBut that's one of the drawbacks to POP3,\nall right.\n\n469\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.136\nNow if you wanna be able to manage\nyour emails on the server and\n\n470\n00:25:43.136 --> 00:25:48.426\nyou wanna work with them, create folders,\ndoesn't matter what computer you go to,\n\n471\n00:25:48.426 --> 00:25:52.108\nthat's what you're gonna,\nuse, if I can say that right.\n\n472\n00:25:52.108 --> 00:25:55.753\nDon't lose, that's where you're\ngonna use the last email server or\n\n473\n00:25:55.753 --> 00:25:58.640\nemail protocol that we\nwanna talk about here.\n\n474\n00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.812\nAnd what I've got here is an example\nof what is known as IMAP, all right.\n\n475\n00:26:02.812 --> 00:26:06.360\nThat's the Internet message or\nmail access protocol.\n\n476\n00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.550\nWhat this allows me to do is this\nallows me to connect to the server.\n\n477\n00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:13.430\nAnd I could manage, download and\n\n478\n00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.658\nwork with my emails, just like I\ncould if they were stored locally.\n\n479\n00:26:17.658 --> 00:26:22.090\nAnd i can log into any web browser,\nreally, that supports it today.\n\n480\n00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.850\nThat's what we commonly we use today,\nright, IMAP.\n\n481\n00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.410\nAnd that's why if I log into Gmail I can\ngo to one web browser, one computer,\n\n482\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.190\nI can look and retrieve my emails but\nthey're on the server.\n\n483\n00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.960\nThey look to me that as they're local,\nright?\n\n484\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.328\nI can see them in the web browser but\nthen I can go over to another computer and\n\n485\n00:26:38.328 --> 00:26:39.290\nI can log in.\n\n486\n00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.760\nI can connect to that IMAP server and\nguess what?\n\n487\n00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.386\nStill have access to my email, all right.\n\n488\n00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:50.483\nSo, three of the email protocols, and\nthe last one there IMAP, that's port 143.\n\n489\n00:26:50.483 --> 00:26:55.171\nAll right, so we've got port 25 for\nSMTP, we've got port 110 for\n\n490\n00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:58.090\nPOP3 and we've got port 143 for IMAP.\n\n491\n00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.212\nKeep in mind your email protocols, and\n\n492\n00:27:00.212 --> 00:27:03.443\nZach is giving me the old evil\neye when it comes to this time.\n\n493\n00:27:03.443 --> 00:27:06.390\nSo it does look like we're gonna\nhave to put a comma in this episode.\n\n494\n00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.173\nWe'll come back with a part two.\n\n495\n00:27:07.173 --> 00:27:10.693\n[LAUGH] Wes, you doing a fantastic job.\n\n496\n00:27:10.693 --> 00:27:12.783\nAnd it's amazing everything\nthat you remember and\n\n497\n00:27:12.783 --> 00:27:14.560\nyou're able to share with us so fluidly.\n\n498\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.555\nThank you so very much.\n\n499\n00:27:15.555 --> 00:27:17.810\nAnd so of course this is ports and\nprotocols part one.\n\n500\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.841\nThere will be a part two.\n\n501\n00:27:18.841 --> 00:27:21.690\nAnd this is inside\nthe CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n502\n00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.620\nMake sure you watch every single episode.\n\n503\n00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.348\nCourse

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:08.537\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.516\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:13.385\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:16.940\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.601\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA and Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:23.730\nThis is Ports and Protocols Pt 2,\nmake sure you see Pt 1.\n\n9\n00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.200\nAnd our IT expert bringing us all the\ngreat information we need is Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.640\nWes, thanks for coming on back.\n\n11\n00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.140\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here, Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.680\nThat's right,\nwe left you with a cliffhanger in Pt 1.\n\n13\n00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.752\nRemember, we were talking about in Pt 1,\nwe kinda set the stage.\n\n14\n00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.300\nAnd I'd like to just recap\njust a little bit, right?\n\n15\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.930\nRemember, we're talking about ports and\nprotocols, right?\n\n16\n00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.109\nProtocol is a rule for\ncommunication, right?\n\n17\n00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.080\nA structured organization,\nif you will, rules for communication.\n\n18\n00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.465\nAnd if you have a service that is needed,\n\n19\n00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.974\nyou have a client computer\nrequesting a service out there,\n\n20\n00:00:51.974 --> 00:00:56.412\nboth endpoints have to be speaking\nthat same communication type, right?\n\n21\n00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:59.660\nAnd that's essentially what a protocol is,\nright?\n\n22\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.830\nNow the port is what helps us to identify\nthat connection, where it's going, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.880\nSo for instance,\nwe talked about in the first episode,\n\n24\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.630\nwe talked about things like\nour email servers, right?\n\n25\n00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.630\nIf I'm going to send email to\nan SMTP server, it's port, right?\n\n26\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.760\nThe port that it's listening out on,\nthat's open.\n\n27\n00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.430\nAnd it's saying, hey, you could send\nme your email, is port 25, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.600\nSo it identifies that logical\nendpoint of a connection.\n\n29\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.194\nSo I do want you to be aware of that.\n\n30\n00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.312\nNow continuing on, basically,\n\n31\n00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:33.380\nwe have quite a few more protocols\nthat we need to talk about, right?\n\n32\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.230\nWe've got one service, protocol,\n\n33\n00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.465\nif you will, that's out there that is\nprobably one of the most important.\n\n34\n00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:44.520\nThey're all important, Zach, but this\nreally, from administrative standpoint,\n\n35\n00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.020\nhelps us to reduce\nthe complexities of addressing\n\n36\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.710\nall of the computers that\nare across our networks, right?\n\n37\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.811\nNow if you're on a small network,\nit might not be so bad, right?\n\n38\n00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.360\nIf you've got 5 or 6 computers, but can\nyou imagine if you have 5,000 computers?\n\n39\n00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.690\nAnd you need to assign an IP address\nto every single one of those\n\n40\n00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.920\ncomputers, right?\n\n41\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.770\nWell, if you're an hourly employee,\nthat's just fine.\n\n42\n00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.358\nYou start now,\n\n43\n00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:09.354\nby the time you're done, you'll probably\nhave to start over again, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:11.720\nIt's like mowing a 1,000-acre\nyard with a push mower.\n\n45\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.236\nBy the time you're done,\nyou need to start back over again.\n\n46\n00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:19.546\nBut we really want to try to reduce\nthe administrative complexities,\n\n47\n00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:24.080\nlike marriage complexities,\nof assigning IP addresses.\n\n48\n00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.420\nAnd that's where something\nknown as DHCP comes in, right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.690\nNow in other episodes,\nwe go more into depth on the DHCP process.\n\n50\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.020\nBut you need to know,\nagain, the protocol, right?\n\n51\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.260\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n52\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.220\nIn fact, I got a little diagram here,\njust as a real quick refresher\n\n53\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.350\nif you haven't seen our episodes where\nwe talk about DHCP more, all right?\n\n54\n00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.680\nRemember that DHCP,\nit allows dynamic host configuration.\n\n55\n00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.230\nI love to break down\nthe acronyms on this because\n\n56\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.970\nin this acronym it tells\nyou what's happening.\n\n57\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.980\nDynamic, it means it's not automatic, but\n\n58\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.310\nit just does mean things can change,\nall right?\n\n59\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.490\nHost configuration, right?\n\n60\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.739\nWe're gonna send out some\nconfigurations in a protocol, right?\n\n61\n00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.251\nWe already know what protocol is,\nwe've established that,\n\n62\n00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:09.484\nthe rules of communication.\n\n63\n00:03:09.484 --> 00:03:12.288\nSo when my client computer,\nit comes online, right?\n\n64\n00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:17.170\nIt calls out to the network, and says,\nhey, anybody out there got an IP address?\n\n65\n00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.432\nMy server responses back, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:23.261\nThe DHCP server, even your home routers\ndo this, responds back, says, yeah,\n\n67\n00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:25.260\nI have an IP address, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.391\nNow there's more to it, but we'll go into\nthe DORA process when we start talking\n\n69\n00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:31.050\nabout IP addressing and stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.590\nCuz it's really, really essential to\n\n71\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.530\nhow IP addresses are obtained\nin your modern networks, right?\n\n72\n00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.640\nNow I do want you to be\naware of the port or\n\n73\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.570\nports that are associated with the DHCP.\n\n74\n00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.070\nThis is another one where, unfortunately,\nthere's just not a single port.\n\n75\n00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.295\nThere's a couple of them, right?\n\n76\n00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:57.498\nPorts 67 and 68, so do be aware of\nthat for DHCP, port 68 and port 67.\n\n77\n00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:02.080\nAll right, now the next port that we have,\nor protocol, if you will,\n\n78\n00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.060\nis one that you're\nprobably using right now.\n\n79\n00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.160\nYou're watching us from your computer,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.310\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n81\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.984\nWell, what I mean is\nsomething known as HTTP.\n\n82\n00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:14.379\nHTTP has been around for\na very long time, right?\n\n83\n00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.585\nHTTP is the hypertext transport protocol,\nall right?\n\n84\n00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:20.173\nHypertext transfer protocol, basically,\n\n85\n00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:24.550\nyour web pages that we see today when\nyou're visiting the ITProTV website.\n\n86\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.409\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n87\n00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.710\nSo I got the ITProTV website up here.\n\n88\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.855\nAnd what we have in the background\nthat's going on is there's HTML,\n\n89\n00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:33.045\nhypertext markup language, right?\n\n90\n00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:35.060\nThe hypertext markup language is,\nessentially,\n\n91\n00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.610\nthe language that your\nwebpages are written in.\n\n92\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.850\nNow what I have is I have a web client.\n\n93\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.630\nThe web client, in this case,\njust happens to be Internet Explorer.\n\n94\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.870\nAnd for those of you out there\nthat like different browsers,\n\n95\n00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.740\nI'm not picking one over the other.\n\n96\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.560\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, if you will,\n\n97\n00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.340\nEdge, Internet Explorer,\nall type of web clients, right?\n\n98\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.510\nWell, the web browser,\n\n99\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.578\nwhat it does is it actually connects to\nthe web server, on port 80, by the way.\n\n100\n00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:04.520\nAnd there is a change to that, too,\nand we'll talk about that in a second.\n\n101\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.650\nAnd the web server essentially\nresponds to a request.\n\n102\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.687\nSo my web browser here is going to\nconnect to a web server and say, hey,\n\n103\n00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:13.995\nI need that resource.\n\n104\n00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:15.420\nWell, what's the resource?\n\n105\n00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.527\nWell, the resource is the web page,\nall right?\n\n106\n00:05:17.527 --> 00:05:22.730\nAnd over HTTP, the web server responds\nto the request for that service.\n\n107\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.507\nAnd hands the HTML back to the web\nbrowser, which, technically,\n\n108\n00:05:26.507 --> 00:05:28.760\nis the web client in this case.\n\n109\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.670\nAnd then the web client, the browser,\nrenders the HTML in what you see,\n\n110\n00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.400\nthe interactive viewing\nexperience that you have.\n\n111\n00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.460\nThat happens over port 80, in fact,\nwe could actually kinda show you that.\n\n112\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.410\nAnd we'll let the Wireshark go ahead.\n\n113\n00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.680\nAnd we'll, basically, launch it up here,\nand it looks like I'm minimizing it here.\n\n114\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.780\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna take the network adapter here.\n\n115\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.331\nAnd we'll just kinda capture some traffic,\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.196\nWhere we're actually connected\nover HTTP to the web server,\n\n117\n00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:59.480\nlet's see if we can see\nthat port in action, right?\n\n118\n00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.924\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and I'll apply\nmy filter tcp.port and then == 80.\n\n119\n00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:06.767\nAnd we'll go ahead and hit that filter.\n\n120\n00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:11.527\nAnd I tell you what I'll do, I'll go ahead\nand close the web browser down just for\n\n121\n00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:12.160\na second.\n\n122\n00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.610\nAnd then we'll re-open it.\n\n123\n00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.404\nAnd let's see if that generates just\na little bit of unencrypted traffic there.\n\n124\n00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:20.050\nI know Edge has using it\na little bit there, too.\n\n125\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.106\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsee if we can't, we'll go ahead and\n\n126\n00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:25.824\nopen these back up here.\n\n127\n00:06:27.677 --> 00:06:30.794\nGotta try to generate\nsome of the traffic here.\n\n128\n00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:33.551\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we want here, and\n\n129\n00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.792\nlet's see here.\n\n130\n00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:36.530\nThere we go, that's what I wanted to see.\n\n131\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.687\nSo I've got my filter in here,\nand I can go ahead and\n\n132\n00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:42.390\nactually stop this packet capture.\n\n133\n00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.360\nBut what I wanna see here is notice that\nTransmission Control Protocol, all right?\n\n134\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.930\nRemember, we are talking about ports, the\nsource port is coming from my computer.\n\n135\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.597\nIt's in that 49152 to 65535 I told you\nabout, those were the dynamic ports.\n\n136\n00:06:57.597 --> 00:07:01.515\nWell, look, my computer is\nsending a connection saying, hey,\n\n137\n00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:02.880\nit's coming from me.\n\n138\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.200\nBut notice what the destination is here,\nthe destination port is HTTP, right?\n\n139\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.787\nSo I can see that this is HTTP traffic.\n\n140\n00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:15.130\nAnd we can see that right here just\nby capturing that information.\n\n141\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.849\nAnd that's one of the reasons I tell you\nthat it is important to understand these\n\n142\n00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.335\nprotocols, all right?\n\n143\n00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:28.660\nNow there's a problem with HTTP,\nHTTP is unencrypted traffic.\n\n144\n00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.444\nIt's another one of those ones that, yes,\n\n145\n00:07:30.444 --> 00:07:33.545\nI know it's gonna start sounding like\na tin-foil hat episode here, Zach.\n\n146\n00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:38.030\nBut it's one of those ones that\nsomebody could capture the information,\n\n147\n00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.051\njust like I did.\n\n148\n00:07:39.051 --> 00:07:41.339\nAnd they could potentially\nsee what's going on.\n\n149\n00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:45.665\nAnd they can decipher what is\ngoing on with your communication.\n\n150\n00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:49.174\nIf there's any information in there\nthat you don't want anybody seeing,\n\n151\n00:07:49.174 --> 00:07:50.297\nthey're gonna see it.\n\n152\n00:07:50.297 --> 00:07:55.064\nSo one of the things that you'll notice\nis that this web browser, in fact,\n\n153\n00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:59.312\nif you load this up here on the web\nsite here, ITProTV's web site.\n\n154\n00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:04.136\nNotice that we have this H HTTPS,\nall right?\n\n155\n00:08:04.136 --> 00:08:06.150\nWell, what's HTTPS?\n\n156\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.620\nWell we can couple HTTP with something\nknown as SSL, the secure socket layer.\n\n157\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.714\nAll right, so HTTPS is an acronym,\nif you want the full name it's\n\n158\n00:08:15.714 --> 00:08:19.660\nHyper Text Transfer Protocol\nover Secure Socket Layer.\n\n159\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.630\nHTTP over SSL.\n\n160\n00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.160\nAnd what that does is Adds that\nPublic-key cryptography, right?\n\n161\n00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.810\nLike we were talking about SSH,\nI get the public key of the server.\n\n162\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.650\nWell, guess what?\nWe're gonna start a session key, too,\n\n163\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.180\nprocess, it's just\na little bit different but\n\n164\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.750\nwe're gonna start a session with\nthe server and when we connect to it,\n\n165\n00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.830\nwhat's gonna go on is, it is going\nto encrypt the communication, right?\n\n166\n00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.060\nIt's going to make sure that if somebody\nis out there with one of these,\n\n167\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.140\nlike Wireshark and\n\n168\n00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.000\nthey're scanning the network that they\ncannot see that information, right?\n\n169\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.252\nThat is port 443, that's what we want\nyou to be aware of for the exam.\n\n170\n00:08:55.252 --> 00:08:57.690\nand again,you could fire up\nsomething like Wireshark and\n\n171\n00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.440\nyou can actually see the communications,\nright?\n\n172\n00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.250\nThat's port 443,\nthat is encrypted traffic.\n\n173\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.399\nNow, I want you to be careful with this\none because, one of the things that\n\n174\n00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:12.318\nI have told students in the past,\nis that port 143 and port 443.\n\n175\n00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:16.941\nBoy, those are really, really close and\nif you're getting nervous on the exam,\n\n176\n00:09:16.941 --> 00:09:21.220\nI can see you making a mistake on those,\njust because how close they are.\n\n177\n00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.232\nDo not confuse, port 143 with IMAP,\n\n178\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:29.250\nAll right, and port 443 with HTTPS.\n\n179\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:35.502\nDo not confuse them the other way, right,\nHTTPS, 443, all right, IMAP, port 443.\n\n180\n00:09:35.502 --> 00:09:39.765\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, is there a protocol to help us\nfind out the state of our network devices?\n\n181\n00:09:39.765 --> 00:09:42.985\n&gt;&gt; This is a very, very useful protocol.\n\n182\n00:09:42.985 --> 00:09:46.935\nAnd that's something known as the Simple\nNetwork Management Protocol, SNMP.\n\n183\n00:09:46.935 --> 00:09:50.155\nNow SNMP is a way that just\nlike you were saying, Zach,\n\n184\n00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:55.915\nthat I can connect to various devices,\nrouters, switches, if you will, servers.\n\n185\n00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:59.960\nAnd if I've got the software set up\nright they can actually send me well,\n\n186\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.690\nthings like configuration,\nhow they're configured, if you will, and\n\n187\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.070\nwe can just basically\nmonitor those devices.\n\n188\n00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.670\nAnd I got a little example here too and\n\n189\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.140\nwhat you have is the simple\nnetwork management protocol.\n\n190\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.050\nYou typically have a management station.\n\n191\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.860\nWe'll talk more about the mid databases\nand stuff in another episode.\n\n192\n00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.850\nBut again,\nremember the protocol itself, Again,\n\n193\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.910\nit allows us to communicate with our\nnetwork devices and find out what there\n\n194\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.360\nconfigurations are and basically what's\nthe state, the state of their health.\n\n195\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.930\nAre they online, are they offline and\n\n196\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.030\nthis is a great protocol that you\nshould should be aware of, SNMP.\n\n197\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.950\nNow there are few different versions.\n\n198\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.020\nThere is SNMP1, which really\nshouldnt' be used at all any more,\n\n199\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.880\neven two has some\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n200\n00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.540\nReally, today, for security purposes,\nif you are gonna use SNMP,\n\n201\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:53.040\nyou wanna be using SNMP version three,\nand that is port 161.\n\n202\n00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.340\nSo be aware of that.\n\n203\n00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.270\nNow there are other\nprotocols that we can also\n\n204\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.370\nuse that allow us to connect over\nthe network to other computers.\n\n205\n00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:06.660\nAnd, if we want, we can control them just\nlike we're sitting at them locally right,\n\n206\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.260\nthese are what is known as\na remote connection protocol.\n\n207\n00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.660\nAnd there's actually one that\nthey call out specifically.\n\n208\n00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.780\nThere's all different types.\n\n209\n00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.210\nThere's RDP remote desktop protocol.\n\n210\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.780\nYou have things VNC SSH allows\nyou remote logons as well.\n\n211\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.650\nRight but what we're talking\nabout is Microsoft's proprietary.\n\n212\n00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.010\nMicrosoft's implementation of\na remote management protocol and\n\n213\n00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.030\nthat's something known as RDP\nthe Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n214\n00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.020\nWe can actually see that in action,\nI tell you.\n\n215\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.700\nLet me show you here how we use that,\nright?\n\n216\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.060\nSo if I wanna connect to another machine,\nand I wanna control it over the network,\n\n217\n00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.790\nall I have to do is go down to our\nlittle search functionality here, and\n\n218\n00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.590\nwe can type MSTSC and we can launch our\nremote desktop connection software, and\n\n219\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.610\nI can make a connection.\n\n220\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.830\nAll right, let me make sure that\nI got the IP address right there,\n\n221\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.200\nthen we can make a connection.\n\n222\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.370\nLet's try that again.\n\n223\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.120\nThere we go, that's what we want.\n\n224\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.990\nAnd I have to remember if\nI have my password right.\n\n225\n00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.750\nAll right, so,\nI'm connecting to this machine right now.\n\n226\n00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.530\nAnd this is another Windows machine\nthat's on the network, right?\n\n227\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:18.570\nAnd I just used RDP to connect over\nthe network to it in order to, well,\n\n228\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.220\nbasically take control of it remotely.\n\n229\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.580\nAll right, and let me see here.\n\n230\n00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.830\nWe can potentially also\nsee this in action, too.\n\n231\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.080\nSo we'll use Wireshark and\nshow you guys these ports as well.\n\n232\n00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.210\nAnd why things like\nthe ports are important.\n\n233\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.660\nAll right, so if I just basically look\nup any kind of connection here or\n\n234\n00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.440\njust fire up Wireshark again.\n\n235\n00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.470\nWe could probably let me see.\n\n236\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.460\nI wanna say this is TLS.\n\n237\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.020\nI might have that wrong but\nlet's try this.\n\n238\n00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.840\nTCP port will equals and\n\n239\n00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.700\nthen is 3389.\n\n240\n00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.630\nAll right, now there we go.\n\n241\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.820\nYeah, we can see those.\n\n242\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.560\nSo what we end up having here is\nin Remote Desktop Protocol, RDP,\n\n243\n00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.230\nwhen I make a connection that other\nWindows computer that was listening out\n\n244\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.810\nlike a server, it's a actually\nlooking at port 3389, right.\n\n245\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.710\nAnd we can see that right here, port 3389.\n\n246\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.290\nSo I want you to remember\nthat on the exam right?\n\n247\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.160\nWhen it comes to remote desktop protocol,\n\n248\n00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.090\nit allows me the ability to connect\nto another Windows machine,\n\n249\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.010\nessentially controlling it as though\nI'm sitting locally at it right?\n\n250\n00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.420\nHere's the desktop of\nthe machine that I'm sitting at.\n\n251\n00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.260\nWell, guess what?\n\n252\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.330\nOver the network now you can see this\nlittle remote desktop connection bar here.\n\n253\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.820\nI can actually connect to this machine and\nI can control it.\n\n254\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:42.590\nI can work with it just like I was\nsitting in front of it locally, right?\n\n255\n00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:48.020\nSo, remote desktop protocol, RDP,\nyou wanna know is port 3389.\n\n256\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.540\nNow that's another one that I'm gonna\nmention coming up a little bit later that\n\n257\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.080\nalso is really close, all right?\n\n258\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.970\nSo I'm gonna mention it now.\n\n259\n00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.530\nWe'll get to it in a second here.\n\n260\n00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.250\nLDAP, lightweight directory\naccess protocol uses port 389.\n\n261\n00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.470\nLet's be careful and\nnot confuse those two.\n\n262\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.280\nAll right, so\nwhat else do we have here, Zach?\n\n263\n00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.990\nThe next thing that we're going to look\nat is what is known as, well, NTP.\n\n264\n00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.120\nNTP is a port or a protocol that's\nbeen around for a good long while and\n\n265\n00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.160\nthis is really about timing,\nall right, network time protocol.\n\n266\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.080\nAll right,\nNTP is network type protocol and\n\n267\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.220\nis what we use as time synchronization.\n\n268\n00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.624\nSo let me show you here,\nI got a little diagram here.\n\n269\n00:14:25.624 --> 00:14:28.246\nYour computers rely,\ntheir network communications,\n\n270\n00:14:28.246 --> 00:14:30.430\neverything revolves around timing, right.\n\n271\n00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:35.450\nIt's one of the reasons we have that\nreal time clock on your computer.\n\n272\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.540\nLike a metronome,\nit's the heartbeat of your computer.\n\n273\n00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.638\nWhen you're doing things like synchronous\ncommunications, I need to be able to\n\n274\n00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:45.814\nsynchronize so that we can send those\ncommunications in the right order, right.\n\n275\n00:14:45.814 --> 00:14:48.650\nWell, NTP is the way that you do that,\nright.\n\n276\n00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.680\nThere's a lot of protocols that\nare really, really time sensitive,\n\n277\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.970\nthings like the Kerberos\nauthentication protocol.\n\n278\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.440\nIt's very time sensitive.\n\n279\n00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.571\nSo you need to make sure our computers,\nour devices out there need to make\n\n280\n00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.247\nsure that they can rely on whats\nknown as a reliable time source.\n\n281\n00:15:06.247 --> 00:15:09.400\nAnd they do that over NTP.\n\n282\n00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.910\nUnderstand that NTP uses port 123 and\nI went ahead and\n\n283\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.570\njust kinda drew a little diagram up here\nbecause we think about connecting out to\n\n284\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.110\na time server and\nwe synchronize our time right?\n\n285\n00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.630\nWell, there's actually a whole entire\nhierarchy, when it comes to NTP.\n\n286\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.190\nAnd when I say hierarchy,\nI mean it is massive.\n\n287\n00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.775\nThe top part of the NTP hierarchy are what\nare known as the authoritative clocks,\n\n288\n00:15:35.775 --> 00:15:38.280\nauthorative clocks, if you will.\n\n289\n00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.380\nThese are thing like your GPS clocks,\nyour atomic clocks, that things like\n\n290\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:48.550\nthe Naval Observatory, US Naval\nObservatory, if I could say that right.\n\n291\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.486\nThey've got time clocks.\n\n292\n00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:53.768\nAnd then you have your primary time\nservers that are directly connected to\n\n293\n00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:54.672\nthose clocks.\n\n294\n00:15:54.672 --> 00:15:57.092\nAnd then they go in the layers from there,\n\n295\n00:15:57.092 --> 00:16:00.020\nall the way to where your\nlocal time source is.\n\n296\n00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.397\nKind of an interesting fact, when your\nWindows machines, when they come online,\n\n297\n00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:08.213\nthey actually reach out across\nthe internet to time.microsoft.com or\n\n298\n00:16:08.213 --> 00:16:09.478\ntime.windows.com.\n\n299\n00:16:09.478 --> 00:16:10.660\nOne of the two, I can remember exactly.\n\n300\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.230\nBut they're gonna reach out, and they're\ngonna actually do time synchronization.\n\n301\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:19.860\nTime synchronization is important on\nyour network, so know what NTP is.\n\n302\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.460\nAll right, so the next one that we have\non the list, moving on down the list,\n\n303\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.980\nis something known as SMB,\nthat's Server Message Block.\n\n304\n00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.435\nServer Message Block is inside of Windows.\n\n305\n00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:33.415\nI will tell you that this is essentially\na protocol that allows you to connect to\n\n306\n00:16:33.415 --> 00:16:36.811\nFile Share, shared resources\nwithin a Windows network, right?\n\n307\n00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:39.530\nSo if I have a shared folder\nthat I've dumped my files in and\n\n308\n00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.194\nI want people to be able to\nconnect to it over the network,\n\n309\n00:16:42.194 --> 00:16:45.770\nwell they're gonna use something\nknown as Server Message Block.\n\n310\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.630\nServer Message Block,\nI can give you an example here.\n\n311\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.890\nI've got one on my screen here.\n\n312\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:54.356\nIs when you do have those shared resources\nlike maybe its a file share out there,\n\n313\n00:16:54.356 --> 00:16:54.938\nright?\n\n314\n00:16:54.938 --> 00:16:58.848\nWe've got a folder out there on a Windows\nnetwork, and we're putting all our\n\n315\n00:16:58.848 --> 00:17:03.077\ndocuments in there, and we're allowing\npeople over the network to connect to it.\n\n316\n00:17:03.077 --> 00:17:05.583\nIf you're sharing a printer\nover the network, guess what?\n\n317\n00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:10.340\nIn order for your client to print to that\nshared computer it's gonna use SMB, right?\n\n318\n00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.740\nServer Message Block inside of Windows,\nas well as serial ports too.\n\n319\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.180\nThat's why I got the COM port up here.\n\n320\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.360\nSome of you guys maybe\ncoming over from A+,\n\n321\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.570\nremember that a COM port is\nessentially a serial port.\n\n322\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:26.150\nNow, there are interoperability protocols\nso I just want to take a second and\n\n323\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.050\nI want to make mention of.\n\n324\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.726\nThere's something known as Samba,\nall right?\n\n325\n00:17:28.726 --> 00:17:32.230\nAnd you can kinda see SMB, Samba,\nthey're kinda playing on the word.\n\n326\n00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.980\nThat's one thing you would use for\nLinux machines,\n\n327\n00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.715\nUnix-like machines to actually interact,\nif you will, with SNB shares, right?\n\n328\n00:17:40.715 --> 00:17:46.728\nSMB actually started off, originally, it\nwas a version of something known as CIFS,\n\n329\n00:17:46.728 --> 00:17:50.580\nthat's the Common Internet File System or\nStandard.\n\n330\n00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.780\nAnd Microsoft made a ton of changes to it,\nso\n\n331\n00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.940\nthere's actually quite a few\ndifferent versions of it.\n\n332\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.970\nAgain, it's an application layer protocol.\n\n333\n00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.880\nAnd when it's using TCP, Transmission\nControl Protocol, it uses Port 443.\n\n334\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.361\nBut I've actually seen it go across,\nas you research it,\n\n335\n00:18:08.361 --> 00:18:12.481\nyou might see that it can also\npiggyback not across just TCP/IP, but\n\n336\n00:18:12.481 --> 00:18:15.267\nit can piggyback across\nthings like NetBIOS.\n\n337\n00:18:15.267 --> 00:18:21.876\nAnd if it uses the UDP ports you're gonna\nsee UDP Ports 137 and 138, all right?\n\n338\n00:18:21.876 --> 00:18:29.894\nNow, they don't call out that port as far\nas what the objectives are, 137 and 138.\n\n339\n00:18:29.894 --> 00:18:32.153\nBut, I do want you to be aware of it,\njust in case.\n\n340\n00:18:32.153 --> 00:18:34.300\nI'm not sure if they're\ngonna show that on the exam.\n\n341\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.850\nBut, if they do,\nyou're there, you'll have it.\n\n342\n00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.890\nThere are other ones that are out\nthere that are like this, too.\n\n343\n00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.440\nI mean, this isn't the only one,\nWindows isn't the only one.\n\n344\n00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.010\nYou got Network File System,\nNFS, if you will.\n\n345\n00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.740\nYou've got things like, it's not\nAppleTalk, it's the Apple Filing Protocol,\n\n346\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.650\nAFP, today as well.\n\n347\n00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.960\nSo be aware of those, likewise.\n\n348\n00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.469\nAll right, so again,\njust kinda running through our list here.\n\n349\n00:18:58.469 --> 00:19:03.291\nThe next one that we have to talk about,\nI kind of briefly mentioned when I\n\n350\n00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:08.290\ntalked about RDP, Remote Desktop Protocol,\nand that was Port 3389.\n\n351\n00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:13.090\nWell, LDAP, Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol, I got an example of this here.\n\n352\n00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.850\nWhat this allows you to do, and\n\n353\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.265\nthat should not be an SMB client,\nsorry about that.\n\n354\n00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:19.970\nLet's go ahead and\nfix my slide on the fly.\n\n355\n00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.315\n[LAUGH] This is an LDAP Client, all right?\n\n356\n00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:25.835\nAnd what this allows you to do,\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol,\n\n357\n00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:30.022\nit allows you to connect to\nan X.500-based Directory Service.\n\n358\n00:19:30.022 --> 00:19:34.402\nIt essentially allows you to communicate\nwith a directory database and\n\n359\n00:19:34.402 --> 00:19:39.299\ndirectory router, directory databases,\ndirectory services, if you will.\n\n360\n00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:42.412\nThey are common for storing things\nlike usernames and passwords.\n\n361\n00:19:42.412 --> 00:19:46.182\nSo, if you are, let's say,\nin an Active Directory domain, right?\n\n362\n00:19:46.182 --> 00:19:49.827\nAnd you wanna connect to the domain\ncontroller, the directory service,\n\n363\n00:19:49.827 --> 00:19:52.015\nthe directory database, well guess what?\n\n364\n00:19:52.015 --> 00:19:53.851\nYou're gonna do it over LDAP, right?\n\n365\n00:19:53.851 --> 00:19:55.912\nAnd that is Port 389.\n\n366\n00:19:55.912 --> 00:20:00.183\nAnd I made a point to try to differentiate\nthat, it's another one of those ones that\n\n367\n00:20:00.183 --> 00:20:02.867\nyou might get wrong on the exam\nif you get nervous, or\n\n368\n00:20:02.867 --> 00:20:05.384\njust not paying attention\nto the key words here.\n\n369\n00:20:05.384 --> 00:20:10.674\nBecause, remember RDP,\nRemote Desktop Protocol, that's Port 3389.\n\n370\n00:20:10.674 --> 00:20:12.363\nLDAP, industry-wide standard,\n\n371\n00:20:12.363 --> 00:20:15.579\nI just happen to have it associated\nwith Windows Active Directory.\n\n372\n00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:18.251\nPlease understand,\nit's not just a Windows-based technology.\n\n373\n00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:23.040\nThat's LDAP, Lightweight Directory\nAccess Protocol, and that's Port 389.\n\n374\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.650\nVery easy to get wrong, but\njust as easy to get right.\n\n375\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.490\nSo even if you're a little nervous there,\n\n376\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.392\npay attention to those questions on\nthat exam, we want you to pass them.\n\n377\n00:20:30.392 --> 00:20:34.740\nAll right, let's see here,\nnow there is an issue with\n\n378\n00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.380\nthis protocol in the fact that if I am\nconnecting to that directory service.\n\n379\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.740\nI want you to think about what a directory\ndatabase, not only does it have usernames\n\n380\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.150\nand passwords, which is very,\nvery important on your network, right?\n\n381\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:52.490\nEspecially from a security stand point but\nit's a database of every object\n\n382\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.490\nwithin your network, printers,\nservers, services, you name it.\n\n383\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.966\nI mean, Active Directory, as an example,\ncan scale up to a billion objects.\n\n384\n00:21:01.966 --> 00:21:04.571\nCould be in one little file, right?\n\n385\n00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:06.961\nSo we wanna keep that protected, right?\n\n386\n00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:12.976\nSo Port 389 might not be\nthe way that communications,\n\n387\n00:21:12.976 --> 00:21:16.118\nagain, would be protected.\n\n388\n00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:20.857\nBut if we implement LDAP over SSL,\njust like with HTTP and\n\n389\n00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:24.925\nHTTPS, we can now encrypt\nthat communication.\n\n390\n00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:28.412\nSo, if you will,\nthey have what's known as LDAPS, and\n\n391\n00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:31.695\nagain it's a secure LDAP,\nand let me show you here.\n\n392\n00:21:31.695 --> 00:21:38.523\nWhat LDAPS is is a Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol over SSL.\n\n393\n00:21:38.523 --> 00:21:43.299\nAnd it, again, couples that public\nkey encryption with a communication\n\n394\n00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:47.621\nwith the database so\nthat basically it's confidential, right?\n\n395\n00:21:47.621 --> 00:21:52.660\nPort 636, all right, there are two\ndifferent ports for these, all right?\n\n396\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.950\nSo definitely know a little\nbit about those ports, right?\n\n397\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.540\nEssentially you are using\nan SSL certificate\n\n398\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.772\nto secure access to the directories\nover a TCP/IP based network.\n\n399\n00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.280\nAll right, let's see, Zach.\n\n400\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.721\nWe got a few more,\na couple we haven't talked about yet\n\n401\n00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.534\nthat I want to just go ahead and mention.\n\n402\n00:22:09.534 --> 00:22:14.341\nSession Initiation Protocol,\nand I'm kinda going\n\n403\n00:22:14.341 --> 00:22:19.366\nout of order here, but\nSession Initiation Protocol,\n\n404\n00:22:19.366 --> 00:22:24.187\nand then something known as H.323,\nall right?\n\n405\n00:22:24.187 --> 00:22:29.734\nWell let's start with the one that\nwas actually comes from the ITU,\n\n406\n00:22:29.734 --> 00:22:34.115\nthe International\nTelecommunications Unions, and\n\n407\n00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:39.091\nthat is H, I wanna say,\n232, but it's 323, right?\n\n408\n00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:42.929\n[LAUGH] This was initially used for\nvideo conferencing, but\n\n409\n00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:44.626\nlater on it was expanded.\n\n410\n00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:48.881\nAnd now it's a convergence technology,\nwhich means it converges audio, video,\n\n411\n00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:49.880\nand data.\n\n412\n00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.860\nAnd it basically, for\n\n413\n00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.850\nthose types of communications\nover a TCP/IP-based network.\n\n414\n00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.620\nSo we use it in things\nlike video conferencing.\n\n415\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:02.804\nAnd there was also another use for\nit, we use it in voice over IP,\n\n416\n00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:07.029\njust as well as we use\nSession Initiation Protocol.\n\n417\n00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:09.923\nA Session Initiation Protocol,\nagain, is used for\n\n418\n00:23:09.923 --> 00:23:13.937\nvoice communications initially but,\nagain, later it was expanded and\n\n419\n00:23:13.937 --> 00:23:16.986\nit is now used for\nmore than just voice communication.\n\n420\n00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:22.161\nWe can use it for things like video,\ninstant messaging, presence, right?\n\n421\n00:23:22.161 --> 00:23:25.174\nIf you've ever seen a listing\nin your Skype where it says,\n\n422\n00:23:25.174 --> 00:23:30.044\nhey, guess what, this person's online, or\nthis person's away, or this person's busy.\n\n423\n00:23:30.044 --> 00:23:34.880\nWell, guess what, you can use things like\nthe session initiation protocol for that.\n\n424\n00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:41.132\nLet's see here, a couple of ports,\nSIP, Session Initiation Protocol,\n\n425\n00:23:41.132 --> 00:23:44.817\nuses Port 5060, as well as a 5061.\n\n426\n00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:49.610\nThe last one there, the H.323,\nI do want you to understand\n\n427\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.325\nthat that's gonna use Port 1720,\nagain Port 1720.\n\n428\n00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:58.123\nNow the last couple of things that I\nwant to talk about are they mention\n\n429\n00:23:58.123 --> 00:23:59.186\na protocol types.\n\n430\n00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:03.160\nAll right, and I've kinda been talking\nabout this throughout the last two\n\n431\n00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.172\nepisodes and I've been mentioning things\nlike transmission control protocol.\n\n432\n00:24:07.172 --> 00:24:10.510\nAnd I've also been mentioning\nthings like UDP, all right.\n\n433\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.310\nWhat we are talking about is\non a network communication,\n\n434\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.210\nsometimes you need a guaranteed\nreliable connection.\n\n435\n00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.632\nI need to guarantee when I send\nthat information, it's gonna get to\n\n436\n00:24:21.632 --> 00:24:25.728\nthe endpoint in the right order and it's\ngonna be processed the way it should be.\n\n437\n00:24:25.728 --> 00:24:28.034\nI can't tolerate errors.\n\n438\n00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:32.330\nI've got to have that reliable service.\n\n439\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.853\nWell, with a reliable service there's\na lot of checks and balances,\n\n440\n00:24:34.853 --> 00:24:35.805\nthings that have to go on.\n\n441\n00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:39.555\nAnd, in some cases you don't care\nif a packet gets dropped, but\n\n442\n00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:41.660\nyou need it to get there fast.\n\n443\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.920\nThat would be connection list service,\nright?\n\n444\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.420\nWhere you need it a little bit more\nstreamlined, that's where two protocols,\n\n445\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.240\ntwo transport protocols come in.\n\n446\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.301\nOne known as transmission control protocol\nTCP, and the other one known as UDP,\n\n447\n00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:54.806\nthe user datagram protocol.\n\n448\n00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:58.785\nLet's go ahead and I tell you what,\nLet's start with TCP.\n\n449\n00:24:58.785 --> 00:25:04.845\nAll right, when I talk about TCP, there's\na reason there's a little bit of overhead.\n\n450\n00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:10.372\nThis is a connection-oriented service\nensuring reliable delivery, all right?\n\n451\n00:25:10.372 --> 00:25:13.724\nAnd that's like me\nsending a piece of mail,\n\n452\n00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:18.085\nthis ad, and I wanna make sure\nthat Zach gets it, right.\n\n453\n00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:20.385\nSo what do I do?\nI want delivery confirmation,\n\n454\n00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:25.045\nI want a return receipt and if Zack\ndoesn't get it I want him to call back and\n\n455\n00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:28.990\nlet me know, I didn't get that\npackage I need to resend it.\n\n456\n00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.174\nThat's essentially what transmission\ncontrol protocol's gonna do, all right?\n\n457\n00:25:32.174 --> 00:25:34.029\nBut in order for that to happen,\n\n458\n00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:37.140\nwe have to go through\na certain handshaking process.\n\n459\n00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.047\nAnd I want you to know that about\ntransmission control protocol as well.\n\n460\n00:25:40.047 --> 00:25:43.790\nTo set up this reliable connection,\nwe go through a three way handshake.\n\n461\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.730\nLet's me show you what I mean here.\n\n462\n00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.459\nAll right, so in the TCP 3-way handshake,\nwe have what's\n\n463\n00:25:48.459 --> 00:25:52.327\nknown as synchronization request, remember\nwe earlier we're talking about time.\n\n464\n00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:54.766\n[LAUGH] What time is important, right?\n\n465\n00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:58.954\nI'm gonna reach out, I say it's gonna be\nthe computers that are doing this, but\n\n466\n00:25:58.954 --> 00:26:01.000\nI'm going to reach out this computer.\n\n467\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.678\nI'm must say,\nI need to study some reliable or\n\n468\n00:26:03.678 --> 00:26:06.020\nsome information in a reliable manner.\n\n469\n00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.863\nSo we're gonna send what's\nknown as a SYN packet.\n\n470\n00:26:07.863 --> 00:26:11.070\nIt's a synchronization request.\n\n471\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.472\nZach's computer is gonna hear it and\nit's gonna respond back, okay, yeah,\n\n472\n00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:15.409\nI acknowledge that.\n\n473\n00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:18.120\nYou just sent a synchronization request.\n\n474\n00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.691\nThat's called a snack or\na SYN-ACK [LAUGH].\n\n475\n00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:23.752\nThe synchronization\nacknowledgement all right packet.\n\n476\n00:26:23.752 --> 00:26:28.624\nFinal process,final part of this three way\nhandshake is an acknowledgement back to\n\n477\n00:26:28.624 --> 00:26:33.080\nhis computer that yes,\nwe have established that communication.\n\n478\n00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.270\nBut it goes a little bit farther than\nthat, it doesn't just stop there.\n\n479\n00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.280\nTransmission control protocol does\nsomething kind of interesting.\n\n480\n00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.089\nWhen you've got a large amount of\ninformation that you need to send, right?\n\n481\n00:26:42.089 --> 00:26:44.273\nWe've established\nthe three we handshake and\n\n482\n00:26:44.273 --> 00:26:47.880\nnow we gonna send communications\nbetween Zach and my computer.\n\n483\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.382\nWhat's gonna happen is the TCP\nis gonna take that package and\n\n484\n00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:55.580\nit's gonna break it down into smaller\nmore manageable pieces, right?\n\n485\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.150\nThis is what's known as, segmentation.\n\n486\n00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.744\nAnd user gonna become segments, all right.\n\n487\n00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:02.736\nNow it's gonna go a little farther than\nthat too, cuz it's gonna take each one of\n\n488\n00:27:02.736 --> 00:27:05.440\nthose pieces and\nit's gonna sequentially number them.\n\n489\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.720\nNow please don't take 1,\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n490\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.810\nThese could be large numbers,\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n491\n00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.784\nBut what it's gonna do is it's gonna\nsequentially mark them, right?\n\n492\n00:27:14.784 --> 00:27:18.320\nSo now, what we have is segmentation and\nsequencing, right?\n\n493\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.900\nWell why are we doing the segmentation?\n\n494\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.672\nFor more reliable delivery.\n\n495\n00:27:21.672 --> 00:27:23.160\nWhy are we doing sequencing?\n\n496\n00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.540\nWell, sequencing works like this,\nlet's say that I'm the source of\n\n497\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.770\nthe communication here, and\nlet's say Zack is the destination.\n\n498\n00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:35.095\nWell, notice something, Zack's computer in\nmy diagram here has received packet one,\n\n499\n00:27:35.095 --> 00:27:38.720\npacket two, or segment one,\nsegment two, segment three.\n\n500\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.830\nNotice what's missing.\n\n501\n00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.219\nSegment four, all right?\n\n502\n00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:45.900\nSo transmission control protocol, and\nthis part of the handshake process.\n\n503\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.334\nZack's computer is going to say hey, hey,\nhey hold on I'm missing four, I got one,\n\n504\n00:27:51.334 --> 00:27:56.410\ntwo, three but now you're sending me five,\nwe've got something wrong here.\n\n505\n00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:01.080\nSo what he's gonna tell my computer, I'm\nmissing segment four, can you resend that?\n\n506\n00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.627\nAnd my computer will resend segment four,\nbut\n\n507\n00:28:03.627 --> 00:28:08.020\nthen it'll start back in the process of\nall those sequence segments behind it.\n\n508\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.260\nSo not only does it ensure that it's\nbroken down into a reliable manner, but\n\n509\n00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.720\nthen when they're processed\non the other end, guess what?\n\n510\n00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.255\nThey're processed in the right order.\n\n511\n00:28:17.255 --> 00:28:22.519\nGuarantee, first of all, connection\noriented service with reliable delivery,\n\n512\n00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:24.483\nyour delivery confirmation.\n\n513\n00:28:24.483 --> 00:28:30.240\nAnd that is unlike something\nknown as User Datagram Protocol.\n\n514\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.050\nAll of that extra stuff that is going on,\ntakes a little bit of overhead.\n\n515\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.520\nYour computers have to do this.\n\n516\n00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.000\nThey have entire offload engines for\nTCP to maintain communication.\n\n517\n00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.515\nEspecially when you have hundreds\nof hundreds of thousands of these\n\n518\n00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:44.060\ncommunications.\n\n519\n00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.498\nSometimes you just need\nthings that are fast, and\n\n520\n00:28:46.498 --> 00:28:48.889\nthat's where user\nDatagram Protocol comes in.\n\n521\n00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:52.165\nI want you to think about,\nhere in the states,\n\n522\n00:28:52.165 --> 00:28:57.122\nif I need to mail a snail mail and\nI don't need to go to the postoffice and\n\n523\n00:28:57.122 --> 00:29:02.425\ndo all that delivery confirmation,\nreturn receipt, what do I do?\n\n524\n00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:05.425\nWell, here in the states, we find one\nof those blue mailboxes right and\n\n525\n00:29:05.425 --> 00:29:07.527\nI take my letter and\nI throw it in it and I walk away.\n\n526\n00:29:07.527 --> 00:29:10.418\nThat's best effort delivery,\nno guaranteed delivery but\n\n527\n00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:12.260\nyou don't have all that overhead.\n\n528\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.815\nMy time isn't gonna be spent on delivery\nconfirmation, and filling paperwork out,\n\n529\n00:29:16.815 --> 00:29:18.853\nI'll just throw it in the mail and go.\n\n530\n00:29:18.853 --> 00:29:22.988\nMy time is money, well that's\nthe same thing that you use with UDP.\n\n531\n00:29:22.988 --> 00:29:24.837\nIf I need to stream data,\n\n532\n00:29:24.837 --> 00:29:31.440\nI don't care if there's that football\nplayer that's running into the end zone.\n\n533\n00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.356\nI don't need to pick up a couple of little\nsegments that we maybe we lost, right?\n\n534\n00:29:36.356 --> 00:29:39.520\nNo, just let them go and\nlet's just keep going.\n\n535\n00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.260\nIt's streaming information.\n\n536\n00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.475\nI needed there fast and\nI cannot worry about rebuilding it, right?\n\n537\n00:29:43.475 --> 00:29:46.480\nFile transfers, I want to rebuild it.\n\n538\n00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.244\nI want to make sure that the data\nstate maintains its integrity.\n\n539\n00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:52.077\nIn something like streaming media,\nwe drop a couple of packets,\n\n540\n00:29:52.077 --> 00:29:54.810\nyou see it glitch in the video and\nwe move on, right?\n\n541\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.850\nSo there are reasons why you would\nuse a connection list service.\n\n542\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.476\nYou can also have things where\nthe application has built-in,\n\n543\n00:30:01.476 --> 00:30:02.490\nreliable delivery.\n\n544\n00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.780\nWell, then there's no reason to\nuse transmission control protocol.\n\n545\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.640\nYou can let the application handle it,\nall right.\n\n546\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.940\nTwo protocols there,\nI know we're getting out of time here.\n\n547\n00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.055\nBut I also wanna mention one is ICMP,\n\n548\n00:30:14.055 --> 00:30:16.930\nthat's the internet\ncontrol message protocol.\n\n549\n00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.000\nInternet control message protocol doesn't\nactually send information, right?\n\n550\n00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.874\nNot like these transport protocols,\nUDP and TCP that we're talking about.\n\n551\n00:30:23.874 --> 00:30:28.242\nThis is actually for things like\nsending diagnostics information,\n\n552\n00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:30.360\nflow control, error messages.\n\n553\n00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.341\nIf I am sending too much information into\nZach's computer and Zach's computer,\n\n554\n00:30:34.341 --> 00:30:37.284\nthe network adapter for\nwhatever reason gets overwhelmed,\n\n555\n00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:39.555\nit sends me a squelch message and\nsays hold on.\n\n556\n00:30:39.555 --> 00:30:44.059\nSlow down, you don't slow down I am going\nto start dropping packets cuze I can't\n\n557\n00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.527\nprocess them fast enoug.\n\n558\n00:30:45.527 --> 00:30:46.851\nSo it does flow control,\n\n559\n00:30:46.851 --> 00:30:50.079\nsome of the utilities that you\nuse actually use ICMP as well.\n\n560\n00:30:50.079 --> 00:30:54.720\nPING, Packet Pnternet Grouper that we use\nto test communications between two end\n\n561\n00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.770\npoints, it uses ICMP to send\nthose PING packets, trace RT.\n\n562\n00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:02.575\nWe determine the path a packet takes\nfrom source to destination, guess what?\n\n563\n00:31:02.575 --> 00:31:04.210\nIt also uses ICMP.\n\n564\n00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.935\nSo we've got protocols out there that\ndon't necessarily transmit data or\n\n565\n00:31:08.935 --> 00:31:13.735\nuse the transport information, as they\nare used to do things like manage and\n\n566\n00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:16.142\ndiagnose issues within the network.\n\n567\n00:31:16.142 --> 00:31:18.160\nLast but not least is IP.\n\n568\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.492\nWe've got a whole entire section that\nwe're gonna go into the Internet Protocol\n\n569\n00:31:21.492 --> 00:31:23.415\nand how we obtain, and\nwhat IP addresses are.\n\n570\n00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:29.200\nJust know for now that IP, it's\nresponsible for your addressing, right?\n\n571\n00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.953\nSource and destination,\nwhere do I send that traffic to,\n\n572\n00:31:31.953 --> 00:31:33.479\nwhere did it come from, right?\n\n573\n00:31:33.479 --> 00:31:36.860\nWe've got an identifier just like\nyou have in any kind of mail system.\n\n574\n00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.010\nWe have a source and destination address.\n\n575\n00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.212\nIP is your source and destination,\nan electronic packet,\n\n576\n00:31:42.212 --> 00:31:45.430\nthe electronic envelope if you will.\n\n577\n00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.755\nIt is a connectionless protocol.\n\n578\n00:31:48.755 --> 00:31:52.760\nIt has no clue how to get\nthe information where you need.\n\n579\n00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.182\nIt just says, I stamped it with\nan address.now we gotta worry about,\n\n580\n00:31:56.182 --> 00:31:57.980\nthe network has to worry about that.\n\n581\n00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.594\nThat's the last one of these protocol\ntypes that we want you to be aware of.\n\n582\n00:32:01.594 --> 00:32:03.880\nKeep in mind,\nsome of it's just memorization.\n\n583\n00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.297\nI do understand that,\nsome of it's theory, some of it's, hey,\n\n584\n00:32:06.297 --> 00:32:08.210\nyou gotta understand what\nthe protocols are doing.\n\n585\n00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.568\nSometimes it's just a matter of writing\nthings down and just memorizing and\n\n586\n00:32:11.568 --> 00:32:13.350\ncommitting it to memory.\n\n587\n00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.638\nDon't let it worry you.\n\n588\n00:32:14.638 --> 00:32:17.500\nIf you keep practicing,\nyou're gonna get these protocols down.\n\n589\n00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.347\nAnd before you know it,\nit'll be a thing of the past.\n\n590\n00:32:19.347 --> 00:32:22.350\n&gt;&gt; And if you keep watching\nthe videos that Wes is creating here,\n\n591\n00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.520\nI'm sure you won't have any trouble.\n\n592\n00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.993\nPorts and Protocols, Part 2.\n\n593\n00:32:25.993 --> 00:32:27.910\nThere was a part 1, watch them both.\n\n594\n00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.302\nWatch everything in the comp series.\n\n595\n00:32:30.302 --> 00:32:34.096\nAnd, the course library, check out\nthe hundreds of videos that are there, and\n\n596\n00:32:34.096 --> 00:32:37.630\nthey're all created for one purpose,\nto help you go further.\n\n597\n00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.329\nAnd thank you for watching IT PRO

00:00:22.819\nAs we continue on with CompTIA Net+ and\nfor this episode, it's OSI model.\n\n10\n00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.639\nAnd we've asked our IT expert and\nall around great guy,\n\n11\n00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:26.910\nWes Bryan to help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.900\nWes, good to see you here.\n\n13\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.500\nThat's right,\nwe're gonna throw acronyms at you, and\n\n15\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.622\nwe're gonna put them right there in\nthe title to confuse you, right?\n\n16\n00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:39.178\nWe're gonna talk about something that\nwas actually started back in 1984 and\n\n17\n00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:40.188\nis still around.\n\n18\n00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:44.615\nWe're gonna dive into a little bit of\nthe theory in this episode and we're gonna\n\n19\n00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:49.610\nbe talking about a structured set of rules\nfor communication known as the OSI model.\n\n20\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.200\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, right off the bat, I just\nwould like to ask, what is the OSI model?\n\n21\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach, that's kind of interesting.\n\n22\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.240\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nthrow you a curve ball on this one and\n\n23\n00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.870\ntell you that the OSI was made by the ISO,\nright?\n\n24\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.930\nBoy, if that's not confusing, I tell you.\n\n25\n00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.490\nActually, if we take a trip back in time,\nright, and\n\n26\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.400\nin the early days of networking everybody,\nall these different vendors,\n\n27\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.540\nthey were coming up basically\nwith their own rules, right.\n\n28\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.720\nThey were making it up as you go.\n\n29\n00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.880\nNot really, they were brilliant,\nI'll let you know, brilliant engineers but\n\n30\n00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.300\nif you were with one vendor,\nyou had to stay with that vendor.\n\n31\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.990\nYou would get vendor locked and again they\nwere really wasn't a set of standards.\n\n32\n00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.900\nSo the international organization of\nstandardization, I know it sounds like\n\n33\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.305\nthey can't even standardize their name\nright, ISO and the OSI there, right.\n\n34\n00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:35.500\nBut International Organization\nof Standardization.\n\n35\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.920\nThe ISO actually stands for,\n\n36\n00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.400\nit's a shortened form of a Greek word\ncalled, isos, which means equal.\n\n37\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.330\nBut they said, let's go ahead and\nwe'll come up with a way,\n\n38\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.030\na structured set of means, or\na structured set of rules, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.010\nan architecture that will standardize\nthe way we do network communications.\n\n40\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.070\nSo they came up with a seven-layer\nabstract model, they're abstract layers if\n\n41\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.680\nyou will, a seven layer model\nthat would really do that.\n\n42\n00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.460\nIt would standardize the way we\ncommunicate between end systems, or\n\n43\n00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.460\nend points within networks.\n\n44\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.440\nAnd it also allows,\n\n45\n00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.530\nwell, just like anything that we do\nwhen we do standardization, right.\n\n46\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.030\nWe do standardization why?\n\n47\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.680\nBecause it allows interoperability,\nand actually you as the customer,\n\n48\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.900\nmyself as the customer typically,\nwe benefit from that, right?\n\n49\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.730\nBecause, if we know that\nsomebody's following a standard,\n\n50\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.550\nthen really the only thing I have to make\na choice from is which vendor is making\n\n51\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.530\na better product, right?\n\n52\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.820\nWe know that they're gonna be\nfollowing the same set of rules,\n\n53\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.420\nthe same set of architecture.\n\n54\n00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.530\nWe just gotta figure out who\nwe like better as a vendor.\n\n55\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.460\nSo as customers,\nwe really win out on that.\n\n56\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.270\nAnd then the interoperable nature of this\nmeans that you can have these dissimilar\n\n57\n00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.160\nsystems that can communicate again,\nas long as they're following that model.\n\n58\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.810\nSo, the OSI model is actually\na seven layered system and again,\n\n59\n00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.750\nabstract layers that again, standardize\nhow we communicate between source and\n\n60\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.520\ndestination across a computing network.\n\n61\n00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.360\nNow, we have to know a little bit\nabout those seven layers for our exam.\n\n62\n00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.910\nWe gotta know, by each layer,\nwhat the layer is doing.\n\n63\n00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.380\nSome of the protocols that you can\npotentially see on those layers,\n\n64\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.075\nas well as things like\nwhat are the devices?\n\n65\n00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.580\nCuz we do have devices that\nwork at these different layers.\n\n66\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.310\nNow, I keep talking about these layers.\n\n67\n00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.910\nLet's go into the layers\na little bit more there.\n\n68\n00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.730\nTalk about layers.\n\n69\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.000\nWhat we're talking about is\na seven layered model, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.990\nIn these seven layers each layer\nassists another layer, right?\n\n71\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.110\nAnd depending on if you're sending or\n\n72\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.370\nreceiving the communication it'll dictate\nwhich end of these layers you're on.\n\n73\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.540\nSo really, when we look at the top layer,\nthe top layer is layer seven, right?\n\n74\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.930\nAnd you might say, wait a second Wes,\n\n75\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.320\ndoesn't the numerical\nsystem start with one?\n\n76\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.380\nWhy are you starting with seven?\n\n77\n00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.730\nWell, if I'm sending information I\nactually start at layer seven and\n\n78\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.480\nI work my way down to layer one.\n\n79\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.530\nNow, if you're receiving information,\nso in this case,\n\n80\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.290\nlet's say that I'm sending\ninformation to Zach here.\n\n81\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.920\nWhen he receives that information, what\nhe's doing, his network adapter really,\n\n82\n00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.790\nand the cable of the wireless\nradiated energy if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.640\nIt's receiving the raw bits, right?\n\n84\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.210\nThe electrical impulses,\nthe binary ones and zeros, so\n\n85\n00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.340\nhe actually starts at layer one, right?\n\n86\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.430\nThe bottom most layer, and\n\n87\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.030\nhe works his way up until we get to layer\nseven, where the last thing that's left is\n\n88\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.280\nthe data that we intended to send\ninformation between two systems.\n\n89\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.340\nSo that's a little bit about\nwhat the OSI model is.\n\n90\n00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.930\nLet's talk a little bit more about\neach one of this individual layers.\n\n91\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.830\nSo I've got a little diagram here and\n\n92\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.670\nit could help us out to\nunderstand these layers.\n\n93\n00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.640\nNotice that we have application.\n\n94\n00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.650\nAll right, that's Layer 7 and\nyou could see both side of this, right?\n\n95\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.390\nI went ahead so you know what layer it is.\n\n96\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.310\nAnd it is important because on the exam,\n\n97\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.103\nwhen we are talking about the application\nlayer, they might tell you Layer 7.\n\n98\n00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:47.715\nAnd it's up to you as a Net+ candidate to\nknow that layer seven is the application\n\n99\n00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:52.433\nlayer all right or that the presentation\nlayer is Layer 6, right.\n\n100\n00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:56.213\nSo I've got both of these here, right so\nthen also if you are happily to be talking\n\n101\n00:04:56.213 --> 00:05:00.104\nto somebody about it, you know that Layer\n4 right that could be the transport layer\n\n102\n00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:02.240\nright and\nyou just have to understand these.\n\n103\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.640\nSo I'm gonna kinda use\nthem interchangeably.\n\n104\n00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.900\nYou have them here, you see them here,\n\n105\n00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.390\nyou can always pause the video and I would\nmemorize this information cuz there's\n\n106\n00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.330\nno telling what questions they might\nask you when it comes to the exam.\n\n107\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.900\nAll right, an OSI model is\nsomething that I have been known to\n\n108\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.640\nhear about questions that have\ncome up quite frequently, so\n\n109\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.830\nit's a good thing to get\nthis under your belt.\n\n110\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.160\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nwe're gonna start at the top layer there.\n\n111\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.590\nAnd what I mean by the top layer,\nI'm gonna say Layer 7,\n\n112\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.000\nright, because when we send information,\nthis is where we start.\n\n113\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.400\nWe start with the application layer.\n\n114\n00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.930\nAnd the application layer\nis really responsible for\n\n115\n00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.870\ngiving us access to the network, right.\n\n116\n00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.590\nYour user applications at that\napplication layer are responsible for\n\n117\n00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.710\ngiving you access to network resources,\nall right.\n\n118\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.880\nSo that's the very first layer.\n\n119\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.590\nSome of the examples of the protocols\nthat you would see here.\n\n120\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.210\nThings like file transfer protocol.\n\n121\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.080\nSMB is one.\n\n122\n00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.530\nAnd I don't have all of\nthem in the list here.\n\n123\n00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.570\nThere are tons of them.\n\n124\n00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.060\nSo, it is up to you.\n\n125\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.280\nRemember that we're just\ngiving you some examples here.\n\n126\n00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.130\nI would definitely study these\nprotocols that we've talked about so\n\n127\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.750\nthat you know where they set\nin the OSI model, right?\n\n128\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.480\nSo we have FTP, right?\n\n129\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.510\nSMB.\nWe have POP3, right?\n\n130\n00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.420\nSMTP, you'll notice these right away,\nright?\n\n131\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.740\nIMAP, these are email servers.\n\n132\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.570\nAll right, so an email application\nis a type of application.\n\n133\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.580\nAnd any kind of network-aware application\nwhere you're sending communications,\n\n134\n00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.730\nright, that's your entry point into\nthe networking side of things, right?\n\n135\n00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.210\nHTTP, DNS, these are all examples\nof application layer protocols.\n\n136\n00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.680\nBut then we move down,\n\n137\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.590\nnow that we've got access to the network,\nwhere do we go from there?\n\n138\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.590\nWell now I want,\nI've got this data, right?\n\n139\n00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.640\nAnd the application layers given my data\naccess to the network, but the problem is,\n\n140\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.560\nit's not in a format that\nthe network can really move, right?\n\n141\n00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.220\nWe wanna make sure that our data that\nwe're gonna send across this network\n\n142\n00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.750\nis in a format that's\ntransparent to the network.\n\n143\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.260\nI want you to think about it another way.\n\n144\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.970\nThink about it this way.\n\n145\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.690\nIf I have a handwritten letter and I need\nto send it across the snail mail system,\n\n146\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.310\nhere in the states the USPS,\nthe postal system.\n\n147\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.790\nI can't just take that letter and\nthrow it in the mail.\n\n148\n00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.990\nNow you might say, well, yes, you can.\n\n149\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.530\nNo, no, no.\n\n150\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.690\nTechnically, I can't, right?\n\n151\n00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.830\nI can't get done writing that letter,\nfold that letter up, just like that, and\n\n152\n00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.540\nthrow it in the mail, right?\n\n153\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.380\nWhy?\n\n154\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.060\nBecause it's not in\na format that the carrier\n\n155\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.910\nunderstands how to get it from where\nit was to where it's supposed to be.\n\n156\n00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.180\nSo we need a way that we format it,\nso that starting point,\n\n157\n00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.070\nthe carrier can use it,\ncan transport across the network, right?\n\n158\n00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.210\nSo the presentation layer's\nall about formatting.\n\n159\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.500\nIt's like taking the envelope,\nopening it and\n\n160\n00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.030\nputting your letter in the envelope,\nright?\n\n161\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.930\nThat's just the start.\n\n162\n00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.240\nBut at least the envelope or a box or\nwhatever you might be shipping, right?\n\n163\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.451\nIf you're shipping like a,\nI don't know, candy to somebody,\n\n164\n00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:46.706\nyou might put it in a box.\n\n165\n00:07:46.706 --> 00:07:51.620\nBut you need a container that we can now\nput it across the carrier's mail system.\n\n166\n00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.517\nWell it's the same thing with\nyour network communications.\n\n167\n00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.563\nI have a letter,\nI need to put it in a format.\n\n168\n00:07:56.563 --> 00:08:00.937\nI need to start a way putting it in\na format that the network can understand,\n\n169\n00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:01.640\nall right?\n\n170\n00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.005\nAnd that's where the presentation\nlater starts, right?\n\n171\n00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:06.643\nSometimes it's called the syntax layer,\ncuz again,\n\n172\n00:08:06.643 --> 00:08:08.960\nit's about the syntax to the network,\nright?\n\n173\n00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.700\nWe don't want the network to have to worry\nabout the formatting process, right?\n\n174\n00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.399\nSo this is the first part.\n\n175\n00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.714\nThis is where things like data\nencryption happen, right?\n\n176\n00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:18.744\nThis is where things\nlike compression happen.\n\n177\n00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:24.612\nIf you are familiar with JPEG, TIFF,\nGIF, all these formats, right?\n\n178\n00:08:24.612 --> 00:08:26.503\nThese formats sit right here.\n\n179\n00:08:26.503 --> 00:08:31.100\nAnd again, I want you to remember things\nlike data encryption and compression.\n\n180\n00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.830\nSo that’s the presentation layer, right?\n\n181\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.740\nNow that I've got this envelope, right?\n\n182\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.435\nNow I got to start making some\ndecisions on, how I'm gonna send it?\n\n183\n00:08:41.435 --> 00:08:43.153\nHow I'm gonna set up the communication?\n\n184\n00:08:43.153 --> 00:08:46.020\nAnd that's where the next layer comes in.\n\n185\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.890\nThe next layer you'll see\nthat we have right here,\n\n186\n00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.870\nis what is known as the session layer.\n\n187\n00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.660\nNow the session layer, you'll see some of\nthe things that I've written down here,\n\n188\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.830\nbut I know you guys can read those,\nthese three things here.\n\n189\n00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.910\nI want you to make it easy on yourselves.\n\n190\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.660\nYou can always pause the video, and\nyou can look and write these down.\n\n191\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.430\nBut think about it this way,\nthe session layer is responsible for\n\n192\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.490\nnegotiating the parameters,\nend to end of the communication.\n\n193\n00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.630\nBringing that session online, so\nwe can send that information, maintaining\n\n194\n00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.870\nthe session, and then tearing the session\ndown once we no longer need it, right?\n\n195\n00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.490\nSo that's what the session layer does.\n\n196\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.390\nIt's part of the communication\nestablishment.\n\n197\n00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.930\nDefining those, in this case,\ncommunication parameters.\n\n198\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.290\nDefining the parameters\nof the communication,\n\n199\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.760\nmaintaining the communication.\n\n200\n00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.180\nAnd again,\none thing that I didn't put up here is\n\n201\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.500\nactually tearing the communication down,\nonce we no longer need it right?\n\n202\n00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.190\nSo it's responsible for\nsession establishment.\n\n203\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.047\nAll right, now that we've got\nthrough the first three layers,\n\n204\n00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:44.130\nhere is where it's interesting.\n\n205\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.630\nWhen we get to the first three layers,\nour data is in a format\n\n206\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.990\nthat is transparent to the network\nfrom now on, all right?\n\n207\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.260\nNow we've got a package\nthat is ready to go.\n\n208\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.060\nNow we've got to determine what\n\n209\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.510\nkind of delivery do we want across\nthat communication session?\n\n210\n00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:10.940\nAnd in another episode, Zach and I talked\nabout connection oriented sessions\n\n211\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.430\nusing reliable communication methods,\nreliable protocols.\n\n212\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.070\nWe also said that, hey, sometimes\nyou don't need all that overhead.\n\n213\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.689\nI just need a, you throw it in that\nblue mailbox and walk away from it.\n\n214\n00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:24.760\nAnd I know that postal carrier\ncan get it where they need to.\n\n215\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.510\nAgain, sometimes though you\nneed delivery confirmation.\n\n216\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.750\nAnd the transport layer is where we\nchoose the protocols that are gonna\n\n217\n00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.230\nbe responsible for actually moving\nour information, all right?\n\n218\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.650\nTwo come into play.\n\n219\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.500\nSo if we take a look here,\nwe can see that at the transport layer,\n\n220\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.860\nright, it moves the data\nalong the network.\n\n221\n00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.230\nAnd we've got a couple choices, all right?\n\n222\n00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.470\nWe've got transmission control protocol.\n\n223\n00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.680\nWe've also got UDP as well,\nUser Datagram Protocol.\n\n224\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.260\nNow I wanna take a second, I want you to\nunderstand too that sometimes it's not so\n\n225\n00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.765\nclearly defined which layer of\nthe OSI model certain things sit on.\n\n226\n00:10:57.765 --> 00:11:00.970\nYou're gonna notice that some will sit\nacross a couple of the layers too,\n\n227\n00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.160\njust based on what they're doing, right?\n\n228\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.581\nSo if it's UDP, transport layer, why?\n\n229\n00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.233\nBecause I don't need any\nconnection establishment.\n\n230\n00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:12.924\nBut a connection establishment with TCP,\nimagine where that also starts.\n\n231\n00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:14.435\nIt starts with the session layer, right?\n\n232\n00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:18.585\nIf you're doing communication\nestablishment, defining the parameters,\n\n233\n00:11:18.585 --> 00:11:21.465\nmaintaining the communication, and\nthen tearing it down, guess what?\n\n234\n00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.095\nTransmission protocol\nis a reliable protocol.\n\n235\n00:11:24.095 --> 00:11:27.955\nIt is a connection oriented protocol\nin which the session has to be\n\n236\n00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:29.215\nconnected first.\n\n237\n00:11:29.215 --> 00:11:33.015\nSo it has functionalities that are also on\nthe session layer, but when we talk about\n\n238\n00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:38.120\nit as a transport protocol,\nthat's happening there at layer four.\n\n239\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.000\nNow remember that the transmission\ncontrol protocol at this point,\n\n240\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.580\nwhat we have is we have that\ndata formatted in a way, but\n\n241\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.840\nwe might not be able to reliably\nmove it across the network.\n\n242\n00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.160\nSo what is transmission\ncontrol protocol do?\n\n243\n00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.650\nNot only does it maintain that connection,\nit will take your data and\n\n244\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.870\nit will segment it.\n\n245\n00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.240\nIt will take it and break it down\ninto more manageable pieces, and\n\n246\n00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.680\nthen it will sequence it like we've\ntalked about in other episodes, right?\n\n247\n00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.170\nAnd then as we send that\ninformation over to the end point,\n\n248\n00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.210\nit's gonna maintain that communication.\n\n249\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.700\nIt's like your delivery confirmation\non that little snail mail that we're\n\n250\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.840\nsending right now.\n\n251\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.500\nNow I gotta talk to the post office,\nand I have to say, you know what?\n\n252\n00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.610\nI want you to transport this\nacross your network and\n\n253\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.810\nI wanna know when it gets there.\n\n254\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.210\nI wanna make sure it gets there, and\nI want you to let me know that it's there.\n\n255\n00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.040\nI want an acknowledgement\nthat comes back that says,\n\n256\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.810\nhey, Zach got that\npackage that I sent him.\n\n257\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.780\nThat's what transmission control\nprotocol is doing, okay?\n\n258\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.715\nUDP, it's connectionless.\n\n259\n00:12:30.715 --> 00:12:33.500\nIt's best effort in delivery is\nwhat really what they call best\n\n260\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.640\neffort delivery.\n\n261\n00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.850\nNow at this point,\nI'm not looking at the post office saying,\n\n262\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.210\nI need delivery confirmation.\n\n263\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.900\nI'm walking over to the blue mailbox,\nI'm throwing the letter in the mailbox.\n\n264\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.320\nAnd I'm walking away, and\nI hope it gets there.\n\n265\n00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.010\nThe difference between the two is\none is a little bit more complex,\n\n266\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.680\nbecause of all the extra stuff that\ntransmission control protocol has to do.\n\n267\n00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.270\nUDP, it's not so complex, it doesn't\ntake as much computational power.\n\n268\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.300\nSo if you need things like streaming\nvideo, you need fast delivery,\n\n269\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.329\nUDP is where it goes, where you know\ngive you another example like for\n\n270\n00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:02.802\ninstance when we do DNS.\n\n271\n00:13:02.802 --> 00:13:06.882\nRemember, we said DNS gives you access\nto the network, when we need do\n\n272\n00:13:06.882 --> 00:13:11.239\na DNS resolution request, you don't\ncare where you get your answer from,\n\n273\n00:13:11.239 --> 00:13:15.280\nyou don't even need to maintain\na communication, right?\n\n274\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.905\nI just need to send it to\nthe DNS server and say, hey,\n\n275\n00:13:17.905 --> 00:13:20.551\ntell me where www.google.com is,\nI have no clue.\n\n276\n00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.180\nI don't care where my answer comes from.\n\n277\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.530\nI just need my answer, so\nit doesn't have to be that complex.\n\n278\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.100\nWe can attach it to UDP port 53,\nand send it to the DNS server.\n\n279\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.660\nHowever, when you have two DNS\nservers that are communicating and\n\n280\n00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.480\nthey're transferring zone information, you\ndon't want that database being corrupted.\n\n281\n00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.810\nSo DNS again, application layer\ngives us access to the network.\n\n282\n00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.810\nBut this time,\nwhen we get down to that transport layer,\n\n283\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:46.720\nactually it's gonna start at session\nlayer, we're gonna do a TCP transport.\n\n284\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.350\nWhich means the two DNS servers are gonna\nstart that three way handshake,\n\n285\n00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.320\nand they're gonna maintain that connection\nto ensure that it gets there and\n\n286\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.820\nthe zone transfer happens without\ncorruption, all over port 53 again.\n\n287\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.780\nSo again, there are the transport layer\nwhat we are saying is that it's really\n\n288\n00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.130\nabout the top of communications dealing,\nall right?\n\n289\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.232\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n290\n00:14:05.232 --> 00:14:08.450\nAll right,\nhere we did even more fun stuff.\n\n291\n00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.405\nThese is where a lot of\nthe action happens, [LAUGH] and\n\n292\n00:14:10.405 --> 00:14:11.615\nthese is the networking layer.\n\n293\n00:14:11.615 --> 00:14:15.004\nAnd if we can take a look at\nthe networking layer is responsible for\n\n294\n00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:16.610\nforwarding your packets.\n\n295\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.160\nIt's responsible if you will, for routing.\n\n296\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.976\nIt's responsible for\naddressing as well, right?\n\n297\n00:14:22.976 --> 00:14:25.930\nWhen we talk about IP addresses and\nwe talk about that in other episodes,\n\n298\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.020\nwell guess what?\n\n299\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.920\nIP addresses get attached\nat the network layer.\n\n300\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.480\nNow I've got this envelope, but\nI can't do anything with it, right?\n\n301\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.330\nI don't know where it's going,\nso what do we do?\n\n302\n00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.660\nWe put a mailing address, right?\n\n303\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.330\nAnd we put a return address.\n\n304\n00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.575\nNow I know where it came from and\nwhere it's going to, well IP says that,\n\n305\n00:14:44.575 --> 00:14:47.734\nlet's go ahead and take that data\npacket and we'll add a header on it.\n\n306\n00:14:47.734 --> 00:14:51.180\nAnd it's gonna have the source IP\naddress and the destination IP address.\n\n307\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.410\nWe can hand it to the router, and the\nrouter's gonna use routing protocols to\n\n308\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.190\nmake sure that it hops through the\nnetworks and gets to the right location.\n\n309\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.300\nGreat stuff, right?\n\n310\n00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.720\nSo we have some examples of some\nprotocols that you see here, and\n\n311\n00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.390\nthese are just a few, all right?\n\n312\n00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.400\nSo for instance you have IP, ICM,\nthe internet control message protocol.\n\n313\n00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.690\nHey, slow down there, you're sending\ntoo much information, too fast, right?\n\n314\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.610\nFlow control,\ncontrol message protocol, right?\n\n315\n00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:19.211\nAnd many other things\nlike diagnostics too.\n\n316\n00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:20.580\nThings like OSPF, right?\n\n317\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.560\nThe open shortest path first,\nthat's our distance vector protocol.\n\n318\n00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.120\nI'm sorry, open short this past birth,\nlink state routing protocol.\n\n319\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.990\nRip version two, the next one, I'm\nlooking at rip, rip version two, right?\n\n320\n00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:36.300\nThat's our distance vector protocol,\nright?\n\n321\n00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.310\nBGP, Border Gateway Protocol.\n\n322\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.380\nIt's what we use to basically send\ninformation between autonomous systems\n\n323\n00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.220\nacross the network.\n\n324\n00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.500\nIt's path vector protocol.\n\n325\n00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.398\nBut there are other ones there too that\nI haven't mentioned, RIP version one\n\n326\n00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:54.390\nis there, EIGRP could be here as well,\nCisco proprietary routing protocol.\n\n327\n00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.980\nWhat else do you have IS-IS,\nintermediate system, intermediate system.\n\n328\n00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.183\nSo there are more.\n\n329\n00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:01.577\nWe don't want to leave you hanging and\nthink this is all of them.\n\n330\n00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:03.620\nThis is just some of the more\ncommon ones you might see.\n\n331\n00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.760\nNow, here's one that\ngets a little confusing.\n\n332\n00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.690\nIf it hasn't been confusing\nwith theory already,\n\n333\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.600\nhere's where it gets really confusing,\nright?\n\n334\n00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:18.070\nThe Data-Link layer, layer two or\nmaybe we should say layer 2.1 and 2.2.\n\n335\n00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.425\nWhy is that?\n\n336\n00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:24.231\n[LAUGH] Well, the Data-Link layer,\nthere came a point when they said,\n\n337\n00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:25.305\nyou know what?\n\n338\n00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:28.220\nThere's a little bit more happening\n\n339\n00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.030\nhere at these layers than\njust a signal layer, right?\n\n340\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:36.236\nSo what they did is they came out with,\nI believe it has an 802 standard, 802.2,\n\n341\n00:16:36.236 --> 00:16:38.010\nthat's the logical link control layer.\n\n342\n00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.070\nSo, they divided it into two sub layers\nbecause they figured after a certain\n\n343\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.610\npoint that one layer didn't correctly\ndefine what that layer was doing and\n\n344\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.640\nit would almost be two sub layers.\n\n345\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.360\nAnd that's technically what it is.\n\n346\n00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.750\nSo, LLC, don't let it confuse you.\n\n347\n00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.000\nThat's the logical link control.\n\n348\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.660\nWhen you look at logical link control,\nunderstand that this provides addressing.\n\n349\n00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.680\nAll right, error and flow control.\n\n350\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.970\nBut this addressing is\na little bit different, right?\n\n351\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.110\nNow we're not talking about network\nlayer addresses, those are IP addresses.\n\n352\n00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.140\nNow what we're talking about\nare what are known as MAC addresses.\n\n353\n00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.110\nMedia Access Control addresses.\n\n354\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:12.105\nNow be careful,\n\n355\n00:17:12.105 --> 00:17:16.350\nbecause the Media Access Control layer\ntechnically is not a MAC address.\n\n356\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.360\nAll right?\nWhat it's responsible for,\n\n357\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.550\nis actually controlling how the media,\nthe physical media,\n\n358\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.440\nwhich we'll get to that layer in a second,\nis accessed.\n\n359\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.590\nThat's what it's responsible for, right?\n\n360\n00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.100\nIt determines who's allowed\nto access the media.\n\n361\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.780\nWe're gonna talk about other\ntechnology standards, right?\n\n362\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.850\nWe're gonna talk about something known as\ncarrier-sense multiple access collision\n\n363\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.670\ndetection, right?\n\n364\n00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.480\nCSMACD, right?\n\n365\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.020\nThis is how Ethernet would detect,\nhey, is the media present?\n\n366\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.100\nRight, remember where how are we gonna\nplace the information on the media going\n\n367\n00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.480\ndown to that physical layer.\n\n368\n00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.750\nIs the media there?\n\n369\n00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.760\nOkay, I can sense the media is there,\nall right?\n\n370\n00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.950\nI'm gonna send my information and\nthen I'm gonna listen again.\n\n371\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.170\nI'm listening.\n\n372\n00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.350\nI didn't detect a collision,\nso that must've got there.\n\n373\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.200\nLet me send another frame of information.\n\n374\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.000\nAll right.\n\n375\n00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.920\nSo, it controls things like your\ncarrier-sense multiple access\n\n376\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.720\ncollision detection.\n\n377\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.310\nIt also does things like\ndetermining frame synchronization.\n\n378\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.410\nAnd that's also something to be important.\n\n379\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:23.390\nBasically, it determines where a frame\nends and where the next frame begins.\n\n380\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.000\nNow, that leads us into\nthe physical layer.\n\n381\n00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Actually you know, let's make mention,\ncuz you know up here on my slide, I don't\n\n382\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.320\nreally have anything for the Data-Link\nlayer, but let me go ahead and give you\n\n383\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.420\nan example, another example where you have\ntechnologies that operate on both layers.\n\n384\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.240\nAnd the reason I say that,\nnotice frame relay and\n\n385\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.870\ndown there at the physical layer.\n\n386\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.910\nIt actually operates at both layers,\nright because frame relay defines not only\n\n387\n00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.970\nthings like how addressing is happening\nand how frames are sent across a switch.\n\n388\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.410\nIt also defines the physical\ncharacteristics of the media\n\n389\n00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.700\nthat connects to it.\n\n390\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.140\nIt's operating at both.\n\n391\n00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.030\nEthernet.\n\n392\n00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.310\nEthernet is another one, right.\n\n393\n00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.860\nEthernet we use MAC addresses.\n\n394\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.485\nWell guess what?\n\n395\n00:19:02.485 --> 00:19:06.750\nData-Link layer, MAC addresses, but\nEthernet also, in things like our 10-based\n\n396\n00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.460\nstandards and our CAT cables, defines\nthe physical transmission media as well.\n\n397\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.790\nSo it's one of those things that\nyou can see again at both layers.\n\n398\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.680\nYour network interface controllers, NIC.\n\n399\n00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.760\nYour network adapters They\noperate at both layers.\n\n400\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.260\nAnd there's I know sometimes there's\ncontention in forums and stuff like that.\n\n401\n00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.410\nBut if you look at it, I mean physically\nyou've got a cable that connects to\n\n402\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.460\na network adapter, so\nthat's on the physical level.\n\n403\n00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.330\nInside of that network adapter\nis burned in MAC address.\n\n404\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.990\nSo technically that's\nat the Data-Link layer.\n\n405\n00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.340\nSo it's operating at both.\n\n406\n00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.340\nBut those are some examples.\n\n407\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.350\nSwitches, and we'll come back to that here\nin a second and revisit that because we'll\n\n408\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.450\ntalk about some of the devices\nthat work on these other layers.\n\n409\n00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:42.980\nCuz that's also gonna\nbe important as well.\n\n410\n00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.260\nBut Zach is giving me that evil eye and\n\n411\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.265\nhe's telling me I think we might\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n412\n00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:50.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Looks like it might happen.\n\n413\n00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.850\nOSi model part two coming your way.\n\n414\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.870\nEnjoyed part one.\n\n415\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.020\nWes, once again, fabulous job.\n\n416\n00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.630\nAnd make sure you watch everything\nin the Comp T and Net Plus series.\n\n417\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.620\nWhile you're at it, check out the rest\nof the videos on our course

tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n421\n00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.170\nThey'll be really glad you did.\n\n422\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:09.830\nThanks for watching.\n\n423\n00:20:09.830 -->

00:00:12.007\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.027\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:15.830\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.730\nI'm your host Zach Memnis as we continue\non with Comp net plus OSI model part two,\n\n7\n00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.400\nWes said, we'd come back with part two.\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.360\nAnd here we are and here's Wes.\n\n9\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.000\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n10\n00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.870\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you sir.\n\n11\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.060\n&gt;&gt; And let's roll it, the endings.\n\n12\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.660\nNo, just kidding.\n\n13\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.720\nGosh, we wouldn't do that do you.\n\n14\n00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.480\nThat's right.\n\n15\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.030\nMore of that OSI model.\n\n16\n00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.060\nRemember in the first part,\n\n17\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.010\nwe talked pretty extensively about\nthe first few of the layers, right?\n\n18\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.630\nI left you with not telling you\nwhat the layer one was about.\n\n19\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.150\nBut remember that the OSI model,\nthe Open Systems Interconnection model,\n\n20\n00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.780\nit goes back to 1984 if you will\n\n21\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.940\nby the International Organization\nof Standardization.\n\n22\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.010\nAgain, remember that it's\nan abstract seven layer system.\n\n23\n00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.830\nThat defines or\n\n24\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.760\nstandardizes the way we communicate across\nopen systems across computer networks.\n\n25\n00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.980\nAnd we, in the last episode we\ntalked about the application layer,\n\n26\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.220\nwe talked about the presentation session,\ntransport,\n\n27\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.380\nnetworking and the data link layer which\nis comprised of the LOC and the M.\n\n28\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.660\nAC or the Mac layer, but\nwe left you with a cliffhanger.\n\n29\n00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.630\nJust like Zach said,\nthat’s why we’re back here.\n\n30\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.030\nWe left you not talking\nabout physical layer.\n\n31\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.860\nSo, if we could go ahead and\nlook at our document here that we have.\n\n32\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.400\nYeah Zach?\n\n33\n00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.610\nWell I'm just gonna say so the physical\nlayer, this is the receiver, right?\n\n34\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310\n&gt;&gt; You could see it this way.\n\n35\n00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm making it very simplistic.\n\n36\n00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.370\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n37\n00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.970\n&gt;&gt; But you are the receiver if you're\ngetting the physical layer here.\n\n38\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.435\n&gt;&gt; At this point what we're talking\nabout is there's no more addressing.\n\n39\n00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:38.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; What we have is we have the data link\n\n40\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.430\nlayer, the frame, essentially is placed\non the media in its raw bit form.\n\n41\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.440\nNow we're talking about the hardware,\nright?\n\n42\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.390\nThe electrical,\n\n43\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.190\nthe mechanical characteristics that are\ndefined at this layer, and it is important\n\n44\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.140\nto understand that this is where we\ntalk about If we're using ethernet.\n\n45\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.880\nAre we using fiber optic media?\n\n46\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.940\nIf we're using fiber optic media\nare we using the 10 megabit?\n\n47\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.060\nAre we using the 100 megabit?\n\n48\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.470\nAre we using a gigabit?\n\n49\n00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.220\nAre we using ten gigabit networks?\n\n50\n00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.390\nAnd usually with fiber optics today you\nwon't waste your time with the older,\n\n51\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.200\nslower standards.\n\n52\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.595\nIt'll be a gigabit and beyond.\n\n53\n00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:15.370\nTen gigabit standards right, but\nthat's all where we talk about those\n\n54\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.762\nbinary ones and zeros, that are actually\ngoing from source to destination.\n\n55\n00:02:19.762 --> 00:02:23.020\nAll right, so\nsome of the technologies that we see here.\n\n56\n00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.170\nEthernet is one of those, DSL, ISDN,\n\n57\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.900\nand let me step back and quit hitting\nyou guys with so many acronyms.\n\n58\n00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.970\nDigital subscriber line, DSL modems,\nthey operate here at this layer.\n\n59\n00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.033\nISDN, the integrated\nservices digital network.\n\n60\n00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:40.033\nSON, the synchronized optical networking,\nwhich is what it's called here according\n\n61\n00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.586\nto the American National\nStandards Institute, ANSI.\n\n62\n00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:45.497\nBut in the European nations,\nright, yeah, the ITU,\n\n63\n00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:48.096\nthe International Telecommunication Union\nand\n\n64\n00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:52.230\nwhat they call is the synchronous\ndigital hierarchy, so SONET SDH, right?\n\n65\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.370\nAgain, same technologies that just\nhow they're standardized here in\n\n66\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.880\nNorth America Versus\nthe European Nations and stuff.\n\n67\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.110\nFrame relay, ATM.\n\n68\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.230\nWe're not talking about\nautomated teller machine,\n\n69\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.310\nwe're talking about\nthe asynchronous transfer mode.\n\n70\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.530\nSo another networking communication as\nwell as all happens here at this layer.\n\n71\n00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.360\nWe talk about our base standard, right.\n\n72\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.854\nTen base T, Ten megabits baseband\ntechnology T being twisted pair.\n\n73\n00:03:18.854 --> 00:03:22.175\nNot baseband but\nthose base technologies, right?\n\n74\n00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:25.124\nThey're part of the physical layer as\nwell, so you do have to know that.\n\n75\n00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:25.688\nAll right,\n\n76\n00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:29.537\nnow it's important to understand these\nthings because you have to understand.\n\n77\n00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:34.557\nLet's go ahead and go into a little\nbit more about, well we'll say for\n\n78\n00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:38.630\ninstance, how are these\nLayers assisting each other.\n\n79\n00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.370\nWell, let's talk a little bit about\nsomething known as encapsulation.\n\n80\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.080\nNow my head's kinda covering this one\nup but we're gonna start up here and\n\n81\n00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.890\nwe're gonna start at Layer 7.\n\n82\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.580\nSo we're gonna say, hey.\n\n83\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.500\nWe're sending information.\n\n84\n00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.170\nWhen we send information what's going\non here is the application layer,\n\n85\n00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.810\nagain, it gives us access to the network,\nright?\n\n86\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.220\nAnd an encapsulation happens alright?\n\n87\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.040\nThose of you out there that maybe\nhave seen those Russian dolls.\n\n88\n00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.100\n&gt;&gt; Babushka.\n\n89\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.930\nThank you, thank you, very good Zach\n&gt;&gt; Those little Russian dolls right?\n\n90\n00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.690\nWe one little Russian doll in a bigger,\nin a bigger, in a bigger and\n\n91\n00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.930\nthen when you take them apart right?\n\n92\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.500\nYou set there and stack them side by side\n&gt;&gt; And they all look like my grandmother.\n\n93\n00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely,\nwell I don't know about that.\n\n94\n00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.490\nApparently, it looks like Zack's\ngrandmother, and its also,\n\n95\n00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.025\nan analogy for encapsulation.\n\n96\n00:04:24.025 --> 00:04:25.780\n[LAUGH] Because that's what's happening.\n\n97\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.870\nAll right, what you have is you\nhave something known as an SDU.\n\n98\n00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.970\nAn SDU is a service data unit and that\nmeans that the application layer, right?\n\n99\n00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.170\nOur SDU, or service data,\ndata units, service data units,\n\n100\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.620\nexcuse me, is basically going to be\nrelying on the layer below it, all right?\n\n101\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.350\nAnd when the layer below it\nservices the layer above it,\n\n102\n00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.080\nthat becomes what's known as\na protocol data unit, right?\n\n103\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.950\nSo keep that in mind but the application\nlayer, basically format your data in a way\n\n104\n00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.620\nthat it can, basically the application\ngives access to the network, right?\n\n105\n00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.780\nThen we take it to\nthe presentation layer and\n\n106\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.720\nthe presentation layer adds its header to\nit, basically encapsulating it as well.\n\n107\n00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.990\nAgain, little bit bigger of a dog, right?\n\n108\n00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.180\nNow it is assisting the application layer,\nright.\n\n109\n00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.450\nSo the applications layers SDU, all right,\n\n110\n00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.325\nnow becomes the presentations\nlayers Protocol Data Unit PDU.\n\n111\n00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:26.565\nBut now the presentation layer,\nwe can't stop there right?\n\n112\n00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:29.015\nWe got session establishment to happen.\n\n113\n00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:30.864\nSo now that it's got it's format.\n\n114\n00:05:30.864 --> 00:05:34.961\nWe've got one doll in another,\nit's gonna pass it's information needing\n\n115\n00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.277\nthe assistance of the old\nA layer below it.\n\n116\n00:05:37.277 --> 00:05:41.910\nSo now it turns into a service data\nunit and it hands its information\n\n117\n00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.309\nrequiring the services,\nI'm going to keep saying surfaces.\n\n118\n00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:49.453\nServices of the lower level\nnow in the session layer.\n\n119\n00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:52.003\nThe session layer treats that,\n\n120\n00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:57.343\nbasically that presentation\nlayer as its protocol data unit.\n\n121\n00:05:57.343 --> 00:06:00.503\nSo just understand that when an\napplication needs a service from a lower\n\n122\n00:06:00.503 --> 00:06:03.313\napplication, that's considered\na service data unit.\n\n123\n00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:07.183\nWhen that lower layer actually\nprovides that service,\n\n124\n00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:10.423\nthat becomes the protocol data unit,\nand then it hands that down and\n\n125\n00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:12.885\nthat process happens all the way\ndown to the physical layer.\n\n126\n00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:18.290\nAll right, and we go through this process\nof adding and adding and adding, right.\n\n127\n00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.040\nJust adding those,\nbasically those layers upon layers.\n\n128\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.910\nThe other way we could consider\nit is like an onion, right.\n\n129\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.502\nWell what do you do?\n\n130\n00:06:27.502 --> 00:06:29.600\nAll right,\nwell if I was to pass this information.\n\n131\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.390\nIf we could take a look at that\ninformation right there one more time.\n\n132\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.910\nNotice that the physical layer\ndown here at the bottom,\n\n133\n00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.190\nthose are your raw binary ones and zeros.\n\n134\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.070\nNow, I want you to think about this,\nif we don't think about the,\n\n135\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.650\nmaybe the Russian dolls,\nmaybe we'll think about an onion, right?\n\n136\n00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.290\nI'm passing Zach over an onion, now we're\nnot gonna make Zach cry here on camera,\n\n137\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.222\nwe wouldn't do that to him.\n\n138\n00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:50.520\nAll right, but\n\n139\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.260\nwhat he's gonna do, his computer is\ngonna peel off the first layer, right?\n\n140\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.620\nIn this case,\nit's gonna be the data link layer, right?\n\n141\n00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.640\nThe data link layer is responsible for\nsending traffic between two\n\n142\n00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.020\nphysically connected machines, all right,\nacross things like our switches.\n\n143\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.170\nSo he peels off that layer.\n\n144\n00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.960\nSays hey, is that my Mac address?\n\n145\n00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.060\nYes, it's my Mac address.\n\n146\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.420\nOkay, so let me go ahead and\nI'll process that a little bit more.\n\n147\n00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.960\nPeel that off.\n\n148\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.680\nIs this my IP address?\n\n149\n00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.050\nYeah, that's my IP address.\n\n150\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.010\nSo I'll process it a little bit more,\nand we keep, basically, peeling\n\n151\n00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.180\noff the onions to the layer to the center\npart of that onion is your raw data.\n\n152\n00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.780\nAnd that's what happens when\nI told you in the first part,\n\n153\n00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.080\nwhere we essentially get Layer 7 from\n1 if I'm sending information right,\n\n154\n00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.290\nbecause if I'm sending information,\nI've got my raw data or data in general.\n\n155\n00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.920\nAnd it goes down through the layers,\n\n156\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.160\nlittle header after header is added on\nuntil we get down to the Data Link Layer\n\n157\n00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.170\nthat finally that MAC layer\nputs it on the network, right?\n\n158\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.870\nPuts that information on the network, once\nit's on the network it's now in the format\n\n159\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.040\nof those electrical, or raw bits, right?\n\n160\n00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.430\nElectrical impulses, as we process\nthe information each one of those\n\n161\n00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.560\nlayers they're in capitulations, right?\n\n162\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.160\nBecome decapitulated, and\nthat is up the OSI model, so\n\n163\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.480\nyou might hear the term down the stack,\nor up the stack.\n\n164\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.660\nAll right, and for troubleshooting\npurposes you also troubleshoot\n\n165\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.400\ndown the stack or up the stack, right?\n\n166\n00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.140\nSo, the OSI model starts out, for\n\n167\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.360\na lot of people it just\nstarts out as theory, right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.300\nBut then they get away from this,\nit's just theory,\n\n169\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.660\nwell it's not really theory and\nlet me tell you why.\n\n170\n00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.100\nWhen we talk about the devices that work\nat these layers, I got a little diagram\n\n171\n00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.040\nto kind of show you some of the different\ncomponents that operate at each layer.\n\n172\n00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.000\nHere's why I tell you figure out what\nlayer in the OSI model's having the issue,\n\n173\n00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.450\nif I have a DNS issue.\n\n174\n00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.510\nIs it my DNS application\nthat's having a problem?\n\n175\n00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.600\nWell if it is it's up the application\nlayer and I know where that sits or\n\n176\n00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.060\nmaybe it's the fact that\nthe IP address is wrong.\n\n177\n00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.890\nWell if the IP address is wrong\nthat's at layer three right?\n\n178\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.790\nThat's the network layer, so you can\nuse the OSI model to figure out where\n\n179\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.000\nthe communication breakdown is happening.\n\n180\n00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.890\nRight some of the devices that you see,\nsome of these higher devices you'll see\n\n181\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.530\nsome of these devices that operate\nat different layers as well too, and\n\n182\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.630\nI'll explain that as I go.\n\n183\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.900\nSo, for instance, you have certain\nfirewalls that have to understand\n\n184\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.120\nthe session layer, they understand\napplication layer information, right?\n\n185\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.050\nThey understand ports if they're\ndoing stateful packet inspection and\n\n186\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.930\nthat's what the NGFW is.\n\n187\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.860\nIt's next generation firewall.\n\n188\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.050\nThese current, the next generations, our\ncurrent generation, firewalls are very,\n\n189\n00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:29.610\nvery smart.\n\n190\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.850\nThey operate on just about\nevery level of the OSI model.\n\n191\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.370\nAll right,\nwhen you get to the transport layer,\n\n192\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.090\nthis is where things like gateways happen.\n\n193\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.950\nNow, I want you to understand that\na gateway is a little bit different than\n\n194\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.380\nwhat we're talking about when\nwe say a TCPIP default gateway.\n\n195\n00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.170\nAll right?\n\n196\n00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.960\nThe TCPIP default gateway is just\nan IP address that basically\n\n197\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.420\nconnects you to your router and allows\nyou to send traffic off your network.\n\n198\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.780\nWhen we talk about a gateway device here,\n\n199\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.660\nwe're talking about something\na little bit different.\n\n200\n00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.970\nThis is what allows you that\ninteroperability between two\n\n201\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.410\nsimilar systems.\n\n202\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.740\nAll right, so for instance maybe you\nwere in a TCPI based network and\n\n203\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.370\nin the earlier days, maybe you were\nstill on an IPXSPX network right?\n\n204\n00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.230\nWell, a gateway device is\nactually translating between two\n\n205\n00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.200\ndissimilar protocol so\nthat we get the interoperability together.\n\n206\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.930\nThat's what we mean when\nwe say a gateway device.\n\n207\n00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.520\nNow, when we come down\nto the network layer,\n\n208\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.320\nyou're gonna notice that we\nhave things like routers.\n\n209\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.830\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.000\nWell, routers, I want you to think\nabout what they do, all right?\n\n211\n00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.050\nIf I need to troubleshoot, I can't send\ninformation of of my local network well,\n\n212\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.590\nI do have to check things like\nthe physical cables, right?\n\n213\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.610\nWe have to make sure that our\nnetwork adaptors are turned on.\n\n214\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:43.150\nThat the switches are available but\nthen we get to the network layer and\n\n215\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.250\nwe find out that maybe the IP\naddresses are wrong, or\n\n216\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.820\nmaybe there's a bad route in\nthe routing table, right?\n\n217\n00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.890\nI can tell where the breakdown\nis happening and\n\n218\n00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.720\nthat's something that you should know,\nand not just outside of theory but\n\n219\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.090\nyou should also take it into\nyour networking career as well.\n\n220\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.570\nSo routers, IP addresses,\nrouting protocols right?\n\n221\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.020\nThat's what the routers\nbasically operate off of.\n\n222\n00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.820\nLayer 3 switches and\nwhy do we call it a Layer 3 switch?\n\n223\n00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.110\nWell, you're gonna have to wait\ntill I explain a switch and\n\n224\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.160\nthen we'll come back to it, right?\n\n225\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.785\nThat's not too nice of me, right?\n\n226\n00:11:14.785 --> 00:11:17.750\n[LAUGH] A switch operates traditionally,\n\n227\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.930\nswitching happens at Layer 2,\nwe talked about MAC addresses, right?\n\n228\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.830\nWe talked about forwarding frames\nbetween end points, right?\n\n229\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.190\nThey understand MAC addresses,\nbut some switches, and\n\n230\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.110\na lot of switches today\nare also Layer 3 switches.\n\n231\n00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.450\nBecause what does that mean?\n\n232\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.650\nWell, it just means that they\nunderstand IP addresses.\n\n233\n00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.950\nThey can act like a router and that's\nwhy they call them a Layer 3 switch.\n\n234\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.780\nYou might hear the term brouter, and\nI've always thought that that's funny,\n\n235\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.570\nbut don't worry about it,\nit's not a bridge router,\n\n236\n00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.490\nit means it understands Layer 2 and\nit understands Layer 3.\n\n237\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.650\nWhen we say a Layer 3 switch,\nwe're talking about one that essentially\n\n238\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.827\nunderstands the functions\nof a router all right?\n\n239\n00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:56.780\nNow switches, network adaptors.\n\n240\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.330\nNow you'll notice I've said before that\nsome of these things operate at two layers\n\n241\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.560\njust like the layer three switch.\n\n242\n00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.050\nIt operates natively at layer two and\nit understands IP so\n\n243\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.430\nit operates at layer three as well.\n\n244\n00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.030\nWell guess what?\nA network interface card has a physical\n\n245\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.890\ncable plugged into it.\n\n246\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.940\nAll right, but\nit also operates on Mac addresses, right?\n\n247\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.990\nAnd it does encoding and stuff so we do\nhave some functionality that is happening\n\n248\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:25.020\nat the layer too as well as\nthe physical layer as well.\n\n249\n00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.260\nSo there are certain functionalities and\nI went ahead and just put it at layer one.\n\n250\n00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.239\nAgain you'll see many different people\nwill kind of debate where it should be,\n\n251\n00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:37.452\nbut it does have\ncharacteristics that share both.\n\n252\n00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:42.451\nNow down here in the physical layer,\na couple people I don't\n\n253\n00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:47.560\nthink really would have any issue\nwith is hubs and repeaters.\n\n254\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.440\nSee a hub is a, it's a really dumb device\nas far as network connectivity devices.\n\n255\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.430\nIt doesn't understand addressing,\n\n256\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.350\nit doesn't make logical\ndecisions like a router does.\n\n257\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.200\nIt doesn't even look it like a Mac table,\nlike a switch does and\n\n258\n00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.980\nmake sure it knows where\nto forward information.\n\n259\n00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.890\nIt is electrically hardwired to\nreceive a signal on one port and\n\n260\n00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.990\nthen broadcast it out on all other ports.\n\n261\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.050\nIt's electrically wired that way,\nthere's no logic all right.\n\n262\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.070\nRepeaters, what is a repeater do?\n\n263\n00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.350\nWell, a repeaters a way\nto regenerate the signal.\n\n264\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.500\nWhen a signal is getting to\nthe end of its physical media,\n\n265\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.590\nthe maximum transmission distance.\n\n266\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.220\nIf it went any further pass\nthat then we can get errors,\n\n267\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.410\nwe get communication errors,\nwe get what's known as signal attenuation.\n\n268\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.520\nAnd attenuation is just the progress\ndegradation of the signal as it gets\n\n269\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.120\nfarther and farther from it's source.\n\n270\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.915\nWhen you get a while.\n\n271\n00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.435\nWireless repeater in your house?\n\n272\n00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:40.115\nWell, you got a physical\nlayer device right?\n\n273\n00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:41.825\nBecause what is the wireless\nrepeater doing?\n\n274\n00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:44.725\nIt's receiving that wireless signal,\nit's regenerating it and\n\n275\n00:13:44.725 --> 00:13:46.155\nit boost it out further.\n\n276\n00:13:46.155 --> 00:13:50.315\nSo it thereby extends the length of\nthe transmission distance, right?\n\n277\n00:13:50.315 --> 00:13:52.550\nHave wire repeaters and\nyou have wireless repeaters.\n\n278\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.080\nThese all operate on the physical layer.\n\n279\n00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.270\nWe'll also have things like modems.\n\n280\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.430\nWe'll talk a little bit more on\nother episodes about modems,\n\n281\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.590\nbut modem is just short for modulator\ndemodulator, modulation demodulation.\n\n282\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.900\nAll right, it takes an electrical signal.\n\n283\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.080\nIt modulates it with a modulation scheme,\n\n284\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.130\nand it sends it across\nan analog PSTN line, right?\n\n285\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.680\nPhysical public switch telephone network\nlines and then on the other end,\n\n286\n00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.720\nwhat happens?\n\n287\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.000\nRight, the modem does the demodulation,\nand it removes the encoding.\n\n288\n00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.130\nAnd it leaves the digital bits that are\nthen delivered to the network adapter and\n\n289\n00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.040\nprocessed by your computer, and\nback up the stack we go, right?\n\n290\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.860\nSo these are some of the things that you\nhave to be aware of when it comes to\n\n291\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:31.850\nthe exam, all right?\n\n292\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.920\nKnow what your layers are.\n\n293\n00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.350\nKnow the processing models, or\nhow our computer's process.\n\n294\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.700\nKnow what encapsulation is.\n\n295\n00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.580\nRemember, encapsulation\nis just the process of\n\n296\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.500\none layer handing its information\nto be assisted by the lower layer.\n\n297\n00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.300\nIt basically puts it in this envelope\nif you will and it adds its data to it.\n\n298\n00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.070\nAnd then the process repeats all the way\nto we get down to the switch and\n\n299\n00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.250\nthat MAC layer defining who\ncan access the media, right.\n\n300\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.390\nThese are important things.\n\n301\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.160\nRemember what layer of the OSI model,\nthings like switches operate on,\n\n302\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.460\nthings like routers,\ngateways, if you will.\n\n303\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.750\nUnderstand what an application\nlayer firewall is.\n\n304\n00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.900\nYou might have heard that term before and\nnever understood what it meant.\n\n305\n00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.660\nYou say, well,\nwe've got an application layer firewall.\n\n306\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.956\nWhat does that mean?\n\n307\n00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:21.562\nIt means, a firewall, and that's your\nnext generation firewall that are smart\n\n308\n00:15:21.562 --> 00:15:24.693\nenough to know that just\nbecause you tell me it's DNS.\n\n309\n00:15:24.693 --> 00:15:26.823\nThat firewall can look at and say,\n\n310\n00:15:26.823 --> 00:15:31.620\nI understand HTTP traffic and\nthat's not the DNS, that's HTML in there.\n\n311\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.030\nSo now nice try but\nthat's a web based attack.\n\n312\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.480\nIt's smart enough to understand this,\nright?\n\n313\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.185\nAnd you wanna be aware of it, right?\n\n314\n00:15:38.185 --> 00:15:42.490\nOne of the things we talked about\nTCP is session identifiers.\n\n315\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.145\nThose port numbers.\n\n316\n00:15:43.145 --> 00:15:45.582\nPort numbers happen at the session layer.\n\n317\n00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:49.984\nWe want you to be aware of these\ntechnologies and certainly, you could\n\n318\n00:15:49.984 --> 00:15:54.990\nspend an entire month, in just the OSI\nmodel, but remember some of the basics.\n\n319\n00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:59.820\nIf you remember these basics, you're gonna\nbe doing well for your next Net Plus exam.\n\n320\n00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n321\n00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:04.830\nOSI model, part two and there's a part\none and you watch them both, and\n\n322\n00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.930\nyou'll see that Wes has put\ntogether all this information for\n\n323\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.590\nyou, to help you in the exam.\n\n324\n00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.620\nAnd make sure you watch\nevery single episode,\n\n325\n00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.620\nin the CompTIA Net+ series,\nand every other video!\n\n326\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.330\nAnd of course, library,\nhundreds of videos.\n\n327\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.720\nSo they're all designed to\nhelp you go further and\n\n328\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.880\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be mighty glad you did.\n\n329\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.200\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n330\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n331\n00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.272\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n332\n00:16:26.272 --> 00:16:32.261\n[MUSIC]\n\n333\n00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.024\nI'm Zach Memos, you host as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net+,\n\n7\n00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:23.316\nNetwork Traffic Properties is\nthe title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:26.686\nAnd Wes Bryan is here once again to\nhelp us out because he likes us.\n\n9\n00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.040\nWes [LAUGH] it's good to have you here,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n10\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.143\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back,\nthat's right, you guys are okay,\n\n11\n00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:34.876\nyou're all right with me,\nI don't care what Zach says about you.\n\n12\n00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:36.846\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No just kidding, that's right,\n\n13\n00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:41.545\nwe are back to talk about the different\ncharacteristics, right, the properties,\n\n14\n00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:44.143\nif you will,\nof our network communications.\n\n15\n00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.801\nCuz believe it or not really all we've\nbeen talking about is the source and\n\n16\n00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:48.874\ndestination right.\n\n17\n00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:50.713\nThe end points of communications, and\n\n18\n00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:53.724\nwe've been talking about\nthe redistribution points, right,\n\n19\n00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:57.070\nwhether that be your connectivity\ndevices or a repeater, right.\n\n20\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.440\nBut we have to look a little bit more,\n\n21\n00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.080\na little bit more in depth on some\nof these characteristics, right.\n\n22\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.960\nSome of the properties,\n\n23\n00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770\nbecause in certain scenarios your\ncomputers might communicate one way.\n\n24\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.670\nAnother given scenario, your computers\nmight communicate completely different.\n\n25\n00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.547\nAnd then in other ways, they all will\ndiffer from all the other ones that we'll\n\n26\n00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:18.449\ntalk about as we go into this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:20.127\nSo, and it's gonna be important for\n\n28\n00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.998\nyou guys out there to understand\nsome of the characteristics or\n\n29\n00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:26.024\nproperties that we're gonna take\ncare of here in this episode.\n\n30\n00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:27.425\n&gt;&gt; So,\nWes it sounds like you're talking about\n\n31\n00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:28.910\nthere's more than one communication type.\n\n32\n00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.760\nSo can you tell us a little\nbit more about that?\n\n33\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely,\nwhen it comes to communications,\n\n34\n00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.370\nlargely it's broken down into\nthree of the most common.\n\n35\n00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.962\nThere's a fourth one here\nthat isn't on the list,\n\n36\n00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:41.254\nso Zach,\nI'm gonna throw you a curveball and\n\n37\n00:01:41.254 --> 00:01:44.530\nkinda steer it off the beaten path\nwhen we get to that fourth one.\n\n38\n00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.980\nBecause even though it's\nnot called out on the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.170\nI want you to be prepared for it.\n\n40\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.910\nBecause we know here at ITProTV that many\nof you that are gonna sit the Network+\n\n41\n00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.450\nexam might go on to other certifications.\n\n42\n00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.980\nSo it's not always just about what is on\nthe exam, but to try to give you some\n\n43\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.010\nadditional information,\neven if they don't call it out.\n\n44\n00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.744\nSo the very first one I want to call out\nis, and I got a little diagram here and\n\n45\n00:02:04.744 --> 00:02:07.554\nthis communication type is\nwhat's known as a unicast.\n\n46\n00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:12.255\nAnd when we look at unicast, unicast is\na one to one communication, all right,\n\n47\n00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:15.973\nthat's really what is boils down\nto when we say we got a source of\n\n48\n00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:19.720\nthe communication, and\nwe got a single destination, right.\n\n49\n00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.723\nSource and destination, that's a unicast,\nso for instance if I'm gonna communicate,\n\n50\n00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:27.320\nlet's say Zach and my computer, I'm\ngonna send him some information, right.\n\n51\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.120\nOr maybe I'm gonna connect to his\ncomputer over like a share if you will,\n\n52\n00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.465\nlike a shared resource\nthat's on his computer,\n\n53\n00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:36.160\nit's a straight one to one communication,\nright.\n\n54\n00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.370\nOr if I do something like, maybe I\nping Zach's computer from my computer,\n\n55\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.450\njust to see if, test reachability,\nright, and I get replies back.\n\n56\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.610\nWell those are one to one,\nright, one to one communication,\n\n57\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.532\nis what we know as a unicast.\n\n58\n00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:55.527\nNow I do want you to understand that in\na unicast no other computer, none of these\n\n59\n00:02:55.527 --> 00:03:00.538\nother computers actually receives any\nsignal and that's important, right.\n\n60\n00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:04.403\nNot only to know that it's a one to one\ncommunication but also to know that these\n\n61\n00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:08.340\nother computers aren't going\nto receive that communication.\n\n62\n00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.319\nNow we have another type of communication\nand that's what's known as a broadcast and\n\n63\n00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.427\nthat's really, Zach,\nthat's the polar opposite of a unicast.\n\n64\n00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:17.092\nWe say unicast being one to one,\n\n65\n00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:20.733\na broadcast communication is like\ngoing to the food court in the mall,\n\n66\n00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.697\nstanding up on the table and yelling out,\nand everybody hears you, right.\n\n67\n00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:29.963\nSo notice that the source\nof the communication\n\n68\n00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:36.175\nhere sends a broadcast into\nthe connectivity device,\n\n69\n00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:41.846\nand then that connectivity\ndevice urns around and\n\n70\n00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:47.805\nliterally sends it out all of its ports,\nall right.\n\n71\n00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:52.530\nSo that is important to remember, that\nbroadcast communication is one to all.\n\n72\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.040\nSo we have unicast, a one to one\ncommunication, and we have a broadcast\n\n73\n00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.170\nbeing the opposite of that, being one\nto everybody, one to all communication.\n\n74\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.940\nNow we've got another one, and this is the\nthird most common type of communication\n\n75\n00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.970\nthat you have on your networks.\n\n76\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.310\nAnd the third most common\ntype of communication\n\n77\n00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.690\nis what is known as\na multicast communication.\n\n78\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.123\nNow a multicast communication's a little\nbit more efficient than a broadcast.\n\n79\n00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:22.078\nBroadcast communications, if you have\ntoo many of them on your networks,\n\n80\n00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:25.804\nthey can negatively impact\nthe performance of your network, right.\n\n81\n00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:28.588\nIf you think about it, if I only have\nto talk to Zach, there's no reason for\n\n82\n00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:29.737\nme to stand on the table here and\n\n83\n00:04:29.737 --> 00:04:32.280\nyell out to where everybody else\nin the studios can hear me, right.\n\n84\n00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.520\nThere's a lot of wasted information or\nwasted hot air in my case,\n\n85\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.820\nbut wasted communications if we bring\nit back over to the network, right,\n\n86\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.790\nI only needed to talk to Zach, right.\n\n87\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.730\nWell, what if I needed to talk to let's\nsay Zach here in studio two here,\n\n88\n00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.610\nmaybe Mr. Gordon over there in\nstudio four, right now, and\n\n89\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.940\nmaybe Miss Cherokee over in studio one but\nI didn't need to talk to anybody else.\n\n90\n00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.300\nWell that's where the multicast comes in,\nnow I want you to understand that you'll\n\n91\n00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.980\nhear it commonly said a one to many,\nright we have the unicast one to one,\n\n92\n00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.800\nwe have the broadcast one to everybody,\nbut what is one to many?\n\n93\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.808\nAs I've been teaching this over almost\na decade now to a lot of our members now,\n\n94\n00:05:10.808 --> 00:05:12.993\nbut the students that\nI used to in the past,\n\n95\n00:05:12.993 --> 00:05:15.765\nI would say I want you to\nchange that many, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:19.139\nChange it a little bit, that's absolutely\nright, and that's what you're gonna\n\n97\n00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.451\nhear in the majority of a lot\nof documentation out there,\n\n98\n00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.464\nbut I want you to understand that it's\nactually a select few, all right.\n\n99\n00:05:24.464 --> 00:05:28.225\nThat many is chosen, it's not just some\nrandom, arbitrary number, it's a group,\n\n100\n00:05:28.225 --> 00:05:29.700\nit's called a multicast group.\n\n101\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.380\nBut I want you to think about it as a,\nlike, back in the 90s I remember,\n\n102\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.100\nand even the 80s, I remember when we\nwere a little bit younger you know.\n\n103\n00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.756\nWe would get one of the kids' moms that\nhave like a pay-per-view event, right.\n\n104\n00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:46.567\nAnd we'd all do chores or something,\nand we'd all get our money together and\n\n105\n00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:48.267\nwe'd put it in a collection pot and\n\n106\n00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.095\nwe'd give it to one of the moms\nwithin the neighborhood.\n\n107\n00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:54.667\nAnd she would order the prize fight,\nand we'd watch Mike Tyson, right,\n\n108\n00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.970\nwe'd Evander Holyfield, right,\nwe would watch the prize fight.\n\n109\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.090\nWell think about the pay-per-view and\nhow it's going.\n\n110\n00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.060\nYou can have everybody in that\nneighborhood has the same cable company,\n\n111\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.340\nand most likely in those days they\ndid have the same cable company.\n\n112\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.120\nBut who is gonna receive\nthat pay-per-view event?\n\n113\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.490\nNow, I'm not talking about you hackers\nout there, I'm talking about legal.\n\n114\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.850\nLegally, [LAUGH] who is gonna\nreceive that communication?\n\n115\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.030\nOnly the people that were apart\nof the pay-per-view event, right?\n\n116\n00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.550\nWell that's the same thing with a\nmulticast, let's go ahead and tie some of\n\n117\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.070\nthese other concepts together that\nwe've talked about in the past as well,\n\n118\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.622\nall right.\n\n119\n00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:33.450\nI want you to think of IGMP, that's\nthe Internet Group Management Protocol.\n\n120\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.750\nThe Internet Group Management Protocol,\nwhat it's responsible for\n\n121\n00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.640\nit's the protocol that we use\nto send multicast communication.\n\n122\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.080\nSo your connectivity devices when they\nneed to send a multicast communication\n\n123\n00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.930\nwhat do they do?\n\n124\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.930\nThey use IGMP, and in fact I've\ngot a Windows 10 machine here,\n\n125\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.200\nI could kinda show you how our computers,\nsince this is under the domain,\n\n126\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.370\napparently I don't remember\nhow to type my password.\n\n127\n00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.230\nSince this is under\nthe domain of routing and\n\n128\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.050\nswitching it is kinda good\nto kinda see this in action.\n\n129\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.620\nSo let's go ahead and what we'll do is\nI'll launch up my Command Prompt here.\n\n130\n00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.276\nLet me go ahead and clear the screen here\nand give us a little more real estate.\n\n131\n00:07:10.276 --> 00:07:14.553\nAnd in our network troubleshooting tools,\nwe talk about a command and go check those\n\n132\n00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:18.611\nout if you will, cuz we're not really\ngonna dive too in depth on what this does.\n\n133\n00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:21.870\nBut we talked about a route command\nbeing able to view the routing table.\n\n134\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.620\nAnd if I do a route space print -4,\nI can view the IPv4 routing table here.\n\n135\n00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.760\nAnd the reason my computer knows where\nto send multicast communications\n\n136\n00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.210\nis because it's aware of\nthe multicast networks.\n\n137\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.460\nTying another concept together, remember\nwe're gonna start tying the pieces\n\n138\n00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.880\ntogether of everything we've\nbeen learning here in Net+.\n\n139\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.106\nI want you to think of that class D range,\nright,\n\n140\n00:07:45.106 --> 00:07:48.593\nin the classical system we have A,\nB, C, D, and E.\n\n141\n00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.874\nDon't worry about E,\nEs research, experimental,\n\n142\n00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.813\nit was never given over to anyone in\nthe public, it was used for ARPA,\n\n143\n00:07:53.813 --> 00:07:56.469\nthe military, if you will, and\nuniversities for research.\n\n144\n00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:58.548\nBut d range is the multicast range, and\n\n145\n00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:01.450\nthat's never allocated to\nany one computer, right?\n\n146\n00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.220\nIf I'm an ISP, Zack doesn't come to me and\nsay, hey, I need internet access, and\n\n147\n00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.470\nthen I gave him a multicast address,\nright?\n\n148\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.600\nAll of your computers use these addresses,\nright?\n\n149\n00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.370\nWhen they need to send the communication,\nand they say,\n\n150\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.930\nhey I'm gonna start the multicast group.\n\n151\n00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.980\nAnd then they send it to\nthe multicast address.\n\n152\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.640\nThe listening connectivity device says,\nokay, I'll make a multicast advertisement\n\n153\n00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.683\nthat says, hey there's a multicast group\nover here and if you want to join it,\n\n154\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:26.869\ncommunicate with me.\n\n155\n00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:30.750\nAnd then when my computer needs\nto send multicast communications,\n\n156\n00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.243\nit sends it again in that one too many\nfashion in everybody that is in the group,\n\n157\n00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:37.440\nthat is in the multicast, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.520\nSo recap we got unicast one to one.\n\n159\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.620\nWe got broadcast one to everybody, right?\n\n160\n00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.700\nGetting up on the table and\nyelling at the top of your lungs.\n\n161\n00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.782\nAnd then we have the multicast which\nis a one to a select few, one to group.\n\n162\n00:08:50.782 --> 00:08:54.595\nNow there's a fourth one here and I don't\nhave a diagram for this one and honestly\n\n163\n00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:58.466\nit really isn't in the exam objectives but\nthere's another one on the scene too,\n\n164\n00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:01.999\nthat I'm gonna go ahead and mention so\nthat those of you that are gonna go and\n\n165\n00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:05.646\nuse NetPlus to leap off into higher levels\ncertifications will be aware of and\n\n166\n00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.149\nit won't catch you off guard.\n\n167\n00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:09.500\nAnd that's called an anycast.\n\n168\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.407\nNow, an anycast is an interesting thing\nbecause an anycast isn't a one to one,\n\n169\n00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:16.080\nisn't a one to many, isn't a one to all.\n\n170\n00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.360\nIt's what's known as a one to the best.\n\n171\n00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.530\nOne to the best choice, all right?\n\n172\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.554\nI'll give you a classic example\nof where you see something like\n\n173\n00:09:23.554 --> 00:09:24.364\nin anycast, all right?\n\n174\n00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:29.700\nIn our DNS episodes, we talked about\nthe root, the hierarchical system.\n\n175\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.530\nAnd when my DNS server doesn't\nhave the answer, what does it do?\n\n176\n00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.365\nIt needs to communicate with\nthe root hint server, right?\n\n177\n00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:37.840\nBut where are those root hint servers?\n\n178\n00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.160\nWell there's actually 13 IP addresses for\nthose root hint servers, all right.\n\n179\n00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.630\nAnd I think its alphabet letters,\nA through M, but\n\n180\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.550\n13 IP addresses doesn't mean\nthere's 13 root end servers,\n\n181\n00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.990\nthere's actually hundred of root end\nservers all around the world, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.419\nWell when I need to contact, my DNS server\nneeds to contact and root end server.\n\n183\n00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:05.200\nThe router's gonna look at it and\nsay okay well what's the best choice?\n\n184\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.040\nYou've got a lot of root\nhead servers out there.\n\n185\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.190\nSo it does an anycast and it sends\nthat request out to the closest or\n\n186\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.140\nthe best choice.\n\n187\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.110\nSo the anycast is one, not on the list.\n\n188\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.920\nNow you're off to the side, but\nit is one that you should be aware of,\n\n189\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.630\nit is the one to best.\n\n190\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.760\nNow there's something else that\nwe have to understand too,\n\n191\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.720\nand that is the fact that we talked about\ntwo different media access methods.\n\n192\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.030\nOr I'm sorry,\nconnectivity network types if you will.\n\n193\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.510\nOne is what is known as\ncondition based in media access.\n\n194\n00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.990\nThe other one's known as deterministic\nmedia access, all right.\n\n195\n00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.030\nEthernet is what we use today\non land communications.\n\n196\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.820\nIt is the most common local area network.\n\n197\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.370\nIt dominates the market, right.\n\n198\n00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.750\nWell, why is that?\n\n199\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.440\nWell it's a cheaper implementation\nthan some of the earlier,\n\n200\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.980\nif we take a trip in our Dolorean and\ngo back to the future,\n\n201\n00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.502\nback into the '80s where there wer\nother competing technologies for\n\n202\n00:10:59.502 --> 00:11:03.060\nland based communications, but\nthey kind of fell by the wayside.\n\n203\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.960\nAnd some of these were deterministic\nmedia access, all right?\n\n204\n00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.990\nAnd what is the difference, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.090\nWell, contention based\nmedia access does this.\n\n206\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.510\nIt says, every one of the devices on\nthat network are gonna contend, right?\n\n207\n00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.692\nI could've been a contender, right?\n\n208\n00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:20.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna contend.\n\n209\n00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.690\nWe're gonna come back to prize\nfight somehow here, Zach.\n\n210\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.669\n&gt;&gt; Hey, you feel like Rocky.\n\n211\n00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:26.850\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right,\n\n212\n00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:31.390\nso what they do is they all are in\na competition to send their data.\n\n213\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.200\nThey send their data, they send their\ndata, they send their data, and\n\n214\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.710\nthey hope it gets to the end point,\nall right?\n\n215\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.222\nNow, there's a benefit to that and\nthere's a drawback, all right?\n\n216\n00:11:40.222 --> 00:11:44.710\nThe benefit is because the computers are\nthe ones that are communicating back and\n\n217\n00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.482\nforth and\nthey're the ones that are contending,\n\n218\n00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:50.320\nit brings the price of\nyour connectivity devices,\n\n219\n00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.190\nsince they don't have to worry about that\ncontention, down, so the cost is lower.\n\n220\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.630\nHence, one of the reasons\nethernet won out.\n\n221\n00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.340\nThe other thing to keep in mind too\nis that deterministic media access,\n\n222\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.495\nall right now there's a benefit to it but\nthen there's also a drawback, as well.\n\n223\n00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:08.860\nSee deterministic media access\nis like this, me saying, Zach,\n\n224\n00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.300\ndo you have information\nthat you need to send?\n\n225\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.865\nNo?\nOkay, somebody else.\n\n226\n00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:16.230\nDo you have information\nthat you need to send?\n\n227\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.840\nYou do?\n\n228\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.724\nOkay, well,\nyou can send your information now.\n\n229\n00:12:19.724 --> 00:12:23.078\nAnd as we go around the circle\nwe're going to let everybody know\n\n230\n00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:26.812\nthat you've got information that's\non the wire and Zack, myself and\n\n231\n00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:32.090\neverybody else that is connected that\nnetwork, you've gotta be quiet and wait.\n\n232\n00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.630\nRight?\nThat's deterministic media access now\n\n233\n00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.070\nthere's a benefit to it right?\n\n234\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.940\nEverybody's guaranteed access to the wire,\nand\n\n235\n00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.260\nI say wire figuratively\nis the network right?\n\n236\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.410\nAll of your devices are guaranteed\n\n237\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.610\nthat they will have access\nto the wire all right?\n\n238\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.188\nAnd there is a drawback,\n\n239\n00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:53.783\nwell when somebody's is using the wire,\neverybody else has to shut up.\n\n240\n00:12:53.783 --> 00:12:57.250\nEverybody else has to keep quiet,\nright but can't communicate.\n\n241\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.480\nThe other thing is,\ndo you notice how I said, hey Zach,\n\n242\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.050\ndo you have information to send?\n\n243\n00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.960\nNow Zach, I didn't even give him\ntime to respond here honestly,\n\n244\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.950\nbut Zach didn't say anything right.\n\n245\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.930\nThat's a method called polling, I have to\nask Zach do you have information to send?\n\n246\n00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.510\nAnd if Zach doesn't have\nany information to send\n\n247\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.410\nthere's a chance I wasted\na little bit of time.\n\n248\n00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.190\nNot that I wasted time on Zach, it's just\nthe fact that I wasted time in the network\n\n249\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.670\nas in the node where Zach in this case,\ndid you have information and\n\n250\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.960\nsaid you didnt.\n\n251\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.360\nSo now we go to the next person.\n\n252\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.520\nYou didnt?\n\n253\n00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.370\nNext person.\n\n254\n00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.140\nYou didnt?\n\n255\n00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.480\nSo there's a chance that we can go\naround a few of these computers and\n\n256\n00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.410\nin the polling process and\nnobody has to communicate.\n\n257\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.230\nSo with contention based media access\nyou're just, again, in a competition.\n\n258\n00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.010\nAnd again, deterministic media\naccess needs more logic in\n\n259\n00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.800\nthe connectivity devices,\nraises the price point too.\n\n260\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.520\nThen also once ethernet got beyond\na 100 megs, and then into a gig at\n\n261\n00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.200\nthe lower prices, that's one of\nthe reasons that just made it really,\n\n262\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.770\nreally attractive to a lot of businesses.\n\n263\n00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.840\nNow with contention based media access\nthat leads into the next concept\n\n264\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.910\nthat we have to watch it.\n\n265\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.910\nIn the earlier days of communications\nacross the ethernet based networks we were\n\n266\n00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.610\nin a bus based network right.\n\n267\n00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.960\nRemember the bus topology so\n\n268\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.210\nwe're kinda tying a lot of pieces together\nhere in the traffic properties right.\n\n269\n00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.960\nWe had those bus space networks, and what\nwas it, remember it was a single coaxial,\n\n270\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.410\nalmost like a network backbone, and\n\n271\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.920\nthen you would just attach\nnodes to that backbone cable.\n\n272\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.290\nOne computer would send information and\n\n273\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:28.520\neverybody else would hear it broadcast,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.290\nBut only the person or\nthe node that it was intended to,\n\n275\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.630\nthe recipient would actually\nprocess the information, all right.\n\n276\n00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.300\nAnd I want you to think of it this way.\n\n277\n00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:44.010\nIf everybody is contending and\nsending their information out at one time.\n\n278\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.170\nThen there's a potential for\nwhat's known as collisions.\n\n279\n00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:54.550\nAll right, that group of nodes is in\nwhat is known as a collision domain.\n\n280\n00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.390\nNow I want you to also understand that in\nthe topology section we also talked about\n\n281\n00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.030\na logical bus.\n\n282\n00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.910\nWe said, you can have a physical star.\n\n283\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.930\nAnd in fact let's go back to my\nmulticast drawing right here, just for\n\n284\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.140\na second here.\n\n285\n00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.160\nNotice that, let's just say that this\nis a switch in the middle, right?\n\n286\n00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.420\nI know it's a diagram for\na router but let's say it's a switch.\n\n287\n00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.700\nOr not a switch, I'm sorry.\n\n288\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.680\nBut let's say it's a hub in the middle.\n\n289\n00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.830\nWell, I want you to understand.\n\n290\n00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.012\nRemember what we said about a hub?\n\n291\n00:15:19.012 --> 00:15:22.290\nEven though this is a star topology,\nright?\n\n292\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.350\nPhysically, when one\ncommunication goes in to and\n\n293\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.710\nprobably be better to even go over to our\nbroadcast, because this is actually, know\n\n294\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:36.790\nthat this is a physical star topology, but\nbecause of the hub, the way the hub works,\n\n295\n00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.770\nit receives the communications and it\njust broadcasts it out to all the ports.\n\n296\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.420\nThat means every communication that\ngoes into the hub is gonna be broadcast.\n\n297\n00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.590\nIt means there's a potential for\n\n298\n00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.900\nan electrical collusion especially\nwhen you have shared media.\n\n299\n00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.115\nThat is what's known\nas a collusion domain.\n\n300\n00:15:53.115 --> 00:15:59.337\nAll right, and what it means is that a PC\none sends information Into this hub.\n\n301\n00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:02.089\nIt's going to broadcast\nit out all other ports.\n\n302\n00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:07.139\nThat means there's a potential for\ntwo of these PCs, if not all of these PCs,\n\n303\n00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:11.024\nto try to send information into\nthe hub at the same time, and\n\n304\n00:16:11.024 --> 00:16:13.970\nwe get an electrical collision.\n\n305\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.600\nThat's what's known as a collision domain.\n\n306\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.730\nAnd you have to understand that anytime\nyou put a hub in your networks,\n\n307\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.280\nyou increase the contention because\nit's all broadcast communications and\n\n308\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.846\nyou actually degrade\nthe performance of your network.\n\n309\n00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:30.690\n&gt;&gt; And, Wes,\ncan I bring it back to a certain point?\n\n310\n00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.440\nA little bit earlier you\nmentioned about being within\n\n311\n00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.030\nearshot of a broadcast domain.\n\n312\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.690\nNow, what exactly did you mean by that?\n\n313\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, when I said being within\nthe earshot of a broadcast communication,\n\n314\n00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.380\nthat is what is known as\na broadcast domain, right?\n\n315\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.240\nIf I said that if you can hear\nthat broadcast communication.\n\n316\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.306\nWell, what do I mean by that?\n\n317\n00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:53.280\nWell, every communication, if we look\nat our hub, right, every communication\n\n318\n00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.390\nis essentially a broadcast communication,\njust the way it's electrically hardwired.\n\n319\n00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.159\nIt has no logic,\nit doesn't look at addresses at all.\n\n320\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.040\nBut at layer two, we have switches, right?\n\n321\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.820\nAnd switches inspect Mac addresses.\n\n322\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.230\nWell, believe it or not,\nthere is a MAC address for\n\n323\n00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.440\na broadcast communication, right?\n\n324\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.150\nIn our IP addressing we talked about\nhaving a broadcast address for\n\n325\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.970\nthe network, right?\n\n326\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:25.460\nAnd that's the IP address that a computer\nsends a broadcast communication when that\n\n327\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.320\ncomputer over IP wants every node within\nthat subnet to hear what's going on.\n\n328\n00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.990\nWell, that's also layer two\nthat that happens as well.\n\n329\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:39.508\nUnderstand that layer two, in fact,\nI can kind of show you this.\n\n330\n00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:42.390\nThere's actually a broadcast MAC address.\n\n331\n00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.810\nAnd if we use another command that we've\nused in our network troubleshooting tools,\n\n332\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:51.140\narp, we do an arp -a,\nwe can actually see that right here,\n\n333\n00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.336\nthat they're, and\nyou know what, I do not see it.\n\n334\n00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:55.740\nYes, I do, I see it right here.\n\n335\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.830\nSorry about that.\n\n336\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.415\nHere is the IP address, that's\nthe layer three rebroadcast address.\n\n337\n00:18:00.415 --> 00:18:04.385\nBut remember, we're talking about the OSI\nmodel, we still have the data link layer.\n\n338\n00:18:04.385 --> 00:18:08.705\nAll fs is a broadcast communication\nthere at the data link layer, and\n\n339\n00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:10.665\nthat's what switches respond to.\n\n340\n00:18:10.665 --> 00:18:14.890\nSo when this switch receives\na broadcast communication, so\n\n341\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:20.390\nlet's follow this train of thought\nhere down the wire quite literally.\n\n342\n00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:26.290\nSo PC1 sends a communication in\nthe hub that is addressed to all fs,\n\n343\n00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.180\nt hat broadcast address.\n\n344\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.290\nRemember the hub?\n\n345\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.300\nIt's dumb, it doesn't look at\nthat address, it doesn't pair,\n\n346\n00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.410\nit doesn't know any logic at all.\n\n347\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.204\nIt receives the information and\n\n348\n00:18:36.204 --> 00:18:41.105\nit broadcasts it to everybody that is\nconnected to it, including the switch.\n\n349\n00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:44.995\nNotice how the switch is\nalso connected to the Hub.\n\n350\n00:18:44.995 --> 00:18:48.695\nNow, the switch is gonna, this is were\nwe start to get into the logic, right?\n\n351\n00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:50.995\nThat's what differentiates\na Hub from a switch.\n\n352\n00:18:50.995 --> 00:18:55.625\nA switch is looking at the MAC address and\nit's saying, I see the destination,\n\n353\n00:18:55.625 --> 00:19:01.410\nthe destination is all fs, so you want\nthis to be a broadcast communication.\n\n354\n00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.100\nSo what does the switch do?\n\n355\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:09.230\nThe switch broadcasts that\ncommunication out all of it's ports.\n\n356\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:15.920\nAnd when it does that, every device that\nis connected to that switch will receive,\n\n357\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.807\nand is within the earshot of\nthat broadcast communication.\n\n358\n00:19:20.807 --> 00:19:22.110\nThat make sense now?\n\n359\n00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.726\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So that means if this, and\n\n360\n00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:27.696\nagain, let's kinda follow this down\nthe wire so we know what's going on.\n\n361\n00:19:27.696 --> 00:19:32.585\nPC1 sends a broadcast all fs\nas the destination MAC address\n\n362\n00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:34.652\nin that Ethernet frame.\n\n363\n00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:38.462\nIt goes into the hub, hub's blind to it,\nhub doesn't look at addresses,\n\n364\n00:19:38.462 --> 00:19:40.290\nit just looks at raw bits.\n\n365\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.771\nIt's like a repeater,\nit just broadcasts it out all other ports,\n\n366\n00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:47.950\nincluding sending it up to the switch,\ncuz the switch was connected to the hub.\n\n367\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.742\nBut then the switch says,\nthat is a broadcast communication,\n\n368\n00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:57.448\nand it floods that out all of it's\nports including up to this Hub and\n\n369\n00:19:57.448 --> 00:20:01.501\nthen back out to these three\ncomputers here, all right?\n\n370\n00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:06.613\nNow, one of the reasons we don't use Hubs\nanymore on our networks, or you shouldn't\n\n371\n00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:11.092\nbe using Hubs, is because you will\nincrease the competition, all right?\n\n372\n00:20:11.092 --> 00:20:15.123\nIf a Hub is just like a logical\nbus topology which if one computer\n\n373\n00:20:15.123 --> 00:20:20.599\ncommunicates everybody hears it within\nthe network, well, then the more computers\n\n374\n00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:26.310\nI hook to that Hub, the more competition\nwe have, the more Hubs and more computers.\n\n375\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.320\nYou're just creating one\nbig broadcast storm.\n\n376\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.990\nThe one great thing about switches today\n\n377\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.160\nis that switches isolate\ncontention domains, right?\n\n378\n00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.590\nBecause essentially what we've\ndone is we've removed the Hub,\n\n379\n00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.980\nwe have plugged each device, if you will,\ninto it's own port on the switch.\n\n380\n00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.970\nAnd if you check out the network\ndevices that we've talked about,\n\n381\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.440\nthe Hub can forward between each ports\nbased on its destination MAC address.\n\n382\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.630\nSo essentially,\n\n383\n00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.570\nwhat's happening is each computer is\nnow on it's own collision domain, but\n\n384\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:03.140\nI want you to know that this would still\nbe a single broadcast domain, right?\n\n385\n00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:08.160\nAccording to the switch, if it sees\nan all f destination MAC address,\n\n386\n00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.190\nit's going to send it to every computer\nthat's connected to the switch,\n\n387\n00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:16.460\nwhich is the larger portion, if you will,\nthat's the Broadcast Domain, all right?\n\n388\n00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.540\nSo know a little bit of the difference\nbetween the Broadcast Domain and\n\n389\n00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.490\nthe Collision Domain.\n\n390\n00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.660\nWhen you have a shared media\nwhere there's competition for\n\n391\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.850\nthat shared media,\nyou have a Collision Domain.\n\n392\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.700\nBecause we don't use\nbus-based topologies anymore,\n\n393\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.470\nwe don't see too many of these like\na lot of competition going on.\n\n394\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.800\nBut you still have broadcast\ncommunications using Broadcast Domains.\n\n395\n00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.280\nYou put a Hub into your network, and\n\n396\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.410\nnow you've essentially created\na Collision Domain, if you will.\n\n397\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:52.340\nSo definitely understand that because\nhow it affects your communications,\n\n398\n00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.600\nhow it affects the performance\nof your network, really matters.\n\n399\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.455\nThe more Hubs,\nthe worse you network's gonna be.\n\n400\n00:21:58.455 --> 00:22:01.260\nCuz again,\nwhat you are doing is you're increasing\n\n401\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.120\nhow much extra communications\nare going on your network.\n\n402\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.040\nAnd what I mean by that,\nif we go back to our diagram here,\n\n403\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.390\nwhat if PC 1 only really needs to talk to,\nlet's say PC 1, 2 and 3, right?\n\n404\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.380\nPC 1 only needs to talk to PC 3.\n\n405\n00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.740\nAnd in the MAC address is\nthe destination MAC address for PC 3.\n\n406\n00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.000\nWell, it doesn't matter the Hub,\nit doesn't understand that.\n\n407\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.380\nIt just receives the signal and\nit broadcasts it out all over the port.\n\n408\n00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.605\nSo that means PC 2 is gonna\nreceive the signal as well.\n\n409\n00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:32.080\nIt's not gonna process it.\n\n410\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.111\nSo again you can see there's wasted time,\nwasted communications on your networks.\n\n411\n00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:39.080\nSo that's why we gotta worry\nabout broadcast communications.\n\n412\n00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.420\nAnd that's why I said earlier on when we\nfirst started this episode, that you have\n\n413\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.430\nto be careful, you have to know what type\nof communications are going on because in\n\n414\n00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:54.290\ncertain scenarios you will\ncommunicate differently, right?\n\n415\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.550\nIf I'm sending a one-to-one\ncommunication between source and\n\n416\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.960\ndestination, I'm sending\na unicast message.\n\n417\n00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.260\nThere are times where we need to use IGMP,\nInternet group management protocol.\n\n418\n00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.990\nAnd what we end up doing is\nessentially the node is saying, hey,\n\n419\n00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.090\nI've got multicast group, sends the\ncommunication to the multicast address,\n\n420\n00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:18.170\nmakes the connectivity device aware\nthat there's a multicast group.\n\n421\n00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.810\nAnd then that connectivity device turns\naround and advertises the fact that hey,\n\n422\n00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.950\nthere's a multicast group out here,\nand if you want to join it,\n\n423\n00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.410\njust talk to me and\nI can get you that information, right?\n\n424\n00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.070\nAnd then, obviously the broadcast\nis one to everybody, and\n\n425\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.430\nwe really don't want,\nthere's times when we have to, right?\n\n426\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.020\nIt's not something that we can get around,\nright?\n\n427\n00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.590\nYou're not gonna eliminate broadcast\ncommunications until you go to IPv6 and\n\n428\n00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.730\nwe're all IPv6.\n\n429\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.245\nSee, IPv6 does away with broadcast.\n\n430\n00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:47.320\nThere's multicast, unicast and any cast.\n\n431\n00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.689\nThat's all, all right?\n\n432\n00:23:48.689 --> 00:23:50.888\nBecause we still have an IPv4,\n\n433\n00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:55.420\nwe have technologies that rely\non a multicast communication.\n\n434\n00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.780\nLike let me tell you specifically.\n\n435\n00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.950\nWe've talked in other episodes about ARP,\nthe Address Resolution Protocol, right.\n\n436\n00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:04.610\nAnd here's our ARP table here\non my Windows 10 machine.\n\n437\n00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.260\nRemember what's going on with arp.\n\n438\n00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.750\nRemember that it doesn't\nunderstand the IP address.\n\n439\n00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.580\nSo if I run ipconfig, right, and this is\nmy IP address for this windows 10 machine.\n\n440\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.520\nIf that the routers are passing\ninformation across themselves and\n\n441\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:26.280\nit gets to the destination network\nwhere my computer 10.10.10.10 resides,\n\n442\n00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.580\nIP is dumb it does not\nunderstand a MAC address.\n\n443\n00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.660\nSo what does it do?\n\n444\n00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.260\nIt hands it over to the address\nresolution protocol,\n\n445\n00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.212\nthe IP address, and says, man,\nI need your help, help me out here.\n\n446\n00:24:36.212 --> 00:24:40.410\nAnd then ARP, Address Resolution Protocol,\nturns around and sends a broadcast,\n\n447\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:44.016\nstands up in the table in\nthe food court and says.\n\n448\n00:24:44.016 --> 00:24:47.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Who has 10.10.10.10?\n\n449\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.870\nAnd then my computer is listening.\n\n450\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.720\nNow, all the other computers heard it,\ntoo,\n\n451\n00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.290\nbecause it was a broadcast communication.\n\n452\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.200\nBut they don't respond because\nthat's not their IP address.\n\n453\n00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.790\nAnd my computer sends an ARP\nresponse message back and says,\n\n454\n00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:02.770\nhey, tell old lazy IP out there\nthat you can find 10.10.10.10.\n\n455\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.391\nAnd then what it does is it\nturns around and it gives,\n\n456\n00:25:07.391 --> 00:25:13.073\nwell, my MAC address,\nif I rerun that ipconfig all.\n\n457\n00:25:13.073 --> 00:25:16.694\nI can spell,\nI cannot spell all today, Zach?\n\n458\n00:25:16.694 --> 00:25:17.917\n&gt;&gt; There's an a in it.\n\n459\n00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:18.820\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n460\n00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:23.800\nThen, it turns around and\nsays, hey, you can find this\n\n461\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.830\nIP address at this MAC address.\n\n462\n00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.690\nI'll get it right here eventually.\n\n463\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:30.760\nAt this MAC address.\n\n464\n00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.710\nWe'll get this right again.\n\n465\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.170\nHopefully you guys took your Dramamine\nout there, got your sea sickness going.\n\n466\n00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.080\nNow that's was ARP does.\n\n467\n00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.170\nIt says, hey, tell the router\nin this case, that 10.10.10.10\n\n468\n00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:46.300\nis at this MAC address, and then IP can\nfinish the delivery to the local network.\n\n469\n00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.620\nSo again, there are reasons you\nhave to know the characteristics,\n\n470\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.510\nthe properties, right?\n\n471\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.100\nCharacteristics, properties, I keep saying\nthem because they're interchangeable.\n\n472\n00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.510\nIt's not technical jargon that's\ngonna get you on the exam.\n\n473\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.200\nKnow those.\n\n474\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.900\nBut I will tell you that we've\ngot a little bit more to go and\n\n475\n00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.132\ndoesn't look like we have\nenough time in this episode.\n\n476\n00:26:02.132 --> 00:26:03.638\n&gt;&gt; Keep doing a wonderful job, Wes.\n\n477\n00:26:03.638 --> 00:26:05.470\nNetwork Traffic Properties, part one.\n\n478\n00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.320\nThere will be a part two.\n\n479\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.730\nMake sure you see both parts.\n\n480\n00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.940\nAnd see everything inside of COMPTIA Net\nPlus that Wes has put together for you.\n\n481\n00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.310\nAnd when you're in that

00:00:08.535\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:12.120\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.431\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.295\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:19.590\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net+,\n\n8\n00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.960\nand this is network traffic\nproperties part two.\n\n9\n00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.889\nAnd part one was great, but part two is\ngonna be even better, I'm telling you.\n\n10\n00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:29.089\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to give us\nall the information we need, Wes,\n\n11\n00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.062\ngood to see you again today.\n\n12\n00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:32.660\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back,\nhaving a lot of fun, that's right.\n\n13\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.595\nAnd there are some more characteristics,\nor just like Zach said, more properties\n\n14\n00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:39.814\nthat we need to be aware of when it\ncomes to network communications.\n\n15\n00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:42.731\nNow, if you didn't check out part one,\ndefinitely go check that out,\n\n16\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.531\nbecause it's really\ngonna set the stage for\n\n17\n00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:47.276\nsome of the concepts that we're\ngonna talk about in this episode.\n\n18\n00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:53.251\nWe talked about the communication types,\nunicast, broadcast, as well as multicast.\n\n19\n00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:56.250\nAnd then we talked a little bit about the\ndifference between a broadcast domain and\n\n20\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.688\na collision domain, right?\n\n21\n00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:00.630\nAnd that's gonna set us up for\nsome additional properties or\n\n22\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.095\ncharacteristics that we\nneed to be aware of.\n\n23\n00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:07.055\nAnd the very first one that I'd like\nto talk about is a whole bunch of\n\n24\n00:01:07.055 --> 00:01:09.337\nalphabet soup right off the bat here.\n\n25\n00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:13.932\nSo let's see if we can help you out\nwith this one, this is CSMA CD.\n\n26\n00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:16.609\nAll right, so\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n27\n00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.324\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see Zach over there.\n\n28\n00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:20.593\n&gt;&gt; Let me officially ask it,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n29\n00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:23.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can see Zach going,\nmy gosh, what is that?\n\n30\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.630\nThat is carrier sense multiple\naccess collision detection.\n\n31\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.963\nAnd what we mean now, and\nlet's step back for a second, and\n\n32\n00:01:30.963 --> 00:01:35.314\ndo like we like to do here with Net+ if\nthis is the first time, and even in A+.\n\n33\n00:01:35.314 --> 00:01:38.950\nBreak down these acronyms and kind of\nlook at each individual word here, right?\n\n34\n00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.050\nSo we can kind of get a good\ngrasp of what's going on.\n\n35\n00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.060\nCarrier sense, all right,\nwell, what's the carrier,\n\n36\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870\nthe carrier's essentially the network,\nright?\n\n37\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.470\nCarrier sense, if you will,\nit's sensing, is the network available?\n\n38\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.692\nMultiple access, and\n\n39\n00:01:53.692 --> 00:01:57.430\nI might have said media access\nbecause we gotta be careful with that.\n\n40\n00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.800\nIt's carrier sense multiple if I did,\n\n41\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.860\nmultiple access is what\nit's supposed to be.\n\n42\n00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.430\nSo think of it, carrier sense,\ncan we we sense the network, and\n\n43\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.350\nmultiple access,\nmore than one node accessing the network.\n\n44\n00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.100\nAnd then the last part,\nCD, collision detection.\n\n45\n00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.140\nRemember, one of the things that I told\nyou is that in the first part of this\n\n46\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.472\nepisode, I said that if you have\ncomputers that are on the same\n\n47\n00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:25.690\nEthernet-based network, cuz it's\na contention-based media access, right?\n\n48\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.460\nAgain, we have multiple computers striving\nto send their information, contending,\n\n49\n00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.210\nif you will, competing to send their\ninformation out over the wire.\n\n50\n00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.581\nThe coalition detection part is\nthat they could be made aware.\n\n51\n00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:41.734\nOne of the things that I also\nsaid is that the connectivity\n\n52\n00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.623\ndevices don't have to have\na lot more logic in them,\n\n53\n00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:48.970\njust because the devices themselves could\nkinda duke it out and battle it out.\n\n54\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.436\nThat's what brought the price point for\n\n55\n00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:55.502\nEthernet communications compared\nto deterministic media down,\n\n56\n00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:59.577\nwhich is also one of the reasons\nthat it became so popular, right?\n\n57\n00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:03.949\nNow, how do they do that, when we say\ncarrier sense multiple access collision\n\n58\n00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.380\ndetection, how does that process work?\n\n59\n00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.060\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's take you through a few steps here\n\n60\n00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.080\nthat I've got kinda laid out for you and\nwe'll take a look at that all right?\n\n61\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.410\nSo we've got a couple of computers here,\ncarrier sense, what are they doing?\n\n62\n00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.770\nI am listening, and do we see data,\n\n63\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.118\nI don't know why I got a question\nmark there, but I am listening.\n\n64\n00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:25.706\nNo data is being been transmitted, right?\n\n65\n00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.335\nFirst, you gotta sense, is the media\nthere, is it even available, right?\n\n66\n00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.920\nThat's when we get things like our\nlink lights on our adapters, right?\n\n67\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.160\nYou plug it in, there's a link light,\nyou don't have to have activity.\n\n68\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.020\nIf you have no activity,\nmeans you're not sending any information.\n\n69\n00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.477\nBut the link light's there,\nwe can sense that the media is available.\n\n70\n00:03:41.477 --> 00:03:44.730\nWell, I'm listening out,\nis there data being transmitted?\n\n71\n00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.430\nWell, I don't hear anything,\nwell, you know what?\n\n72\n00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.600\nThere could be another computer\ndoing the same thing, and again,\n\n73\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.740\nI don't know why I got\nthe question marks in there.\n\n74\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.167\nSo, we'll fix our slide on the fly,\ncuz that never goes wrong, right?\n\n75\n00:03:55.167 --> 00:04:00.920\n[LAUGH] I'm listening, and I don't hear\nthat there's any data being transmitted.\n\n76\n00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.950\nSo guess what, we're gonna go ahead,\nand first computer says,\n\n77\n00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.080\nI'm gonna transmit my information.\n\n78\n00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.978\nGuess what happens to the second computer?\n\n79\n00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:13.350\nThe second computer says,\nI'm gonna transmit my information.\n\n80\n00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.730\nWell, now we've got a problem, remember,\n\n81\n00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.620\nwhen we've got two computers that are\nsending information across the same shared\n\n82\n00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.860\nmedium at the same time,\nthis is where we get a collision.\n\n83\n00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.066\nNow here is something that's kinda,\nI wanna say magical,\n\n84\n00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.934\nnothing in computing is magical.\n\n85\n00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:32.410\nNothing in computing happens unless they\nprogram it that way, nothing is magical.\n\n86\n00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.011\nRight, I don't care what,\nSteve Jobs says, right,\n\n87\n00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:41.025\nthis is actually kind of the cool part,\nright?\n\n88\n00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:43.739\nAnd this is the fact that when\nthe collision is detected, you say,\n\n89\n00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:46.630\nwell, wait a second, Wes,\nhow's the collision detected?\n\n90\n00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:53.040\nWell, remember, we send the electrical\ncommunication down the same shared medium.\n\n91\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.710\nIt's going to collide, and\nit's going to bounce back to the sources\n\n92\n00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.430\nof the communication in\nthe form of a fragmented frame.\n\n93\n00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.555\nAnd they're gonna see that,\nthey're gonna detect that,\n\n94\n00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.815\nhence why we call it collision detection.\n\n95\n00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:09.043\nThey're gonna detect that,\n\n96\n00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:12.695\nand what they're gonna do is, they're\ngonna wait a random back off period.\n\n97\n00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:15.637\nNow, I know it's programmed\nin there somehow,\n\n98\n00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:18.669\nI don't exactly know what\nthe back off period is.\n\n99\n00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.035\nAnd understand, we're not in an electrical\nor a network engineering class here.\n\n100\n00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:26.120\nWe're taking a Net+ exam,\nthey're not gonna want you to know that.\n\n101\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.830\nBut just understand,\nthey wait a back off period, right?\n\n102\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.270\nAnd once that back off period is reached,\nthey re-transmit the information.\n\n103\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.335\nNow, what happens is,\nif they wait a back off period, right,\n\n104\n00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:44.497\nthey randomize it to try to make sure,\nand it's pseudorandom.\n\n105\n00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:49.160\nThey pseudorandomize it so\nthat we don't send it at the same time.\n\n106\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.937\nAll right, well if it happens,\nwhich it can, if it happens again,\n\n107\n00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:55.339\nthey're gonna adjust that back off time.\n\n108\n00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.339\nAnd they keep adjusting that back off\ntime, and the thought process is,\n\n109\n00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.536\nif you have two trains going down the same\ntracks, it's kinda like when they\n\n110\n00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:07.690\nswitch the gates open, right, and\nthey kind of veer off to the side there.\n\n111\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.290\nWe're hoping that the tracks have\nswitched, and we've got a side rail here.\n\n112\n00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.080\nBasically, what's going on is, they're\ntrying to eliminate those collisions.\n\n113\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.560\nNow, that's collision detection,\nwe see that this media access method,\n\n114\n00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.470\nand it's inside of your\nEthernet-based networks.\n\n115\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.297\nNow today,\n\n116\n00:06:25.297 --> 00:06:30.773\nI do want you to understand that every\ncomputer is plugged into a switch today.\n\n117\n00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:34.608\nWe've pretty much eliminated the hubs,\nhowever,\n\n118\n00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:38.190\nI want you to know that\nwe still have collisions.\n\n119\n00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.530\nAnd how can we have collisions,\n\n120\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.070\ncuz there are broadcast\ncommunications that can happen.\n\n121\n00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.580\nThe more broadcast\ncommunications you have,\n\n122\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.270\nthe more potential there is for\na collision to happen.\n\n123\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.600\nIt just happens, so don't think\nthat you eliminated it altogether.\n\n124\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.410\nBut it is greatly reduced\nbecause of the fact that,\n\n125\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.880\nagain, each computer now is\non its own collision domain.\n\n126\n00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.420\nBut it doesn't mean that they're on their\nown, they're still within a broadcast\n\n127\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.670\ndomain, like we talked about in\nthe first episode, so do know that.\n\n128\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.440\nKnow that this is associated with 802.3,\nremember,\n\n129\n00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.660\n802.3 is the IEEE's formal standardization\nfor the Ethernet technology.\n\n130\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.176\nAnd then all of its amendments and\nderivatives thereafter, all right?\n\n131\n00:07:20.176 --> 00:07:22.580\nSo that's how we do it on a wired network,\n\n132\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.280\nthe next one we gotta talk about is\nin a wireless communication, right?\n\n133\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.820\nWireless communications,\nremember, are unbounded media,\n\n134\n00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.810\nwe do not have the bounds of\na physical cable, all right?\n\n135\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:36.683\nSo we have some good things and\nwe have some bad things, right.\n\n136\n00:07:36.683 --> 00:07:39.835\nOne of the good things is when you have\nthe limitations of your physical cable,\n\n137\n00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.960\nand you can go to wireless,\nyou can get around that.\n\n138\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.110\nOne of the bad things is that\nwhen a collision happens,\n\n139\n00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.512\nit doesn't bounce back to the source,\nit's not a shared cable, right?\n\n140\n00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:56.736\nSo we can't really detect whether\na collision has happened.\n\n141\n00:07:56.736 --> 00:08:03.528\nSo CSMA CD, or collision detection\nDoesn't work in a wireless network.\n\n142\n00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:07.920\nSo what they did is they came\nup with another type of CSMA.\n\n143\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.770\nStill the same thing on the first part,\nguys and\n\n144\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.600\ngals out there, don't let that fool you,\ncarrier sense multiple access.\n\n145\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.890\nBut now it's CA,\nit's collision avoidance, all right?\n\n146\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.700\nNow, be very clear on this one.\n\n147\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.260\nThe goal is collision avoidance, right?\n\n148\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.840\nThat's how we, Zack and I, drive to work\nin the morning trying to get here to our\n\n149\n00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.280\njob where our goal is to\ntry to avoid a collision.\n\n150\n00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.830\nBut on the way into work,\n\n151\n00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.050\nyou see people that have\nunfortunately have collided, right?\n\n152\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.670\nSo the goal is to avoid collisions, right?\n\n153\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.631\nSo let's talk a little bit about CSMACA,\n\n154\n00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:43.941\nCSMACA you make sure I\nget that acronym right.\n\n155\n00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.840\nCarrier Sense Multiple\nAccess Collision Avoidance.\n\n156\n00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.480\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at our diagram here.\n\n157\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.560\nNow, it's a little bit different here,\nall right.\n\n158\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.020\nSo we still have a carrier sense,\nand I could say that,\n\n159\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.840\nhey, is the media present, right?\n\n160\n00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.085\nYou see, you still have that\ncarrier sense that has to go on.\n\n161\n00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.045\nIs the network there?\n\n162\n00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:00.930\nIs the media present?\n\n163\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.700\nIn this case, the media is\nunbounded radiated energy, but\n\n164\n00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.770\nthe network is there, right?\n\n165\n00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:12.110\nAnd when a device senses that media and\nsenses that it's there, it signals\n\n166\n00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.790\nits intent to the rest of the network and\nsays I've got information to send.\n\n167\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.000\nThat's in the form of what's\nknown as a jam signal, all right?\n\n168\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.330\nAnd the other computer that's within\near shot says, yeah, I heard that.\n\n169\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.940\nYou've got data to send me,\nlike Zach saying,\n\n170\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.480\nraising his hand in class if\nwe were in class together.\n\n171\n00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.000\nYeah, Zach, okya, you've got something to\nsay, everybody else hold off for a second,\n\n172\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.940\nincluding the teacher or whoever is in\nthe front of the class at that time,\n\n173\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.940\njust hold on.\n\n174\n00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.120\nZach has the floor, right?\n\n175\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.800\nThat's kind of how the jam signal works,\nright?\n\n176\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.170\nAnd then the data is going to\nbe transmitted, all right?\n\n177\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.040\nNow, here is the thing that can happen,\nall right?\n\n178\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.306\nHere's one of the reasons I say the goal\nis collision avoidance, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:56.306 --> 00:09:59.650\nI tell you what,\nwe're gonna use this analogy.\n\n180\n00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.170\nZach, you and I, we go out to Ben Griffon\nStadium here in Gainesville, right, and\n\n181\n00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.480\nwe're standing literally on\nthe football field, right?\n\n182\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.800\nI'm on one side of the 100 yards,\nyou're on the other side of the 100 yards,\n\n183\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.200\nwe're both in the end zones or whatever\non the opposite sides of the field.\n\n184\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.110\nI want you to image that we have somebody\nright in the middle of the field.\n\n185\n00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:23.240\nWe represent these devices here,\nClient 1 and Client 2, all right?\n\n186\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.700\nThe person that's in the middle of the\nfield represent's the access point, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.300\nNow, there is a good chance that if I\nwas one side of the field and Zach was\n\n188\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.360\non the other side field, and I said hey\nZach I've got information I gotta send.\n\n189\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.170\nThat Zach wouldn't be in ear shot and\ncouldn't hear me say I have data to send.\n\n190\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.270\nJust like on the other side of the field I\ndidn't hear Zach say I have data to send.\n\n191\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.950\nNobody seen us raise our hands, right?\n\n192\n00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.050\nWe're too far away from\neach other to hear that.\n\n193\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.210\nSo we both send information at the same\ntime, and a collision happens.\n\n194\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.620\nBut here's the problem.\n\n195\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.810\nThere's no way to detect it.\n\n196\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.370\nIt doesn't bounce back,\nit just, whatever it does,\n\n197\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.600\ngoes off into electrical limbo, right?\n\n198\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.440\nIt's gone.\n\n199\n00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.780\nSo we're having collisions.\n\n200\n00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.690\nAgain, the goal is to avoid collisions,\nbut\n\n201\n00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.760\nit doesn't mean that it wouldn't happen.\n\n202\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.840\nSo they knew that,\nthey knew that there was a potential.\n\n203\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.050\nWhat this does is create what's\nknown as the hidden node phenomenon,\n\n204\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.320\nand that's where there's a node out\nthere saying I've got information.\n\n205\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.460\nSending a jam signal, nobody can hear him.\n\n206\n00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.320\nOr her whatever, all right?\n\n207\n00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.670\nNobody can hear that device, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.540\nSo what they did is they came up,\nsay again no detection of a collision,\n\n209\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.410\nwe think everything's good, right?\n\n210\n00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.250\nWe can't detect it.\n\n211\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.840\nWe think everything's good.\n\n212\n00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.440\nAnd so they came up with a kind of\n\n213\n00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.100\na way to try to get away around\nthis hidden node syndrome.\n\n214\n00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.200\nAnd that's something know as\na RTS CTS signal, all right?\n\n215\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.150\nNow, again, I know another acronym, and\nI'm not sure if they're going to ask you\n\n216\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.040\nthis on the exam, but if they do,\nyou'll be prepared for it, right?\n\n217\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.480\nSo what does a RTS CTS signal stand for?\n\n218\n00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.330\nWell, RTS is request to send.\n\n219\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.590\nLet's go back to the analogy of being\non the 100 yard on a football field,\n\n220\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:09.850\nall right?\n\n221\n00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.505\nNow, imagine Zach can't hear\nme communicating saying\n\n222\n00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:16.845\nhey Zach I've got data to send, or\nhey network I've got data to send.\n\n223\n00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:17.535\nAnd I can't, for\n\n224\n00:12:17.535 --> 00:12:22.315\nwhatever reason, I can't hear Zach saying\nhey network I've got data to send.\n\n225\n00:12:22.315 --> 00:12:25.355\nBut wouldn't it be nice if we could talk\nto the person that's sitting right in\n\n226\n00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:30.450\nthe middle of the field and\nsay hey anybody else sending information?\n\n227\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.970\nI need to send some information.\n\n228\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.560\nBecause the person in the middle\nof the field can hear Zach.\n\n229\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.426\nAnd the person in the middle\nof the field can hear me.\n\n230\n00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:38.590\nWe can't hear each other.\n\n231\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.040\nBut if I ask that person, hey can I talk?\n\n232\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.860\nAnd that person says Zach\nis talking right now.\n\n233\n00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.460\nOkay, I'm not clear to send,\nI got to hold off for a sec.\n\n234\n00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.090\nAnd then I request to transmit again,\nright?\n\n235\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.540\nAnd then finally, the access point\nof the person in the middle says,\n\n236\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.900\nyeah, I can hear Zach and Zach is okay.\n\n237\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.150\nThe network is quiet, go ahead and send.\n\n238\n00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.773\nAnd what it does is it says hey Zach,\nWes is sending information.\n\n239\n00:13:05.773 --> 00:13:08.810\nYou need to stop right now,\njust hold off, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.010\nHe's got his hand raised in the classroom.\n\n241\n00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.030\nAnd it sends me back the CTS\nsignal that says clear to send,\n\n242\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.900\nyou're clear to transmit your information.\n\n243\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.930\nSo request to send, clear to send, or\n\n244\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.930\nrequest to send, hold your horses somebody\nelse is sending, however it might work.\n\n245\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.940\nAnd that kind of helps to eliminate or\nto to combat that hidden node syndrome.\n\n246\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.020\nThat is Carrier Sense Multiple\nAccess Collision Avoidance.\n\n247\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.840\nThe goal is to avoid avoid collisions.\n\n248\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.420\nNow, I'm gonna get a little bit specific\nhere, specifications, technical jargon.\n\n249\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.500\nKnow that that's for your 802.11 networks\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n250\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.646\nWhere do we see CSMACA?\n\n251\n00:13:48.646 --> 00:13:52.600\nWe see that in our wireless networks.\n\n252\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.800\nRemember the IEEEs?\n\n253\n00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.866\nFormal standardization of\nwireless communications,\n\n254\n00:13:56.866 --> 00:14:00.403\nwireless local area network\ncommunications is 802.11.\n\n255\n00:14:00.403 --> 00:14:05.837\nRemember that your CSMACD collision\ndetection is what the 802.3 or\n\n256\n00:14:05.837 --> 00:14:09.500\nEthernet based wired networks use,\nall right?\n\n257\n00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.502\nAnd it is important to\nunderstand the 802 designations,\n\n258\n00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:18.040\nand the reason I say that is cuz\nyou have to learn the jargon.\n\n259\n00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.840\nI don't know,\n\n260\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.411\nI couldn't tell you which question they're\ngonna give you on the exam, I'm not sure.\n\n261\n00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:27.846\nSo if you understand the concepts,\nyou understand that that's associated with\n\n262\n00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:32.736\nEthernet, and by association you know that\nEthernet is 802.3, they might give you\n\n263\n00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:37.060\na question that says which of these\nmedia access methods does 802.3 use?\n\n264\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.111\nAnd you have to say, well,\nI know 802.3 is Ethernet,\n\n265\n00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:46.160\nand I know Ethernet uses\ncollision detection.\n\n266\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.890\nSo you see how it's more of those\npieces of the puzzle, and it's gonna\n\n267\n00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.780\nhelp you do pretty good on the exam if you\ncan start to put more of these concepts.\n\n268\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.130\nI understand that when you look at\nthe objectives its like somebody taking\n\n269\n00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.373\na 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle and\nthrowing it on the table and\n\n270\n00:15:02.373 --> 00:15:04.580\nyou gotta try to make\nsome sense out of it.\n\n271\n00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.270\nWell, you don't have to understand\nthe whole picture right away, right?\n\n272\n00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.210\nYou don't even have to know what the\npicture is, but you can start to flip over\n\n273\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.640\nthe individual pieces and then we can\nhelp you put those pieces together so\n\n274\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.240\nyou can sit back and look and realize,\nthat picture's a network, and\n\n275\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.240\nthis is what we do to put it together,\nright?\n\n276\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.730\nSo we do have to know some\nof those individual pieces.\n\n277\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.530\nAll right, now, we've got some other\nthings that we need to be aware of, too.\n\n278\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:33.270\nAnd one of the things that we have to\nbe aware of is what are known as PDUs.\n\n279\n00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:38.330\nAll right, when we talk about a PDU,\na PDU is a protocol data unit,\n\n280\n00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.630\nand it is important to understand\nwhat protocol data units are, PDUs.\n\n281\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:46.926\nNow, this goes right\nback to our OSI model.\n\n282\n00:15:46.926 --> 00:15:52.052\nSo you do have to know, again,\nI say sometimes we're trying to\n\n283\n00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:57.955\nsteer away from those theory concepts,\nbut You're going to see more and\n\n284\n00:15:57.955 --> 00:16:03.566\nmore that OSI model just keeps creeping\nup it never seems to go away and\n\n285\n00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:07.250\nit always, always seems to come back.\n\n286\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.240\nSo, with the protocol data unit I want\nyou to think of well a couple of things.\n\n287\n00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.500\nOne of the things that I want you to\nthink of is again that OSI model.\n\n288\n00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.520\nAnd when we look at the OSI model,\nyou will remember and in fact,\n\n289\n00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.130\nI've got my slide here up.\n\n290\n00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.810\nLet's look at the OSI model rather\nthan just sit here and talk about it.\n\n291\n00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.360\nYou remember the OSI model and\nif you haven't seen that episode,\n\n292\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.460\ncheck the OSI model out\nbecause it's important.\n\n293\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.380\nRemember we have the different layers.\n\n294\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:38.796\nWe've talked about the different devices\nthat operate at the different layers and\n\n295\n00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:41.590\nthen we also talked about encapsulation.\n\n296\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:50.720\nWell encapsulation is really\na upper level service layer.\n\n297\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.910\nHanding its information down to a lower\nlayer and that lower layer puts it and\n\n298\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.682\nwraps it in that container.\n\n299\n00:16:56.682 --> 00:17:00.070\nKind of like the onion pees that\nwe talked about in that episode or\n\n300\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.800\nthose Russian dolls.\n\n301\n00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.080\nA smaller doll's put into a larger\ncontainer, put into a larger container,\n\n302\n00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.970\nfinally until you've got one big doll.\n\n303\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:17.390\nWell, a protocol data unit is\nlet's take the session layer here.\n\n304\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.170\nSo the session layer is going to require\nthe services of the transport layer,\n\n305\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.600\nwe have our physical data link\nnetwork transport session.\n\n306\n00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.960\nWhen that session layer is done with the\ninformation that it's encapsulating from\n\n307\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.560\nthe higher layers, it creates what's\nknown an SDU that's a Service Data Unit.\n\n308\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.470\nIt means I got my data session layer,\nI'm done with what I need to do and\n\n309\n00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:48.970\nnow I need to send my information down and\nrely on the transport layer to do its job.\n\n310\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.820\nSo it's requesting the service\nof the lower layer.\n\n311\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.360\nThat's how the OSI model works.\n\n312\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:02.390\nWhen it passes down its service data units\nthe transport header encapsulates it,\n\n313\n00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.540\nadd its bit of information\nbasically doing its job.\n\n314\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.580\nWell, that becomes what's\nknown as transport layers PDU,\n\n315\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.400\na Protocol Data Unit.\n\n316\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.240\nSo it receives, from an upper layer,\nand this is how it works,\n\n317\n00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.790\nit receives the service data\nunit from the session layer.\n\n318\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:28.690\nIt does it's job, it encapsulates it, and\nthat becomes it's protocol data unit.\n\n319\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.690\nBut now it needs to rely\non the layer before it, so\n\n320\n00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:37.680\nnow it's going to require\nthe services of a lower layer.\n\n321\n00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.220\nAnd what it's gonna do\nnow as it has its own\n\n322\n00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.300\nSDU because it says hey my\nprotocol data unit is here.\n\n323\n00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.010\nI've added my information, and now I need\nto send this down to the network layer.\n\n324\n00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.870\nAnd when it does,\n\n325\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:54.750\nit requests the services of the lower\nlayer that's a service data unit.\n\n326\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.920\nNow when the network, and you can kinda\nsee that this just keeps happening.\n\n327\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.050\nNow that the service data unit,\nit's going to be passed down,\n\n328\n00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.770\nif you will, from the transport\nlayer to the network layer.\n\n329\n00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:12.400\nAnd the network layer is gonna put its\ninformation, encapsulate its information,\n\n330\n00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.350\non the transport layers data.\n\n331\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.260\nAnd that becomes, well,\nthe network layers PDU.\n\n332\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.440\nNow that it's prepared its information,\n\n333\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.420\nit's done its job, it's gonna rely\non the services of a lower layer.\n\n334\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.320\nSo now, it has its SDU.\n\n335\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.440\nIt says, hey, I've got my information,\nmy PDU, my protocol data units there,\n\n336\n00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.170\nnow I'm requiring the services\nof the layer below me.\n\n337\n00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.530\nSo here's my service data unit and\nit keeps doing that, and\n\n338\n00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.870\nit goes down the stack.\n\n339\n00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.710\nNow and that's what they mean\nby going down the stack,\n\n340\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.420\nyou can see how these\nlayers stack on each other.\n\n341\n00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.120\nThe last thing that happens,\n\n342\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:56.090\nwell second to last thing that happens is\nthat the data link layer, what does it do?\n\n343\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.640\nIt encapsulates the entire\nstacks information into a frame.\n\n344\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.510\nThat's why we talk about switches,\nthey work with frames.\n\n345\n00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.014\n&gt;&gt; Work with frames.\n\n346\n00:20:04.014 --> 00:20:08.860\n&gt;&gt; So the frame now is the data links PDU.\n\n347\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.530\nAnd then the data link layer and\nmore specifically,\n\n348\n00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:17.180\nthrough that MAC sublayer of the data link\nlayer [LAUGH], I know this gets confusing.\n\n349\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.180\nHopefully it's making a little sense here.\n\n350\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.620\nSays all right, now I'm ready to put\nthe information out on the physical wire.\n\n351\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:32.101\nSo at the physical wire or\nat the physical layer\n\n352\n00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:38.130\nlast layer of the OSI model,\nwe get its PDU.\n\n353\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.520\nNow what are the PDUs?\n\n354\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.210\nThey have names and\nI want you to be aware of that.\n\n355\n00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.030\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n356\n00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:49.952\nI gotta little diagram here and I want you\nto know the different protocol data units.\n\n357\n00:20:49.952 --> 00:20:52.310\nNow, I've got a little\nmnemonic that will help you.\n\n358\n00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.390\nWe'll talk about this\nmnemonic here in a second.\n\n359\n00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.550\nDon't worry about it.\n\n360\n00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.310\nThe protocol units are not called\nSome People Fear Birthdays.\n\n361\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.860\nWe'll get there in a second.\n\n362\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.760\nThat's a little mnemonic.\n\n363\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.180\n&gt;&gt; I fear birthdays all the time.\n\n364\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.928\n&gt;&gt; We fear birthdays as we get older,\nJack.\n\n365\n00:21:05.928 --> 00:21:06.854\nRight?\n\n366\n00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:11.020\n[LAUGH] So, let's look at the layers.\n\n367\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.000\nWhen we talk about layers 5\nthrough 7 It's just called data,\n\n368\n00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.960\nbecause at this point,\nremember that's the application block.\n\n369\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.330\nAnd it's just preparing your data, to put\non the network so we can start to move it,\n\n370\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.815\nso it's not until you get to layer four,\nthat they start to talk about the PDUs.\n\n371\n00:21:26.815 --> 00:21:32.102\nIn the protocol data unit for\nanything above that is just called data.\n\n372\n00:21:32.102 --> 00:21:35.405\nBut I want you to think about\nwhat is happening at layer four.\n\n373\n00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:39.735\nTransmission control protocol is starting\nto segment your data and do sequencing.\n\n374\n00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:43.915\nWell, protocol data units,\nthat encapsulation\n\n375\n00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:48.285\nwhen the transport layer receives it,\nit encapsulates it into a segment.\n\n376\n00:21:48.285 --> 00:21:50.027\nThat's it's protocol data unit.\n\n377\n00:21:50.027 --> 00:21:54.460\nNow, when it's finished its job,\nand now it\n\n378\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.530\nneeds the services of the network layer,\nit takes it data service unit and it\n\n379\n00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.680\nbasically sends all of that encapsulated\ninformation down to the next layer.\n\n380\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.190\nAnd the next layer wraps it in a packet.\n\n381\n00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.170\nAnd that's layer 3, the network layer,\n\n382\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:11.530\nif you will,\nit's PDU is going to be a packet.\n\n383\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.310\nThen we get down to the data link layer,\nwhere our switches operate.\n\n384\n00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.480\nAnd the data link layer\nencapsulates everything in a frame.\n\n385\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.160\nThat's it's protocol data unit.\n\n386\n00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.080\nLast but not least, at the physical layer,\n\n387\n00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.630\nthis is where we get\nthe raw electrical pulses.\n\n388\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.010\nWe get the bits,\nthe binary bits, ones and zeros.\n\n389\n00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.900\nSo at layer 1,\nthe physical layer of the OSI model,\n\n390\n00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.250\nwe have what's known as just a bit.\n\n391\n00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:41.450\nSo those are the four, you can say five\nif you wanna talk about data itself.\n\n392\n00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:42.590\nBut I wouldn't worry about that.\n\n393\n00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.330\nI never wanna say that.\n\n394\n00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.490\nI gotta stop saying that.\n\n395\n00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.420\nAlways worry about it, but if you can\nremember data from five through seven,\n\n396\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.700\nyou'll be doing good.\n\n397\n00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.250\nNow, to remember the other ones.\n\n398\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.960\nFour to one use the mnemonics,\nsome people fear birthdays.\n\n399\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.740\n&gt;&gt; Aah,\nI see the gist of your gib there, sir.\n\n400\n00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:57.420\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n\n401\n00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.350\n&gt;&gt; And it'll make it a little bit\neasier if you need to remember, hm,\n\n402\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.150\nwhich one is which on the exam.\n\n403\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.020\nSo know your protocol data units.\n\n404\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.150\nNow the last thing I have to talk\nabout is what is known as an MTU.\n\n405\n00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.280\nAnd when we talk about an MTU that's a\nvery important characteristic or property\n\n406\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.805\nof you're network communications and\nit's called a Maximum Transmission Units.\n\n407\n00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:30.110\nI want you to think about, let's think\nabout we're flying in an airplane right.\n\n408\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.230\nI said that I was gonna take two\nbags when I showed up to the airport\n\n409\n00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.560\nI have five bags.\n\n410\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.530\nWe're not gonna say that you can pay more\nmoney and you could bring those bags.\n\n411\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.410\nWhat would you have to do\n\n412\n00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.360\nif you said hey I'm not gonna pay\nanymore money for those bags.\n\n413\n00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.470\nLeave them.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to leave them, right?\n\n414\n00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:46.420\nYou drop them off.\n\n415\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.926\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n416\n00:23:46.926 --> 00:23:52.142\n&gt;&gt; Well an MTU kind of works like that\nin the fact a Maximum Transmission Unit\n\n417\n00:23:52.142 --> 00:23:57.101\nis defined by the maximum amount of\ninformation that can be in a single\n\n418\n00:23:57.101 --> 00:24:01.740\nFrame across the ethernet link and\nacross the network, right.\n\n419\n00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.630\nHow do we know what the MTU is?\n\n420\n00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.220\nWell, your operating system typically\nsets the maximum transmission unit and\n\n421\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:13.460\nthen it's your system administrators, your\nnetwork administrators that set the MTU,\n\n422\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.520\nmaximum transmission unit for\na link on a connectivity device itself.\n\n423\n00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:23.000\nBut different scenarios require different\nMTUs, but I want you to know for\n\n424\n00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.390\nyour exam,\nthe default MTU on an ethernet network or\n\n425\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.380\na, yeah, an ethernet based netwrk\nis going to be 1500 bytes.\n\n426\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.280\nAll right?\nNow,\n\n427\n00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.730\nthere are scenarios where that changes.\n\n428\n00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:41.270\nWhen you go over into some of\nthe other episodes that Zach and\n\n429\n00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.920\nI have recorded here in Network+, you're\ngonna learn about jumbo frames, right?\n\n430\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.990\nWhere you can increase the MTU\nup to 9,000 bytes, all right?\n\n431\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.220\nThere's goods and\nthere's bads with that, right?\n\n432\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.690\nI want you to think about it.\n\n433\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:58.820\nIf I have 1,500 bytes, I receive 1,500,\nall right I have to check, inspect,\n\n434\n00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.650\nI guess it gets a little redundant, I have\nto inspect a frame check sum sequence.\n\n435\n00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.850\nI have to check a frame\ncheck sum sequence.\n\n436\n00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:07.250\n&gt;&gt; Check that check sum.\n\n437\n00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.520\n&gt;&gt; That's right I gotta\ncheck that check sum.\n\n438\n00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.380\nSo that the FCS is at\nthe end of the frame,\n\n439\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.690\nremember how our switches typically work.\n\n440\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:20.700\nMost common is a store and forward,\nreceive the whole entire frame, inspect,\n\n441\n00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.620\nif you will, the FCS,\nthe Frame Checksum Sequence,\n\n442\n00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.450\nwhich is just a little, CRC32 value,\nCyclic Redundancy Check.\n\n443\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:31.880\nAnd we inspect it, and\nthe frame has maintained it's integrity,\n\n444\n00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.095\nthen the switch forwards its on.\n\n445\n00:25:33.095 --> 00:25:34.880\nThat;s why they call it store and forward.\n\n446\n00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.012\nAlright, now, if I inspect 1,500 bytes,\nthen 1,500 bytes,\n\n447\n00:25:40.012 --> 00:25:44.670\nthen 1,500 bytes,\nversus 9,000 bytes all at one time.\n\n448\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.860\nWell, you might say well wait a second,\n\n449\n00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.670\nI can say with jumbo frames might\nincrease the speed of your network.\n\n450\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.060\nYes, they could.\n\n451\n00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.460\nBut I also want you to think about what\nif the frame checksum sequence on a 9,000\n\n452\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.518\nbyte frame is checked and\nthere's one bit that's bad in it?\n\n453\n00:25:58.518 --> 00:26:04.206\nAn entire 9,000 bytes is thrown out\nversus 1,500 bytes being throw and\n\n454\n00:26:04.206 --> 00:26:06.810\njust resend that 1,500 bytes.\n\n455\n00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.560\nSo it does have the potential\nto speed up your network, but\n\n456\n00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.270\nit also means you're gonna throw a lot\nmore information away if there's an error.\n\n457\n00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.430\nSo again, it's always a give and take.\n\n458\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.340\nThere are other scenarios too, and\nthis goes well beyond the exam and\n\n459\n00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.500\nthe scope of this exam, but you'll learn\nas you go on to other advanced training,\n\n460\n00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:25.100\nlike for instance,\nin configuring DNSSec, right?\n\n461\n00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.420\nDNS security.\n\n462\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.280\nAll right, a standard EDP DNS query,\nlike we talked about in DNS,\n\n463\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.140\nwhen I need a name resolution.\n\n464\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.190\nI have a name, I need a,\nwhat's the IP address?\n\n465\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.260\nAnd I send that query out to DNS server.\n\n466\n00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.360\nThat's 512 bytes.\n\n467\n00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.200\nWell under the MTU.\n\n468\n00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.800\nNo problem, right?\n\n469\n00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.530\nIf you're using DNS sec you could\nhave a response that comes back\n\n470\n00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.965\nfrom the server that's up to 4096 bytes.\n\n471\n00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.780\nWhich means I could cause you problems,\nit's like that packet being or that frame,\n\n472\n00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.430\nexcuse me, being delivered back to you,\nand it hits the connectivity device and\n\n473\n00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.700\nit's like the airport.\n\n474\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.450\nYou got extra bags, you're not paying for\nthem, guess what we're gonna do,\n\n475\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.290\nwe're gonna throw it out.\n\n476\n00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.280\nSo you need to understand what the MTU is.\n\n477\n00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.340\nNow I will tell you,\nin fact, let's go ahead and\n\n478\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.470\ndive back into our Windows machine here.\n\n479\n00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.690\nAnd let me log back in, it looks like I\ntimed out, and you can actually see this,\n\n480\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:18.390\nanother command and I don't see this\ncommand much in the objectives.\n\n481\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.960\nBut I will throw it out there\njust in case they ask you about,\n\n482\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.700\nit's called network shell,\nwe call it netsh, net shell.\n\n483\n00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.710\nIt's the way you can interact with\na network stack inside of Windows.\n\n484\n00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:32.906\nSo you can do netsh, you do interface, and\n\n485\n00:27:32.906 --> 00:27:39.570\nipv4 show interface and\n\n486\n00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.320\nwe can actually see that the operating\nsystem is setting the MTU right?\n\n487\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.320\nSo the MTU is set by the operating system\nand then it's peaked and tweaked according\n\n488\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.750\nto whatever the administrator wants across\nthe switch or across that link itself.\n\n489\n00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.720\nSo there are other occasions\nwhere you might exceed,\n\n490\n00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.250\nas far as the connectivity device goes.\n\n491\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:02.160\nIn your networks you might\nexceed the 1,500 byte MTU, and\n\n492\n00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.400\nthat's when we talk about VLANs,\ncuz VLANs adds a tagging unit\n\n493\n00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.930\nto it that could potentially grow\nthat just beyond 1,500 bytes.\n\n494\n00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.890\nYou'll learn more about that as you\ngo onto things like CISCO training.\n\n495\n00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.190\nThere's another way that\nyou can look at it.\n\n496\n00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.350\nYou can run that also and instead of doing\ninterface, if you wanted you could do\n\n497\n00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.760\nsubinterface and it just kinda rearranges\nit a little bit different, but\n\n498\n00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.770\nyou can see that it's 1,500 bytes, right?\n\n499\n00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.090\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll do another one here.\n\n500\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.310\nLet me go ahead and\nbring up my terminal on the Mac OS here.\n\n501\n00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:31.350\nAnd you all could see\nthat one likewise too.\n\n502\n00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:36.830\nSo, if we do an ifconfig, all right,\n\n503\n00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:42.230\nand I'll just do a -a you can see that\nif I scroll back up here we've got 1,500\n\n504\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:47.510\nbytes right there, so\nyou can see there's the empty use 1500.\n\n505\n00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:52.520\nSome of these different wireless networks,\nand even this P to P here,\n\n506\n00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.360\nyou can see sets it a little bit\ndifferent, but for the main part,\n\n507\n00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:01.330\nyour ethernet based adapters,\nthey're gonna have your 1,500 bytes.\n\n508\n00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.050\nSo you can see that that's something that\nis set inside of the operating system, but\n\n509\n00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.340\nthen ultimately across that lake it\nwill be something that is controlled\n\n510\n00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.990\nby the network administrator themselves.\n\n511\n00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.670\nSo these are some of the properties of\nour network traffic that you need to\n\n512\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.570\nbe aware of.\n\n513\n00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.560\nAnd as you can see,\nas we've gone through a couple of parts,\n\n514\n00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.910\nit's not really just about what's on the\nexam, it's really about knowing the DNA\n\n515\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.400\nof the communications as they\ntraverse your networks, and\n\n516\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.760\nwhere you might see some of these.\n\n517\n00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.870\nAnd in the scenarios that you might\nwant to eliminate these like broadcast\n\n518\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.160\ncommunications Reducing\ncollisions on your network,\n\n519\n00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.460\nshortening collision domains by using\nswitches, getting the hubs off there.\n\n520\n00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.260\nSo not only for\nthe network plus exam but also for\n\n521\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.280\nyour own experience in\nnetworking in the real world.\n\n522\n00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.370\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Wes.\n\n523\n00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.130\nThank you very much.\n\n524\n00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.250\nNetwork Traffic Properties part two,\nthere was a part one, see them both and\n\n525\n00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.937\nsee everything inside the Comp Series\nthat Wes has put together for you.\n\n526\n00:29:53.937 --> 00:29:55.285\nHe's done such a fantastic job.\n\n527\n00:29:55.285 --> 00:29:58.420\n[INAUDIBLE] all the information we\nneed for those exams and so forth.\n\n528\n00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.181\nAnd by the way, when you're inside\nthe core there's hundreds of other videos.\n\n529\n00:30:02.181 --> 00:30:05.017\nThey're all designed to help you\ngo further, so check those out.\n\n530\n00:30:05.017 --> 00:30:08.310\nAnd ITProTV, they'll

You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching IT Pro TV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.760\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we\ncontinue on with Comp G and Net Plus.\n\n7\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.520\nSwitching Technologies is\nthe name of this episode and\n\n8\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.690\nWes Bryan is here to help us\nout because he's a great guy.\n\n9\n00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.908\nWes, nice to see you sir.\n\n10\n00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:29.433\n&gt;&gt; Hey,\nyou telling all those lies about me again.\n\n11\n00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:30.540\nThanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.480\nIt's always good to be here with ITProtV.\n\n13\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.270\nThat is right, we are moving through, if\nyou're following along with us out there,\n\n14\n00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.640\nwe're moving through the objective 1.3,\nwhich is routing and switching, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.170\nin this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at some of the switching\n\n16\n00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.342\ntechnologies that you need to be\naware of when you sit that exam.\n\n17\n00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:49.587\nNow we're going to talk about\nsome of the basics as well.\n\n18\n00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:54.048\nWe need to know things like, you know,\nhow do switches make decisions, and\n\n19\n00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.535\nwhat is some of the information\nthat is stored within them,\n\n20\n00:00:57.535 --> 00:01:01.369\nas well as defining some of the basic\nconcepts that can get a little\n\n21\n00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.812\nbit confusing if you've never\nseen some of these before.\n\n22\n00:01:04.812 --> 00:01:07.390\nSo if it's the first time\nyou're getting into Net plus,\n\n23\n00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.045\nmaybe first time you're getting into\nnetworks, these will be some fundamental\n\n24\n00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.430\ntechnologies that you're gonna need to\nbe aware of, and again not just for\n\n25\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.250\nthe exam but\nas you launch into your networking career.\n\n26\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.258\n&gt;&gt; And you know some of the episodes\nwe've actually worked on together,\n\n27\n00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:23.440\nyou mentioned packet switched and\ncircuits.\n\n28\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.330\nSo what's the difference?\n\n29\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.580\nI guess that's what\nwe're leading into here.\n\n30\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that's a great concept.\n\n31\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.030\nOne of the most prevalent\nways that we move information\n\n32\n00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.925\nacross networks is through what is known\nas a packing switching technology.\n\n33\n00:01:36.925 --> 00:01:40.125\nIn fact, our switches that we talk about,\nthey work with data packets.\n\n34\n00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.585\nNow, it's kind of interesting that we\ncall it packet switching network, right?\n\n35\n00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:47.430\nAnd when we talk about IP, that's\ntechnically where are our packets, right.\n\n36\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.300\nWe talked about protocol data units,\nand IP, the IP layer if you will,\n\n37\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.110\nthe internet layer, the network layer\nat least where we have packets, but\n\n38\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770\nthen when we talk about switches,\nwe always talk about the fact\n\n39\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.020\nthat well switches deal with frames,\nthey don't deal with packets so.\n\n40\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.400\nWhat the heck is it that we mean?\n\n41\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.310\nSo in this context, what we mean when\nwe talk about packet switch networks,\n\n42\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170\nwhat we mean is that,\nit's a unit of measurement if you will.\n\n43\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.760\nA packet is a variable length size.\n\n44\n00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.090\nIt can change the links.\n\n45\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.230\nAnd one of the things that's great\nabout packet switching networks is that\n\n46\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.800\nthe way they have it set up is that\npackets can take different routes across\n\n47\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.390\nnetworks to find their ways at\nthe endpoints and that's great.\n\n48\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.600\nIn some of the earlier implementation of\nthis, it's kinda like a military thing\n\n49\n00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.740\nwhere they wanted, during war time and\nstuff, portions of a network that could\n\n50\n00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.020\nunfortunately be destroyed, right, and\nthey wanted a way these packets could be\n\n51\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.830\nbasically routed around the failed network\nand still make their way to the endpoints.\n\n52\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.000\nSo with a packet switching network, a\ncouple of the characteristics that I want\n\n53\n00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.360\nyou to be aware of is that\nthe packets are variable length.\n\n54\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.040\nThere isn't any predictability, right?\n\n55\n00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.420\nWe have different of technologies out\nthere like cell switching networks for\n\n56\n00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.580\nthe asynchronous transfer mode ATM, right?\n\n57\n00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.950\nAnd that ATM, if you will, it uses these\ncells that are 53 bytes in size, and\n\n58\n00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.210\nif your data isn't 53 bytes, well, guess\nwhat, you have some padding on there,\n\n59\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.340\nwe're gonna make sure,\nthe technology is, not us.\n\n60\n00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.510\n[LAUGH] But the technology's gonna make\nsure that it's always 53 bytes that\n\n61\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.380\ntraverses the wire within those networks,\nand that offers a predictability and\n\n62\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.540\nwe don't really have to calculate things\nlike the cyclic redundancy checks and\n\n63\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.060\nstuff, so it's less prone to errors, but\nit's also more of expensive technology.\n\n64\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.180\nAnd ethernet,\nwhen we talk about ethernet, right,\n\n65\n00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.300\nthat's essentially packet\nswitching type communication.\n\n66\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.800\nNow, the other thing to keep in mind to is\nthat packets will take different routes.\n\n67\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.760\nThey don't take the same dedicated path.\n\n68\n00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.820\nThey don't have a dedicated\npath if you will.\n\n69\n00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.760\nThe connectivity devices will\ncheck some information and\n\n70\n00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.300\nthey'll determine where that information\nneeds to go and send it along its way.\n\n71\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.730\nAnd then even in the same data stream you\ncan have multiple packets that are taking\n\n72\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.920\ndifferent routes, and that's a little bit\ndifferent than circuit switching networks.\n\n73\n00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.730\nNow you mentioned circuits, right?\n\n74\n00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.460\nWell we also have circuit switching\nnetworks and circuit switching networks\n\n75\n00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.980\nhonestly are some of the oldest\nnetwork communications that we have.\n\n76\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.530\nIt's really one of the reasons you and\n\n77\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.890\nI were talking about it at some\npoint off camera before the episode.\n\n78\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.550\nWe talked about how why was computing\neven really started, right?\n\n79\n00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.680\nWhy do we use binary?\n\n80\n00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.710\nWell, if you go back into some of\nthe earliest days when they decided,\n\n81\n00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.480\nhey, we need a way to\ncontrol these circuits,\n\n82\n00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.870\nthese logical gates if you will,\nand binary was perfect.\n\n83\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.070\nBecause what you would have in\ncircuit switching networks,\n\n84\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.770\nyou probably remember some of the old\nblack and white commercials where you have\n\n85\n00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.090\nthe ladies in there and\nthey work the switchboard.\n\n86\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.540\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say like\noperators at a switchboard-\n\n87\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.080\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n88\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.340\nthey were our connectivity devices, right.\n\n89\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340\nIf you look back,\ngoing back a hundred years or\n\n90\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.930\nso, those were our connectivity devices.\n\n91\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.815\nThey would recieve a single on one and\nsay let me go ahead and connect you.\n\n92\n00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:47.200\nNow, I want you to keep that in mind,\nthe reason I use that analogy os because,\n\n93\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.310\nwhat were they doing?\n\n94\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.520\nThey were establishing a dedicated\ncommunication path, and\n\n95\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.540\nthat's what's a little bit\ndifferent with circuit switching.\n\n96\n00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.840\nSee, with circuit switching networks like\nyour PSTN lines, publics, or what is it?\n\n97\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.900\nThe public telephone switch network.\n\n98\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.450\nAlthough sometimes they\ncall it POTS lines.\n\n99\n00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.490\nYou have a dedicated connection, right?\n\n100\n00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.160\nWhen you make a communication\nacross the circuit switch network,\n\n101\n00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.090\nwhat you have is you have a circuit\nthat is brought online and\n\n102\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.990\nit is a dedicated pathway\nbetween source and destination.\n\n103\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.750\nAnd that portion of that network resource\nis actually temporarily used and\n\n104\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.990\nother people can't use it, right?\n\n105\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.220\nSo it's a little bit different than packet\nswitching where you can have one data\n\n106\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.080\nstream that goes across the wire\ntaking different routes.\n\n107\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.120\nCircuit switching network,\n\n108\n00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.590\nyou build a dedicated point to point\ncommunication between the endpoints.\n\n109\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.340\nNow, I say point to point, it doesn't have\nto be a physical, they also have logical,\n\n110\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.310\nvirtual circuits, too.\n\n111\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.670\nBut keep in mind with a circuit switching\nnetwork you have a dedicated path\n\n112\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.430\nin between source and destination,\nunlike the package switching network.\n\n113\n00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.780\nSo circuit switching network\nare still out there as well,\n\n114\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.880\nagain that's what you have things like\ndialup is a circuit which type network.\n\n115\n00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.640\nYou have, for instance,\nagain those PSTN lines too.\n\n116\n00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.950\nSo that's a little it about\npackage switching networks versus\n\n117\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.100\ncircuit switching networks.\n\n118\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.060\nAlso, I went ahead and just mentioned\nthe other one, cell switching network,\n\n119\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.990\neven though it's not really\nrelevant to our content here.\n\n120\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.160\nIt is relevant to understand\nthe three different types.\n\n121\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.160\nCell switching network is a fixed\nlength and it's predictable, right.\n\n122\n00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.300\nPredictability means we know\nexactly what to expect every time,\n\n123\n00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.190\nless error correction.\n\n124\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.180\nNow, one of the great things about packet\nswitching network is that if there\n\n125\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.710\nare errors and errors do make are present,\nwell we just discard the packet and\n\n126\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.745\nwe do a request for retransmission\ndepending on if we're using connection\n\n127\n00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:36.670\noriented services or\nif were using connectionless services.\n\n128\n00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.408\nIf it's connectionless services, we just\nthrow the packet away and that's right,\n\n129\n00:06:40.408 --> 00:06:42.770\nit goes off and do electrical in both.\n\n130\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.620\nAll right, so that'll move us into some of\nthe other topics that we need to discuss.\n\n131\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.160\nOne of the things I want\nto start out with is, and\n\n132\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.090\nwe've kind of talked about this in\nother episodes, is how do switches\n\n133\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.320\nmake decisions on where to send\ninformation when they are communicating?\n\n134\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.030\nWell they do that with\nsomething called a mack table.\n\n135\n00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.110\nThat's how switches communicate.\n\n136\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.410\nAnd we talked about switches, you know,\nthe switch communication in an earlier\n\n137\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.220\nepisode, but I do want you to kinda\nunderstand that the Mac table\n\n138\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.090\nessentially is a set of a Mac\naddresses related to the porch that\n\n139\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.500\ndevices are on, and\nwhen a frame comes into the switch,\n\n140\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.257\nyou have inside of that switch,\nyou have basically\n\n141\n00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:33.500\nthe database that is built up and\nagain it is port two MAC address mapping.\n\n142\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.950\nSo if I have a communication that comes\nin on Port 1, well the switch looks and\n\n143\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.725\nit says okay.\n\n144\n00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.620\nWhat's the destination MAC address?\n\n145\n00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.790\nWhere is it supposed to be going?\n\n146\n00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.140\nAnd then it looks at that destination MAC\naddress and compares it to its MAC table.\n\n147\n00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.920\nAnd it says okay, I see,\njust figuratively speaking,\n\n148\n00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.214\nthat this computer with this\ndestination MAC address, let's say,\n\n149\n00:07:51.214 --> 00:07:54.477\nis on port 22, and it forwards\nthat information appropriately.\n\n150\n00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:58.958\nNow I want you to remember that when\nit comes to switches, not only do they\n\n151\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.669\nhave MAC tables, But just like our\ncomputers they also have ARP tables too.\n\n152\n00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.030\nAnd the ARP table, remember, is an IP\naddress mapped to its MAC address.\n\n153\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.727\nIn fact,\nwe've kinda looked at this before,\n\n154\n00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:11.257\nI've got our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n155\n00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:14.641\nAnd if you wanna see like on a computer\nwhat the MAC table looks like, all you\n\n156\n00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:18.430\nhave to do is drop down to your command\nprompt, and you can do an arp, right?\n\n157\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.390\nIf you run arp by itself,\nit's just gonna say, hey,\n\n158\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.600\nyou needed to have some kind of\nparameter option assigned to it,\n\n159\n00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.780\nyou can see that we've got\na few different options here.\n\n160\n00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.990\nLet me go ahead and clear the screen and\nwe're gonna do our arp -a,\n\n161\n00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.000\nand what that does is it shows us\nthe ARP table that this computer has.\n\n162\n00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.570\nNow switches do the same exact thing.\n\n163\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.870\nThey have ARP tables, too.\n\n164\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.290\nAnd again, that's just your IP\naddresses mapped to your MAC addresses.\n\n165\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.376\nRemember that your switch\nis making communication or\n\n166\n00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:54.714\ndelivering or forwarding information\nbased on that MAC address.\n\n167\n00:08:54.714 --> 00:08:58.369\nSo know a little bit about\nthe ARP table and what it is and\n\n168\n00:08:58.369 --> 00:09:01.972\nwhat would be in there,\nas well as your MAC table too.\n\n169\n00:09:01.972 --> 00:09:06.252\nAll right, some of the other concepts\nthat we need to look at, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:10.673\nOne of the things that they talk\nabout are how do you control,\n\n171\n00:09:10.673 --> 00:09:15.540\nwhat devices can communicate and\nhow and where they communicate.\n\n172\n00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.660\nWell, that's through\nsomething known as an ACL.\n\n173\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.410\nJust like in Windows,\nthose of you that are coming over from A+\n\n174\n00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.440\nprobably have heard about permissions,\nright?\n\n175\n00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.590\nAnd I can say okay, Zack,\nyou are our IT manager,\n\n176\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.649\nI want you to have full control\nover this file or folder, right?\n\n177\n00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:35.976\nAnd that means Zack has a certain level of\nthings that he can do over that file or\n\n178\n00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:36.790\nfolder.\n\n179\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.570\nWell, believe it or not,\n\n180\n00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.470\nyou have access control lists\ninside of your switches as well.\n\n181\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.640\nAnd switches,\nyou can control how the traffic and\n\n182\n00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.050\nwho can communicate, what devices can\ncommunicate, through access control lists.\n\n183\n00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.690\nSo understand that an ACL is just\na way to an access control method that\n\n184\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.270\nallows an administrator to configure the\nswitch, put rules in there and dictate.\n\n185\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.120\nHow traffic can move,\nwhere it can move inside of the switch.\n\n186\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.670\nNow, those of you who are going on to\nmore advanced technologies or training,\n\n187\n00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.170\nif you will, might get into the Cisco\nworld where they're gonan show\n\n188\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.980\nyou how to inspect an ACL and\ndo the configurations.\n\n189\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.670\nBut just know that an access\ncontrol list inside of a switch\n\n190\n00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:19.500\nreally isn't much different in a concept,\nas it would be permissions inside\n\n191\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.390\nof your operating system in Windows or\nif you look at firewalls.\n\n192\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.360\nFirewalls do what?\n\n193\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.310\nThey use a series of rules that either\nallows or denies traffic going in and\n\n194\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.220\nout of an interface.\n\n195\n00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.200\nWell, your ports are interfaces\non switches as well and\n\n196\n00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.110\nyou use ACLs to control\nwho can communicate and\n\n197\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.640\nwho cannot communicate\non the switch itself.\n\n198\n00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.440\nSo that is something to keep in mind.\n\n199\n00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.770\nSome of the other things that you need\nto be aware of too that they call out.\n\n200\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.670\nThey call out things for\ninstance port mirroring, all right?\n\n201\n00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.392\nNow port mirroring,\nwhy would we do port mirroring?\n\n202\n00:10:54.392 --> 00:10:56.570\nAll right,\nwell I got a little diagram here and\n\n203\n00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.215\nI wanna kind of show you what I mean here.\n\n204\n00:10:58.215 --> 00:11:01.530\nSo imagine these numbers by\nthe way these port numbers,\n\n205\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.640\nI just kind of randomly through\nthem out there all right.\n\n206\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.612\nSo they are arbitrary just\nimagine we got a 48 port switch.\n\n207\n00:11:07.612 --> 00:11:11.850\nAnd we've got a couple of devices that are\nconnected to it that are in question here.\n\n208\n00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.980\nNow, port mirroring is a great\nway that you can see the traffic,\n\n209\n00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.750\nyou can duplicate traffic that's\ngoing into one port, on another port.\n\n210\n00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.320\nNow, why might I do this?\n\n211\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.260\nWell, you can do it for\na few reasons, right?\n\n212\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.880\nSo, notice that the source of the\ncommunication here and the destination.\n\n213\n00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.663\nAll right, now,\n\n214\n00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:32.662\nI want you to keep in mind that we\nalso a management station here too.\n\n215\n00:11:32.662 --> 00:11:36.784\nAll right, and when we look at this,\nnotice that the source computer\n\n216\n00:11:36.784 --> 00:11:41.122\nsends information into Port 2 and\nthe switch looks at it's MAC table and\n\n217\n00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:45.697\nsays okay, I see the destination MAC\naddress is bound for this server here.\n\n218\n00:11:45.697 --> 00:11:50.340\nIn this case, and that is on Port 22,\nlet me send it out that port.\n\n219\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.270\nBut what's interesting is when you do\na port mirroring, what you're saying\n\n220\n00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.780\nis that, this computer let's say,\nwe're gonna mirror Port 2 with Port 10.\n\n221\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.115\nNow what happens is, even though\nthe source of the communication and\n\n222\n00:12:02.115 --> 00:12:05.120\nthe destination of the communication\nare actually talking.\n\n223\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.342\nAll the traffic that goes in and\n\n224\n00:12:07.342 --> 00:12:12.080\nout of Port 2 is now going to be\nalso duplicated over to Port 10.\n\n225\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.030\nNow, like I said,\nwhy would we do something like that?\n\n226\n00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.700\nWe do it for\na couple of different reasons, right?\n\n227\n00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.660\nOne of the reasons you can do it,\nis for security purposes.\n\n228\n00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.410\nMaybe you're doing some\nkind of security auditing.\n\n229\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.100\nMaybe you've got\nan administrative station that\n\n230\n00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.370\nyou just want to see what they're doing,\nright?\n\n231\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.595\nMaybe you've got somebody\non your network that again,\n\n232\n00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:32.855\nit doesn't always have to be bad right,\nthat you wanna just kinda\n\n233\n00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:37.415\naudit what it is that they're doing\nwhile they're at work, I'm not sure.\n\n234\n00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:41.965\nBut you can inspect and\ngrab that information.\n\n235\n00:12:41.965 --> 00:12:44.284\nSo you can also do it as\na way to just basically,\n\n236\n00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:47.863\nkind of like sniff traffic without\nhaving to have a protocol analyzer.\n\n237\n00:12:47.863 --> 00:12:52.689\nBut you can also do it for diagnostic\npurposes to maybe you wanna see a certain,\n\n238\n00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:55.323\nfor instance if the roles\nwere reversed and\n\n239\n00:12:55.323 --> 00:12:58.128\nthis server is what you\nwere port mirroring.\n\n240\n00:12:58.128 --> 00:13:01.360\nMaybe you wanna see the traffic that's\ncoming in and out of the server, so\n\n241\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.300\nyou can get a better understanding\nof the utilization of that server.\n\n242\n00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.790\nMaybe the over [LAUGH]\nutilization of that server.\n\n243\n00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.060\nMaybe you have to beef\nup the network adapter.\n\n244\n00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.810\nMaybe a 1 gig length isn't good enough.\n\n245\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.560\nYou need a 10 gig length, so again,\n\n246\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.650\nyou can do it for the purposes just of\ninspecting and diagnosing the information.\n\n247\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.990\nWe can also do this with things like IDSs\ntoo and Trojan detection systems, so\n\n248\n00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.120\nit's really up to you.\n\n249\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.090\nJust understand basically, for the exam,\nthe port mirroring is a way that you can\n\n250\n00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.870\nmap traffic across or\nduplicate the traffic across ports, right?\n\n251\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.060\nWe could do it for, again,\ndiagnostic purposes, auditing purposes,\n\n252\n00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.950\nnetwork logging information that's\ncoming to and from a server.\n\n253\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.250\nAnd again, we wanna get some\nidea of what information,\n\n254\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.460\nwhat is being sent in and\nout of that server.\n\n255\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.286\nWe can do that as well, so\nit's a good handy thing to have.\n\n256\n00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.140\nAll right, so that's port mirroring.\n\n257\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.900\nThat's some of the properties of\nthe interface, if you will, but\n\n258\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.240\nthere's also other things\nthat you can do too.\n\n259\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:57.940\nFor instance,\n\n260\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.520\none of the things that we can do is\nsomething known as port security.\n\n261\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.390\nNow, port security is a way that we can\ndefine exactly who or, as I say who but\n\n262\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.350\nit's not us as the humans,\nit's the device if you will, the node.\n\n263\n00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.780\nI know I keep saying who can communicate,\n\n264\n00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.160\nbut what devices can communicate\non a single port, right?\n\n265\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.337\nSo for security,\n\n266\n00:14:20.337 --> 00:14:22.715\nimagine that port security but,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n267\n00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:24.158\n&gt;&gt; For security purposes,\n\n268\n00:14:24.158 --> 00:14:28.211\nwe wanna ensure that somebody can't\njust randomly plug into a port and\n\n269\n00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:30.420\nsend their communications, right?\n\n270\n00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.210\nNow physical security is one of\nyour second lines of defense,\n\n271\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.280\nonly preceded by policies,\nprocedure and awareness.\n\n272\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.800\nBut we do need physical security.\n\n273\n00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.910\nSo port security is a good way\nto physically, you can say,\n\n274\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:47.330\nhey, I'm gonna only allow this computer\nto send information into that port.\n\n275\n00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.530\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\ncheck and see what that looks like.\n\n276\n00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.400\nSo Zach, what we've got here is\nwe've got a series of computers.\n\n277\n00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.850\nAnd again, like I said,\ntheir names are kinda arbitrary here.\n\n278\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.280\nBut what I really care about\nis the MAC address, right?\n\n279\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.300\nAnd again, these are just kinda made\nup on the fly MAC addresses still\n\n280\n00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.795\nwithin the same format, right, so.\n\n281\n00:15:03.795 --> 00:15:08.329\nClient01 has its MAC address,\nthat's part of an Ethernet based network.\n\n282\n00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:11.149\nWe'll all had MAC addresses and\nremember that's what the switch is\n\n283\n00:15:11.149 --> 00:15:13.520\nalready using to determine\nwhere to forward traffic.\n\n284\n00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.481\nRight, I'm look into that destination MAC\naddress compare it to the MAC table inside\n\n285\n00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:18.204\nof the switch.\n\n286\n00:15:18.204 --> 00:15:22.546\nWell, when you do port security,\nall you're saying is that on this\n\n287\n00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:26.966\nport that the Client01 is connected to,\nthe only traffic that I'm\n\n288\n00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:31.010\ngoing to allow into that port\nis something that's sourced.\n\n289\n00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:35.917\nRight, now we're looking\nat the source MAC address.\n\n290\n00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:42.183\nA source MAC address of this right here,\n00-01-22-33-44-55, right?\n\n291\n00:15:42.183 --> 00:15:44.137\nSame thing with Clientt02.\n\n292\n00:15:44.137 --> 00:15:46.470\nClient02 is connected to the switch.\n\n293\n00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.405\nThe only inbound communication that we're\ngonna allow on that port is going to\n\n294\n00:15:51.405 --> 00:15:53.287\nbe Client02s MAC address.\n\n295\n00:15:53.287 --> 00:15:55.473\nRight, against inspecting that source and\n\n296\n00:15:55.473 --> 00:15:58.494\nthat destination MAC address\ninside of the Ethernet frame.\n\n297\n00:15:58.494 --> 00:16:02.640\nSame thing here likewise with Client03,\nno different.\n\n298\n00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.332\nRight?\nWe got a MAC address,\n\n299\n00:16:04.332 --> 00:16:06.432\nand that's all we wanna see.\n\n300\n00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.730\nAgain, coming in to that port, right?\n\n301\n00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.250\nSo we've already got that MAC address\nthere, right from these computers.\n\n302\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.380\nAnd it is in that database,\nright and the switch says, okay,\n\n303\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.890\nI see it again,\njust arbitrary portal numbers here.\n\n304\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.912\nPort 2, I see MAC address for client 1.\n\n305\n00:16:22.912 --> 00:16:24.862\nAll right, port 10, I see the MAC address.\n\n306\n00:16:24.862 --> 00:16:28.310\nWe configure MAC address and\nport security for client 2.\n\n307\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.510\nLet's say port 23 has client 03 on it,\nright?\n\n308\n00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.800\nThat MAC address is there, likewise too.\n\n309\n00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.420\nSo now what happens, all right?\n\n310\n00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.760\nWell, it's inspecting the source of the\ncommunication as it comes into the switch.\n\n311\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.610\nAnd here's what happens, all right?\n\n312\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.920\nSo we've got our bad guy, right?\n\n313\n00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.580\nAnd you can tell he's a bad guy\nby the way he's dressed, right?\n\n314\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.006\nHe's dressed like\nFrank Sinatra with sunglasses,\n\n315\n00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:51.720\napparently that makes you a bad guy.\n\n316\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.649\n&gt;&gt; An evil Frank Sinatra.\n\n317\n00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:54.774\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nthat's an evil Frank Sinatra.\n\n318\n00:16:54.774 --> 00:16:59.089\n[LAUGH] So what we end up having here is,\nand I'm sure you're not paying attention\n\n319\n00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:01.700\nto the MAC addresses out there and\nthat's okay.\n\n320\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:07.725\nSo let me explain that this MAC address\nthat was actually set in the database,\n\n321\n00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:08.378\nright?\n\n322\n00:17:08.378 --> 00:17:12.557\nSo when this switch receives\ncommunication on port 2 and\n\n323\n00:17:12.557 --> 00:17:17.171\nit inspects the MAC address just\nlike it's gonna do anyways and\n\n324\n00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:20.827\nlet's fix that there\naren't semicolons there,\n\n325\n00:17:20.827 --> 00:17:25.200\nit looks at the MAC address and\nsays, let me see who that is.\n\n326\n00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.070\nAll right, let me look at my database.\n\n327\n00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:32.800\nYeah on port 2, I don't see that MAC\naddress, that's not the right MAC address,\n\n328\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.125\nso what does it do?\n\n329\n00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:37.535\nIt doesn't allow the communication\nit completely discards it,\n\n330\n00:17:37.535 --> 00:17:39.555\nright that's part of port security.\n\n331\n00:17:39.555 --> 00:17:42.968\nNow there are other port security too that\nwe could talk about as well and we'll talk\n\n332\n00:17:42.968 --> 00:17:45.963\na little bit more in depth as well\nbecause I don't want to just stop here.\n\n333\n00:17:45.963 --> 00:17:50.155\nBut there's also 802.1X,\nright that's port based authentication.\n\n334\n00:17:50.155 --> 00:17:51.635\nSwitches can actually and\n\n335\n00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:56.750\nwireless access points if they're set up\nin an enterprise mode, what you can do is\n\n336\n00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.492\nphysically shut the port down as\nan authentication request comes in.\n\n337\n00:18:00.492 --> 00:18:05.330\nAll right, what the switch does is\npass that authentication through to\n\n338\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.840\nsome kind of authentication\nserver like a Radius server, and\n\n339\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.630\nshut the port down while the Radius\nserver is doing the authentication,\n\n340\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.900\nverifying that that\nperson should be there.\n\n341\n00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.120\nAnd if the person or, again,\nthe device, I keep saying person,\n\n342\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.640\nif the device should be\nconnected to the network, and\n\n343\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.730\nthe authentication is successful,\nit turns around an it opens the port.\n\n344\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.330\nSo there's a couple of\ndifferent ways you can do it.\n\n345\n00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.570\nOne of the ways you can do it,\nport security, there, is through, kind\n\n346\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.420\nof like we do with our wireless network,\nas well, through MAC filtering, right?\n\n347\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.470\nWe can say only the MAC address\n\n348\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.970\nfrom this computer can send\ninformation into that switch, right.\n\n349\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.560\nWe do it a little bit different, for\ndifferent purposes on wireless networks,\n\n350\n00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.070\nwe can say allow or deny,\nwe can put a MAC address in a list, right?\n\n351\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.712\nThis is doing it on a port by port basis.\n\n352\n00:18:52.712 --> 00:18:54.800\nAll right,\n\n353\n00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.860\nso those are some of the other interface\nproperties that we need to be aware of.\n\n354\n00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.150\nI would say, probably the next thing that\nwe should be aware of is what is known as\n\n355\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:03.660\nVLANs.\n\n356\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.880\nAll right, what is a VLAN?\n\n357\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.710\nA VLAN is a virtual local area network.\n\n358\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.520\nIt's a layer to technology that allows you\nto essentially, logically if you will,\n\n359\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.150\ndivide up a switch in to\nmore than one switch.\n\n360\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.420\nSee, if I've got 48 ports on a switch,\nwhat do I have?\n\n361\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.380\nI have one big huge broadcast domain,\nright?\n\n362\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.110\nWe talked about broadcast domains.\n\n363\n00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.750\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I want to maybe logically\n\n364\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.340\ndivide some of those ports up then\nwhat I can do is create these logical\n\n365\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.170\nsoftware if you will,\nbased local area networks.\n\n366\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.920\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n367\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:43.040\nSo I've got just an example of a VLAN\nthat you might see, VLAN diagram, right?\n\n368\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.900\nSo I've got one switch, right?\n\n369\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.950\nRemember, switches are only aware\nof what is connected to them.\n\n370\n00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.660\nSo these computers have to\nbe plugged into the switch.\n\n371\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.200\nAnd then what we can do\ninside of the software,\n\n372\n00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.070\nthe switch is that we can configure and\nwe can logically\n\n373\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.280\ngroup these computers together so\nthat only they can communicate.\n\n374\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.580\nThat's why they call it\na virtual local area network.\n\n375\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.580\nThat's what a VLAN is.\n\n376\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.170\nIt's a software defined\nlocal area network.\n\n377\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.550\nNow don't confuse that with\nsoftware defined networking.\n\n378\n00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.820\nWe'll talk about SDN later.\n\n379\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.410\nBut what this is,\nis it's logically defined in software.\n\n380\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.770\nAll right, so\nthat means that PC1, PC4 and 5.\n\n381\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.490\nThey're on their same virtual network,\nright?\n\n382\n00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.590\nAnd they can't communicate with,\nif they are on VLAN10,\n\n383\n00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.370\nthey cannot communicate with VLAN20.\n\n384\n00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.720\nThese servers, I can segment them,\nI can separate them from the rest of\n\n385\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.310\nthe computers that are on separate VLANs,\nisolating their communication just for\n\n386\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:44.370\nthose devices that are within that\nsame virtual, local area network.\n\n387\n00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.995\nNow how would we allow\nthese to communicate?\n\n388\n00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:48.960\nWell that's where you can\nstack on a router and\n\n389\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.550\nthen the routing it treats them like\ntheir own virtual area network.\n\n390\n00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:57.271\nRemember, we can't communicate across\nnetworks without that layer three\n\n391\n00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:58.162\ntechnology.\n\n392\n00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:01.819\nSo this is a way that you can, for\nsecurity purposes, you can isolate\n\n393\n00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:06.237\nthe communication that happens between\na group of computers by logically defining\n\n394\n00:21:06.237 --> 00:21:10.044\nwhat LAN they're in based on\nthe configuration in the switch, right?\n\n395\n00:21:10.044 --> 00:21:12.714\nAnother way that you could look\nat this is that logically,\n\n396\n00:21:12.714 --> 00:21:16.070\nthrough the access control list\nlike we talked about ACLs, right?\n\n397\n00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:21.358\nWe can define that these 10 computers,\nregardless of their physical\n\n398\n00:21:21.358 --> 00:21:26.393\nlocation are now seen to be on\nthe same isolated local area network.\n\n399\n00:21:26.393 --> 00:21:28.459\nHence the term VLAN where these servers,\n\n400\n00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:31.150\nmaybe I only want these\nservers communicating.\n\n401\n00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.410\nMaybe I've got a management station and\na server and\n\n402\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.320\nI only want them to be able\nto talk to together and\n\n403\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.960\nI don't want them to talk with the rest\nof the PCs within the network, right?\n\n404\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.830\nAnd so, I can put them on their\nown separate VLAN, and only those\n\n405\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:49.430\ncommunications will stay within those\nVLANs and only go between those computers.\n\n406\n00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.650\nSo how is it that we accomplish\nvirtual local area networks, right?\n\n407\n00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.430\nWell you have to have a managed switch,\nall right?\n\n408\n00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.430\nThat's important, right?\n\n409\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.700\nYou're not gonna do this with one of those\nlittle Linksys switches that you just plug\n\n410\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.850\nin, you turn the power on, you plug\nthe device is in, and you go, right.\n\n411\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.020\nThose are unmanaged switches.\n\n412\n00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.350\nAnd unmanaged switches,\nthey've got all the logic built into them.\n\n413\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.040\nAnd they don't have an interface\nthat you can type in commands,\n\n414\n00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.580\ndrop down to a terminal, do an SSH into\nthem and start configuring them, right.\n\n415\n00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.470\nA managed switch is that one\nagain that you can consult in,\n\n416\n00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.860\nyou can SSH into, you can make\nconfigurations into the ACLs and\n\n417\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.940\nyou can find how or\nwhat computers are on what VLANs.\n\n418\n00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:34.200\nNow how that happens Is through\na technology known as 802.1Q.\n\n419\n00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.690\nThat is the IEEE's industry-wide standard\nfor VLAN tagging, trunking as well,\n\n420\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.440\nand we're gonna talk about what that\nmeans here in a second, all right.\n\n421\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.270\nThere's another protocol too that Cisco\nproprietary, that I don't know if it'll\n\n422\n00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.980\ncome up on the exam but Interswitch link,\nISL, is Cisco's proprietary.\n\n423\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.221\nThey do both, they do ISL and 802.1Q.\n\n424\n00:22:56.221 --> 00:22:59.460\nUnderstand that 802.1Q is your VLAN.\n\n425\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.100\nIt defines that VLAN tag, right?\n\n426\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.370\nAnd what that means is that\nin that Ethernet frame,\n\n427\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.060\nyou will see that there's a portion\nthat you are gonna actually put\n\n428\n00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.050\na tag on that the switch\nis going to inspect.\n\n429\n00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.315\nAnd let me show you what I mean here,\n\n430\n00:23:11.315 --> 00:23:13.895\nI like to do this more in like colors,\nright?\n\n431\n00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:17.295\nSo let's say that we've got\nmultiple switches that are in,\n\n432\n00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:21.195\nthat are all managing these VLANs, right?\n\n433\n00:23:21.195 --> 00:23:26.600\nWell how do they know which traffic\ngoes to which VLAN, right when\n\n434\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.410\nyou got a group of switches, well that's\nthrough the process known as tagging.\n\n435\n00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:35.420\nAnd it happens, it just so happens that\nthey'll receive a tagged frame and\n\n436\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:40.510\nagain it'll have that 802.1Q VLAN tag,\nthink of it as like a color, right and\n\n437\n00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.880\nit'll say, okay, this is destined for\nVLAN 7, all right?\n\n438\n00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.920\nAnd then what it will do is as it\nreceives, let's say switch one,\n\n439\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.430\nwe are sending information VLANs here.\n\n440\n00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.348\nThe switch will receive the untagged\nport on an access port.\n\n441\n00:23:54.348 --> 00:23:58.308\nI will go a little bit farther with that\nhere in a second and it will turn around-\n\n442\n00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:02.628\nIt'll look at it's table and through that\naccess control list it'll say which B land\n\n443\n00:24:02.628 --> 00:24:06.228\nis this supposed to go out on and\nit'll say okay I see it's B land seven,\n\n444\n00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:09.169\nI've identified it, let me go ahead and\nput my tag on it and\n\n445\n00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:13.670\nthen what I'll do is I'll send it out\nthat interface that it goes to switch to.\n\n446\n00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:18.245\nWhile Switch 2 receives that,\ninspects the VLAN tag and\n\n447\n00:24:18.245 --> 00:24:21.780\nsays, all right, I see this is for VLAN 7.\n\n448\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.990\nLet me go ahead and untag it.\n\n449\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:27.830\nAnd I'll look at my table here and see\nwhere I should send this out to get it to\n\n450\n00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:33.580\nVLAN 7, and it'll put the tag on it,\nand it'll send it to the next switch.\n\n451\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.145\nFinally, the last switch that maybe\nis directly connected to where\n\n452\n00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:40.409\nthe destination PC is within\nthat VLAN will receive that tag.\n\n453\n00:24:40.409 --> 00:24:43.085\nAnd it'll say, okay,\nactually I see this is VLAN 7.\n\n454\n00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:44.300\nLet me go ahead and untag it.\n\n455\n00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.758\nAnd I'll look at my interface\nto see configured on me, and\n\n456\n00:24:47.758 --> 00:24:50.245\nI'll figure out which way\nI need to send it out.\n\n457\n00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:55.000\nAnd, at that point, once it's actually on\nthe VLAN, it doesn't need the tag anymore.\n\n458\n00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.230\nIt knows where to send it.\n\n459\n00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:01.885\nSo it's actually going to be\nan untagged frame at that point,\n\n460\n00:25:01.885 --> 00:25:06.034\nbecause it identifies\nit as being on the VPN.\n\n461\n00:25:06.034 --> 00:25:10.630\nOop, that didn't change that color.\n\n462\n00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:11.970\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n463\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.588\nThere we go, try that.\n\n464\n00:25:15.588 --> 00:25:18.650\nAll right, so it's actually untagged\nwhen it gets to that location.\n\n465\n00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.527\nNow another way we can look\nat this too,all right,\n\n466\n00:25:22.527 --> 00:25:26.236\nis Access Ports versus Trunk Ports,\nall right.\n\n467\n00:25:26.236 --> 00:25:27.710\nSo what do we mean by that, all right?\n\n468\n00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:28.500\nIf we look and\n\n469\n00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.280\nwe've got a series of computers here and\nthey've on VLANs, all right?\n\n470\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.360\nAll I did here is I essentially cut out\nswitch two, all right, if you will.\n\n471\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.120\nSo we just have two\nswitches here just to kinda\n\n472\n00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:42.720\nmake the diagram a little bit\neasier to view here, all right?\n\n473\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.660\nNotice that I've got these two switches\nand they are managing the VLAN,\n\n474\n00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.075\nif I can get that in the picture there.\n\n475\n00:25:49.075 --> 00:25:50.380\n[LAUGH] They're managing the VLAN.\n\n476\n00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:55.380\nNow if this computer, all right, sends\ninformation into the switch all right,\n\n477\n00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.710\nwhen it sends information into\nthe switch it's in untagged format and\n\n478\n00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.290\nthat untagged format\nthat's the access port.\n\n479\n00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.050\nThat's the difference between,\nyou know an untagged port versus\n\n480\n00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:12.280\na port that will do the tagging, so\nwhat happens here is access ports\n\n481\n00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:17.060\nare those ports that deliver\nthe traffic directly to the device.\n\n482\n00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:23.950\nA trunk port is essentially a port that\nmore than one VLAN can use, right?\n\n483\n00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.940\nSo we've got multiple VLANs.\n\n484\n00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.800\nWell, if this VLAN 7 and\nVLAN 8 have to send information to\n\n485\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.940\nthis switch to get to VLAN 7 or VLAN 8,\nthey've gotta be able to share a port.\n\n486\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.540\nRight?\nAnd that's what a trunk port is.\n\n487\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:41.580\nA trunk port if you will is just\na port that multiple VLANs can use.\n\n488\n00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.582\nAnd they use that tagging frame or\nthat tag within the frame if\n\n489\n00:26:46.582 --> 00:26:52.189\nyou will between the switches to\nidentify what VLAN it should go to.\n\n490\n00:26:52.189 --> 00:26:55.330\nAnd then when it gets to this switch,\nthis switch receives the tag frames.\n\n491\n00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:56.626\nSays okay I see that.\n\n492\n00:26:56.626 --> 00:27:02.750\nThat's bound for VLAN 7, I'm connected\nto the VLAN that that computer's on.\n\n493\n00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.520\nI'm also,\nthat computer's connected directly to me.\n\n494\n00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.770\nSo what it does is it removes the tag, and\n\n495\n00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.580\nit sends that information in an untagged\nmanner out finally to the destination PC.\n\n496\n00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.330\nSo tagging and untagging.\n\n497\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.750\nWe're just talking about\nhow VLANs operate.\n\n498\n00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:23.600\nHow the switches themselves try to\ndetermine where to send that information.\n\n499\n00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.890\nAll right.\nSo that how,\n\n500\n00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:29.310\nthat is a little bit about our VLANs.\n\n501\n00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.500\nThe VLAN tagging, we do have some more\nto talk about, but unfortunately,\n\n502\n00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.430\nit looks like we might\nhave run out of time.\n\n503\n00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.100\n&gt;&gt; Well, wes that'd be great, but you know\nwe actually do have a couple more minutes.\n\n504\n00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.560\nIs there anything else you'd like to\nadd about switching technologies?\n\n505\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n506\n00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.490\nThere are a couple other topics\nthat we just kinda need to wrap up.\n\n507\n00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll go ahead, and\n\n508\n00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.140\nwe won't make you wait.\n\n509\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.010\nNo more cliffhangers in this one, right?\n\n510\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.200\nSo one of the other things that we wanna\njust briefly mention here, and you need to\n\n511\n00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.130\nbe aware of for the exam, is that we\ntalked about some of the properties of our\n\n512\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.290\nnetwork traffic and one of those\nthings is broadcast communications.\n\n513\n00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.186\nAnd remember what we said right?\n\n514\n00:28:03.186 --> 00:28:05.042\nIn broadcast communications-\n&gt;&gt; Everybody.\n\n515\n00:28:05.042 --> 00:28:06.525\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n516\n00:28:06.525 --> 00:28:10.125\nThat was like standing up on the table\nin the food court and yelling out.\n\n517\n00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:13.175\nAnd everybody looks at you and\nwonders why you're doing that.\n\n518\n00:28:13.175 --> 00:28:14.525\nBut everybody hears it right?\n\n519\n00:28:15.705 --> 00:28:18.015\nBroadcast communications\ncan cause problems right.\n\n520\n00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:21.885\nNot only do they saturate our\nnetworks with unnecessary traffic\n\n521\n00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:25.060\nif only one destination is really needed.\n\n522\n00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.150\nBut the other problem is that when\nyou have multiple switches that\n\n523\n00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.720\nare basically servicing a larger network,\n\n524\n00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.800\na larger LAN is that one switch might\nsend a broadcast communication.\n\n525\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.570\nAnd I tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and explain.\n\n526\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.920\nI've got a little diagram here.\n\n527\n00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.940\nLet's talk about how we can,\nessentially what happens a broadcast,\n\n528\n00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.310\nif we get too many broadcasts we can\nget whats known as a broadcast storm.\n\n529\n00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.530\nRight?\nAnd it causes what's known as\n\n530\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.000\nswitching loops.\n\n531\n00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.990\nIn order to stop this, we use something\nknown as STP, or Spanning Tree Protocol.\n\n532\n00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:59.510\nSo, I want you to take a scenario, right,\n\n533\n00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:03.650\nwhere this switch sends a broadcast\ncommunication out, right?\n\n534\n00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.267\nRemember, we're talking\nabout that OF address,\n\n535\n00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:10.650\nright, and in fact if we switch back\nover to our Windows client here,\n\n536\n00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.570\nremember this is the, remember we\nhave a broadcast MAC address, right.\n\n537\n00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.150\nThat's where we send a broadcast\ncommunication into the switch\n\n538\n00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.840\nbecause we need everybody to hear it.\n\n539\n00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.630\nWell, the problem with\nthat is what happens if\n\n540\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.070\nthis switch sends a broadcast\ncommunication, right?\n\n541\n00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:30.390\nIt is sending a communication out to all\nthe other switches that is destined for\n\n542\n00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.140\nall Fs, right, the MAC address all Fs.\n\n543\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.027\nWell, what happens when this\nswitch receives that broadcast?\n\n544\n00:29:37.027 --> 00:29:40.875\nWell, it says okay,\nI see it's a broadcast communication, and\n\n545\n00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:44.640\nthen it broadcasts its information or\nall its ports, right?\n\n546\n00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.830\nAnd then what happened's again well\nthen this switch in here's it right?\n\n547\n00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.630\nAnd you can see what's going on\nlike this switch here sentences\n\n548\n00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.670\nthat's a broadcast so what is it do?\n\n549\n00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.710\nWell it's send's it out all of\nit's port's and now what happens.\n\n550\n00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.970\nThis switch and this switch just\nreceived another broadcast communication\n\n551\n00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.250\neven though it was this switch that\nstarted a broadcast communication,\n\n552\n00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.280\nthis switch will receive it,\nthis switch will receive it.\n\n553\n00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.150\nAnd then we're back to the same thing.\n\n554\n00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.988\nNotice that again we've got,\nit's called a broadcast storm.\n\n555\n00:30:11.988 --> 00:30:13.870\nIt's just those broadcast communication,\n\n556\n00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.050\nevery switch is receiving a portion\nof that broadcast communication and\n\n557\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:22.070\nsaying, well let me send this out\nto the broadcast mac address.\n\n558\n00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.366\nAnd then you see what's going on here.\n\n559\n00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:28.113\nThe cycle just kind of repeats itself and\npretty soon all of these broadcast\n\n560\n00:30:28.113 --> 00:30:32.900\ncommunications are just ending up in these\nloops across our switching technology.\n\n561\n00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:38.640\nSo what we do with spanning\ntree protocol uses\n\n562\n00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.120\nan algorithm called STA, spanning tree\nalgorithm, sorry about the acronyms there.\n\n563\n00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.020\nIt gets confusing.\n\n564\n00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.470\nSTP uses STA, class dismissed.\n\n565\n00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:51.560\nNo, spanning tree protocol uses an\nalgorithm called spanning tree in order to\n\n566\n00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.010\ndo a few things, all right?\n\n567\n00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:58.060\nSo I want you to know, it's a loop\nprevention mechanism at layer two, right?\n\n568\n00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.730\nWhat it does is the algorithm\ntakes all of these switches, and\n\n569\n00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.390\nwe can go look at our slide here.\n\n570\n00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.140\nAll of these switches are gonna go through\nwhat's know as an election process.\n\n571\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:16.220\nAnd the election process what it does is\nit's determining the main switch, right?\n\n572\n00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.620\nWho is the king of all the switches,\nright?\n\n573\n00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.370\nThat's what becomes the root switch,\nroot bridge as they call it.\n\n574\n00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.231\nThey call it a root bridge\nbecause bridging technologies,\n\n575\n00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:28.700\nswitching technologies\nare pretty much the same.\n\n576\n00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.213\nSo this goes back from the early\ndays when we had bridges but\n\n577\n00:31:32.213 --> 00:31:34.727\nthey still call it a root bridge, right.\n\n578\n00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:39.517\nWhat the root bridge is, is the root\nbridge is the top part of the tree, right,\n\n579\n00:31:39.517 --> 00:31:42.855\nit's going to start to try to\nform this tree topology so\n\n580\n00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:45.370\nthere aren't any loops right.\n\n581\n00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.720\nAnd the top part of the tree\nis called that root bridge.\n\n582\n00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.188\nAnd the root bridge's ports\nare always in forwarding mode,\n\n583\n00:31:52.188 --> 00:31:54.505\nall their ports are in forwarding mode.\n\n584\n00:31:54.505 --> 00:31:57.517\nNow the root bridge is\ndetermined by priority and\n\n585\n00:31:57.517 --> 00:32:01.407\nit uses a MAC address all right,\na MAC address and a priority and\n\n586\n00:32:01.407 --> 00:32:04.566\nby default all switches\nhave The same priority, so\n\n587\n00:32:04.566 --> 00:32:09.047\na lot of times what will happen is,\nif you let spanning tree protocol go,\n\n588\n00:32:09.047 --> 00:32:13.260\nis that it's going to choose the MAC\naddress with the lowest value.\n\n589\n00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.630\nThat will be the highest priority,\nit will become the root bridge.\n\n590\n00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.250\nAnd there are going to be problems with\nthat as well, because a lot of times,\n\n591\n00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.380\nwhat you have is your oldest switches\nhave the lowest priority, or\n\n592\n00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.040\nthe lowest MAC addresses.\n\n593\n00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.930\nAnd a lot of times, your oldest switches\nare the slowest switches, right.\n\n594\n00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.240\nThey're the oldest technology.\n\n595\n00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.890\nSo a lot of your administrators\nlike in Cisco and\n\n596\n00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:35.360\nstuff will manually define\nwhat the route bridge is.\n\n597\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.150\nBut you can let FTP do this as well.\n\n598\n00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.110\nNow, once the root bridge\nhas been elected, now,\n\n599\n00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.020\nwe gotta go through another process,\nright?\n\n600\n00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:47.950\nAnd that's determining which port you're\ngonna actually be forwarding information,\n\n601\n00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.368\nso that's another part of this, right?\n\n602\n00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:53.420\nIt determines, are loops present, and\n\n603\n00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.590\nif loops are present,\nwe gotta start blocking ports.\n\n604\n00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:56.940\nSo, what we're doing here is,\n\n605\n00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.464\nwe're determining which\nports will be root ports.\n\n606\n00:33:00.464 --> 00:33:03.340\nAnd root ports are gonna\nforward information\n\n607\n00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.420\nalways back to the highest part of the\nhierarchy, back towards the root bridge.\n\n608\n00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.080\nAnd then you have designated ports,\n\n609\n00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.920\nwhich can forward to other switches,\nnot to the root, but to other switches.\n\n610\n00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.685\nAnd then you have non-designated ports,\n\n611\n00:33:16.685 --> 00:33:19.940\nand non-designated ports\nare those ones that we close down.\n\n612\n00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:25.970\nAnd what it's trying to do is make sure\nthat it creates this loop-free topology.\n\n613\n00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.430\nAnd then finally, what you have,\nyou'll see that the root ports,\n\n614\n00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.640\nright, they're only\ngoing in one direction.\n\n615\n00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.790\nThey're only forwarding traffic to one\ndirection, and that's back to the root.\n\n616\n00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.440\nRight?\n\n617\n00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.880\nSo remember, you have root ports,\nyou have designated ports and\n\n618\n00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.670\nyou have non-designated ports.\n\n619\n00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.820\nRoot ports means these are the shortest,\n\n620\n00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.110\nif this was determined that it's\nthe shortest path back to the root, and\n\n621\n00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:51.190\nthe designated ports\nare forwarding to other switches.\n\n622\n00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.870\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n623\n00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.930\nAny kind of loop that is detected,\nthose ports will be shut down and\n\n624\n00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.310\nthose are non-designated ports.\n\n625\n00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.770\nAll right, so a little bit\nabout spanning tree algorithm.\n\n626\n00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.410\nAgain, as you go on to\nmore advanced training,\n\n627\n00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:08.060\nyou'll learn how to configure this, and\nyou'll learn it in much greater detail.\n\n628\n00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.480\nI would say on the Net+ exam,\nknow the process that's happening, right?\n\n629\n00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.620\nKnow that it's a priority and\n\n630\n00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.510\na MAC address that determines\nthe route bridge election.\n\n631\n00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.400\nKnow that it's root ports,\ndesignated ports and non-designated ports.\n\n632\n00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.270\nEssentially, the root ports are that\nshortest path between that switch and\n\n633\n00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:26.570\nthe root bridge if you will,\nor the root switch.\n\n634\n00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.960\nAnd then, designated ports forward\njust to that segment and then last but\n\n635\n00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.370\nnot least,\nnon-designated ports are blocked.\n\n636\n00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.170\nThat takes me to one other topic.\n\n637\n00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.630\nI guess we got a couple of other\ntopics here, and we will finish up.\n\n638\n00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.720\nThe next thing I want to talk about is\nwhat's known as a DMZ, and you might\n\n639\n00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.640\nhave heard this in our security section,\nwhere we talked about demilitarized zone.\n\n640\n00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.420\nThere are a couple of different ways that\nthey define this in other technologies,\n\n641\n00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.880\nmore vendor-specific terms, you might\nhear screen subnet perimeter network,\n\n642\n00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.520\nedge network.\n\n643\n00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.740\nBut if we can look here,\nour DMZ is typically\n\n644\n00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.650\nany resource that is publicly\naccessible from the internet.\n\n645\n00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.320\nSo I want you to think about this.\n\n646\n00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.930\nWe don't want people out on the internet\nbeing able to connect back into our local\n\n647\n00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.500\narea network, right,\nthat would be a security vulnerability.\n\n648\n00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.410\nBut what we might have is we\nmight have a web server for\n\n649\n00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.950\na company that needs to sell our product,\nright?\n\n650\n00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.200\nWell, we might have a web server, but\n\n651\n00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.050\nwe need customers from\nthe Internet to be able to get to.\n\n652\n00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:30.140\nSo how do we allow access public\naccess into that resource\n\n653\n00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:35.320\nwithout actually allowing them access back\ninto our private network, or our LAN?\n\n654\n00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.338\nWell, that's where a DMZ comes in.\n\n655\n00:35:38.338 --> 00:35:43.465\nA DMZ, a demilitarized zone,\nessentially, is a subnet.\n\n656\n00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:47.860\nIt's usually placed in between two\nfirewalls where the external firewall\n\n657\n00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.530\nallows communication in.\n\n658\n00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.400\nYou can communicate with the web server,\nbut\n\n659\n00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.580\nit doesn't allow public access back\ninto the local area network, right.\n\n660\n00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.090\nSo it is a, basically a network\nthat sits between the public side,\n\n661\n00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.460\npublic facing side,\nwhich would be the internet, and\n\n662\n00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.980\nthe private network which would\nbe your local area network.\n\n663\n00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.970\nAll right, last but not least, I say last,\n\n664\n00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.245\nit does look like I've\ngot two more topics here.\n\n665\n00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:14.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know we're running short on time.\n\n666\n00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.320\nBut I also wanna talk about, briefly,\nabout distributed switching, just so\n\n667\n00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.340\nyou can understand what that means.\n\n668\n00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:19.880\nAnd again,\n\n669\n00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.550\nthis is something that you'll see in some\nof the vendor-specific training as well.\n\n670\n00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:28.176\nAnd what this does is,\nthis actually just breaks up and\n\n671\n00:36:28.176 --> 00:36:33.480\nputs a hierarchical\nimplementation to switching.\n\n672\n00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.670\nEssentially a hierarchical\nmodel with multiple layers,\n\n673\n00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.940\nand what you have are these three layers.\n\n674\n00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.880\nYou have an access layer,\na distribution layer, and a core layer.\n\n675\n00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.660\nThe access layer connects the clients\ndirectly to the network, if you will.\n\n676\n00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.680\nThe distribution network can be\nthings like LAN-based routers,\n\n677\n00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.850\nlayer three switches, and it moves\nthe data like, for instance, across VLANs.\n\n678\n00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:56.846\nThe last is the core layer, and\nthe core layer are high-end switches with\n\n679\n00:36:56.846 --> 00:36:59.620\nhigh-speed cabling,\nlike fiber optic communications.\n\n680\n00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.270\nThink of it as the backbone.\n\n681\n00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.010\nThey're gonna handle\nthe traffic from everything.\n\n682\n00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.250\nSo lot of bandwidth,\nbasically, high-speed cable,\n\n683\n00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.330\ncompromising the backbone of a network.\n\n684\n00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.700\nAnd that's just those abstract,\n\n685\n00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.480\nthat hierarchical model that\nthey apply to switching.\n\n686\n00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.560\nThey call it distributed swishing,\ndistributed switching.\n\n687\n00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.420\nI'm not swishing.\n\n688\n00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.138\nWe're not teaching you\nhow to brush your teeth.\n\n689\n00:37:20.138 --> 00:37:21.680\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n690\n00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.640\nAnd right, last but not the least and\nI'll quit saying that, sound\n\n691\n00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.858\nlike Colombo episode here is something\nknown as power over ethernet, POE.\n\n692\n00:37:28.858 --> 00:37:32.520\nAll right, POE is exactly what it\nsounds like, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n693\n00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.840\nIt means that we've got ethernet cables,\nand we inject power onto them so\n\n694\n00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.130\nthat we can power devices.\n\n695\n00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.280\nNow, where do we see this?\n\n696\n00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.370\nWhere would this come in handy?\n\n697\n00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.920\nI want you to think about of any kind of,\n\n698\n00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.340\nlike, an access point, that you can't\nrun an external AC adapter to, right?\n\n699\n00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.280\nAn IP camera, right?\n\n700\n00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.360\nYou have some kind of security camera, and\n\n701\n00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.310\nyou want to be able to send data to it and\nfrom it.\n\n702\n00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.620\nBut you don't have a place to\nmount an external AC adaptor.\n\n703\n00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.800\nWell, you can plug your ethernet cable\ninto it, connect it to a POE injector.\n\n704\n00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.680\nIt puts power in to the ethernet cable,\nand powers the device.\n\n705\n00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.350\nThere are two different POE technologies\nthat I want you to be aware of for\n\n706\n00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.130\nthe exam, right?\n\n707\n00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:12.370\nThere's POE and POE+.\n\n708\n00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.896\nPOE is 802.3af, alpha foxtrot, there.\n\n709\n00:38:16.896 --> 00:38:19.623\nPOE+ is 802.at, alpha tango.\n\n710\n00:38:19.623 --> 00:38:24.030\nSo what's the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n711\n00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.030\nBasically the output of wattage, right,\none's got a higher wattage output.\n\n712\n00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.081\nThe first POE or 802.3af,\n\n713\n00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:37.110\nlet me make sure I say that right,\nwould give you 15.4 watts.\n\n714\n00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:43.380\nIf you're talking about POE+, it increased\nthe wattage output up to about 25.5 watts.\n\n715\n00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:49.970\nSo POE+, or 802.at,\nis going to be 25.5 watt output.\n\n716\n00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.690\nSo, just more of those specifications\nthat you have to know for your Net+ exam.\n\n717\n00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:56.480\nRemember some of these technologies,\nremember some of the fundamentals, and\n\n718\n00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.260\nyou'll be doing well the next\ntime you sit in that exam booth.\n\n719\n00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.540\n&gt;&gt; Awesome job, Wes.\n\n720\n00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.023\nAnother essential episode,\nswitching technologies, and\n\n721\n00:39:04.023 --> 00:39:06.565\nthat's a part of the Comptia Net+ series.\n\n722\n00:39:06.565 --> 00:39:08.450\nMake sure you see every\nsingle one of them, and\n\n723\n00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.610\nthat will be in the course library, where\nyou'll find hundreds of other videos,\n\n724\n00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.100\nall designed to help you go so\nmuch further.\n\n725\n00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.110\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro TV, it is binge worthy.\n\n726\n00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.540\nThank you for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n727\n00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n728\n00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:19.890\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n729\n00:39:19.890 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.917 --> 00:00:08.501\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:12.140\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.650\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.320\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.700\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n9\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.570\nAs we continue on with CompTIA Net plus.\n\n10\n00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.550\nAnd this is routing technologies part two.\n\n11\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.080\nAnd once Brian is here to once\nagain help us through these waters.\n\n12\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.112\nWell, it's good to see you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.363\n&gt;&gt; Hey, [CROSSTALK] Hopefully\nif it's murky waters,\n\n14\n00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.627\nwe can clear them up for you.\n\n15\n00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:32.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can.\n\n16\n00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.670\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so we've been talking\nabout routing technologies, right?\n\n17\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.890\nAnd like Zach mentioned,\nthis is a part two.\n\n18\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.740\nRemember in the first part,\n\n19\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.340\nwe kind of set the stage for,\njust some of the basics, right?\n\n20\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.090\nThe difference between an IGP and and EGP,\n\n21\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.720\ninterior gateway versus\nexterior gateway protocols.\n\n22\n00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.220\nAnd we really talked about\nDistance Vector Routing Protocols, right.\n\n23\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.770\nWe were talking about Rip version 2.\n\n24\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.750\nSo as a real quick recap on that\njust remember RIP version 2 is\n\n25\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.380\na distance-vector routing protocol, and\n\n26\n00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.250\nwith distance-vector protocols\nkeep in mind that it is\n\n27\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.560\nthe hop count that becomes the cost of the\nmetric or what determines the best path.\n\n28\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you said there's two types\nof IGPs, distance vector and link state.\n\n29\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.600\nNow can you tell us more about that?\n\n30\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nwith link state routing protocols,\n\n31\n00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.230\nit's another type of essentially\ninterior gateway protocol.\n\n32\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.245\nAnd the, really the most common one\nthat we use is what is known as OSPF,\n\n33\n00:01:29.245 --> 00:01:30.110\nall right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.098\nThat's Open, Shortest Path First.\n\n35\n00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:34.890\nAnd it's kinda interesting, in the name\nyou can kind of see what's going on.\n\n36\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.360\nIt's the basis of routing, right?\n\n37\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.060\nWe want the best, or\nthe shortest path to get to a destination.\n\n38\n00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.480\nWell, with open shortest path first and\nlink state routing, it's a little\n\n39\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.750\ndifferent in how we determine what\nthe cost of a route is, right?\n\n40\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.590\nThe metric or the cost itself is going\nto be based on not just distance.\n\n41\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.030\nAnd really it can be based\non a lot of things, right?\n\n42\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.090\nSo where distance vector uses\nthe destination and just distance\n\n43\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.210\nwhen it comes to link state, I want you\nto kind of change your mindset around it.\n\n44\n00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.560\nI've been teaching this for almost\na decade now, and one of the things that I\n\n45\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.130\ntell students is that when you think\nof link state, change it around.\n\n46\n00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.060\nAnd I want you to think\nof state of the link.\n\n47\n00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870\nIf you think of state of the link routing,\nyou can kind of figure out\n\n48\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.580\nwhat a link state routing protocol\nis using to determine the best path.\n\n49\n00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.062\nHow it determines the cost, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:30.160\nAnd that is through the state of the link,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.280\nSo it can use things like, for\ninstance, it can use the bandwidth.\n\n52\n00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.860\nWhat is the available bandwidth for\nit, if you will?\n\n53\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.380\nWhat is the load utilization, what is the\nlink reliability, is it up, is it down.\n\n54\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.570\nAgain speed of the link,\nthe bandwidth is one that is very,\n\n55\n00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.540\nvery important and let me show you here.\n\n56\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.800\nSo unlike remember our distance-vector\nprotocol that's using hop counts,\n\n57\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.010\nright and the distance when it comes\nto something like OSPF, OSPF can say,\n\n58\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.490\nhey should I send this over,\nlet's say, maybe.\n\n59\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.296\nOop, let me finish my diagram there again.\n\n60\n00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:07.280\nShould I send this over 100 megabite link?\n\n61\n00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.030\nOr 100 megabit link,\nshould I send this over 65k link?\n\n62\n00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.580\nShould I send this over a 10 gig link,\nright?\n\n63\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.989\nWell, you'll notice that 10 gig\nis obviously gonna be faster than\n\n64\n00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.790\na 100 Meg link, so\nthe 10 gig link has more bandwidth,\n\n65\n00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.228\nit's gonna be could\npotentially be a better choice.\n\n66\n00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:29.980\nSo we look at the quality of the link,\nthe speed of the link.\n\n67\n00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.890\nWell, is that link up or\nis that link down?\n\n68\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.220\nAgain, so the reliability of the link.\n\n69\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.720\nSo and\nadministrators can actually set these.\n\n70\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480\nThey set them through what are known\nad administrative distances, right?\n\n71\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.170\nAnd you can manually let\nOSPF determine it and\n\n72\n00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.530\nthere's a certain value or cost associated\nwith different transmission speeds.\n\n73\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.328\nBut then administrators can\noverride these if they want.\n\n74\n00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:54.648\nIf they wanna manually define what\nthe cost of the link is, they can and\n\n75\n00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:57.972\nthey do that by setting what are known\nas administrative distances and\n\n76\n00:03:57.972 --> 00:04:00.115\ndifferent characteristics of those links,\n\n77\n00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:02.853\nas you'll go on to more\nadvanced training we'll learn.\n\n78\n00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:08.000\nBut the administrative distances do\ndiffer in what the overall cost is.\n\n79\n00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.409\nNow, kinda understand\na little bit more about OSPF.\n\n80\n00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.530\nOSPF is actually a pretty\namazing link state protocol.\n\n81\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.670\nIt's the most common interior gateway\nprotocol, much more so than RIP is today.\n\n82\n00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.080\nAnd one of the reasons is,\n\n83\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.960\nIs that it doesn't have a hop count\nlimitation, we don't have that limitation.\n\n84\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.961\nIt's very, very scalable.\n\n85\n00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.120\nIt has faster convergence times too.\n\n86\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.835\nNow, initially, it doesn't,\nall right and let me tell you why.\n\n87\n00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:38.985\nIf we go back to our diagram here, OSPF,\n\n88\n00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:42.985\nwhen these routers first come online if\nthey're using OSPF then what they do is\n\n89\n00:04:42.985 --> 00:04:47.570\nthey actually broadcast their routing\ntables to all routers within the network.\n\n90\n00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.203\nAnd you're probably thinking maybe, maybe\nyou're thinking out there like I am well\n\n91\n00:04:52.203 --> 00:04:55.161\nwait a second if Rip is only\ntalking to the neighbors and\n\n92\n00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:59.794\nbroadcasting that communication with that\nme more efficient than OSPF flooding that\n\n93\n00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:02.469\ninformation out to every\nrouter on the network.\n\n94\n00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:07.553\nThe answer is yes at first OSPF is\ngonna saturate your network with a lot\n\n95\n00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:13.259\nof communications while all of these\nrouters on this network try to converge.\n\n96\n00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.789\nAgain, convergence remember that\nprocess of us all agreeing that we have\n\n97\n00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.680\nthe updated routing information.\n\n98\n00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.580\nNow here's where it\nstarts to out perform REV\n\n99\n00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.340\nat first you get a lot of heavy traffic,\nas these routers are learning.\n\n100\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.475\nOnce they are converge,\n\n101\n00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:35.680\nonce they all agree to have\nthe updated topology information,\n\n102\n00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.157\nif a link fails unlike RIP which continues\nto broadcast communicate it's routing\n\n103\n00:05:41.157 --> 00:05:46.660\ntables whether anything changes or not\nOSPF does incremental routing messages.\n\n104\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.810\nIt says, I don't need to tell Zack\nabout everything every 30 seconds.\n\n105\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.950\nI'll just tell Zack,\nhey guess what that link's failed.\n\n106\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.110\nJust that message goes, right?\n\n107\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.900\nSo you'll see that you get a faster\nconvergence time because it's\n\n108\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.280\nthe incremental topology\nchanges that are actually\n\n109\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.270\nsent out across the network, right?\n\n110\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.220\nRather than having to inspect\nthe whole routing table\n\n111\n00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.410\nfigure out what we know like Rip does.\n\n112\n00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.290\nFigure out if we know all of these routes,\n\n113\n00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.960\njust to pick process the whole routing\ntable to find one route that's changed.\n\n114\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.710\nI'm just gonna tell you\nwhat the change is.\n\n115\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.391\nI don't need to give you\nthe whole routing table, right.\n\n116\n00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:27.522\nIt also not only has faster convergent\ntimes, it has routing authentication.\n\n117\n00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:32.080\nAll right, changes are propagated\ninstantaneously, it doesn't wait and\n\n118\n00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.790\nwe don't have to wait for it get from\nneighbor, to neighbor, to neighbor,\n\n119\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.290\nto neighbor.\n\n120\n00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.630\nAnd wait until that converges really\nslowly because the increment is just,\n\n121\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.290\nthat incremental change,\n\n122\n00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.970\njust that change is gonna be\npropagated to all routers if you will.\n\n123\n00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.940\nIt uses something known as the Dijkstra's\nalgorithm to recalculate topology changes\n\n124\n00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.660\nand it also uses things like for\ninstance, multicast updates.\n\n125\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.290\nAnd the multicast communications, unlike\nthe broadcast communication, remember,\n\n126\n00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.940\nyou've got to be part of the group.\n\n127\n00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.490\nA broadcast is one to everybody.\n\n128\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.260\nA multicast communication that\nOSPF is using here is just one\n\n129\n00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.860\nto the other devices that\nwere within that group.\n\n130\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.811\nSo again, much more efficient\nutilization of your bandwidth.\n\n131\n00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:18.100\nAll right, let see here so,\nthat has our link state routing protocols.\n\n132\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.485\nAgain, remember that with your routing\ninformation protocol its an IGP,\n\n133\n00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:25.935\ndistance-vector routing\nprotocol as well as OSPF\n\n134\n00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:29.215\nthat is using link state\nrouting protocols.\n\n135\n00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:32.615\n&gt;&gt; So you mentioned link state protocols,\nand distance-vector protocols.\n\n136\n00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:36.976\nThese are two separate protocols,\nnow can there be a blending of the two?\n\n137\n00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:40.385\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting, technically\nwe do have one that kind of sits.\n\n138\n00:07:40.385 --> 00:07:42.730\nAnd this is a completely\ndifferent topic altogether.\n\n139\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.315\nWe have one that kind of sits in between.\n\n140\n00:07:45.315 --> 00:07:50.316\nIt is an interior gateway protocol and\nthat's something known as EIGRP,\n\n141\n00:07:50.316 --> 00:07:53.796\nThe Enhanced Interior\nGateway Routing Protocol.\n\n142\n00:07:53.796 --> 00:07:57.593\nYou gotta love the name, it's telling\nme what type of protocol it is but\n\n143\n00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.900\nit actually started out,\nit's a proprietary one by the way.\n\n144\n00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:07.339\nThese other protocols are actually just\nopen standards if you will with the EIGRP.\n\n145\n00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:12.790\nThe EIGRP is actually proprietary to\nCisco, it's a Cisco based protocol.\n\n146\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.707\nIt was the successor to the earlier\nInterior Gateway Routing Protocol,\n\n147\n00:08:17.707 --> 00:08:19.971\nalso Cisco proprietary, IGRP.\n\n148\n00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:25.760\nSo you can considered enhanced interior\ngateway protocol as the upgraded IGRP.\n\n149\n00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.270\nOriginally, it was deployed as\nan interior gateway protocol but\n\n150\n00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:36.010\nit can be used as an EGP, an Exterior\nGateway Protocol but more commonly an IGP.\n\n151\n00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.370\nNow, Zach, you asked a question.\n\n152\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.146\nA blending of the two, what do we have?\n\n153\n00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:43.465\nTotal protonic reversal,\na crossing of the stream, right?\n\n154\n00:08:43.465 --> 00:08:44.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Said we should never do.\n\n155\n00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.645\n&gt;&gt; Getting back to\nthe Ghostbuster thing again.\n\n156\n00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:48.883\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, so\n\n157\n00:08:48.883 --> 00:08:54.267\nwhat's going on here is that EIGRP\ncan use distance vector technologies,\n\n158\n00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:59.320\nbut at the same time, it can also\nuse like our link-state bandwidth.\n\n159\n00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.224\nWhat bandwidth is available,\nwhat's the delay?\n\n160\n00:09:02.224 --> 00:09:04.648\nSee that's another thing that\nI mentioned about link-state.\n\n161\n00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:07.626\nIf there's a latency on the link to,\nso the quality of the link,\n\n162\n00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:11.530\nthe availability of the link, is it up or\nis it down, that's also in link-state.\n\n163\n00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.860\nBut it's also in EIGRP,\nright, because it's blending\n\n164\n00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.300\nportions of distance vector and\nportions of the link state technologies.\n\n165\n00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.020\nLoad utilization, again,\nlink reliability like we said.\n\n166\n00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.555\nBetter conversion times\nthan the earlier EIGRP.\n\n167\n00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:32.250\nAnd it uses something known as dual, and\nthat's the defusing update algorithm.\n\n168\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.880\nNot sure if that's gonna be on the exam,\nbut it is a characteristic of EIGRP.\n\n169\n00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.645\nSo, EIGRP, make sure I get that right,\n\n170\n00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.780\n[LAUGH] we don't want the old one so\nthat you'll know that on the exam.\n\n171\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.830\nSo that is one of those ones that\nkind of blends both characteristics\n\n172\n00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.140\nof distance vector and length state to\ngive you just a better routing protocol.\n\n173\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.820\n&gt;&gt; And I have another question.\n\n174\n00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.590\nYou mentioned the exterior protocols,\nright, the exterior.\n\n175\n00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.790\nCan we talk a little bit more about that?\n\n176\n00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.060\nCan you tell us a bit more about that?\n\n177\n00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.650\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, so\nif we go back to the slide,\n\n178\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.250\nremember one of the things\nthat I told you.\n\n179\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.840\nPrimarily, we've got those three\ninterior gateway protocols, right?\n\n180\n00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.470\nWe've got RIP, we've got RIP Version 2,\nits successor.\n\n181\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.280\nWe've got, what else?\n\n182\n00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.075\nOSPF as well as IGRP,\nwhich is old by now, and\n\n183\n00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:19.810\nthen enhanced interior gateway protocol.\n\n184\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.330\nAll of these sit on the internal network.\n\n185\n00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.230\nWell, or\nour internal to the autonomous system.\n\n186\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.410\nRemember, they don't broadcast that\ninformation across autonomous systems.\n\n187\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.390\nWell there is one out there that is\nan exterior gateway protocol and\n\n188\n00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.330\nthat's known as BGP.\n\n189\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.856\nNow BGP is interesting.\n\n190\n00:10:37.856 --> 00:10:41.909\nIf you're following along with the exam\nobjectives one of the things that you'll\n\n191\n00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:46.270\nnotice is that they call it a hybrid, it's\nreally technically a path vector protocol.\n\n192\n00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.710\nAnd let me show you what I mean by that,\nall right?\n\n193\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.022\nRemember that when I said\nthe interior gateway protocols, and\n\n194\n00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:54.710\nthe interior gateway routers,\n\n195\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.221\nthose are routers that actually\nsit on the inside of your network.\n\n196\n00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:03.007\nAnd they sit there and they basically\ncommunicate their routing topologies\n\n197\n00:11:03.007 --> 00:11:05.185\ninside of the autonomous system.\n\n198\n00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:10.850\nBut they don't broadcast that information\nto other autonomous systems, right?\n\n199\n00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.770\nNow this is where the border\ngateway routers come in, right.\n\n200\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.021\nRemember, we have autonomous\nsystem numbers out there.\n\n201\n00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:21.698\nA autonomous system, again as a recap,\nit's just a network that is under\n\n202\n00:11:21.698 --> 00:11:24.716\nthe control of a single\nadministrative body and\n\n203\n00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:27.620\nit adheres to a single routing policy.\n\n204\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.050\nWell, path vector protocol or\nborder gateway protocol is what your ISPs\n\n205\n00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.715\nuse to communicate across\nthe backbone of the Internet\n\n206\n00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:38.920\nin-between these autonomous systems\nthrough the border gateway routers.\n\n207\n00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.460\nThese border gateway routers,\nif you will, they actually communicate\n\n208\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.790\namongst each other and\nshare routing topologies, all right?\n\n209\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.766\nAnd they do that with\nthe Border Gateway Protocol.\n\n210\n00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:55.052\nIt uses things like the path, right,\nthrough those autonomous system numbers,\n\n211\n00:11:55.052 --> 00:11:59.525\nnetwork policies or rule sets to make its\ndecisions to send communications basically\n\n212\n00:11:59.525 --> 00:12:01.710\nalong the backbone of the Internet.\n\n213\n00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.470\nThis is how the core backbone routers,\nif you will,\n\n214\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:09.390\nand this is how the autonomous systems\ncommunicate across the Internet through\n\n215\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.050\nBGP, or the Border Gateway Protocol.\n\n216\n00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:18.030\nAll right, so we've come a long\nway here in our routing episode,\n\n217\n00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.820\nor a couple parts here now.\n\n218\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:27.008\nWe talked about the routing protocols,\nwe talked about how they communicate.\n\n219\n00:12:27.008 --> 00:12:31.590\nI do want to kind of mention something\nknown as the route types, all right.\n\n220\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.790\nWhen we talk about routing types, we've\nbeen talking about routing protocols.\n\n221\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.420\nRouting protocols,\nthese are dynamic protocols and\n\n222\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.530\nthey allow us to generate what\nare known as dynamic routes.\n\n223\n00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.798\nAll right, dynamic routes means that\nif something changes, these routers to\n\n224\n00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:51.666\nthe routes if you will something changes,\na link goes down, there's topology change.\n\n225\n00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:54.811\nThe routers can communicate and\nthey can update on the flood.\n\n226\n00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:58.248\nThey can update the routing tables\nremoving bad routes, replacing and then\n\n227\n00:12:58.248 --> 00:13:02.340\nputting entries in there for destination\nnetworks with better routes, right?\n\n228\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.560\nSo that happens dynamically, all right?\n\n229\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.396\nThere's a benefit to that, and\n\n230\n00:13:07.396 --> 00:13:11.482\nthere's also another routing type\nthat's called static routes too.\n\n231\n00:13:11.482 --> 00:13:12.850\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n232\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.675\nSo I got a little diagram that\nwe've used with our routers here.\n\n233\n00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:19.486\nAnd a dynamic route is one that has\nbeen generated by these routers\n\n234\n00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:21.020\ncommunicating, right?\n\n235\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.140\nThat analogy I used in the first\npart where Zach and I are talking.\n\n236\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:30.380\nZack says, hey, I got a better way for you\nto get to that destination in your car.\n\n237\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.428\nI say, okay, you know what?\n\n238\n00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:33.635\nI want that destination.\n\n239\n00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:35.176\nI'm gonna use that path now, and\n\n240\n00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:38.230\nI'm gonna quit driving an hour\nto the same destination, right.\n\n241\n00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.430\nThat's dynamically happening, right?\n\n242\n00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.980\nWell, there's always static routing,\nall right?\n\n243\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.606\nAnd static routing is different in the\nfact that kind of like when we talk about\n\n244\n00:13:48.606 --> 00:13:52.104\nDHCP, right,\nversus a manually entering an IP address.\n\n245\n00:13:52.104 --> 00:13:56.836\nRemember DHCP, the IP address can change\npotentially and it's generated or\n\n246\n00:13:56.836 --> 00:14:01.128\nit's given and leased over by a server\nversus me going in and typing and\n\n247\n00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:02.760\nmanually setting it.\n\n248\n00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.120\nWell, that's what a static route is.\n\n249\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.270\nA static route is one in which your\nnot using this routing protocol.\n\n250\n00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.630\nNo dynamic routing protocol is being used.\n\n251\n00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.870\nIn fact, the administrator is saying,\nhey, I want to define this route and\n\n252\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.340\nI don't want you to talk to anybody.\n\n253\n00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.135\nI'm not talking to Zach,\nI've got the best route, I know the route,\n\n254\n00:14:19.135 --> 00:14:20.270\nZach's out of the picture.\n\n255\n00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.500\nSorry Zack, picking on you there.\n\n256\n00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But that's essentially what's going on.\n\n257\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.439\nYou're saying,\nI am going to tell you what route to use.\n\n258\n00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:30.645\nI don't want you talking to these routers\nand trying to learn of a different route.\n\n259\n00:14:30.645 --> 00:14:32.340\nNow you might say, well wait a second.\n\n260\n00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.780\nHow is that beneficial?\n\n261\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.390\nWell, it has its benefits.\n\n262\n00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.870\nUnderstand that any time a router\nhas to inspect a routing table or\n\n263\n00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.250\nhas to update routes and\n\n264\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.620\nhas to make these decision, it's gonna\nbe using computational power, right?\n\n265\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.560\nI mean, that's its decision, there's\ncore logic with it, it's gonna CPU.\n\n266\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.680\nIt's gonna use RAM in order\nto make these decisions.\n\n267\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.650\nWell you can actually,\n\n268\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:58.520\nif you know that there's only a single\nroute in between two routers,\n\n269\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.490\nyou don't have like in this case where we\nhave routers that have multiple paths.\n\n270\n00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.790\nWell there's no reason to\nprocess a routing table,\n\n271\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.600\nthere's no reason to try\nto make decisions, right.\n\n272\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.064\nI can manually define that one route and\nwe can get a potential for\n\n273\n00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:16.644\nbetter performance.\n\n274\n00:15:16.644 --> 00:15:18.892\nCuz the router doesn't\nhave to sit there and\n\n275\n00:15:18.892 --> 00:15:21.880\ncalculate algorithms to\ndetermine what the best path is.\n\n276\n00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.120\nIt looks at the routing table and\nsays, I'm using this path.\n\n277\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.470\nSo you get that benefit, right,\nthat speed, if you will.\n\n278\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.470\nNow, the other thing too for security\npurposes, if you're defining a static\n\n279\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.100\nroute and we're not using the dynamic\nrouting tables, then it doesn't matter\n\n280\n00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.810\nwhat all the other routers are telling\nyou cuz it's not listening to that.\n\n281\n00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.042\nIt's gonna use that static route.\n\n282\n00:15:41.042 --> 00:15:44.769\nSo even for security purposes,\nit's good because I don't communicate with\n\n283\n00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:48.610\nanybody else to figure out how to\nget from this router to this router.\n\n284\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.523\nI already know what the answer is,\nright, it's manually fine.\n\n285\n00:15:51.523 --> 00:15:52.784\nNow that's the benefit, right?\n\n286\n00:15:52.784 --> 00:15:56.874\nIf you've only got that one route, no\nreason to process a routing table, right?\n\n287\n00:15:56.874 --> 00:16:00.082\nThe bad part of this, the drawback is, and\n\n288\n00:16:00.082 --> 00:16:04.896\nlet me show you what would happen\nto dynamic routing protocols,\n\n289\n00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:08.870\nis that if a link fails,\nwhat do the routers do?\n\n290\n00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.770\nNow whether you're using RIP or\nRIP version 2,\n\n291\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.100\nwhich you're probably not going to or\nyou're using OSPF.\n\n292\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.180\nEven though there's this convergence\ntime's different, these guys could\n\n293\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.380\ntalk to each other and they could find\nout, yeah, that route's failed, all right?\n\n294\n00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.790\nWell, that route's failed, so\nlet's get the traffic down another path.\n\n295\n00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.010\nWe'll remove that entry from our routing\ntable, and we'll learn a better path and\n\n296\n00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.620\nwe'll put it back in its place.\n\n297\n00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.620\nThen if the route comes back up,\nwell, guess what?\n\n298\n00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.530\nWe'll update that.\n\n299\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.600\nThat dynamically happens, right?\n\n300\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.130\nThat's why they call it dynamic routing.\n\n301\n00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.850\nWith the static route, if the route fails,\nyou're still gonna try to use it.\n\n302\n00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.470\nThe router isn't making a decision.\n\n303\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.510\nThe router isn't gonna communicate.\n\n304\n00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.150\nMy paths to my destination took\nme an hour and a half, and\n\n305\n00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.600\nnow I hit a bridge that was out.\n\n306\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.460\nI don't have the ability and\nthe luxury to call Jack and say, man,\n\n307\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.870\nyou've been out to this St.\nAugustine 100 times.\n\n308\n00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.100\nI need a better path, right?\n\n309\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.500\nI can't check Google Maps.\n\n310\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.464\nI can't check the Tom Tom if you will and\ntry to find a better path.\n\n311\n00:17:05.464 --> 00:17:07.760\nI'm gonna be sitting there\nwaiting at the bridge.\n\n312\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.110\nAnd that's the problem with static routes.\n\n313\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.400\nIt does have its benefit in the fact that\nyou're not gonna process a routing table,\n\n314\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.140\nbut if that route fails, unfortunately,\nyou're still gonna try to use it.\n\n315\n00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.970\nAnd you're not gonna\ntalk to another router.\n\n316\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.050\nSo again, it does have its benefits,\nand like anything else,\n\n317\n00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.160\nit does have its drawbacks.\n\n318\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.952\nNow there's another thing that\nwe also need to be aware of too.\n\n319\n00:17:27.952 --> 00:17:32.240\nAll right and the other thing is they talk\nabout what's known as the default route.\n\n320\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.170\nWell, inside of your operating systems, I\ncan actually give you an example of this.\n\n321\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.065\nWhen we talk about a default route,\nwhat we're talking about is,\n\n322\n00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:44.670\nwhere do I send information if I don't\nknow the destination network, right?\n\n323\n00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.750\nWell, inside of our computers, in fact, if\nwe get back into our Windows machine here,\n\n324\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.400\nand we look again at our routing table,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.598\nNotice that I have this 0.0.0.0,\nall right?\n\n326\n00:17:56.598 --> 00:17:57.843\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n327\n00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:02.931\nWell, that means that we've looked at\nall the routes that we're aware of,\n\n328\n00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:05.170\nand I don't have a destination.\n\n329\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.120\nI'm looking at the destination network\nin this packet, this IP header, and\n\n330\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.062\nI don't know where the network is,\nso where do I send it?\n\n331\n00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:14.556\nWell, our computer send it\nto the default gateway, and\n\n332\n00:18:14.556 --> 00:18:17.490\nthey're doing that through what's\nknown as the default route.\n\n333\n00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.695\nThis means if I search the routing table,\nI can't find the destination.\n\n334\n00:18:22.695 --> 00:18:26.400\nI don't know where to send it, I'm gonna\nsend it to the default route here.\n\n335\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.720\nAnd in this case, it's gonna be\nmy default gateway, all right?\n\n336\n00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.990\nAnd you can see that our\ngateway is this right here.\n\n337\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.760\nSo it says anything\nthat you don't know of,\n\n338\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.390\nwhich typically your operating system can\nuse ARP, the address resolution protocol.\n\n339\n00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:45.520\nUse its routing table and it can send\ninformation on its local network, but\n\n340\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.070\nit doesn't know how to send\ninformation on another network.\n\n341\n00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.230\nSo, it says I don't know whose\nnetwork this is, so let me go ahead.\n\n342\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.500\nI'll look at my routing table, and\nI'll send it to the all zero route.\n\n343\n00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.570\nAnd that essentially is telling\nit to send it to the router.\n\n344\n00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.350\nThe router,\nit's up to its job to sit there and\n\n345\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.760\ndetermine where to send this information.\n\n346\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.060\nSo that is the default route, and I want\nyou to be aware of it or for the exam.\n\n347\n00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.910\nNow if you don't have a default gateway,\nyou're not gonna see the default route.\n\n348\n00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.320\nAll right, and\nlet me kind of prove this to you here.\n\n349\n00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nopen our network and sharing center.\n\n350\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:23.300\nAnd I'm gonna completely change the\nproperties of our network adaptor, right?\n\n351\n00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.870\nSo, I'm gonna go to Internet Protocol\nVersion II, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n352\n00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.920\nchoose Properties.\n\n353\n00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.690\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm just\ngonna manually set an IP address.\n\n354\n00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.340\nI won't be able to connect\nto the Internet at all.\n\n355\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.140\nBut we'll go ahead and\nwe'll just do 10.10.10.\n\n356\n00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:44.470\nWe'll do 255, oops, there we go,\nlet's do 255.255.255.\n\n357\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.387\nAnd notice here, Zack,\nI'm not gonna set a default gateway,\n\n358\n00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:49.874\nwe'll just leave that\ndefault gateway out of there.\n\n359\n00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:52.348\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nsay okay, close.\n\n360\n00:19:52.348 --> 00:19:55.830\nYou can see it's an unidentified network,\nit's not gonna connect, but obviously,\n\n361\n00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.430\nit's not gonna able to\nconnect to the Internet, why?\n\n362\n00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.060\nWell, let's see.\n\n363\n00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.620\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll clear our screen here, and\n\n364\n00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.440\nwe'll rerun our route print option.\n\n365\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.020\nAnd I'll just do the V4.\n\n366\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.270\nAnd notice that, I don't have that.\n\n367\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.250\nI've got the local network that I'm\naware of, just like we did before.\n\n368\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.607\nRight, I don't have the 172\nhere because remember,\n\n369\n00:20:16.607 --> 00:20:20.340\nthat's the network that this computer's\nnow a part of, based on its netmask.\n\n370\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.280\nThis is its IP address, and this is\nthe broadcast address for that network.\n\n371\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.400\nBut notice what we're missing.\n\n372\n00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.865\nNotice that the default route goes away.\n\n373\n00:20:27.865 --> 00:20:28.461\n&gt;&gt; It's not there.\n\n374\n00:20:28.461 --> 00:20:31.558\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's because I said you know what,\n\n375\n00:20:31.558 --> 00:20:34.750\nI don't wanna have a default gateway,\nall right?\n\n376\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.258\nSo no default gateway, no default route.\n\n377\n00:20:37.258 --> 00:20:41.367\nNow I'm gonna go ahead and change this\nover to DHCP, cuz the DHCP server is\n\n378\n00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:45.870\nactually handing out a default gateway,\nwhich is what we want.\n\n379\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.070\nAnd I'll go ahead and just obtain\nit automatically, change this over.\n\n380\n00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.810\nAnd what it's gonna do is go\nback through that door process,\n\n381\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.950\ncalling out to the network, getting an IP\naddress, getting a subnet mask, and\n\n382\n00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.300\ngetting a default gateway.\n\n383\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.020\nAnd if we clear the screen here again, and\nwe do a route -print, oops, excuse me,\n\n384\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.440\nwe don't need a -print, we need a -4.\n\n385\n00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.318\nNotice that now that my default gateway\nis back, the default route is there.\n\n386\n00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:12.542\nAnd again, it just says,\nif you look in this routing table and\n\n387\n00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:15.715\nyou don't know what that network is,\nsend it to this route.\n\n388\n00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:19.010\nAnd again, that will basically\nsend it to your default gateway.\n\n389\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.950\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n390\n00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that has the majority of\nour concepts that we need to talk about.\n\n391\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.790\nNow, I know we're getting a little\nclose on time on this one, but\n\n392\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.390\nI got two more topics\nthat I want to mention.\n\n393\n00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.600\nAnd they put that here\nin our routing section.\n\n394\n00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.410\nAnd that is something known as\nnetwork address translation and\n\n395\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.700\nport address translation.\n\n396\n00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.618\nNow, they call it NAT and PAT, all right?\n\n397\n00:21:41.618 --> 00:21:43.475\nSo what is NAT?\n\n398\n00:21:43.475 --> 00:21:47.323\nAll right, now if you checked\nout our IP addressing episodes,\n\n399\n00:21:47.323 --> 00:21:51.099\nwe talked about the fact that\nthere are public IP addresses and\n\n400\n00:21:51.099 --> 00:21:53.144\nthere are private IP addresses.\n\n401\n00:21:53.144 --> 00:21:57.407\nRemember the public IP addresses are what\nwe use to communicate across the Internet.\n\n402\n00:21:57.407 --> 00:22:00.670\nWhen I need Internet access,\nwhat I do is I go to an ISP.\n\n403\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.310\nAnd I pay them a subscription or\nwhatever the subscription fee is.\n\n404\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.870\nAnd they essentially give\nyou a public IP address, and\n\n405\n00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.180\nthat allows you to communicate\nwith the Internet.\n\n406\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.200\nWhen you're not paying them, guess what?\n\n407\n00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.570\nThey revoke that public IP address, and\n\n408\n00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.670\nnow you can't communicate\nacross the Internet.\n\n409\n00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.970\nPublic IP addresses are how we\nroute traffic across the Internet.\n\n410\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.504\nUnlike the private IP addresses,\nwhich I believe is RFC1918, if you will,\n\n411\n00:22:24.504 --> 00:22:27.973\nrequest for comment 1918,\nthese private IP addresses,\n\n412\n00:22:27.973 --> 00:22:30.727\nthey're just used\ninternally on our networks.\n\n413\n00:22:30.727 --> 00:22:34.129\nAnd ICANN, the internet corporation for\nassigned names and numbers, and\n\n414\n00:22:34.129 --> 00:22:36.943\nIM before that, said hey,\nwe'll just set these to the side.\n\n415\n00:22:36.943 --> 00:22:41.840\nAnd you can use them internally in\nyour networks however you see fit.\n\n416\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.840\nBut you're not gonna be able to\ncommunicate across the Internet with them.\n\n417\n00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.510\nSo how is it that you can have\nten computers, let's say,\n\n418\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.900\non your internal networks?\n\n419\n00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.860\nYou get one IP address, I want you to\nthink about your network right now, right?\n\n420\n00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:59.170\nYou probably got a cell phone connected to\nyour WiFi network, it gets an IP address.\n\n421\n00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:03.630\nYou probably got maybe a Roku,\nit's got an IP address.\n\n422\n00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.170\nGuess what?\nIt's communicating out there\n\n423\n00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:05.770\nacross the Internet.\n\n424\n00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.530\nMaybe you have an Apple TV as well.\n\n425\n00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.934\nMaybe you've even got a television, right?\n\n426\n00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:12.680\nA TV, a smart TV,\nit's connected to the Internet.\n\n427\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.880\nAll these computers are communicating\nacross the Internet.\n\n428\n00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.290\nYet, when you went to your ISP,\n\n429\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.480\nyou were only given a single\npublic IP address, all right?\n\n430\n00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.180\nThat's through network\naddress translation, and\n\n431\n00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.125\nwhat it is is it's a packet mangling.\n\n432\n00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:26.730\nIt's a packet manipulation.\n\n433\n00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.800\nIt's a manipulation of the IP header, and\n\n434\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.990\nlet me show you what I mean by this,\nall right?\n\n435\n00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:35.905\nSo you are leased a public IP address,\nlet's say, from your ISP, all right?\n\n436\n00:23:35.905 --> 00:23:37.830\nYou have one public IP address.\n\n437\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:42.690\nNow on your internal networks, your\nmachines are using private IP addresses.\n\n438\n00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.302\nIn fact, we can kind of see this here.\n\n439\n00:23:44.302 --> 00:23:47.887\nIf I run my IPCONFIG,\nwe can see that this DHCP server\n\n440\n00:23:47.887 --> 00:23:52.220\nis actually configured to give\nus a class B private IP address.\n\n441\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.565\nYou can see 172.16 and\nthen dot anything, dot anything.\n\n442\n00:23:55.565 --> 00:23:57.989\nThat's in that class\nB Be private IP arrange.\n\n443\n00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:00.121\nBut let me see if I can.\n\n444\n00:24:00.121 --> 00:24:05.470\nI can ping a public IP address, and\nsure enough, I'm getting communication.\n\n445\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:09.039\nSo how is it that I tell you that\nyou can't communicate [LAUGH] across\n\n446\n00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:11.589\nthe Internet with a private IP address,\nbut yet\n\n447\n00:24:11.589 --> 00:24:13.520\nI can just ping a public IP address?\n\n448\n00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.081\nSo it sounds like I'm lying to you, right?\n\n449\n00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:16.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not really.\n\n450\n00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.150\nWhat's going on here is that in\nthis instance, what's happening is\n\n451\n00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.455\nthe network address translation\ndevice is receiving that packet,\n\n452\n00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:29.618\nright, with that IP header that\nhas the private IP address in it.\n\n453\n00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:32.913\nAnd what it does is it says,\nokay, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n454\n00:24:32.913 --> 00:24:37.444\nI'm gonna remove that private IP address,\nand I'll bookmark it in my table,\n\n455\n00:24:37.444 --> 00:24:40.130\nso I know which computer it came from.\n\n456\n00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.730\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nput my public IP address on it and\n\n457\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.840\nsend it out across the Internet.\n\n458\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.348\nAll right,\nnow when it comes back into the network,\n\n459\n00:24:48.348 --> 00:24:51.490\nwhat it does is it takes that public\nIP address off and removes it.\n\n460\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.078\nOops, [LAUGH] it removes it,\n\n461\n00:24:53.078 --> 00:24:56.690\nthat's why you shouldn't manipulate\na slide on the fly here.\n\n462\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.790\nAnd it removes it and it replaces\nit with the private IP address.\n\n463\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.345\nAnd I'm gonna get this\nright eventually here.\n\n464\n00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:06.368\n[LAUGH] So what we have essentially\nis a translation, right?\n\n465\n00:25:06.368 --> 00:25:08.613\nWe get ability to manipulate the packet.\n\n466\n00:25:08.613 --> 00:25:12.090\nNow, you also have what's known\nas port address translation.\n\n467\n00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:17.790\nAnd port address translation is the fact\nthat it also will check the porch, right?\n\n468\n00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:21.760\nIt will, like, for instance,\nin your home networks, right?\n\n469\n00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.216\nWhat it also will do is it will say,\nhey, I'm gonna do the same thing here.\n\n470\n00:25:26.216 --> 00:25:29.860\nBut in order to keep track of\nthe communication, I'm gonna actually pay\n\n471\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.340\nattention to the port number as well\nwhen I put that in that database.\n\n472\n00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.204\nAnd when that information comes back,\n\n473\n00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:38.374\nessentially what we're gonna go\nis it's gonna inspect the port.\n\n474\n00:25:38.374 --> 00:25:42.765\nAnd then what it does is it will replace\nthe internal private IP address with\n\n475\n00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:45.610\nthe port and deliver it to the endpoint.\n\n476\n00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.440\nAll right, so\nyou got port address translation, and\n\n477\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.090\nyou got network address translation.\n\n478\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.270\nAgain, network address translation and\nport address translation,\n\n479\n00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.970\nthey're kinda both using NAT, but\none is actually inspecting the port,\n\n480\n00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:02.560\nthat layer five port address,\nif you will, or TCCIP to port.\n\n481\n00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.170\nNow, the last thing I wanna mention, too,\n\n482\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.330\nis something known as port forwarding,\nall right?\n\n483\n00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.090\nAnd again, this kind of comes\nback to port address translation,\n\n484\n00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:15.345\nbut you have your devices that\ncan pay attention to the ports\n\n485\n00:26:15.345 --> 00:26:18.245\nthat are associated with a communication.\n\n486\n00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:22.995\nWell, when you receive a communication\ninbound into a network,\n\n487\n00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:25.835\nif you're doing port forwarding,\nyou can say, you know what?\n\n488\n00:26:25.835 --> 00:26:32.621\nThe device, let's say, the router, I want\nyou, anything that comes in on port 3389,\n\n489\n00:26:32.621 --> 00:26:36.537\nwhen you see that traffic\ncoming from the outside in.\n\n490\n00:26:36.537 --> 00:26:39.890\nAnd I can see that,\nthat TCCIP port is port 3389.\n\n491\n00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.081\nI want you to take that communication and\nforward it to this one computer.\n\n492\n00:26:44.081 --> 00:26:45.850\nIt's called port forwarding, right?\n\n493\n00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.610\nPort forwarding is a way that we can take\na certain type of traffic based on its\n\n494\n00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:54.850\nport number and send it to a specific\ncomputer inside of our internal network,\n\n495\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:55.820\nthat's port forwarding.\n\n496\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.960\nSo know what port forwarding is as well,\nand again, like I said,\n\n497\n00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.455\nas you go on to more advanced training,\n\n498\n00:27:01.455 --> 00:27:06.220\nyou're gonna see a little bit more on how\nto configure port forwarding as well.\n\n499\n00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.790\n&gt;&gt; Now once you said that we would\nlearn a little bit more about advanced\n\n500\n00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.860\nconfiguration in advanced courses, right?\n\n501\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So can you tell us a little\n\n502\n00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:13.780\nbit more about that, or\ncan you give us a glimpse?\n\n503\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely, so when we talk\nabout just basic port forwarding,\n\n504\n00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.270\nright, we can actually show you here.\n\n505\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.500\nSo I'm on a Linksys router.\n\n506\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.056\nIf we take a look at my computer here,\n\n507\n00:27:22.056 --> 00:27:24.487\nyou'll see that we're just\nin the basic web interface.\n\n508\n00:27:24.487 --> 00:27:26.509\nAnd one of the things that you'll find,\n\n509\n00:27:26.509 --> 00:27:30.138\nyou'll find this a lot in your\napplications and gaming, cuz gamers will\n\n510\n00:27:30.138 --> 00:27:33.785\nexpect a certain, here's another\nway that you might see this, right?\n\n511\n00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:38.339\nAnd you might see that when you're doing\nthings like online gaming and stuff,\n\n512\n00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.168\nthat they're expecting\ncertain port values and\n\n513\n00:27:41.168 --> 00:27:44.563\ncertain types of traffic to be\nsent to a certain computer.\n\n514\n00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:47.536\nIf I've got five computers\nwithin my internal network and\n\n515\n00:27:47.536 --> 00:27:51.479\nonly one of them is my gaming rig, then I\nwanna make sure that all of that gaming\n\n516\n00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:55.560\ntraffic goes straight to that computer and\ndoesn't go to any other computers.\n\n517\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.218\nRight, so what we can do is we can do port\nforwarding here, and usually on your home\n\n518\n00:28:00.218 --> 00:28:04.557\nrouters and stuff like that, you'll\nfind it under application in gaming.\n\n519\n00:28:04.557 --> 00:28:06.584\nI just happen to be in Linksys, right?\n\n520\n00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:10.719\nAnd what we can do is we can say hey, I\nwanna forward a specific type of traffic,\n\n521\n00:28:10.719 --> 00:28:13.477\nlet's say, for instance,\nit doesn't have to be,\n\n522\n00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:15.572\nI'm just giving gaming as an example.\n\n523\n00:28:15.572 --> 00:28:22.090\nBut notice it's saying, if you see a port\nfor 53, in this case, it's DNS traffic.\n\n524\n00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:26.913\nI want you to send that to, let's say,\na computer on my network and\n\n525\n00:28:26.913 --> 00:28:31.235\nlet's say it's 192.168.1.12, all right?\n\n526\n00:28:31.235 --> 00:28:35.818\nThen what I can do is I can enable that,\nand we can go ahead and\n\n527\n00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:38.130\nsave those settings.\n\n528\n00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.860\nAnd when we continue,\nlet's see if it does save it, yep.\n\n529\n00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.340\nThen what it's telling me is that,\nhey, any time I see DNS traffic\n\n530\n00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.610\nbound for port 53 in this case,\nit is going to see that,\n\n531\n00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.320\ninspect that information, and\nit's gonna send it to this one computer.\n\n532\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.960\nRight, so this just happens to be an\nexample of doing a single port forward for\n\n533\n00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.810\na single type of communication.\n\n534\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.300\nAnd again, it's gonna identify that.\n\n535\n00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.110\nYou seen it there for\n\n536\n00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.130\na second, that it was gonna identify\nit based on its port number.\n\n537\n00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.430\nSo, notice it's saying\nexternal port coming in.\n\n538\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.940\nI see the traffic, in this case now,\nwe've changed it to HTTP traffic.\n\n539\n00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.804\nWhen I see this traffic come in, send\nit to this computer or this IP address,\n\n540\n00:29:17.804 --> 00:29:18.341\nright?\n\n541\n00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:18.841\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n542\n00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:19.934\n&gt;&gt; Basic port forwarding there,\n\n543\n00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:21.526\nlike I said, it can get more advanced.\nBut\n\n544\n00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:25.858\nat least you could kind of see the basics\nand what is going on behind the scenes.\n\n545\n00:29:25.858 --> 00:29:27.831\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as usual, Wes, and\n\n546\n00:29:27.831 --> 00:29:32.729\nRouting Technologies, Part 2, an essential\nepisode in the CompTIA Net+ series,\n\n547\n00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.750\nmake sure you watch all of them.\n\n548\n00:29:34.750 -->

00:00:08.529\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.146\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:14.306\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.710\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.780\nI'm Zach Memos, your host as we\ncontinue on with CompT and NetPlus.\n\n8\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.830\nThis episode is network\nperformance concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.740\nAnd Wes is right here to show us the way.\n\n10\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.840\nWes, good to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.260\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.078\nThat's right,\nwe have been working through,\n\n13\n00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:37.104\nessentially a few concepts when it\ncomes to routing and switching.\n\n14\n00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.211\nWe’ve looked at things like\nthe characteristics of our traffic,\n\n15\n00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:42.596\nsome of the properties that\nyou have to be aware of,\n\n16\n00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:46.702\nwe’ve talked about things like broadcast\ndomains, the communication times, we’ve\n\n17\n00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:51.030\nlooked at switching technologies, we've\nalso looked at routing concepts, too.\n\n18\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.695\nAnd as we move through those different\nshows, we've been looking really at that\n\n19\n00:00:54.695 --> 00:01:00.078\n1.3 domain there if you're following\nalong at home with the objectives there.\n\n20\n00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:04.250\nAnd it is basically understanding\nthe concepts of routing and switching, and\n\n21\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.880\nwe kind of divvied them up a little bit so\nthat we could group them together in\n\n22\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.490\nwhat I feel is in the appropriate manner,\nright?\n\n23\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.402\nBecause when we're talking about switching\ntechnologies we're talking about\n\n24\n00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:16.340\nVLANs, right?\n\n25\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.360\nWell, that should be grouped\ntogether with the switches.\n\n26\n00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.800\nAnd if we talk about something like\nrouting information protocol or OSPF,\n\n27\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.700\nthat should be part of our\nrouting technologies, right?\n\n28\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.520\nSo one of the last things\nthat we kind of want to,\n\n29\n00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.160\nagain if you've been following along with\nus, one of the last things we kind of\n\n30\n00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.240\nround off are some network performance\nconcepts just like Zach said here.\n\n31\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.280\nAnd we're gonna look at how you can\nmanipulate your communications a little\n\n32\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.020\nbit to ensure that\ndifferent types of traffic\n\n33\n00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.360\nget the network resources they need,\nbecause when you think about it,\n\n34\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.210\nwe've got a network,\nwe've got a certain amount of bandwidth.\n\n35\n00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.560\nAnd we sometimes need to prioritize, what\ntypes of traffic get to their end point,\n\n36\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.300\nthe closer to real time, if you will,\nand maybe even like some traffic,\n\n37\n00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.580\nlike traditional and old traffic that we\ncan slow down a little bit to ensure that\n\n38\n00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.400\nreal time traffic gets to\nwhere it needs to be on time.\n\n39\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.700\n&gt;&gt; Well that sounds like\na network shaping, right?\n\n40\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.670\n&gt;&gt; It's close, it's called\ntraffic shaping, all right, and\n\n41\n00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.730\nin fact what we're going to look at\nis more of an umbrella term, right?\n\n42\n00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.520\nWe call it quality of service, right?\n\n43\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.540\nAnd quality of service really is,\n\n44\n00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.500\nthere's many different ways we\ncan achieve a quality of service.\n\n45\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.950\nBut imagine that you've got one,\n\n46\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.310\nlet's say one communication, and\nit's hogging all of your bandwidth.\n\n47\n00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.308\nLet's say for instance, somebody's on\nyour network viewing things like YouTube,\n\n48\n00:02:34.308 --> 00:02:36.540\nright when maybe they should be working.\n\n49\n00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.510\nAnd what's causing, it can cause problems\nwith things like voice over traffic,\n\n50\n00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.360\nvoice over IP communications, right?\n\n51\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.110\nIn which we need to kind\na ensure a faster delivery.\n\n52\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.130\nWell if somebody is hogging all of\nour bandwidth in a certain area,\n\n53\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.040\nthen what happens is those, the end\nuser experience starts to degrade right,\n\n54\n00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.120\nand certain communications we start\nto notice performance hindrances\n\n55\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.110\ninside of our network.\n\n56\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.530\n&gt;&gt; So traffic shaping can\naffect our network performance.\n\n57\n00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.820\n&gt;&gt; It can, it can.\n\n58\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.270\nAnd we need to kind of understand\nwhat's going on here when it comes to\n\n59\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.070\ntraffic shaping.\n\n60\n00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.770\nNow traffic shaping can be broken down\ninto some categories as well, all right?\n\n61\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.510\nFor instance, on your exam objectives,\nthey call out what is known as traffic\n\n62\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.380\nshaping and they also mention a little\nbit about what's known as policing.\n\n63\n00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.910\nActually, they just call\nit traffic shaping, really.\n\n64\n00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.520\nBut again, I'm gonna break it down\ninto three different concepts.\n\n65\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.410\nWe're gonna talk about\ntraffic shaping itself.\n\n66\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.940\nWe're gonna talk about\ntraffic policing and\n\n67\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.215\nthen last I wanna talk\nabout reservations too.\n\n68\n00:03:32.215 --> 00:03:33.640\nBecause really, again,\n\n69\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.100\nin the context of the exam objectives\nthey just mention traffic shaping.\n\n70\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.550\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n71\n00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.740\nlet's first give you a scenario\nwhere maybe I need traffic shaping.\n\n72\n00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.280\nAll right, again, you want to ensure\nthat certain types of traffic\n\n73\n00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.290\nget the level of performance,\nthe level of your network communications\n\n74\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.500\nthat they need in order to give\na better experience, right?\n\n75\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.840\nWe have older traffic types like\nsome of the most common ones and\n\n76\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.420\nagain classic traffic types,\nthings like FTP, file transfer protocol,\n\n77\n00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.650\nthings like HTTP, right, your web traffic.\n\n78\n00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.740\nWell they can do a little bit\nbetter with a little bit of delay,\n\n79\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.090\nI mean HTTP might be\na little exception there.\n\n80\n00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.360\nYou're talking about end users, right?\n\n81\n00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.360\nBecause end users want to\nget to your website, and\n\n82\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.760\nthey want the fastest and\nbest experience possible.\n\n83\n00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.010\nBut if you look at stuff like\nFile Transfer Protocol, been around for\n\n84\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.480\na very long time, and it's not\nnecessary because it is optimized for\n\n85\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.290\na large file transfer that it consumes\nall of your network bandwidth.\n\n86\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.730\nBut we can actually kinda\nslow that traffic down.\n\n87\n00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.530\nAnd if we look at our bandwidth,\nit's more of a piece of pie, right?\n\n88\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.540\nAnd we can give a greater piece of pie to\nthings like voice conferencing, right?\n\n89\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.690\nVideo conferencing,\nvoice over IP communications,\n\n90\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.670\nthings that need to get there\na little bit faster, right?\n\n91\n00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.830\nBecause File Transfer Protocol,\n\n92\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.320\nit can handle a little bit of a delay,\na moderate amount of delay, right?\n\n93\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.770\nThings like video, video conferencing,\nit can't handle a lot of delay right?\n\n94\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.260\nIt needs to be closer to real time.\n\n95\n00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.125\nBut the other thing we\nneed to look at is video\n\n96\n00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:04.880\nconferencing We can implement\na little bit of packet loss, right?\n\n97\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.150\nBecause in video conferencing, I don't\nneed to rebuild and reassemble packets,\n\n98\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.150\nif you will, and cause a glitch inside\nof the video stream that we're watching,\n\n99\n00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.050\nright, versus something like FTP where\nwe really can't have packet loss.\n\n100\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.800\nPacket loss leads to file corruption,\nright?\n\n101\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.540\nSo we need to be able to mix and match and\nkinda put the pieces of our network\n\n102\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.190\ncommunications bandwidth where we need\nthem and that's what traffic shaping.\n\n103\n00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.300\nOne of the many components under\nquality service traffic shaping allows\n\n104\n00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.260\nus to do so.\n\n105\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.280\nLet's talk about a little bit\nmore about traffic shaping.\n\n106\n00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.700\nI got a little diagram here and\n\n107\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.870\nwhat we're gonna do is kind of do\nthis in 8-bit increments, right.\n\n108\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.970\nWe're gonna say well if I\nwant to shape the traffic,\n\n109\n00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.200\nit essentially allows me the ability\nto do bandwidth management.\n\n110\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.420\nManipulate the data in order to\nget prioritization to certain\n\n111\n00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.560\ntraffic as well as reducing\nthe heavy impact or\n\n112\n00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.110\nthe impact that heavy bandwidth users\nwould have on any one person's experience.\n\n113\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.590\nIt's like I said, we're watching\na lot of YouTube communications then\n\n114\n00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.000\nwe've got unnecessary\ntraffic on our network and\n\n115\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.800\nwe need to make sure that we can\nshape that a little bit more.\n\n116\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.740\nSo let's say that we're\nworking on a policy,\n\n117\n00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.740\nif you will that says hey,\nyou can only use 8 bits of bandwidth.\n\n118\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.650\nWell if I'm doing traffic shaping,\nhow does that work for us?\n\n119\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.820\nWell if we're talking about\njust basic traffic shaping,\n\n120\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.058\nwe're saying there's 8 bits of information\nand that's kind of our ceiling, our cap.\n\n121\n00:06:34.058 --> 00:06:37.410\nWell notice that if I\nhave 6 bits of bandwidth,\n\n122\n00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.620\nwhat does traffic shaping do for me?\n\n123\n00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.615\nAbsolutely nothing,\nI don't even notice it., right?\n\n124\n00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:47.081\nBut how about this, how about if\nwe send 7 bits of traffic, right?\n\n125\n00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.642\nWell, how does traffic shaping affect\nme there on those communications?\n\n126\n00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:53.147\nWell, it doesn't, right?\n\n127\n00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:56.748\nIf I'm sending less than whatever the cap\nis, whatever the policy says, hey,\n\n128\n00:06:56.748 --> 00:06:59.814\nyou're gonna send this amount and\nyou're not gonna send anymore,\n\n129\n00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:02.050\nit doesn't affect you if you send less,\nright.\n\n130\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.560\nAnd we don't even know.\n\n131\n00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.100\nBut let's consider,\nwhen we talk about traffic shaping,\n\n132\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.800\na random line in\nthe middle of the diagram.\n\n133\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.679\nLet's go ahead and pull this over and\nlet's say hey, well what happens if you\n\n134\n00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:16.032\nsend 8 bits of information while\nyou are still within the policy?\n\n135\n00:07:16.032 --> 00:07:17.445\nNothing really happens.\n\n136\n00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:19.635\nBut here's where it\nstarts to come into play.\n\n137\n00:07:19.635 --> 00:07:22.815\nI want you to notice that we\nhave this 9th bit, all right?\n\n138\n00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:26.362\nWe say hey, the cap is 8 bits.\n\n139\n00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.152\nAnd again we're just using this for\ntheory purposes.\n\n140\n00:07:28.152 --> 00:07:30.532\n8 bits, what happens to the 9th bit?\n\n141\n00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:34.292\nWell, this is where you have to know\nthe difference between traffic shaping and\n\n142\n00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:38.732\ntraffic policing, again it's all really\npart of adjusting your bandwidth.\n\n143\n00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:43.243\nBut what happens to this 9th bit is\nreally different when we talk about\n\n144\n00:07:43.243 --> 00:07:45.005\nshaping versus policing.\n\n145\n00:07:45.005 --> 00:07:49.589\nSo Zach, if we look here our 9th bit,\nwhat's gonna happen to that,\n\n146\n00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:53.461\nwell if we go over the cap,\nit's gonna be put in a buffer and\n\n147\n00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:58.127\nwhat's going to happen is- The network\nadapter is gonna buffer it and\n\n148\n00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:02.620\nsays, you know what,\nI can't send that 9th bit right now.\n\n149\n00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.050\nSo what we'll do is we'll put it in\na buffer, and we'll allow communication to\n\n150\n00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.480\nkeep happening, and when the network's\nfree, we'll send that 9th bit.\n\n151\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.310\nThat's traffic shaping,\nand what it says is,\n\n152\n00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.820\nyou're not going to send any\nmore information than just this.\n\n153\n00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.370\nNow there's a little bit more to that\ncuz I want to talk about policing and\n\n154\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.370\nthen we'll compare the two.\n\n155\n00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.900\nBecause what happens to that extra traffic\n\n156\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.280\nis polar opposite different when it\ncomes to the two different concepts.\n\n157\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.155\nSo lets go ahead and let's talk\na little bit about Traffic Policing.\n\n158\n00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:35.405\nNow, remember what we said, Traffic\nPolicing we're saying 8 bits is the cap.\n\n159\n00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:39.205\nSo anything less than that,\nif I say, okay, here's 8 bits,\n\n160\n00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:44.155\nand I say, well, somebody sending, I don't\nknow, let's say 3 bits of information.\n\n161\n00:08:44.155 --> 00:08:46.175\nWell, they don't really notice it, right?\n\n162\n00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:50.390\nAnd if, let's say they send 7 bits,\n\n163\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.550\nwell just like traffic shaping\nit really doesn't affect us.\n\n164\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.120\nBut now what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nplay a little bit of devil's advocate and\n\n165\n00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.820\nI'm gonna bring out that pesky\n9th bit again, all right?\n\n166\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.590\nSo what happens to the 9th bit?\n\n167\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.850\nYou're over the cap.\n\n168\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.740\nNow here's the big difference.\n\n169\n00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.550\nNotice when I said traffic shaping, what\nwe do is we buffer the excess information.\n\n170\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.014\nIf it's over what the policy states,\nor the rule states if you will,\n\n171\n00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:16.580\nwe're gonna buffer that bit.\n\n172\n00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.425\nAnd when the line is free, we're gonna\ntry to keep sending that information, but\n\n173\n00:09:20.425 --> 00:09:23.300\nwe're gonna make sure\nit's no more than 8 bits.\n\n174\n00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.880\nPolicing, it does a little bit different.\n\n175\n00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.100\nAnd instead of doing a buffer if you will,\n\n176\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.080\nlike we just did with shaping,\nit doesn't do a buffer.\n\n177\n00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.830\nIn fact, it's called policing because\nwhat it does is it takes that 9th bit and\n\n178\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:47.640\nit essentially will send it directly to\nthe garbage, all right, electrical limbo.\n\n179\n00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.620\nSo what happens is with policing,\nany extra information, it's thrown out.\n\n180\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.810\nSorry, you can't send any\nmore information on that.\n\n181\n00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.790\nWe're not shaping the traffic,\nwe're not saying, okay,\n\n182\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.820\nI just want this steady rate and anything\nextra will be buffered and then sent.\n\n183\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.000\nNo, policing says, you're gonna\nsend this amount of information,\n\n184\n00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.585\nif you send more,\nI'm just going to discard it.\n\n185\n00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:10.690\nSo that is something to understand\n\n186\n00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.220\nwhen it comes to the difference between\ntraffic shaping and traffic policing.\n\n187\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.790\nNow there's another one\ntoo that we have and\n\n188\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.260\nthat is something known as reservations,\nall right.\n\n189\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.580\nAnd what I want you to understand\nwith reservations is that is\n\n190\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.010\nkind of like saying,\nall right, well you know what,\n\n191\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.490\nI've got one device that's very,\nvery important in my network.\n\n192\n00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.440\nVery important, all right, and\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say that\n\n193\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.075\nthis device,\nI'm gonna reserve that bandwidth.\n\n194\n00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:41.653\nI'm going to say, 8 bits,\nyou're guaranteed 8 bits,\n\n195\n00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:45.304\nI'm going to reserve a portion\nof the network bandwidth for\n\n196\n00:10:45.304 --> 00:10:48.607\nyou to make sure you have\nthat 8 bits when you need it.\n\n197\n00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:51.929\nThat's reservation, it's still traffic\nshaping, you're still manipulating\n\n198\n00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:54.885\nthe bandwidth, but there is, you can\ndo this in a couple of ways, right?\n\n199\n00:10:54.885 --> 00:10:58.320\nI can say, Zach, you always are going\nto have time to speak here.\n\n200\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.130\nNow, he's been hosting with us for\na while now and\n\n201\n00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.366\nhe knows that if I'm talking nobody\nis going to be able to talk.\n\n202\n00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:06.545\n[LAUGH] But\nmight not be a good analogy here but-\n\n203\n00:11:06.545 --> 00:11:07.878\n&gt;&gt; it's a hierarchy.\n\n204\n00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:10.589\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right,\nso I'm going to say, Zach,\n\n205\n00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:12.687\nyou know you are going to\nbe reserved this time.\n\n206\n00:11:12.687 --> 00:11:16.295\nNow what do we do with that time,\nwhat do we do with that bandwidth?\n\n207\n00:11:16.295 --> 00:11:19.480\nWell here's where the two differences come\nin, you can do a reservation that says,\n\n208\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.050\nZach, I'm going to reserve you\nthat time and it's set in stone.\n\n209\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.590\nIt's just going to be there, waiting for\n\n210\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.780\nyou and you know what, we're going to take\nit away from the rest of the network.\n\n211\n00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.790\nSo if you have a very high priority\nsystem that you need that bandwidth,\n\n212\n00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.652\nyou need to make sure that\nit's always open, right?\n\n213\n00:11:36.652 --> 00:11:40.320\nJust like we're reserving the bat phone,\nwe need to know that if Batman makes that\n\n214\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.530\ncall, he's got that bandwidth\nwhen he needs it, or\n\n215\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.540\nwe could say same thing,\nmake a reservation.\n\n216\n00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.340\nBut what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n217\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.590\nuse that bandwidth while\nyou're not using it, right?\n\n218\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.620\nSo it's kind of like dinner reservations,\nthe table doesn't get reserved and\n\n219\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.350\nthen nobody uses it the rest of the night,\nright?\n\n220\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.930\nUnless you're maybe an A-list celebrity,\nmaybe that's the case.\n\n221\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.060\nBut notice what they do,\nyou have a reservation for\n\n222\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.990\nthat table during the time that you\nneed it but then during the rest\n\n223\n00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.930\nof the hours of that business-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n224\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Other people are gonna use it.\n\n225\n00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.088\nAll right,\nnow the difference is when the time comes,\n\n226\n00:12:13.088 --> 00:12:16.417\nthat table is cleared and\nit's available for you.\n\n227\n00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:19.057\nSo reservations are really no different,\nso understand that\n\n228\n00:12:19.057 --> 00:12:22.270\nthere is a few different ways that we\ncan manipulate and shape the traffic.\n\n229\n00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.170\nShaping says, send only this amount\nof information, anything extra\n\n230\n00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.570\nwill be buffered and the next time we have\nfree time on the wire, we'll send it.\n\n231\n00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.720\nPolicing says,\nsend only this amount of information and\n\n232\n00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.780\nif you send more, throw it out,\nsorry too bad no food for you.\n\n233\n00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.090\n[LAUGH] Last one says, reservation says,\nwe're gonna guarantee you that you have\n\n234\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.340\nthis amount of information and when\nyou need it, it will be there for you.\n\n235\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.620\nNow, how, again like I said,\nit can always be ready and available and\n\n236\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.190\nthat might produce problems, right?\n\n237\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.420\nBecause now we've got a portion of our\nbandwidth that's not being utilized at all\n\n238\n00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.340\nsometimes, maybe it's 20% utilization but\nit's always reserved.\n\n239\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.870\nOr we say, go ahead and use it and when\nyou need it, it's going to be reserved,\n\n240\n00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.691\nit will be there for you.\n\n241\n00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:07.260\n&gt;&gt; So question for you Wes,\nwho would use the traffic policing?\n\n242\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.150\nIt seems to me that would\nbe very prohibitive.\n\n243\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.570\n&gt;&gt; Well it would, but this is more about\ncontrol over how much information.\n\n244\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.540\nSo I tell you what, so\nif we've got something like this.\n\n245\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.260\nLet's go back to the diagram\nhere real quick, right?\n\n246\n00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.589\nSo here, was our bandwidth you know that\nour user that was watching YouTube was\n\n247\n00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:26.402\nusing prior to us policing the traffic.\n\n248\n00:13:26.402 --> 00:13:28.880\nAll right, but here is and\nin fact let me go ahead and\n\n249\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.500\njust get this out of here and\nwe'll use another one.\n\n250\n00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:39.290\nAll right, now here is the person\nthat was using that 9th bit.\n\n251\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.976\nRight, well policing I might\nsay you know what, this is,\n\n252\n00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:45.472\nhere this is YouTube traffic, right?\n\n253\n00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:48.789\nSo in YouTube traffic I, and\nI'm not picking on YouTube in general,\n\n254\n00:13:48.789 --> 00:13:53.210\nI'm just saying because it's consuming our\ninformation during business hours, right?\n\n255\n00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.070\nThis isn't about YouTube, all right?\n\n256\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.320\nBut I'm gonna say, you know what\nYouTube traffic, I'm gonna police it.\n\n257\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not important, so\n\n258\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.500\nif you're using more of my information\nI'm gonna cap you there and\n\n259\n00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.775\nanything else you try to\nuse I'm going to discard.\n\n260\n00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:12.348\nVersus if this was a voice over IP system,\nI might wanna not do policing on it.\n\n261\n00:14:12.348 --> 00:14:15.164\nI might wanna do traffic shaping on it,\nwhere I say,\n\n262\n00:14:15.164 --> 00:14:17.468\nyou know what it is an important system,\nso\n\n263\n00:14:17.468 --> 00:14:21.889\nwhat we'll go ahead and do it put that cap\nin there, and then voice over IP system.\n\n264\n00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:24.745\nIf you need to send it again, or\nmaybe not even voice over IP,\n\n265\n00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:27.430\nsome other important\ntraffic on our network.\n\n266\n00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.540\nYou will have access to\nthat information and\n\n267\n00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.827\nwe'll put it down there in the bottom,\nright?\n\n268\n00:14:31.827 --> 00:14:36.266\nSo and again it just allows the\nadministrators to take this overall larger\n\n269\n00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:40.162\nsize of pie, your bandwidth,\nand then divide it accordingly.\n\n270\n00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:44.280\nAll right, so that's a couple\nof things that you need to know,\n\n271\n00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.570\njust about traffic shaping.\n\n272\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.140\nNow there are a few other terms\nthat we need to be aware of, and\n\n273\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.720\none of them like I mentioned\nis quality of service.\n\n274\n00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:59.630\nQuality of service is basically, like I\nsaid the umbrella term that says hey,\n\n275\n00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.030\nI'm gonna identify the traffic, then\nI'm gonna classify the traffic, right?\n\n276\n00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.600\nSo we need some tools to be able\nto identify and classify it, but\n\n277\n00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.580\nthen we also need actions that\nare applied once we identify it, right?\n\n278\n00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.135\nSo for instance and\nwe talked about access control listing,\n\n279\n00:15:14.135 --> 00:15:18.010\nanother subject,\nI need to identify who you are first.\n\n280\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.940\nZach, I gotta say, hey, who are you?\n\n281\n00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.682\nWill you present me with\nyour identification badge?\n\n282\n00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:25.030\nI mean even though I know Zach,\nyou present an ID badge.\n\n283\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.560\nIt's like, okay,\nwe've classified who you are.\n\n284\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.730\nYou're a host here with ITProTV.\n\n285\n00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.558\nNow, what level of access do you have,\nright?\n\n286\n00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:34.450\nSo inside of quality of service,\n\n287\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.923\nwe need mechanisms that allow us to\nidentify the traffic and then classify it.\n\n288\n00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:44.196\nIdentify what type is it, and then,\nhow are we gonna prioritize it, right?\n\n289\n00:15:44.196 --> 00:15:45.808\nSo, and these are a couple of,\n\n290\n00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:49.160\nthese are some of the things that\nQuality service allow us to do.\n\n291\n00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.095\nAnd there's many different ways,\n\n292\n00:15:51.095 --> 00:15:56.420\nthere's different parameters that we can\napply to our traffic in order to do that.\n\n293\n00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.900\nNow, to kinda understand\nwhat we mean by that,\n\n294\n00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.820\nyou kinda have to look\nat an ethernet frame.\n\n295\n00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.380\nRemember, I'm talking about manipulating\nyour data a little bit, right,\n\n296\n00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.920\nto be able to again,\nidentify what type of traffic it is and\n\n297\n00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.060\nclassify it, a based on a priority level.\n\n298\n00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.930\nWell, so let's go ahead, and let's kind\nof dive into the ethernet frame here,\n\n299\n00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.070\nthat I've got, right?\n\n300\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.587\nSo this is just a standard ethernet frame,\nand we'll also talk a little bit, too.\n\n301\n00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:24.282\nCuz one of these actually falls within a\nswitching technology that we talked about\n\n302\n00:16:24.282 --> 00:16:26.971\ncalled VLAN tagging, right, 802.1Q.\n\n303\n00:16:26.971 --> 00:16:29.950\nSo here is our regular ethernet frame,\nright?\n\n304\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.310\nAnd kinda go through the pieces that we\nhave here, we've got a preamble, right?\n\n305\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.850\nThe preamble is just a set of bits that\nallows the receiving device to synchronize\n\n306\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.560\ntheir time clocks, right, synchronization.\n\n307\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.470\nThen the next thing that we have is\nwhat's known as the start of frame.\n\n308\n00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.240\nThe start of frame is a delimiter,\njust an 8 bit field\n\n309\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.230\nthat basically marks the end of the\npreamble and the beginning of the frame.\n\n310\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.511\nThat's really all it's there for,\nall right?\n\n311\n00:16:53.511 --> 00:16:56.730\nNow you probably remember that\nwe've talked about these, right?\n\n312\n00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.960\nWe've got a Destination MAC address,\nright?\n\n313\n00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.160\nThat tells the switch where's it going.\n\n314\n00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.760\nSource MAC address says hey,\nwhere'd it come from?\n\n315\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.017\nNow the ethertype,\nthe ethertype is interesting,\n\n316\n00:17:07.017 --> 00:17:10.364\nyou might hear it called ethertype,\nyou might hear it called called length.\n\n317\n00:17:10.364 --> 00:17:12.405\nCuz depending on how it's implemented.\n\n318\n00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:17.380\nEthertype just tells,\nit tells the switch essentially\n\n319\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.600\nwhat upper layer protocols are actually\nencapsulated inside of this frame, right?\n\n320\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.393\nRemember the encapsulation is happening\ndown there at the data link layer.\n\n321\n00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:26.845\nSo, the ethertype just says hey,\n\n322\n00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:30.385\nthis is the type of protocol that's\nencapsulated within the ethernet frame.\n\n323\n00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:32.715\nOr, it could be used as a length, right?\n\n324\n00:17:32.715 --> 00:17:35.455\nAnd it just denotes the length\nof the frame itself.\n\n325\n00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.520\nSo, it could be used for either or.\n\n326\n00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.240\nNow, we have our data right, and\nwell data's kinda self explanatory there.\n\n327\n00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.370\nThat's the stuff that we wanna send.\n\n328\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.210\nAll this other stuff is\nadded to the frame, so\n\n329\n00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.840\nthat we can get it where it needs to go.\n\n330\n00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.050\nYou have a 1500 byte, by default,\na 1500 byte payload limit.\n\n331\n00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.300\nIf you don't hit the 1500 limit,\nsometimes they'll put padding there,\n\n332\n00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.300\nso that's just why I put padding there,\nit's optional.\n\n333\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.700\nAnd then you have the frame check\nsequence, sometimes checks and sequence,\n\n334\n00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.230\nbut the frame check sequence,\nall that is is a 32 bit value.\n\n335\n00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.800\nIt's technically what's known as a CRC,\na cyclic redundancy check, it's for\n\n336\n00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.520\nintegrity checking, right, we do store and\nforward in our switching, all right?\n\n337\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.750\nSo that's the ethernet frame.\n\n338\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.700\nHow do I identify this information and\nstart to classify it?\n\n339\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.630\nWell, this is where we\nget into the 802.1Q, and\n\n340\n00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:30.550\nI'll tell you what all of this under my\nhead here is, in a bit, we'll get there.\n\n341\n00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.252\nBut, now I want you to notice that\nwe still have the same format,\n\n342\n00:18:33.252 --> 00:18:36.373\nwe got the preamble, the start of frame,\nwe got the destination source.\n\n343\n00:18:36.373 --> 00:18:39.030\nWe'll come back to\n802.1Q here in a second.\n\n344\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.160\nWe got the ethertype, data,\npadding, frame checks and sequence,\n\n345\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.330\nso nothing different than the earlier\nethernet frame, all right?\n\n346\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.889\nBut if I have frame that needs to go to\na specific Vlan, what's gonna happen?\n\n347\n00:18:52.889 --> 00:18:57.460\nIts gonna have the 802.1Q Vlan tag.\n\n348\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.121\nNow inside of that tag,\nwe've got some interesting information.\n\n349\n00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:05.351\nIf we're to take that tag out, we kind\nof break it down into its component and\n\n350\n00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:06.369\nsee what it looks like.\n\n351\n00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:08.510\nYou would have a Tag Type.\n\n352\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.280\nThis just identifies the frame\nis being tagged or untagged,\n\n353\n00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.430\nkinda like we talked about\nin other episodes, right?\n\n354\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.810\nTagging means it's going to a VLAN,\n\n355\n00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.120\nuntagging means it's either on the\ndestination VLAN or it's an access port.\n\n356\n00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.260\nBut then we have this priority, all right?\n\n357\n00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.620\nAnd I'm gonna skip over that just for\n\n358\n00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.210\na second cuz that's really\nwhere the action's at.\n\n359\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.935\nThat's what we're focusing on.\n\n360\n00:19:26.935 --> 00:19:30.570\nThen you have the CFI that's\ncanonical format indicator,\n\n361\n00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.850\nit's not really used today.\n\n362\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.750\nIt was used for an inner operability\nbetween ethernet networks and\n\n363\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.680\ntoken ring in the earlier days,\nit's pretty much unused today.\n\n364\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.530\nAnd then last but\n\n365\n00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.720\nnot least, well the VLAN identifier,\nit identifies what VLAN you're on, right?\n\n366\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.430\nBut here's where we talk\nabout the priority.\n\n367\n00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.130\nThe priority essentially\nis used to give a frame,\n\n368\n00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.290\nthe priority level for different classes.\n\n369\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.210\nAnd this is an earlier class\nof service if you will.\n\n370\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.330\nAnd you can see that within these bits,\n\n371\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.650\nwe can denote what's\nthe priority of the traffic?\n\n372\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.890\nRight?\nWe can see that certain\n\n373\n00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.110\nbits are reserved, right?\n\n374\n00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.970\nAnd then you can see if\nwe tag it with five, and\n\n375\n00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.870\nthis should give you some\nkind of application, right?\n\n376\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.860\nVideo conferencing, call signalling,\nhigh priority, medium priority, or\n\n377\n00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.580\neven best effort.\n\n378\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.747\nBest effort just means, hey I am going\nto try to put it across the network,\n\n379\n00:20:17.747 --> 00:20:19.496\nwe're going to hope that it gets there.\n\n380\n00:20:19.496 --> 00:20:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Cross those fingers.\n\n381\n00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.837\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this is where they\ntalk about class of service.\n\n382\n00:20:24.837 --> 00:20:28.560\nAll right now,\nif you move up the OSI model by one layer,\n\n383\n00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.590\nthis is where we get into some\nof our other stuff right?\n\n384\n00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.920\nYou'll see that they have what's\nknown as the DiffServ code-point.\n\n385\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.990\nNow, this is a layer of three\ntechnology that allows us to implement\n\n386\n00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.920\nquality a service.\n\n387\n00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.830\nAnd to kinda understand what's going on\nhere, this is just a basic IP header,\n\n388\n00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.800\nif you will,\nif we can take a look at this.\n\n389\n00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.120\nAnd you can see that there's some\ndifferent information here, right?\n\n390\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.980\nBack here, essentially, this is all gonna\nbe encapsulated by the frame, right?\n\n391\n00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.150\nSo we're moving up to layer three here.\n\n392\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.690\nAnd inside of this,\nyou have your version in your IP header,\n\n393\n00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.500\nyou have your type of service.\n\n394\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.940\nAnd this is an older field,\nthis kinda predated our\n\n395\n00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.860\ncurrent quality of\nservice implementations.\n\n396\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.710\nYou had the length there as well.\n\n397\n00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:17.330\nAnd we look at the,\nyou have versioning length,\n\n398\n00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.800\nyou've got the length of the IP header,\nyou've got the identifier.\n\n399\n00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.940\nThe idea if you will, offset for\nfragmentation time to leave how\n\n400\n00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.090\nmany hops this gonna go through\nbefore it package discarded.\n\n401\n00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.280\nProtocol, protocols what transport\nprotocols we are using and\n\n402\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.550\nthen you have like an IP checks in as well\nand then your source of destination IP.\n\n403\n00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.712\nAnd then finally your data.\n\n404\n00:21:38.712 --> 00:21:43.220\nAll right.so, big old long drawn out\nthing to talk about the IP header.\n\n405\n00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.380\nAnd in that IP header we\nhave the type of service.\n\n406\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.570\nNow in the earlier days they were using\nsomething known as IP precedents.\n\n407\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.920\nAnd IP precedents was a three bit field,\nand\n\n408\n00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.020\nit was kinda limiting,\nwhen we talk about it.\n\n409\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.160\nIt didn't allow for a lot of flexibility,\n\n410\n00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.120\nbecause the rest of the bits in\nthis eight bit value were unused.\n\n411\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.050\nToday however, we use what is\nknown as Diffserv Code Point to\n\n412\n00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.350\nimplement quality of service and\nDSCP is what it's called.\n\n413\n00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:16.970\nAnd with the Diffserv that 5-bit field,\nit allows us to define things\n\n414\n00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:22.725\nlike the priority type and even things\nlike or the probability of being dropped.\n\n415\n00:22:22.725 --> 00:22:27.835\nAnd that's an interesting thing that\ntype of service didn't have, right?\n\n416\n00:22:27.835 --> 00:22:30.091\nDiffserv just identifies the traffic,\n\n417\n00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:33.417\nit places a classification on\nthe traffic in the IP header.\n\n418\n00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:36.297\nAnd then finally, allows for\ngreater classification,\n\n419\n00:22:36.297 --> 00:22:38.440\nincluding the drop probability.\n\n420\n00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.760\nNow if you need to see this information\ntoo as you go on to more and\n\n421\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.880\nhigher level certifications as\nyou go into your networking.\n\n422\n00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.360\nYou'll definitely learn\nabout this more in Cisco but\n\n423\n00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.330\nthis is what we want you to know for now.\n\n424\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.060\nThe DiffServ Code Point.\n\n425\n00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.240\nAnd Zach,\nthere are tonnes of these DSCP codes.\n\n426\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.300\nAnd again, because five bits,\nyou got a lot more flexibility there.\n\n427\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.575\nYou don't need to know all\nof the individual codes and\n\n428\n00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:09.471\njust kind of remember for the exam\nwhy I would see you're DSCP, right,?\n\n429\n00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.352\nWhat would we use it for\n\n430\n00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:17.320\nagain a lot more flexibility than\nthe earlier three bit IP precedents.\n\n431\n00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.750\nNow, moving on, there is another,\nI did look here at my notes and\n\n432\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.600\nthere's another topic\nthat I wanna mention.\n\n433\n00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:30.160\nI know we're running at the end down here,\nbut I want you to know two concepts,\n\n434\n00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.090\nbandwidth throttling and\nrate limiting, right?\n\n435\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:38.600\nRate limiting is, again, that shaping\nthat we're talking about as well, right?\n\n436\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.170\nThat's part of traffic shaping.\n\n437\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.506\nThe other one is bandwidth throttling,\nand bandwidth throttling is\n\n438\n00:23:45.506 --> 00:23:49.101\nslowing the amount of bandwidth\nthat can be consumed, all right.\n\n439\n00:23:49.101 --> 00:23:50.270\n&gt;&gt; Just like using the throttle.\n\n440\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.771\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly why they call it\nthrottling, and this is one of those\n\n441\n00:23:53.771 --> 00:23:57.850\nthings that when they got into the net\nneutrality debate and stuff like that.\n\n442\n00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.610\nThey're like, ISPs they're gonna\nbe slowing down people that\n\n443\n00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.590\nare streaming traffic, right?\n\n444\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:07.200\nBecause they were looking, and again,\nI think I heard one statistic that said\n\n445\n00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.860\n70 to 80% of all of the bandwidth was\nbeing taken up by streaming media.\n\n446\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.072\nSo they're gonna say hey,\n\n447\n00:24:12.072 --> 00:24:15.877\nwe're gonna reduce the amount of bandwidth\nthat we allow people to stream media for.\n\n448\n00:24:15.877 --> 00:24:19.417\nSo they are not the heavy bandwidth\nconsumers over the other people that\n\n449\n00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:21.135\nare maybe trying to get work done.\n\n450\n00:24:21.135 --> 00:24:24.792\nSo throttling again just like in\nCPUs we say throttling those of you\n\n451\n00:24:24.792 --> 00:24:29.760\nthat are coming over from A+ we're slowing\nthe rate of the bandwidth down, right?\n\n452\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.188\nRate limiting is outbound of your network.\n\n453\n00:24:32.188 --> 00:24:35.090\nFrom inbound to outbound if you will.\n\n454\n00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.810\nAnd that's slowing down\nthe amount of traffic or\n\n455\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.230\nthe amount of bandwidth that any one\nperson or one device might be consumed.\n\n456\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.050\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic.\n\n457\n00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.090\nWell Network Performance Concepts,\nlove this episode.\n\n458\n00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.200\nA lot of great information.\n\n459\n00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.430\nIn fact, Wes has done a wonderful job with\nthe entire series of CompTIA Net plus.\n\n460\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.980\nMake sure you watch each and every video.\n\n461\n00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.960\nAnd when you're in that course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos there.\n\n462\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.940\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n463\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.760\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV,\nbecause ITPRO.TV is binge-worthy.\n\n464\n00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.580\nI'm Zack

00:00:12.046\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.440\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.335\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.128\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n7\n00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:23.220\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net + IP\naddressing is the title of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.120\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to help us out.\n\n9\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.320\nWes, great to have you here.\n\n10\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.983\nThanks-\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:27.983 --> 00:00:32.157\nThis is going to be one of those topics\nthat if you're getting into networks for\n\n12\n00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:35.445\nthe first time,\nif you're coming into network plus, well,\n\n13\n00:00:35.445 --> 00:00:39.075\nthis is gonna be an interesting,\nand very, very important topic.\n\n14\n00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:43.306\nAs we go through this journey, we're gonna\nbe talking about some of the components,\n\n15\n00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:45.319\nthe characteristics of IP addressing.\n\n16\n00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:51.053\nWe'll look at, again, individual pieces\nand what different IP addresses do for\n\n17\n00:00:51.053 --> 00:00:54.817\nus, all right here in this episode\n&gt;&gt; So if I get get this right,\n\n18\n00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:58.071\nIP addressing is how we determine\nwhere information is going.\n\n19\n00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:59.857\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach, that's absolutely right.\n\n20\n00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:04.230\nWhen we talk about IP, the internet\nprotocol, it's interesting protocol that\n\n21\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.381\nessentially allows us to send\ninformation from source and\n\n22\n00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.270\ndestination across our network.\n\n23\n00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.000\nRemember LSI model as we talk about\nit comes down those layers from\n\n24\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.050\nthe application layer, and\n\n25\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.630\nonce it hits the network layer, we have an\nenvelope, kinda like a snail mail, right?\n\n26\n00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.290\nWe've got a packet that is ready to go to,\nbut it doesn't know where to go.\n\n27\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.020\nAnd it's kinda like adding that mailing\naddress and that return address, right?\n\n28\n00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.520\nYour return address is\nyour source address or\n\n29\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.710\nthe snail mail that you're gonna\nsend across the USPS, right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.250\nAnd your mailing address, if you will,\n\n31\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.870\nthat's where you're gonna\nsend the information, right?\n\n32\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.900\nSo we have our return mailing address and\nwe have our outbound mailing address.\n\n33\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.160\nWell, it's no different.\n\n34\n00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.900\nWith IP,\nyou're gonna have a source IP address.\n\n35\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.170\nIt lets us know where\nthe communication came from.\n\n36\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.220\nThen you're going to have\na destination IP address.\n\n37\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.840\nAnd that is going to let\nthings like your routers know,\n\n38\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.350\nhey, what network do I send this to,\nand ultimately, what end point, right?\n\n39\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.740\nWhat end system do we\nsend this information to?\n\n40\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.640\nSo let's go ahead and let's look at\nsome of the format of this information.\n\n41\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.490\nLet's dive in to where our\nWindows 10 machine here.\n\n42\n00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.380\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna open a command prompt.\n\n43\n00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.770\nAnd let's go ahead and\nclear the screen and\n\n44\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.310\ngive us a little bit\nmore real estate here.\n\n45\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.960\nWhat I'm going to do is\nI'm going to run ipconfig.\n\n46\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.970\nWe'll just run this very basically.\n\n47\n00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.775\nIpconfig, I want you to remember\nwhat this utility is used for,\n\n48\n00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.620\ncuz we're going to use it and\nwe will use it, already have pretty much,\n\n49\n00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.750\na lot throughout this entire net\nplus series, as well as the A+.\n\n50\n00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.880\nIt's an important one to\nknow inside of Windows, and\n\n51\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.030\nyou can say that this is about\nWindows IP configuration, right?\n\n52\n00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.320\nThis allows us to configure the parameters\nof your network adapter, right?\n\n53\n00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.680\nSo if I was to open up my network adapter,\nby the network and sharing center,\n\n54\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.650\nand I was to look at this information\nin the graphical user interface,\n\n55\n00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.260\nif we pull this to the side,\nyou can see here in command prompt, right?\n\n56\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.110\nI can see ethernet zero.\n\n57\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.750\nWell here in the graphical user interface,\nI can see ethernet zero likewise, and\n\n58\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.370\nif I want to find out some more\nof this detailed information\n\n59\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.099\noutside of the command prompt, we can just\nright click on it, I can choose status.\n\n60\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.830\nAnd then, here is our the status\nof these network adapter and\n\n61\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.830\nI could choose more,\nmore want I really want here is details.\n\n62\n00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.915\nAnd when I choose details,\n\n63\n00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:20.250\nI can see a lot of same information\nthat we seen here with IP config, right?\n\n64\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.430\nI can see my IP before address,\nwe can see our mac address too,\n\n65\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.382\nthat's important layer to address.\n\n66\n00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:28.480\nBut here, we're just dealing with\nlayer three information, right?\n\n67\n00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.490\nI can see that you, IPv4 address,\n\n68\n00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.250\nwe're gonna talk about because we have\ntwo different internet protocols, right?\n\n69\n00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.210\nWe have IPv4, which has been\naround since the days of way back\n\n70\n00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.150\nwhen the internet was\nbasically first born.\n\n71\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.170\nWe also have the next generation too,\nwe have IPv6, which we'll also\n\n72\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.180\ntalk a little bit about in IP addressing,\nthroughout this episode, as well.\n\n73\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.160\nMaybe not in this episode,\nbut a part two or part three.\n\n74\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.020\nNow, I wanna look a little\nbit at this IPv4 Address,\n\n75\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.214\nand I kinda wanna talk about,\nwell what is that IPv4 address, not\n\n76\n00:04:02.214 --> 00:04:07.480\nonly does it, not just what does it\nallow us to do, but the actual DNA?\n\n77\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.170\nYou have to kinda understand how\nan IPv4 address works, right?\n\n78\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.400\nSo you can see that I have an IPv4\naddress, I have a subnet mask,\n\n79\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.450\nas well as a default gateway.\n\n80\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.700\nWe can see that information.\n\n81\n00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.110\nI'm gonna go ahead and close this down and\n\n82\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.970\nI'm gonna get back to the command prompt\nthere just so you're familiar with this.\n\n83\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.010\nBe familiar with this output on the exam,\n\n84\n00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.150\nbecause they could give you something\nlike a screenshot like this.\n\n85\n00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.950\nThey don't even tell\nyou that it's ipconfig.\n\n86\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.760\nThey just scroll past it and you have\nto know what the output looks like.\n\n87\n00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.960\nBut you can see, I have an IPv4 address.\n\n88\n00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.600\nI also have a subnet mask,\nas well as a default gateway.\n\n89\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.530\n&gt;&gt; So the subnet mask,\nwhich I'm looking at right here.\n\n90\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.070\nWhat do these components do?\n\n91\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.310\nWhat's going on here?\n\n92\n00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay well, the subnet mask,\nthat's interesting,\n\n93\n00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.190\nI am glad you asked that, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.980\nSo the subnet mask, what it is responsible\nfor, and as we look at the DNA,\n\n95\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.390\nthe makeup of a IP address,\nwhat it actually is,\n\n96\n00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.750\nthe subnet mask defines what\nnetwork we're on, all right?\n\n97\n00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.250\nAnd let's understand that the IPv4\naddress, it is expressed for\n\n98\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.540\nus humans here in what's known\nas dotted decimal notation.\n\n99\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.426\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n100\n00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:19.098\n&gt;&gt; A dotted, you can see here that we\nhave four individual blocks of numbers,\n\n101\n00:05:19.098 --> 00:05:20.592\nfour decimal numbers.\n\n102\n00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:25.007\nAnd we actually pronounce the dots,\nbelieve it or not, when you're gonna\n\n103\n00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:30.982\npronounce this in networking, you don't\nsay 10 period 0 period 14 period 20, 120.\n\n104\n00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:33.053\nActually, you pronounced them as dot,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:33.053 --> 00:05:38.614\n10 dot zero dot 14 dot 120.\n\n106\n00:05:38.614 --> 00:05:41.610\nWell that's how we see it as humans,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.920\nBut as far as the computer is concerned,\n\n108\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.550\nthe computer doesn't deal\nwith this decimal values.\n\n109\n00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.302\nComputers deal in binary.\n\n110\n00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:52.820\nBinary is just ones and zeros, right?\n\n111\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.700\nThere's only two possible values,\nthere's a zero and there's a one, right?\n\n112\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.850\nBinary zero, binary one.\n\n113\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.100\nIt's what we call a base\ntwo numbering system.\n\n114\n00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.500\nUnlike a decimal notation, which we're\nused to, this is what we're familiar with.\n\n115\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.780\nDecimal value is just for us humans.\n\n116\n00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.592\nNow, underneath, there's actually\n32 binary bits that represent what\n\n117\n00:06:13.592 --> 00:06:19.336\nthe computer sees in an IP address,\nit's actually a 32 bit identifier.\n\n118\n00:06:19.336 --> 00:06:21.915\nNow, back to your question,\nthe subnet mask.\n\n119\n00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:26.231\nThe subnet mask, when applied to\nthis 32 bit identifier, and again,\n\n120\n00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:32.278\nit's also expressed in dot and decimal\nnotation, you'll see 255.255.255.0.0.\n\n121\n00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:35.903\nBut when we look at binder,\nwhich we gonna show you coming up,\n\n122\n00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:40.500\nwhen a subnet mask is applied to an IP\naddress, it actually divides it up.\n\n123\n00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.640\nThe subnet mask tells us what\nnetwork this computer is on.\n\n124\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.400\nIt also tells us what portion of this IP\naddress is unique to the actual host.\n\n125\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.160\nIn this case, this host, this computer\nhere, that has the IP address, right?.\n\n126\n00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.330\nSo the subnet mask, primarily,\nis applied to your IP address.\n\n127\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.840\nAnd it defines what the network is.\n\n128\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.150\nAnd we'll show you how that\nworks here in a second,\n\n129\n00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.270\njust to kind of understand\nit going forward.\n\n130\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.320\nThe default gateway,\nwhat is the default gateway?\n\n131\n00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.780\nWell, when we look at the default gateway,\n\n132\n00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.210\nthe default gateway is the IP\naddress of the router.\n\n133\n00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.390\nWhen I need to send my traffic\noff of the local network,\n\n134\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.050\nmy computer doesn't understand routing,\nthat's not what it does.\n\n135\n00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.330\nSo it's gonna look at, it's interesting,\nit will look at something internally,\n\n136\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.910\nit will look at a routing table that\nwe'll talk about in another episode.\n\n137\n00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.790\nAnd it says, hey,\nI recognize the local network,\n\n138\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.670\ncuz I can apply my subnet mask to my\naddress, the computer can do that.\n\n139\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.338\nAnd it says, I know what that word on.\n\n140\n00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:46.661\nAnd if I look at the destination IP\naddress and I apply that subnet mask,\n\n141\n00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:50.839\nthe same one I have, to it, and\nwe go through a process that, again,\n\n142\n00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.082\nwe'll look at coming up,\nI can identify that, hey,\n\n143\n00:07:54.082 --> 00:07:58.330\nthis information is destined for\nthe network that I'm on.\n\n144\n00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.418\nAll right, I don't need the router.\n\n145\n00:07:59.418 --> 00:08:03.063\nHowever, if I apply my subnet\nmask the destination IP address,\n\n146\n00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:06.920\nand I don't get my network,\nI don't know what network that's on.\n\n147\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.173\nSo I need to get it to a device, if you\nwill, that can get that off of this local\n\n148\n00:08:11.173 --> 00:08:14.780\nnetwork can route that traffic\nto another network, all right?\n\n149\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.580\nAnd that's the job of the router.\n\n150\n00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.670\nSo the default gateway inside of\nthe TCP/IP communication protocol stack,\n\n151\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.720\nif you will, is nothing more than really\nthe IP address of the router, all right?.\n\n152\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.300\nOr as you'll learn in other\nepisodes that we've done,\n\n153\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.530\na layer three switch that also\nunderstands the IP information, right?.\n\n154\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.350\nSo the default gateway is,\n\n155\n00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.120\nthink of it this way, it's the doorway\noff of your local network, right?\n\n156\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.550\nIf I am gonna leave my house and I'm\ngonna go, how do I get to the next house?\n\n157\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.220\nWell, I got to go out the doorway, right?\n\n158\n00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.905\nI got to go out the front door to be able\nto go into the door of another house.\n\n159\n00:08:49.905 --> 00:08:53.620\nYour default gateway as the gateway of\nthe door, off of your local network.\n\n160\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.778\nNow, one of the things that I did mention\nis that I said that an IP address, right,\n\n161\n00:08:58.778 --> 00:09:00.967\nit is, there are four blocks, all right?\n\n162\n00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:04.210\nWell, these blocks are actually\ncalled octets, right?\n\n163\n00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.989\nBecause remember, an IP address underneath\nis actually binary information.\n\n164\n00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:13.710\nIt's 32 ones and zeros, right?\n\n165\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.158\nAnd I don't know if they're ones or zeros,\nand we'll show you how you find that out\n\n166\n00:09:17.158 --> 00:09:20.818\nas well cuz that's important to understand\nwhat we call decimal to binary conversion.\n\n167\n00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:24.363\nAnd we can kinda show you what\nthe computer is doing when it applies\n\n168\n00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:25.550\na subnet mask.\n\n169\n00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.233\nAnd it determines what\nnetwork we're on and\n\n170\n00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.060\nwe'll also look at these components,\nright?\n\n171\n00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.260\nBut these are called octets.\n\n172\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.450\nAnd from the left to the right,\nyou have what's known as the first octet,\n\n173\n00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.024\nsecond octet, third and\nfourth octets, right?\n\n174\n00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.486\nAnd it is important to understand that,\nright,\n\n175\n00:09:41.486 --> 00:09:43.476\nunderstand what the octet is, right?\n\n176\n00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:47.348\nEven though we're seeing it\nin decimal representation,\n\n177\n00:09:47.348 --> 00:09:51.810\neach block is eight bits,\neight bits wide, hence the term octet.\n\n178\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.420\nNow it is important to understand\nhow we do the conversion, right?\n\n179\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.714\nAnd this is gonna be important so\nyou get a basis for\n\n180\n00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:03.335\nwhat is going on when a subnet\nmask is applied, right?\n\n181\n00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:06.533\nWe have to be able to determine\nwhat network we're on, and\n\n182\n00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:10.646\nin order to do that, sometimes we actually\nhave to see those binary ones and\n\n183\n00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:12.170\nzeros to be able to do that.\n\n184\n00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.050\nSo that's the next thing\nthat we are gonna do.\n\n185\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.770\nWe are gonna go ahead, all right, and\nwe are gonna take a couple of examples of\n\n186\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.070\nIP addresses and we are gonna\nkind of convert them to binary.\n\n187\n00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.621\nCuz I do want you to see\nan example of the octet,\n\n188\n00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:29.550\nthe bits that are within an IP address,\nall right?\n\n189\n00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.844\nSo i've got a couple of examples here of\nIP addresses that we´re gonna go ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:34.844 --> 00:10:36.460\nwe´re gonna convert.\n\n191\n00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.804\nWe´re gonna use these three IP addresses,\nand what we´re gonna do is we're gonna\n\n192\n00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:44.777\ntake them from the dotted decimal\nnotation, and we´re gonna transfer, or\n\n193\n00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:48.462\nconvert them over, if you will,\ninto the binary format, all right?\n\n194\n00:10:48.462 --> 00:10:49.990\nSo let´s go ahead and do that.\n\n195\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.850\nAnd the first thing that we have to do,\nis we kinda have to understand\n\n196\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.385\nthe difference between the base-2 and\nthe base10 numbering system, right?\n\n197\n00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:59.990\nBase-10 numbering system, that's where\nwe getting to our decimals, right?\n\n198\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.350\nWe recognize our decimal values, right?\n\n199\n00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.721\nWhen we talk about base-10,\nwhy do they call it base-10?\n\n200\n00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:08.620\nBecause at it's base there\nare ten possibilities, right?\n\n201\n00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.707\nZero, one, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, eight, nine, right,\n\n202\n00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:14.550\nten possibilities, zero counts.\n\n203\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.010\nThat's not what computers speak, though.\n\n204\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.510\nUnfortunately, well fortunately, I guess,\nthat depends on your perspective,\n\n205\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.820\ncomputers speak in binary in\nterms of binary information.\n\n206\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.650\nAnd there are only two possibilities,\nhence the term base-2.\n\n207\n00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:35.810\nThe base numbering system\nis either a zero or a one.\n\n208\n00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.570\nNow, the other thing I want you to\nunderstand is that there are a certain\n\n209\n00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.020\namount of place values that you have to be\naware of, certain place values that you\n\n210\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.180\nhave to be aware of to be able to do\nthe decimal to binary conversion.\n\n211\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.293\nAnd I've got an example so\n\n212\n00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:52.850\nyou can kind of compare it to something\nthat maybe you're already aware of.\n\n213\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.200\nMaybe you've seen, right?\n\n214\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.820\nWhen we do a math problem,\nright, we typically,\n\n215\n00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.400\nwe don't do the math problem in binary,\nwe do it in decimal, right?\n\n216\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.440\nAnd we have to know, in order to add\nappropriately or subtract appropriately,\n\n217\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.860\nwe need to know what our place values are,\nright?\n\n218\n00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.773\nAnd if you remember your place values,\nright?\n\n219\n00:12:10.773 --> 00:12:14.134\nIf I had a number like,\nlet me take a number, I don't know,\n\n220\n00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:15.696\njust a random number here.\n\n221\n00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:21.180\nLet me take a number like, I don't know,\nlet's say 1234, right, 1,234.\n\n222\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.490\nWell, how do I know that that's 1,000?\n\n223\n00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.640\nHow do I know that it's 200?\n\n224\n00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.530\nHow do I know that it's 34?\n\n225\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.680\nWell, I know it because,\nI know the place values, right?\n\n226\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.384\nBecause if you look at 1,234, right?\n\n227\n00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:37.150\nWhat is that first, what is a four?\n\n228\n00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.440\nWhat place value is the four in?\n\n229\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.080\nWell, it's in the one's position, right?\n\n230\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.400\nWhen we look at our place values,\nthat's in the one's position.\n\n231\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.460\nAnd the two, or the three,\nI should say, where's the three at?\n\n232\n00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.290\nWell, the three is actually\nin the ten's place value.\n\n233\n00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.161\n&gt;&gt; So if it was just 34, right?\n\n234\n00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:58.830\nI would know,\nlet me click on that, there we go.\n\n235\n00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.690\nif it was just 34, right?\n\n236\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.250\nI'd have a four in the one's\nposition place value.\n\n237\n00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.750\nI'd have a three in the ten's place value.\n\n238\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.926\nAnd as we go up, if I add a two,\nnow I've got it's 234.\n\n239\n00:13:10.926 --> 00:13:17.370\nAnd I know that it's 200 because the two\nis sitting in the 100 place value.\n\n240\n00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:17.870\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n241\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.187\nAnd as I add a one, guess what?.\n\n242\n00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:21.931\nWell, now, I've got 1,234.\n\n243\n00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:22.469\nWell,\n\n244\n00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:27.730\nwhy do I know that that one is\nactually in the thousands place?\n\n245\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.260\nI know the place value, right?\n\n246\n00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.200\nI know that it's the thousand place value.\n\n247\n00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.710\nNow, how do we come up with these numbers?\n\n248\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.930\nWell, I want you to remember\nthat it's an exponential, right?\n\n249\n00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.741\nIt's an exponential value.\nAnd to find the place values in base-10,\n\n250\n00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:41.120\nit's ten to the power of zero.\n\n251\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.932\nWell, remember anything to\nthe power of zero is one, right?\n\n252\n00:13:43.932 --> 00:13:48.140\nAnd then ten to the power of one,\nten times one is ten.\n\n253\n00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.650\nTen to the power of two is ten times ten,\nthat gives me 100.\n\n254\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.064\nTen to the power of three, that's ten\ntimes ten times ten, gives me 1,000.\n\n255\n00:13:54.064 --> 00:13:58.490\nAnd we keep on going up as\nwe work our place values.\n\n256\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.735\nIn this case, if we were to say eight\nplace values wide including zero,\n\n257\n00:14:03.735 --> 00:14:07.090\nten to the power of seven\nwould be 10 million, right,\n\n258\n00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.580\nthat would be our place\nvalue at 10 million.\n\n259\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.401\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's something we know.\n\n260\n00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:16.588\nWe know when we look at\nsomething that is 15,777,216,\n\n261\n00:14:16.588 --> 00:14:22.540\nI know how to speak that because\nI know what the place values are.\n\n262\n00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.658\nWell in base-2 this isn't so\ncommon to us, right?\n\n263\n00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:27.090\nWe kinda gotta learn this.\n\n264\n00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.780\nWe gotta kinda understand that\nthe place values are different.\n\n265\n00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.600\nThe exponentials are the same,\nfor most, the exponents, right?\n\n266\n00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.580\nIt's still to the power of zero,\nto the power of one, to the power of two,\n\n267\n00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.770\nto the power of three, but because\nwe're dealing with only two values,\n\n268\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:48.690\na base-2 is two to the power of\nwhatever the specific place value is.\n\n269\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.290\nSo when I look I can see that\ntwo to the power zero is what?\n\n270\n00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.870\nWell, anything to the power\nof zero is always one, right?\n\n271\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.428\nSo two the power of zero is one.\n\n272\n00:14:56.428 --> 00:15:01.960\nTwo to the power of one, two times one\nis well, what is it, it's two, right?\n\n273\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.246\nAnd then two to the power of two,\nis two times two is four, and\n\n274\n00:15:06.246 --> 00:15:11.475\nwe go all the way across to two to\npower of seven we get a 128, all right?\n\n275\n00:15:11.475 --> 00:15:15.600\nNow, why am I going\neight place values wide?\n\n276\n00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.400\nWell, if you remember, remember what\nI told you your blocks were called?\n\n277\n00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.730\nThey were called an octet.\n\n278\n00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.880\nAnd I said that's because we see it as\ndecimal notation, because it is easier for\n\n279\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.520\nus to read a decimal notation than it\nis to remember 32 ones and zeroes.\n\n280\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.960\nIt is a lot easier for me to tell Zach,\nhey, you know what, Zach?\n\n281\n00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.077\nYour IP address is 70.201.10.126.\n\n282\n00:15:38.077 --> 00:15:42.374\nRather than literally\nrattling off 32 ones and\n\n283\n00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:46.700\nzeros, and\nasking poor Zach to remember that.\n\n284\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.256\nI couldn't remember that, right?\n\n285\n00:15:48.256 --> 00:15:51.382\nSo that's why we represent it as\ndotted decimal notation cuz as humans,\n\n286\n00:15:51.382 --> 00:15:52.930\nit's easier to work with, right?\n\n287\n00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.777\nBut there are times When you need to\nknow how to take it from the decimal\n\n288\n00:15:57.777 --> 00:16:02.360\ninto the binary and\nthen from the binary back to the decimal.\n\n289\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.870\nAnd this might be something that\nyou have to do on the exam.\n\n290\n00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.060\nWhy?\nBecause there are certain scenarios where\n\n291\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.485\nyou can't tell where the node portion or\nwhere with the network portion of\n\n292\n00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:16.455\nan address is in those 32 bits and\nwhat's unique to the host, right?.\n\n293\n00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:19.321\nWe need to be able to define that and\nclearly see that, and\n\n294\n00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:21.313\nthat's why the binary's important.\n\n295\n00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:25.376\nhence, why we're gonna go through a few\nof these problems when it comes to\n\n296\n00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:27.247\nthe conversion process.\n\n297\n00:16:27.247 --> 00:16:29.550\nSo what we're gonna go ahead and\ndo, is let's do that,\n\n298\n00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.370\nwe're gonna do decimal to binary, right?\n\n299\n00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.418\nAnd what I wanna had in did is we'll\ngive a few example here, right?\n\n300\n00:16:35.418 --> 00:16:38.874\nAnd most likely we're gonna have to go\ninto a few parts here because you really\n\n301\n00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:40.695\nhave to understand the basics, right?\n\n302\n00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:42.358\nIt is very, very important.\n\n303\n00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:45.208\nSo, here's that first IP address\nthat we've talked about, right?\n\n304\n00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:48.270\nWe've talked about 208.119,\n\n305\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:53.006\nremember it's not a period,\n.38.100, all right?\n\n306\n00:16:53.006 --> 00:16:57.572\nWell, in order to convert it\ninto those 32 ones and zeros,\n\n307\n00:16:57.572 --> 00:17:01.062\nwe do this 8 bits at a time,\nan octet at a time,\n\n308\n00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:05.450\nto establish what all those 32 bits are,\nall right?\n\n309\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.920\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n310\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.307\nNow, remember,\nthey're place values, all right?\n\n311\n00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:13.970\nWe're talking about an octet,\nan octet is that 8 bits, right?\n\n312\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n313\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.098\n&gt;&gt; These values that you see right here,\n\n314\n00:17:18.098 --> 00:17:23.439\nthat you see until I move them\noff the screen right here are 1,\n\n315\n00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:27.161\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 28.\n\n316\n00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:29.930\nMemorize these, commit them to memory.\n\n317\n00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:35.512\nBecause if you can memorize the place\nvalues that we've shown you here,\n\n318\n00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:40.179\nyou will be doing well for\nany decimal to binary conversion,\n\n319\n00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:45.303\nany binary to decimal conversion\nthat you come across on the exam,\n\n320\n00:17:45.303 --> 00:17:49.267\nand as you move in to additional training,\nright?\n\n321\n00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:50.474\nCommit them to memory.\n\n322\n00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:56.559\nSo that's a little bit on the basics\non how we get these numbers, all right?\n\n323\n00:17:56.559 --> 00:18:00.581\nNow, let's tell you how you\ntake that decimal value,\n\n324\n00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:04.790\nvery convert it to an 8-bit binary number,\nall right?\n\n325\n00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.443\nSo let's go ahead and switch over.\n\n326\n00:18:06.443 --> 00:18:10.050\nWe're gonna start with\nthe very first IP address.\n\n327\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.240\nAnd you'll notice here, Zach, what I\ndid is I kind of broke up each octet,\n\n328\n00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.810\nand kind of stacked them this way,\nthese are the same octets.\n\n329\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.710\n&gt;&gt; It makes it easier.\n\n330\n00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:17.325\n&gt;&gt; It does, right?\n\n331\n00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:21.380\nCuz it makes it easier for something\nthat we commonly look at, all right?\n\n332\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.820\nSo let's go ahead, and we'll do\nthe first one, we'll see how far we get.\n\n333\n00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.687\nWe might have cut this\none a little bit short,\n\n334\n00:18:27.687 --> 00:18:30.993\nleave you with a cliff hanger then we'll\ndo a few coming up to the next part here.\n\n335\n00:18:30.993 --> 00:18:33.200\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nBut let's start with 208.\n\n336\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.326\nNow, in order to do this conversion it\nis important understand that what you\n\n337\n00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:43.534\nare going to do is you're going to\nsubtract from the left-most place value,\n\n338\n00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:48.181\nsubtracting this number and\nit´s remainders until you get to the one\n\n339\n00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:53.160\nplace value, here in this octet,\nand you can´t have any remainders.\n\n340\n00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.784\nThere aren't any remainders when you\ndo decimal to binary conversion, right?\n\n341\n00:18:57.784 --> 00:19:01.290\nWe don't say that it is\n208 with a remainder of 2.\n\n342\n00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:01.900\nDoesn't work.\n\n343\n00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.980\nThat works in math,\ndoesn't work in binary math, okay?\n\n344\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.200\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n345\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.620\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\npick on Zack.\n\n346\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.540\nAnd Zack's gonna be my calculator\nbecause if you've ever watched me,\n\n347\n00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.958\nmy math is absolutely horrible, so I'm\ngonna need a proof check here, all right?\n\n348\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n349\n00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.103\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I can, and\nhere's how it works, right?\n\n350\n00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:24.490\nIf I can subtract a place value,\nall right, and you know what?\n\n351\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.965\nLet me change this, I'm gonna change this\nto 209, that's what I meant to do, and\n\n352\n00:19:28.965 --> 00:19:31.532\nI think I might have got that wrong there,\nZack.\n\n353\n00:19:31.532 --> 00:19:33.870\nLet me go ahead and\nchange this real quick.\n\n354\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:40.100\n209, I actually, I put 208 in here and\nI meant 209, all right?\n\n355\n00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Easy enough fix.\n\n356\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.180\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right.\n\n357\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.222\nSo let's go ahead, I tell you what,\nI'm a glutton for punishment.\n\n358\n00:19:46.222 --> 00:19:47.390\nI'm gonna go ahead and change this.\n\n359\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.540\nAnd you know what?\n\n360\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.030\nI'm gonna do that just because I\nwanna do it on the fly to make sure I\n\n361\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.165\nknow what I'm doing, too.\n\n362\n00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:54.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n363\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.400\n&gt;&gt; All right, so 208.\n\n364\n00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.450\nLet's start-\n&gt;&gt; So we are going to 208?\n\n365\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.463\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go with 208.\n\n366\n00:19:59.463 --> 00:20:00.780\nI'll get it right eventually.\n\n367\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.290\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n368\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.157\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go 208, and we're gonna\nwork from the left side of our place\n\n369\n00:20:06.157 --> 00:20:11.380\nvalues here, in a base 2 numbering system\nto the right side of this chart here.\n\n370\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.486\nSo 208, all right?\n\n371\n00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:17.330\nIf I can take a place value and\nI can subtract it, this is the rule.\n\n372\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.980\nYou turn it into a binary\none in that position.\n\n373\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n374\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.547\n&gt;&gt; If my starting number, or my remainder,\n\n375\n00:20:24.547 --> 00:20:31.605\ncannot be subtracted by that place value,\nthen it becomes a binary zero.\n\n376\n00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:33.310\nShow you what I mean here, all right?\n\n377\n00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:37.870\nSo you only have two possibilities, so\nit's either true or it's false, all right?\n\n378\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.340\nIf it's true, you mark it as a 1.\n\n379\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.830\nIf that's a false statement,\n\n380\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.082\nyou mark it as a zero and you move\nthe remainder to the next place value.\n\n381\n00:20:44.082 --> 00:20:47.609\nSo, 208 minus 128.\n\n382\n00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:54.000\nI have the fact that I can take 208 and\nI can subtract 128 from it.\n\n383\n00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.390\nSo I know right away that's\ngonna be a binary 1,\n\n384\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.620\nand if I'm right that should\nleave me with a remainder of 80.\n\n385\n00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.366\nOkay, so\nthat leaves me with a remainder of 80.\n\n386\n00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:08.180\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is take 80, I'm\ngonna move it to the second position, or\n\n387\n00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.355\nthat second position\nwithin these eight bits.\n\n388\n00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:15.230\nNow, next question is can I\ntake the place value of 64 and\n\n389\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:19.945\nsubtract 80, or take 80 and\nsubtract 64 from it?\n\n390\n00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.450\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n\n391\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.332\n&gt;&gt; And the answer is yes, so\nthat's a binary 1 as well.\n\n392\n00:21:23.332 --> 00:21:27.448\nIt's true, it's a true statement so\nthat when I do that,\n\n393\n00:21:27.448 --> 00:21:30.810\nI subtract 80 from 64 hopefully I get 16.\n\n394\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:31.330\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n395\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.696\n&gt;&gt; I get 16, okay, good.\n\n396\n00:21:33.696 --> 00:21:38.050\nNow, I marked that as a binary 1 and\nI move to the next one.\n\n397\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.130\nNow, is it true or\n\n398\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.680\nfalse that I can take my remainder\nof 16 and subtract 32 from it?\n\n399\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.420\n&gt;&gt; You cannot.\n\n400\n00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.280\n&gt;&gt; I can't, so it's false.\n\n401\n00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.347\nAny time it's false,\nit becomes a binary zero, and\n\n402\n00:21:49.347 --> 00:21:53.824\nwe move the remainder to the next\nposition within these 8 bits, all right?\n\n403\n00:21:53.824 --> 00:21:56.560\nNow, the next position is 16.\n\n404\n00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.440\nIs it a true or\n\n405\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.730\nfalse statement that I can take 16 and\nsubtract the place value 16 from it?\n\n406\n00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.900\nAnd the answer's yeah, I can change that,\nI can subtract 16 from 16, right?\n\n407\n00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.790\nSo because of that,\nthat becomes a binary 1.\n\n408\n00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.020\nIt's a true statement.\n\n409\n00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.180\nNow, that leaves me with\na remainder of zero.\n\n410\n00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.150\nAnd the good thing is, remember,\nI told you, in binary, no remainders.\n\n411\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.130\nSo right here, I have no place values,\n\n412\n00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.470\nI don't have any place\nvalues left that I can use.\n\n413\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.993\nSo can I subtract 8 from zero?\n\n414\n00:22:26.993 --> 00:22:29.721\nWell, technically you can, but\nwe don't have negative numbers here, so\n\n415\n00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:31.360\nit's a false statement.\n\n416\n00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.220\nAnd that just means that the rest\nof these place values are zeroes.\n\n417\n00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.370\nNow, I want you to see\nwhat just happened here.\n\n418\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.650\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n419\n00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.460\nEight bits.\n\n420\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.440\nWe just took that decimal value,\nthat octet, and went from decimal and\n\n421\n00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.730\nconverted it into binary.\n\n422\n00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:53.120\nYou take it out of this chart and\nthere's your eight bits of binary.\n\n423\n00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.030\nAnd that's what 208 looks like, not in\ndecimal notation, but binary notation.\n\n424\n00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:58.820\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool.\n\n425\n00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.030\n&gt;&gt; Pretty simplistic, right?\n\n426\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.380\nNow, I know we're running a little bit\nshort on time, let's go ahead, Zack, and\n\n427\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.210\nwhat we'll do is we'll finish\nup this IP address right here.\n\n428\n00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.350\nAnd then we'll come back,\nwhat do you say we come back and\n\n429\n00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.607\nwe'll do a couple more examples as we\nmove in to some more training here?\n\n430\n00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:18.190\nAll right, so next one is 119.\n\n431\n00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:24.913\nThe question is can I take 119 and\nsubtract 128 from it?\n\n432\n00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:26.930\nNo negatives, remember we can't do that.\n\n433\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.193\nSo that would be-\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n434\n00:23:28.193 --> 00:23:29.717\n&gt;&gt; A false statement, right?\n\n435\n00:23:29.717 --> 00:23:31.575\nSo that's gonna be a zero.\n\n436\n00:23:31.575 --> 00:23:34.827\nAnd then we just take, remember I\nsaid you're either starting point,\n\n437\n00:23:34.827 --> 00:23:36.950\nyou're gonna move that\nsince I can't use it.\n\n438\n00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.190\nNow, I'm gonna ask\nthe question can I take 19 and\n\n439\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.050\nsubtract the 64 place value from it?\n\n440\n00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.310\nThe answer is yes.\n\n441\n00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:50.740\nI can subtract 64 from 119, and if I mark\nthat as a binary 1, I hope I get 55.\n\n442\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.610\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n443\n00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:52.436\n&gt;&gt; Do I get 55?\n\n444\n00:23:52.436 --> 00:23:56.503\nOkay, so I've got a remainder of 55,\nand I'm gonna take that and move it\n\n445\n00:23:56.503 --> 00:24:00.790\nto the next bit position within this\noctet, within these eight place values.\n\n446\n00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:06.013\nSo now I got 55 The question is can\nI take 55 and subtract 32 from it?\n\n447\n00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:08.300\nAnd the answer is true, right?\n\n448\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.354\nSo because it's true\nit becomes a binary 1.\n\n449\n00:24:10.354 --> 00:24:15.288\nAnd if I subtract 55 from 32,\nI get hopefully 23.\n\n450\n00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:15.946\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n451\n00:24:15.946 --> 00:24:20.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, and I move my remainder to\nthe next position, well 23, all right?\n\n452\n00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.350\nCan I take 23 and subtract 16 from it?\n\n453\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.390\nAnswer is yes, right,\nso that becomes true.\n\n454\n00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.318\nThank you for the help Zach,\nI do appreciate it.\n\n455\n00:24:27.318 --> 00:24:31.270\nThat's gonna become a binary 1, all right?\n\n456\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.036\nAnd what that does is hopefully\nthat leaves me with 7, all right?\n\n457\n00:24:35.036 --> 00:24:36.558\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good, and\n\n458\n00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:38.306\nwe're gonna move into [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna pause here\n\n459\n00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:38.819\njust for the heck of it.\n\n460\n00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:41.310\n&gt;&gt; There we go and then we're gonna\nmove it to the next bit position right?\n\n461\n00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.393\nSo now that I've got 7 left,\ncan I take 7 and\n\n462\n00:24:45.393 --> 00:24:49.421\nsubtract the place value of 8 from 7?\n\n463\n00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:50.559\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; We can't have negatives, right?\n\n464\n00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:52.173\nSo the answer is that's false.\n\n465\n00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:55.860\nThat becomes a binary 0, and\nwe just take that remainder,\n\n466\n00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.400\nwe move it to the next position.\n\n467\n00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.600\nNow I've got 7 left, right?\n\n468\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.797\nCan I subtract 4 from my remainder of 7?\n\n469\n00:25:03.797 --> 00:25:06.020\nAnd the answer is yes I can, right?\n\n470\n00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.210\nSo that becomes a binary 1 in\nthat position, that's true.\n\n471\n00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:13.490\nWe move our remainder of 3\nto the next position, right?\n\n472\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.170\nNow, can I ask the same question?\n\n473\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.190\nCan I take my remainder of 3 and\nsubtract 2 from it?\n\n474\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.170\nThe answer is yes, right?\n\n475\n00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.762\nIt's true, so that becomes a binary 1.\n\n476\n00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:24.690\nThat leaves me with a remainder so\nfar of 1.\n\n477\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.950\nRemember, I said no remainders.\n\n478\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.139\nWell, thank goodness, I have a remainder\nof 1, 1 place value left that's 1, so\n\n479\n00:25:30.139 --> 00:25:31.465\nI can subtract 1 from 1.\n\n480\n00:25:31.465 --> 00:25:33.340\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, that becomes a binary 1.\n\n481\n00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.160\nAnd I have no remainders.\n\n482\n00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.595\nNow, all I do is take this 8-bit\nvalue out of this chart and\n\n483\n00:25:39.595 --> 00:25:42.627\nI can write it down right next to 119.\n\n484\n00:25:42.627 --> 00:25:49.670\nAnd we now have the binary representation\nof the decimal value 119, right?\n\n485\n00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.646\nSo we're on our way.\nWe're almost there.\n\n486\n00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:53.090\nI know we're running\na little bit short on time.\n\n487\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.460\nLet's go ahead and do two more\nexamples here and we'll go ahead and\n\n488\n00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.580\nwe'll cut this a little short, all right?\n\n489\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.061\nOr long, I guess you would say.\n\n490\n00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:02.561\n[LAUGH] All right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n491\n00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:04.919\n&gt;&gt; So next one is 38, all right?\n\n492\n00:26:04.919 --> 00:26:05.730\nNow this one's kinda\n\n493\n00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.960\neasy when we first start, right?\n\n494\n00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.377\nWe're gonna have a bunch\nof false statements.\n\n495\n00:26:08.377 --> 00:26:10.600\nWell, at least a couple of them, right?\n\n496\n00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.282\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I cannot subtract 128.\n\n497\n00:26:12.282 --> 00:26:14.426\nIf I have 38 I cannot take 128.\n\n498\n00:26:14.426 --> 00:26:16.040\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; And subtract it, right?\n\n499\n00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.984\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go ahead and say.\n\n500\n00:26:17.984 --> 00:26:18.975\n&gt;&gt; 0.\n&gt;&gt; That's 0, very good.\n\n501\n00:26:18.975 --> 00:26:21.590\n&gt;&gt; 64, can't do it either way, 38.\n\n502\n00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.226\nI can't take 64, right?\n&gt;&gt; Can't do it.\n\n503\n00:26:22.226 --> 00:26:24.910\n&gt;&gt; So that's gonna become 0.\n\n504\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:28.884\nBut once I get to the 32-bit,\nright, that place value, right,\n\n505\n00:26:28.884 --> 00:26:31.203\nI can take 38 and I can subtract 32.\n\n506\n00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:33.482\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n&gt;&gt; So that becomes a binary 1.\n\n507\n00:26:33.482 --> 00:26:40.953\nAll right, now, if I'm subtracting 32\nfrom 38, I hope I get a remainder of 6.\n\n508\n00:26:40.953 --> 00:26:42.180\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n\n509\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.280\n&gt;&gt; But notice here,\nI got another couple of false statements.\n\n510\n00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.212\nI can't take 6 and\nsubtract 16 from it, right?\n\n511\n00:26:51.212 --> 00:26:52.460\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So that's a 0.\n\n512\n00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.610\nI can't take 6 and subtract 8 from it.\n\n513\n00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.172\nNo negative values, right?\n\n514\n00:26:58.172 --> 00:27:00.331\nBut once I get to 4, I can take the 6.\n\n515\n00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:00.915\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can.\n\n516\n00:27:00.915 --> 00:27:01.752\n&gt;&gt; There we go, right?\n\n517\n00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:05.855\nI can take the 6, and I can subtract 4\nfrom it, so that becomes a binary 1,\n\n518\n00:27:05.855 --> 00:27:08.130\nexcuse me, gotta get that right.\n\n519\n00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.100\nAnd what do we have?\n\n520\n00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.519\nWe have 4 from 6 is gonna leave me with 2.\n\n521\n00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:14.811\nWell guess what,\nthank goodness my remainder is 2, and\n\n522\n00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:16.270\nI got a place value of 2.\n\n523\n00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.140\nSo I can subtract 2 from 2, right?\n\n524\n00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.275\nAnd that gives me a binary\n1 in that position,\n\n525\n00:27:20.275 --> 00:27:23.480\ncuz that statement is true,\nleaving me with a 0 remainder.\n\n526\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.390\nSo anywhere in this list\nthat I get a 0 remainder,\n\n527\n00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.570\nI could just whatever place\nvalues are left, all become 0s.\n\n528\n00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n529\n00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:34.140\nthis becomes my third binary octet, right?\n\n530\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.790\nFrom decimal to binary,\nright now, we're up 24 bits.\n\n531\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.910\nWe still got 8 more to go and then we've\ngot a 32-bit binary number, right?\n\n532\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.300\nSo let's do this one last time and\nthen we'll come back in a part two and\n\n533\n00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.590\nwe'll do some more examples here.\n\n534\n00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:52.430\nSo you guys can really,\nreally get an idea what's going on here.\n\n535\n00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.310\nAnd then we'll start to tie\ninto why we're even doing this.\n\n536\n00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.780\nAll right, so we got 100, right, last 100.\n\n537\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.116\nI can't take 128 and subtract it from 100.\n\n538\n00:28:02.116 --> 00:28:02.830\n&gt;&gt; Nope, 0.\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zack,\n\n539\n00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.372\nhead of the game there, but I can take 64.\n\n540\n00:28:04.372 --> 00:28:06.830\nI can take 100 and\nI can subtract 64 from it, right?\n\n541\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.328\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can.\n&gt;&gt; So that's a true,\n\n542\n00:28:08.328 --> 00:28:13.043\nthat becomes a binary 1 that\nleaves me with a remainder of 36.\n\n543\n00:28:13.043 --> 00:28:14.162\n&gt;&gt; 36.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n544\n00:28:14.162 --> 00:28:17.720\nnow I've got a position right here\nthat's 32, right, a place value.\n\n545\n00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.717\nSo 36, and I take and\nI subtract 32 form it.\n\n546\n00:28:19.717 --> 00:28:20.539\n&gt;&gt; You can do that.\n\n547\n00:28:20.539 --> 00:28:23.360\n&gt;&gt; I can, becomes a binary 1, right?\n\n548\n00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.180\nAnd that leaves me with the,\nwhat we say we had left?\n\n549\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.547\nWe had 36 from 32,\nthat leaves me with 4, right?\n\n550\n00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Very good, thank you.\n\n551\n00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.089\nThat's why I've got Zach here for\nmy math, all right?\n\n552\n00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:35.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.430\n&gt;&gt; So I can't use the 16 position, right?\n\n554\n00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.590\nThat's false because I only have 4 left,\nso that becomes a 0.\n\n555\n00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:40.150\n&gt;&gt; A 0.\n\n556\n00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.746\n&gt;&gt; And we move.\n\n557\n00:28:40.746 --> 00:28:43.517\nI cannot take 4 and\nthensubtract 8 from it.\n\n558\n00:28:43.517 --> 00:28:44.950\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; That becomes a 0.\n\n559\n00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.835\nBut in that place value where 4 is,\nI can subtract 4 from 4.\n\n560\n00:28:48.835 --> 00:28:52.850\nSo in that bit position that becomes a 1,\nI have 0 left.\n\n561\n00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:58.900\nSo any remaining place values also become\n0s and Zach, that is our last octet.\n\n562\n00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.090\nAnd why they call them octets, by the way?\n\n563\n00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:04.030\nBecause there's 8 bits that\nactually make up the binary\n\n564\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.730\nunderneath the decimal\nthat we read as humans.\n\n565\n00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:08.410\n&gt;&gt; And that becomes, right here,\n\n566\n00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:13.540\nyour 32-bit binary IP\naddress from left to right.\n\n567\n00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.680\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful

00:00:12.368\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:15.866\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.910\nYou're watching the CompTIA Network+ show.\n\n6\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.430\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong,\n\n7\n00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.780\nand today we're gonna be taking\na look at part two on IP addressing.\n\n8\n00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.190\nAnd here to help us once again is gonna be\nour comp TM master himself, Mr Wes Brian.\n\n9\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.410\nWes, welcome to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.600\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Ronnie, thanks for having me.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.730\nThat's right, and\nthanks for jumping in here.\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.140\nIt's great to have you here.\n\n13\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.330\nThat's right, we are continuing along in\nIP addressing part two, like Ronnie said.\n\n14\n00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.280\nAnd we're gonna kinda pick up\nwhere we left off in part one.\n\n15\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.745\nRemember, we were looking at\nthe structure of an IP address, and\n\n16\n00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.403\nwe were looking at the fact that\nit's a 32 bit identifier, right?\n\n17\n00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:53.217\nAnd it's not something that,\nwhen we talk about the binary itself,\n\n18\n00:00:53.217 --> 00:00:56.595\nthat's something as humans,\nwe don't easily recognize.\n\n19\n00:00:56.595 --> 00:00:57.725\nAnd that's why we said,\n\n20\n00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.965\nin that first episode,\nwe told you about dotted decimal notation.\n\n21\n00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:02.975\nIt's what we work with, right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.975 --> 00:01:06.915\nAnd it makes it a lot easier to remember\nan IP address if we have those four\n\n23\n00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.140\nblocks that we called octets, right?\n\n24\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.210\nWe call them out by\ntheir decimal notation.\n\n25\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.650\nBut that's not what your\ncomputers work with, right?\n\n26\n00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.990\nThe computers see only the binary and\nsometimes,\n\n27\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.690\nwhich we will get to I promise you\nalong this beaten path, we will get to\n\n28\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.880\nthe point as to why we sometimes need\nto do the decimal to binary conversion.\n\n29\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.980\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's continue.\n\n30\n00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.230\nIn the first episode we were looking\nat a series of IP addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.960\nAnd we were doing exactly that, we were\ndoing the decimal to binary conversion.\n\n32\n00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.142\nAnd we were just kinda kinda going\noctet at a time, just so you could see.\n\n33\n00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:42.781\nAnd we were hoping, our goal is\nthat by the end of this episode,\n\n34\n00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:46.980\nthat decimal to binary conversion is\ngonna be a thing of the past for you.\n\n35\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.240\nAnd you will easily\nrecognize how to do it.\n\n36\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.060\nSo Ronnie and I, we were talking\nbefore we started this episode,\n\n37\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.700\nhe is gonna jump in here and he'll have\nmy calculator, kinda proofread my math.\n\n38\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.690\nBecause as you all have seen\nthroughout this entire course,\n\n39\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.990\nmy math is impeccable, right?\n\n40\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.920\nNo, just kidding, it's just like my\ntyping skills, I'm very challenged.\n\n41\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.220\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's take a look at my screen.\n\n42\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.221\nIf you remember in the first part,\nwe were looking at this IP address, right?\n\n43\n00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:18.070\nWe had 208.119.38.100, and we gave you\nan example on how to break that down.\n\n44\n00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.570\nRemember, we talked about\nthe place values, right?\n\n45\n00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.050\nWe're used to that base ten numbering\nsystem, those place values being the ones,\n\n46\n00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.000\ntens, one hundreds, thousands, right?\n\n47\n00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.440\nAnd that's what we are used\nto seeing in decimal.\n\n48\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.470\nRemember the place values.\n\n49\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.440\nI said if there's one thing\nthat you can memorize,\n\n50\n00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.690\nif you can remember these 8 bits by their\nplace values, you're gonna be doing really\n\n51\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.620\ngood inside of networking when it\ncomes to this conversion process.\n\n52\n00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.810\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we are gonna\npick up right where we left off, and\n\n53\n00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.410\nwe're gonna move into\nthe second IP address.\n\n54\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.040\nAnd let's go ahead and let's work octet\nby octet, so that we do understand this.\n\n55\n00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.320\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll work with the first octet.\n\n56\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.730\nRonnie, if you can help me out here,\n\n57\n00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.270\nbecause I always have to have\nmy math definitely checked.\n\n58\n00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.060\nWe're gonna start, remember,\nthat like we said,\n\n59\n00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.730\nif I can use a place value with the number\nor the remainder that I'm working with,\n\n60\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.610\nthat would be a true statement,\nit becomes a binary 1.\n\n61\n00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.370\nIf I can't use it, it becomes, remember\nwhat I said it's like being false, right?\n\n62\n00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.830\nThat becomes a binary 0 and we take that\nnumber, or the remainder and we work our\n\n63\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.520\nway through each bit position until we get\nto the end, with no remainders, right?\n\n64\n00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.094\nWe don't have any remainders in this\nformula that we're using here, all right?\n\n65\n00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:27.727\nSo we're gonna start from our left to\nright, and we're gonna start with 192.\n\n66\n00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:31.989\nNow can I use the 128 place value?\n\n67\n00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.492\nAnd the answer is yes I can, right?\n\n68\n00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:38.097\nSo that means it's true, and that becomes\na binary 1, then we're going to take 192\n\n69\n00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:41.540\nand we're going to subtract that\nplace value and see what we get.\n\n70\n00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.700\nNow if my math is correct,\nif I subtract 128 from my 192,\n\n71\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.230\nI should get a remainder of 64.\n\n72\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.860\nNow, what we're gonna do?\n\n73\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.180\nWe're gonna take that 64, and we're gonna\nmove it to the next bit position, right?\n\n74\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.970\nAnd we're gonna ask that same question.\n\n75\n00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.950\nNow, it's kinda interesting on this one,\nright?\n\n76\n00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.710\nRemember we said 64,\nif I can subtract 64 from 64,\n\n77\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.690\nthat's gonna be true as well, right?\n\n78\n00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.760\nSo that's gonna be a binary one,\nand this makes it easy for us.\n\n79\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.310\nRemember, any time you have a remainder\nanywhere in these bit positions of zero.\n\n80\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.290\nIt just means that the rest of those\nfields are all gonna be zeroes, right?\n\n81\n00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.160\nSince I have a reminder of zero,\nwe can make this one kind of easy and\n\n82\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.060\nwe can just fill these in.\n\n83\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.025\nSo if we're looking at the eight bits,\nthough that octet, right?\n\n84\n00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:33.045\nThe binary 192 is going to be 11000000,\nright?\n\n85\n00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:34.585\nThat becomes the first octet.\n\n86\n00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:38.685\nRemember, from left to right, first,\nsecond, third and fourth octets.\n\n87\n00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:40.695\nNext thing that we're gonna work on is,\nwell, 168.\n\n88\n00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:42.995\nSo we'll go ahead and\nwe'll do that same process.\n\n89\n00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:44.895\nAnd we're gonna ask that\nsame question again.\n\n90\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:50.370\nCan I take my value, 168 and\ncan I subtract the place value from it?\n\n91\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.293\nCan I subtract 128 from 168?\n\n92\n00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.300\nAnd the answer is yes, I can, right?\n\n93\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.520\nSo that's gonna become true.\n\n94\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.860\nThat's gonna be a binary 1.\n\n95\n00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.790\nWe're gonna subtract that.\n\n96\n00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.300\nAnd if my math is right I\nbelieve we should have 40 left.\n\n97\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.980\nAnd we're just gonna again,\nmove those remainder and\n\n98\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.150\nmove through the bit positions\nwith that remainder.\n\n99\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.364\nNow notice that when we get to and, you\nknow what, let me take a second here and\n\n100\n00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:14.433\nactually bump these up here a little bit,\nso it's a little easier to see,\n\n101\n00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:15.001\nthere we go.\n\n102\n00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:20.360\nNotice we got a remainder of 40, and\nwhen I get to the 64 place value, right?\n\n103\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.860\nThat value?\n\n104\n00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.690\nI can't subtract it,\nso it becomes a false.\n\n105\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.110\nAnd that's a binary zero.\n\n106\n00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.530\nNow we're going to move\nto the next position.\n\n107\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.875\nNow my remainder's still 40 because\nI couldn't subtract 64 from it so\n\n108\n00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:34.465\nnow I got to take that 40 and\nI'm going to ask that same question.\n\n109\n00:05:34.465 --> 00:05:37.035\nCould I take 32 and\ncould I subtract that from 40?\n\n110\n00:05:37.035 --> 00:05:39.325\nAnd the answer is yes, I can, right?\n\n111\n00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:42.070\nSo that is true, it becomes a binary one.\n\n112\n00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.820\nAnd if we subtract 32 from the remainder\nof 40, we should have eight left.\n\n113\n00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.160\nAnd we're gonna ask\nthe same question right?\n\n114\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.440\n16 I can't use that, right?\n\n115\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.480\nI have eight left, so I can't subtract\n16 from it, it becomes a binary zero,\n\n116\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.935\nwe move to the next place value.\n\n117\n00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:58.057\nAgain, we're going to\nask that same question.\n\n118\n00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:01.106\nI've got 8 left, can I subtract 8 from 8?\n\n119\n00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.120\nAnd the answer is, yes.\n\n120\n00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.870\nSo that becomes true.\n\n121\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.400\nAnd we have a remainder of zero.\n\n122\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.160\nMake it easy for yourself on the exam.\n\n123\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.770\nYou can get to that answer faster.\n\n124\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.910\nOnce I have a zero,\neverything behind that is 0.\n\n125\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.070\nNo remainders in this conversion, right?\n\n126\n00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.770\nAll right, so\nnow we have our first two octets.\n\n127\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.100\nWe have our first and second octet,\n\n128\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.530\njust like we did in the first\nexample of the IP address.\n\n129\n00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.330\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna work on the 131.\n\n130\n00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.080\nAsking the same question,\n128 can I subtract that?\n\n131\n00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.780\nAnd the answer is yes, yes I can,\nso that's gonna be a binary 1.\n\n132\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.650\nAnd if I subtract 128 from our 130,\nI should have a remainder of 3.\n\n133\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.460\nNow if I have a remainder of 3,\nthis should be kinda easy right?\n\n134\n00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.170\nI can't use these first few positions,\nright?\n\n135\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.824\nSo I can't use 64,\ncan't use 32,0 can't use 16, can't use 8.\n\n136\n00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.460\nWell, I can't even use four right?\n\n137\n00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.706\nSo, I know the first place value\nthat I can subtract is two, right?\n\n138\n00:06:55.706 --> 00:06:59.280\nSo we are gonna take two and we will\nsubtract it from three, we know we can.\n\n139\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.820\nSo that becomes a binary one, leaves me\nwith a value, a remainder of one, right?\n\n140\n00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.290\nWell, that leaves the last place value.\n\n141\n00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.350\nWe've got a one that I have a remainder,\nand\n\n142\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.360\nI could subtract one from it, so\nit becomes a binary one as well.\n\n143\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.690\nSo you're starting to see the process,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.910\nThe process doesn't change and\n\n145\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.710\nlike we were telling you,\nmemorize these 8 bits, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.670\nSo we're gonna work on the fourth octet\nhere in our IP address 192.168.131.54,\n\n147\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.700\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n148\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.460\nAnd I'm gonna take 128, and\nyes I can subtract that from 154.\n\n149\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.600\nSo that becomes a binary 1,\nand I have a remainder of 26.\n\n150\n00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.510\nNow, here again we are following\nthat same pattern here.\n\n151\n00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.020\nI can't use 64.\n\n152\n00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.896\nI can't use 32.\n\n153\n00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:49.954\nSo the very first one I can use the very\nfirst place value that I can subtract,\n\n154\n00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:52.122\nthis remainder from is going to be 16.\n\n155\n00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:55.128\nAnd if I take 16 and subtract it from 26,\n\n156\n00:07:55.128 --> 00:07:59.613\nwell I can use that place value\nshould give me a remainder of 10.\n\n157\n00:07:59.613 --> 00:08:04.123\nAll right, now that I have my remainder\nof 10, we move it to the next position.\n\n158\n00:08:04.123 --> 00:08:07.635\nRight?\nAnd I have 10 left so I can subtract 8,\n\n159\n00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:08.285\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:09.198\nThat becomes a binary 1.\n\n161\n00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:11.152\nThat leaves me with a remainder of 2.\n\n162\n00:08:11.152 --> 00:08:15.582\nNotice that I cannot use the 4 but\nI can use the 2, right?\n\n163\n00:08:15.582 --> 00:08:16.630\nI could subtract 2 from 2.\n\n164\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:22.147\nThat becomes a binary 1 and we have\na remainder of 0 in that place value so\n\n165\n00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:24.685\neverything else behind it is 0.\n\n166\n00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:30.147\nAll right, so we've got two of\nthese IP address up to this point.\n\n167\n00:08:30.147 --> 00:08:33.656\nWe've broke them down into\nwhat their 32 bits would be.\n\n168\n00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:37.460\nAnd that's what the computer is gonna see,\nright?\n\n169\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.596\nWe're gonna do one more here and\nthen we'll move on.\n\n170\n00:08:39.596 --> 00:08:44.850\nAnd hopefully by this time you've got a\ngood grasp on how it is to convert these.\n\n171\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.603\nAnd we'll kinda tell you,\ntoo, you never know.\n\n172\n00:08:46.603 --> 00:08:49.790\nOn the exam,\nthey might actually give you the binary.\n\n173\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.262\nAnd they say what is the decimal value for\nthis binary number?\n\n174\n00:08:52.262 --> 00:08:53.570\nAnd we'll make that easy.\n\n175\n00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.011\nWe'll make that kinda easy for you and\n\n176\n00:08:55.011 --> 00:08:56.822\nshow you how you can do the reverse,\nall right?\n\n177\n00:08:56.822 --> 00:08:59.560\nSo we're gonna start with 70 here.\n\n178\n00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.215\nAnd if you look, very first place\nvalue can't be used, right?\n\n179\n00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:07.550\nI can't take 128 subtract it from 70,\nright?\n\n180\n00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.598\nSo that becomes a 0.\n\n181\n00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:12.345\nGiving me the first place value\nthat I can use is 64, right?\n\n182\n00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:16.590\nAnd I can subtract 64, so\nthat becomes a binary 1.\n\n183\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.560\nFollowing the same formula\nshould give me a remainder of 6.\n\n184\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.230\nMake it easier on yourselves,\nget that answer quick, right?\n\n185\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.325\nI know that I can't use 32,\ncan't use 16, and I can't use 8, right?\n\n186\n00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:30.551\nGo over to 4 and\nI can subtract 4 from my remainder of 6 so\n\n187\n00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:35.500\nthat becomes a binary 1 and\nit leaves me, if i'm right, with 2.\n\n188\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.269\nNow, guess what?\n\n189\n00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:40.300\nWe've got a 2 place value,\nso I can subtract 2 from 2.\n\n190\n00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.922\nAnd I do not put a 2 there,\nwe put a binary 1 there.\n\n191\n00:09:43.922 --> 00:09:50.090\nWe subtract it, I've got a remainder of 0.\n\n192\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.994\nSo this becomes the next octet, right?\n\n193\n00:09:50.994 --> 00:09:55.710\nOur first octet in our final IP address,\nall right?\n\n194\n00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.028\nNow we got 201, same process again,\nguys and gals out there.\n\n195\n00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:02.440\nYes, I can subtract 128, so\nthat becomes a binary 1.\n\n196\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.442\nAnd if I subtract 128 from my,\nwell at this point,\n\n197\n00:10:05.442 --> 00:10:09.532\nit's the starting point of 201,\nI'm gonna get 73 as a remainder.\n\n198\n00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:12.530\nAll right, now I got 73 so guess what?\n\n199\n00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.279\nI can also use the 64 place value.\n\n200\n00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:18.890\nAnd if I take 73 and I subtract 64 from\nit, I should get a remainder of 9.\n\n201\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.847\nNow that being said,\nmake it easy on yourselves.\n\n202\n00:10:21.847 --> 00:10:23.490\nGet those answers quicker.\n\n203\n00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.173\nSince I have 9, I know I can't use 32 and\nI can't use 16, but I can use 8, right?\n\n204\n00:10:28.173 --> 00:10:31.830\nAnd because I can use 8,\nthat becomes true, it's a binary 1.\n\n205\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.099\nAnd I take my remainder of 9 and\nsubtract 8 from it.\n\n206\n00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:37.350\nThat leaves me a remainder of 1.\n\n207\n00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.676\nAgain, get to your answers quicker.\n\n208\n00:10:38.676 --> 00:10:41.465\nI know if I've got 1 left,\nI can't use the 4 and\n\n209\n00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:44.950\nI can't use the 2 place value,\nbut I can use the 1, right?\n\n210\n00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.276\nI can subtract 1 from 1, right?\n\n211\n00:10:46.276 --> 00:10:49.930\nAnd that leaves me with the second octet.\n\n212\n00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.537\nAll right, hang on with me here,\nwe're almost done.\n\n213\n00:10:52.537 --> 00:10:54.470\nWe're almost done with some of the math,\nthank goodness.\n\n214\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.397\nThis is the binary math that you\nneed to know for some of the basics.\n\n215\n00:10:57.397 --> 00:10:59.745\nLet's go ahead and do 10.\n\n216\n00:10:59.745 --> 00:11:01.741\n10 is fairly easy, because guess what?\n\n217\n00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:07.760\nI can't use 128, I can't use 64,\nI can't use 32, can't use 16, right?\n\n218\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.061\nThe first place value I can\nuse in the decimal, 10,\n\n219\n00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:16.560\nthe decimal value is going\nto be the 8 place value.\n\n220\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.180\nSo that becomes true, and\nI'm going to put a binary 1 there, and\n\n221\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.526\nI'm gonna subtract it, right?\n\n222\n00:11:20.526 --> 00:11:24.750\nSo 10, I'm gonna subtract 8,\nI have a remainder of 2.\n\n223\n00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.988\nCan't use the 4, can use 2, right?\n\n224\n00:11:26.988 --> 00:11:30.079\nThe 2 place value, so 2 from 2, or 0.\n\n225\n00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:34.570\nI'm gonna mark it as a binary 1, and\nwe're gonna use that last place space,\n\n226\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.350\nsince I have no remainders,\nis going to be a 0.\n\n227\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.830\nAll right, we've come to almost\nthe end of the road here\n\n228\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.970\non our decimal binary conversion,\nlet's do the last octet here.\n\n229\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.544\nAll right, so we got 186 here.\n\n230\n00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:52.270\nNow you're gonna have to help me out\non this one, Ronnie, 186 minus 128.\n\n231\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.598\nNow I know I can use the place value,\nwhat do we got there, Ronnie?\n\n232\n00:11:57.598 --> 00:11:58.542\n&gt;&gt; 58.\n\n233\n00:11:58.542 --> 00:12:03.009\n&gt;&gt; 58, all right, so\nI can't use the 64 but I can use the 32.\n\n234\n00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:08.176\nAll right, want to help me out\nwith my math on here, 58 minus 32?\n\n235\n00:12:08.176 --> 00:12:10.510\n&gt;&gt; 26.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I can use 32.\n\n236\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.560\nAll right, I got 26 left so\nI know that I can subtract the 16,\n\n237\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.894\neven I can do this part of it, right?\n\n238\n00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:20.780\n[LAUGH] I'm gonna subtract 16 from there,\nand leaves me with a remainder of 10.\n\n239\n00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.150\nI can use the 8, but I cannot use the 4.\n\n240\n00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:30.130\nNow I have a remainder of 2, that's why\nI can't use the 4, be clear on that one.\n\n241\n00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:35.710\nI have a place value here of 2, so I can\nsubtract 2 from 2, becomes a binary 1.\n\n242\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.126\nI subtract that, I have a remainder\nof 0 makes that last position a 0.\n\n243\n00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:45.118\nAll right, so not really complicated\nonce you know the steps and\n\n244\n00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:47.717\nonce you memorize these 8 bits.\n\n245\n00:12:47.717 --> 00:12:50.810\nThese 8 bits at these place\nvalues are gonna be very,\n\n246\n00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.489\nvery important to just understanding as\nyou move through future calculations,\n\n247\n00:12:55.489 --> 00:12:58.490\non how to do this conversion process.\n\n248\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.007\nNow, the next thing I wanna talk a little\nbit, we mentioned in the first part,\n\n249\n00:13:02.007 --> 00:13:04.481\nwe mentioned a little bit\nabout subnet masks, right?\n\n250\n00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:09.215\nNow, we're gonna come back to\nexactly what a subnet mask is doing,\n\n251\n00:13:09.215 --> 00:13:13.618\nbut I want you to understand a little\nbit of the decimal to binary\n\n252\n00:13:13.618 --> 00:13:17.463\nconversion on a subnet mask,\nif you will, all right?\n\n253\n00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.815\nBecause subnet masks,\n\n254\n00:13:18.815 --> 00:13:23.352\nwe didn't really mention the fact that\nthey're not IP addresses, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:27.875\nBut they always seem to follow\nthe same type of pattern, right?\n\n256\n00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:32.689\nAnd that means a subnet mask\nprimarily is made of contiguous 1s.\n\n257\n00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:35.190\nIt's made of contiguous 1s\nfrom the left to the right.\n\n258\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.560\nAnd you cannot have any\n0s in between those 1s.\n\n259\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.070\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n260\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.182\nIn fact,\nwe're gonna take three of our common, and\n\n261\n00:13:43.182 --> 00:13:47.027\nwe'll go into this a little bit more,\nclassical subnet masks.\n\n262\n00:13:47.027 --> 00:13:50.480\nAnd again we'll come back to\nclasses here coming up, right?\n\n263\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.717\nBut I want you to notice\nthat we have a 255.\n\n264\n00:13:52.717 --> 00:13:58.833\nI want you to also keep in mind that any\nsubnet mask has to be continuous 1 bits,\n\n265\n00:13:58.833 --> 00:13:59.500\nright?\n\n266\n00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.930\nWell that doesn't make sense if\nyou know to see the decimal, but\n\n267\n00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.050\nyou don't understand\nthe binary that's underneath.\n\n268\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.501\nSo let's go ahead and let's do that same\nprocess, when it comes to a subnet mask,\n\n269\n00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.955\nwe're gonna convert it.\n\n270\n00:14:09.955 --> 00:14:13.779\nAnd I did the same thing here just kind\nof put those octets stacked on each\n\n271\n00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:14.684\nother, right?\n\n272\n00:14:14.684 --> 00:14:18.080\nSo if we take 255,\ncan we subtract 128 from it?\n\n273\n00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.440\nAnd the answer is yes,\nright, we know that.\n\n274\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.287\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\ndo the same process here and\n\n275\n00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:28.150\nthat should leave me with 127.\n\n276\n00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.479\nNow the next thing that we do is\nwe move to the 64 spot, right?\n\n277\n00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:35.419\nAnd I can subtract 64 from 127,\nso I mark that as a binary 1,\n\n278\n00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:37.660\nand I move to the next place value.\n\n279\n00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.597\nNow if my math is right,\nI should have a 63, all right?\n\n280\n00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:44.330\nSo we can subtract 32 from 63.\n\n281\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.805\nWe're gonna go ahead and do that.\n\n282\n00:14:45.805 --> 00:14:51.680\nMark that bit value, place value if you\nwill, as a binary 1 and we move forward.\n\n283\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.586\nNow, the next thing I have to do is,\ndid I go too fast?\n\n284\n00:14:54.586 --> 00:14:56.852\nI think I did too many 1s there.\n\n285\n00:14:56.852 --> 00:14:58.530\nDid I too many 1s there?\n\n286\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.894\n&gt;&gt; You're right.\n&gt;&gt; I'm right, okay.\n\n287\n00:14:59.894 --> 00:15:03.020\nSo I can subtract 32,\nI got ahead of myself there.\n\n288\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.891\nAnd when I do,\nI should have a remainder of 31.\n\n289\n00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:07.893\nI gotta keep track of where I'm at too.\n\n290\n00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:12.699\n[LAUGH] Now 31 is my remainder and\nI'm looking at the 16 place value.\n\n291\n00:15:12.699 --> 00:15:15.308\nI can subtract 16 from 31, right?\n\n292\n00:15:15.308 --> 00:15:18.314\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe'll put a binary 1 there, and\n\n293\n00:15:18.314 --> 00:15:19.890\nwe'll move to the next octet.\n\n294\n00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.850\nNow, if I take 31 and I subtract 16,\nI should have a remainder of 15, right?\n\n295\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.140\nAnd we're gonna do that, so we move to\nthe next place value and guess what?\n\n296\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.922\nI can subtract 8 from 15, so\nthat means that is a binary 1 as well.\n\n297\n00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:38.400\nWe take our remainder of 7 and\nwe move to the next place value, right?\n\n298\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.210\nAnd I could subtract 4 from 7,\nso that becomes a binary 1.\n\n299\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.080\nYou're gonna start to see\nthat pattern again, right?\n\n300\n00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.074\nAnd if I subtract 4 from 7,\nthat gives me 3 left.\n\n301\n00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:47.697\nWell guess what?\n\n302\n00:15:47.697 --> 00:15:52.570\nI can subtract 2 from 3, so\nthat also becomes a binary 1.\n\n303\n00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.978\nLeaves me with 1 left, right?\n\n304\n00:15:53.978 --> 00:15:56.870\nThat's my remainder, and look,\nI can subtract 1 from 1.\n\n305\n00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.245\nNow I want you to notice something here.\n\n306\n00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:04.578\n255 is the largest number you can\nget in an 8 bit octet, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:10.218\nNotice also, that every one of\nthese place values has a 1 in it.\n\n308\n00:16:10.218 --> 00:16:12.080\nNow notice the 0s here?\n\n309\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.660\n0s are very easy,\nthose aren't too complicated, right?\n\n310\n00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.486\nYeah, that just means every place\nvalue is gonna be a 0, right?\n\n311\n00:16:19.486 --> 00:16:23.210\nAnd I could probably fill\nthese out a little bit easier.\n\n312\n00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.410\nBut we'll go ahead and\ndo it just cell by cell here.\n\n313\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.940\nNow, the question is, if I were to lay\nthese all out, 32 bits left to right,\n\n314\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.350\ndo we have contiguous 1 bits, right?\n\n315\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:37.209\nDo I have any 0s in between,\na break in the 1s, a 0 and then another 1?\n\n316\n00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:38.775\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n317\n00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:42.185\nAnd that's something to\nunderstand about a subnet mask.\n\n318\n00:16:42.185 --> 00:16:49.141\nA subnet mask must be contiguous 1s, there\ncannot be any 0s in between these 1s.\n\n319\n00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:53.400\nAnd we're gonna come back and we're gonna\nsee how that applies to our IP address,\n\n320\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.310\nand why that's so\nimportant here in a second.\n\n321\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:01.627\nNow, if we just do the same thing here,\nyou're gonna notice that 255.255.0.0.\n\n322\n00:17:01.627 --> 00:17:03.500\nWell, let's just go ahead and\nwe'll make it easy.\n\n323\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.120\nWe'll just fill these in cuz we\nalready know that they are 1s, right?\n\n324\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.100\nAnd I know that those last two octets are\nall 0s, and the question would be, well,\n\n325\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.300\ndo I have contiguous 1 bits here, right?\n\n326\n00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.546\nDo I have, if I were to lay\nthis out all 32 bits wide,\n\n327\n00:17:19.546 --> 00:17:24.100\ndo I have 1s that are contiguous and\nthe 1s stop and the 0s begin?\n\n328\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.900\nThe answer is correct, right?\n\n329\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.950\nI have two contiguous blocks,\nor octets of 1s.\n\n330\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.552\nSame thing goes here,\nif you will for the last set, right?\n\n331\n00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:35.489\nWe can do the same thing here.\n\n332\n00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:41.600\nAnd if you will notice we\nhave now 255.255.255.0.\n\n333\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.114\nNotice that we now have contiguous\n1 bits in the first three octets.\n\n334\n00:17:47.114 --> 00:17:51.520\nAnd the last octet of course being 0,\nall 0s, right?\n\n335\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.940\nNow that is important, right?\n\n336\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.450\nBecause I want you to remember what\na subnet mask looks like in the binary cuz\n\n337\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.140\nwe're gonna come back to that and\nwe're gonna define why that's important.\n\n338\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.740\nFor now, at this point,\n\n339\n00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.660\nall I want you to remember is that\na subnet mask has to be contiguous 1 bits.\n\n340\n00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.776\nYou have to have 1s, no 0s in between and\n\n341\n00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:16.860\nat some point within these four octets,\nthe 1s will stop and the 0s will begin.\n\n342\n00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:23.340\nAll right, now,\nlet's go ahead now and go farther.\n\n343\n00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.450\nNow that we've seen the majority\nof our decimal to binary.\n\n344\n00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:32.480\nLet me go ahead and tell you how you would\nreverse this if you needed to, all right?\n\n345\n00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.170\nLet's go back real quick\nif we could to the diagram.\n\n346\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:41.910\nIf you ever have an 8-bit\nbinary number on the exam, and\n\n347\n00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:47.630\nyour answers are the decimal values, these\n8 bits of binary, what is that in decimal?\n\n348\n00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.440\nIf you can remember these place values\nthat I'm kind of harping on here,\n\n349\n00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.580\nyou can remember them.\n\n350\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.740\nAll you got to do is make this chart,\nput those binary numbers in this chart and\n\n351\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.280\nadd up all the 1s.\n\n352\n00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.820\nAnd what I mean by that is take every\nplace value that you see has a 1 in it and\n\n353\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.460\nadd it up and\nyou will get your answer, right?\n\n354\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:14.990\nIf I look at, if I add let's see,\n16 and 64, I get 80, right?\n\n355\n00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.933\nExcuse me, let me try that again.\n\n356\n00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:19.920\n16 and 64, yeah, I get 80.\n\n357\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.750\nAnd then from 80 to 128, I get 208, right?\n\n358\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.310\nSo it's easy to do the conversion from\n\n359\n00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:32.000\nbinary to decimal once you know\nthese place values, all right?\n\n360\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.590\nSo, I wanted to not skip over that.\n\n361\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.010\nMake sure that we do show\nyou that just in case.\n\n362\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.954\nNow let's kind of look at an IP address.\n\n363\n00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:43.790\nNow we've talked about these IP addresses,\nwe wanted you to kind of understand that\n\n364\n00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.540\nit's a 32-bit identifier and it uniquely\nidentifies a node within a network.\n\n365\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.610\nBut we're gonna give you an analogy that\nmaybe you're familiar with already, right?\n\n366\n00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.905\nBecause if it's the first\ntime you've seen networking,\n\n367\n00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.932\nmaybe this is just all fresh to you.\n\n368\n00:19:58.932 --> 00:20:02.910\nAnd you're like, what do you mean\nthat it's a unique identifier.\n\n369\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.290\nLet's compare that back to something else.\n\n370\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.460\nSo, I want you to think about mail, right?\n\n371\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.210\nWhen your mail is delivered.\n\n372\n00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.910\nAll right, you have a street address.\n\n373\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.094\nStreet addresses, and I'm not talking\nabout the whole entire thing with\n\n374\n00:20:17.094 --> 00:20:20.495\nZIP code and all, I'm just talking\nabout the street address itself, right?\n\n375\n00:20:20.495 --> 00:20:22.253\nNot the whole mailing address.\n\n376\n00:20:22.253 --> 00:20:25.020\nBut what is a street address comprised of?\n\n377\n00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.990\nWell, it's comprised of what?\n\n378\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.933\nA house number and it's comprised of a\nstreet number or street name, if you will,\n\n379\n00:20:31.933 --> 00:20:32.446\nright?\n\n380\n00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:35.961\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be\na number, it could be a name, all right?\n\n381\n00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:40.021\nAnd when a mail truck needs to\ndeliver to your address, well,\n\n382\n00:20:40.021 --> 00:20:42.390\nwhat do they first have to know?\n\n383\n00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.940\nThey first have to know\nwhat street your on.\n\n384\n00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.260\nSo they gotta locate the street.\n\n385\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.650\nAnd then once they locate the street,\nnow they have to differentiate your house.\n\n386\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.650\nLet's say if Ronnie's my neighbor,\nfrom Ronnie's house, right?\n\n387\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.940\nSo, what does that street\naddress have to have?\n\n388\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.040\nWell, it's got to have a street name.\n\n389\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.560\nBut on that street, it has to\nhave a unique identifier as well.\n\n390\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.265\nIt has to have a unique house number.\n\n391\n00:21:04.265 --> 00:21:06.730\nAnd that's how we differentiate,\n\n392\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.240\nfirst of all, houses that are on\nthat are on the same street.\n\n393\n00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.410\nAnd then the uniqueness of\nthe house within that street.\n\n394\n00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.550\nNow, don't throw duplexes or\ntriplexes at me.\n\n395\n00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.330\nWe're not going there.\n\n396\n00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.120\nWe're just talking about\nindividual houses.\n\n397\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:24.099\nNow, how would that analogy, how can\nwe bring that over to our networking?\n\n398\n00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:27.530\nAll right, well, I want you to\nthink of a network, all right?\n\n399\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.200\nAnd I want you to think of your IP\naddresses as street names, all right?\n\n400\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.090\nIf I look,\nI know that a computer is going to\n\n401\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.900\nhave to have a unique network identifier,\nright?\n\n402\n00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.580\nIf two computers are going to be\nconsidered to be on the same network.\n\n403\n00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.310\nThen like the houses that have to have\nunique identifiers and I need to identify\n\n404\n00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:55.170\nthem on the same street, they have\nto have the same street name, right?\n\n405\n00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.660\nAnd that's gonna be important.\n\n406\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.260\nSo I want you to think of the two\ncomponents within an IP address or\n\n407\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:05.120\nwhat's known as a network ID and\na node ID.\n\n408\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.050\nAnd I want you to think of your\nnetwork ID as kind of like\n\n409\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.960\nbeing your street name, all right?\n\n410\n00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:16.455\nIf two computers are gonna be considered\nto be on the same network like our houses,\n\n411\n00:22:16.455 --> 00:22:22.401\nthey have to share the same network\nidentifier, all right, street name.\n\n412\n00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:29.909\nBut how do we uniquely identify two of\nthese computers within that same network?\n\n413\n00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:32.420\nWell, let's go back to our house numbers,\nright?\n\n414\n00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.840\nJust like a house, sets of houses have\nto have unique house numbers to be\n\n415\n00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.390\ndifferentiated on the same street.\n\n416\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.570\nYour nodes, in this case, computers,\n\n417\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.610\nbut understand that many\nthings can have IP addresses.\n\n418\n00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:50.070\nThis host or node on this network must\nhave a unique identifier as well.\n\n419\n00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.290\nSo, like our house identifiers,\nthat's what's known as a node ID.\n\n420\n00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:59.730\nSo when IP address is comprised of\ntwo different things, all right?\n\n421\n00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:05.940\nIt's comprised of a network identifier,\nnetwork ID and a host ID, all right?\n\n422\n00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:11.070\nSo how do we get to this point, right?\n\n423\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.980\nWell, we do that by a couple of things,\n\n424\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.460\ncouple of rules you need to be aware of,\nall right?\n\n425\n00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.900\nIn order for two computers to be\nconsider on the same network, all right?\n\n426\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:28.440\nThey have to have the same network ID and\nthey also have to be uniquely identified.\n\n427\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.840\nLet me make sure that I put that\nthey have to be uniquely identified.\n\n428\n00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.640\nThey can't have the same house number.\n\n429\n00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.890\nThey can't have the same node identifier,\nright?\n\n430\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.580\nSo, let's say for instance, I'm a\nmaliciously, Ronny and I are neighbors and\n\n431\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:42.680\nI maliciously go out to his mailbox and\nI peel off the stickers on his mailbox.\n\n432\n00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.912\nI wouldn't do that,\nI don't wanna go to jail.\n\n433\n00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:47.920\n[LAUGH] And\nI put the same address as my house.\n\n434\n00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.850\nWell, I want you to go back and\nthink about it.\n\n435\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:55.000\nWhat would happen if somebody was trying\nto deliver mail to our street and\n\n436\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.710\nthey delivered mail to me, and\nthen they come to the next mailbox and\n\n437\n00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.380\nit's got the same house number?\n\n438\n00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.354\nWell, your mail carrier is gonna\nget a little confused, right?\n\n439\n00:24:02.354 --> 00:24:03.940\nWe're gonna have a conflict.\n\n440\n00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.980\nWell, you have to understand\nthat in networks,\n\n441\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.840\nyour nodes have to have those\nunique identifiers as well.\n\n442\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.405\nThey cannot have the same node ID, or\nhost ID, as it's called, all right?\n\n443\n00:24:14.405 --> 00:24:17.340\nThey, in order to be considered\non the same network,\n\n444\n00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.420\nthere's another thing\nthat they have to have.\n\n445\n00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.258\nThey both must share\nthe same subnet mask and\n\n446\n00:24:22.258 --> 00:24:26.100\nthat's where the subnet mask\ncomes into play, all right?\n\n447\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.570\nThe subnet mask, we're gonna get into,\n\n448\n00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.910\nit looks like we're running a little\nbit short on time on this episode.\n\n449\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.310\nBut when we come back on a part three,\nwe're gonna tell you\n\n450\n00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:39.280\nexactly how to apply that subnet mask so\nyou can identify what network you're on.\n\n451\n00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well, thank you for\nhelping us to at least get started with\n\n452\n00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.680\nthe idea of binary and\ndecimal conversions.\n\n453\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.590\nIt is a skill that we have to\nget ready for as we prepare for\n\n454\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.830\nthe Network+ exam and\nyou do need to practice this so\n\n455\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.710\nthat you get quicker at it for\nthe exam as well.\n\n456\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:25:00.050\nAnd then of course we broke into the\nconcept of what an IP address actually is\n\n457\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.360\nand where it actually does\nbreak those 32 bits apart.\n\n458\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.531\nAnd a portion of it is gonna\nbe your network ID, and\n\n459\n00:25:05.531 --> 00:25:07.257\na portion of it is gonna be your node ID.\n\n460\n00:25:07.257 --> 00:25:10.858\nAnd we still need to see how that's gonna\nbe accomplished inside of the computer\n\n461\n00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:14.710\nworld as well, and that will be coming\nup on part three that Wes mentioned.\n\n462\n00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.470\nBut this is a great place for\nus to sign-off then.\n\n463\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.670\nSo for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n464\n00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.620\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n465\n00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:29.445\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the CompTIA Network+ shows.\n\n466\n00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.966\n[MUSIC]\n\n467\n00:25:32.966 -->

00:00:07.916\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:11.282\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.813\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:18.051\nYou're watching the CompTIA Network+ Show.\n\n7\n00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.451\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today,\n\n8\n00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:24.356\nwe're actually taking a look at\na part four on IP Addressing.\n\n9\n00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:28.460\nNow just a little bit short of a rocky\nseries now is what we're taking a look at.\n\n10\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.792\nBut here to guide us through\nthis part four course,\n\n11\n00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.987\nis gonna be well our IP addressing\nguy himself, Mr. Wes Brian.\n\n12\n00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:36.835\nHow are you doing Wes?\n\n13\n00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:38.088\n[LAUGH] Ronnie, I'm doing great.\n\n14\n00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:40.751\nI was gonna say you give me a bit I\nmight catch up with Rocky for sure,\n\n15\n00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:41.430\nthat's right.\n\n16\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.597\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We got\n\n17\n00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:44.622\na few things that we gotta\nkinda round off, right?\n\n18\n00:00:44.622 --> 00:00:49.356\nOver the last three episodes the trilogy\nbefore this, right, we were talking about\n\n19\n00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.823\nthe DNA, the characteristics\nproperties of an IP address and\n\n20\n00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.856\nkinda broke down that\n32-bit identifier for you.\n\n21\n00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.059\nAnd we kinda shown you how a subnet masks\nwork and how you apply them to your IP\n\n22\n00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.411\naddresses so that you could divide net\nportion from the node portion as well.\n\n23\n00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.594\nAnd that's gonna be important on the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:09.864\nIt's gonna be important to know\nthe concepts behind doing that,\n\n25\n00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:12.608\nyou might actually even have\nto do that on the exam too.\n\n26\n00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:16.576\nSo, if you're not familiar with those,\nplease go back and watch them and\n\n27\n00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.250\nthen join us here in part four.\n\n28\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.237\nAnd who knows, it might be part\n4,000 by the time we're done.\n\n29\n00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:23.685\n[LAUGH] But I do wanna kinda double back.\n\n30\n00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:27.793\nI was talking with Ronnie before\nwe started this part four here,\n\n31\n00:01:27.793 --> 00:01:31.916\nand one of the things that I didn't\nmention in the last episode.\n\n32\n00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:36.440\nI didn't mention the host identifier,\nright, we owe the node portion, right.\n\n33\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.370\nWe showed you how to find the network ID,\nbut\n\n34\n00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.390\nremember that's only half\nof your IP address, right.\n\n35\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.639\nOne part of the IP address uniquely\nidentifies the network that these\n\n36\n00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:46.543\ncomputers are on.\n\n37\n00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:50.065\nAnd the other portion uniquely\nidentifies the node itself, right?\n\n38\n00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:52.830\nThe house number back to our analogy.\n\n39\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.255\nSo let me just go ahead and\njust double back real quick so\n\n40\n00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:57.121\nwe don't leave any stone unturned here.\n\n41\n00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:02.467\nAnd if we can look here, you'll see that\nin the last episode right at the end,\n\n42\n00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:07.011\nwe came up with a network\nID of 208.119.0.0, right?\n\n43\n00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:11.286\nThat was the network ID when\nyou apply a 255.255.0.0\n\n44\n00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:13.431\nsubnet mass to that IP address.\n\n45\n00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:19.987\nBut what I didn't mention is that, the\nunique node identifier, the house number.\n\n46\n00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:24.852\nIt's also important to understand, is that\nnumber unique within the network as well?\n\n47\n00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:29.216\nCuz we can't have two nodes that have the\nsame identical node portion or it would be\n\n48\n00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:33.365\nlike having two houses on the same street\nwith the same house number, right?\n\n49\n00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:35.999\nIt cause problems,\ndelivery problems with the carrier, right?\n\n50\n00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.779\nWhere we would have an IP conflict within\nour networks and that wouldn't happen and\n\n51\n00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.919\nI tell you, some operating systems\nwon't allow it to happen at all.\n\n52\n00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.341\nYou do that in Windows and if Windows'\noperating system detects an IP conflict\n\n53\n00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:51.361\nit's kinda interesting,like\nthe Windows operating system will shut\n\n54\n00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.908\ndown the entire TCP IP\nstack until you fix it.\n\n55\n00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:58.994\nSo it is important to understand\nthat our host portion, right,\n\n56\n00:02:58.994 --> 00:03:03.718\nthe unique host identifier\nis going to be .38.100.\n\n57\n00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:09.343\nSo if this computer is on\nthe 208.119.0.0 network,\n\n58\n00:03:09.343 --> 00:03:14.562\nthen it is uniquely identified\nas a 38.100, right.\n\n59\n00:03:14.562 --> 00:03:18.725\nAnd that means all other computers, would\nhave to have a different host portion or\n\n60\n00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:20.065\nwe would have conflicts.\n\n61\n00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:25.070\nSo I kinda want to double back on that,\nmake sure that we did cover that.\n\n62\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.160\nNow the next concept,\nall right when we look at an IP,\n\n63\n00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.160\nwe've been dealing primarily and\nwe really all with IPv4, right?\n\n64\n00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.270\nAnd we mentioned IP addresses\nare 32-bit binary address, right?\n\n65\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.147\nWell, it's not the only IP internet\nprotocol that we have out there.\n\n66\n00:03:44.147 --> 00:03:49.200\nWe've been talking about IPv4 and\nI've just generically saying IP, right?\n\n67\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.009\nWell there is also IPv6 too and then we're\ngonna get into that a little bit later.\n\n68\n00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:58.287\nSo I do want to mention that with\na 32-bit address space, right?\n\n69\n00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:03.215\nWe have certain classes that\nwe follow inside of IPv4\n\n70\n00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:08.039\naddressing, right,\nnow what do I mean by classes?\n\n71\n00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.308\nAll right, well you have to understand\nthat when the IP addressing first started\n\n72\n00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:15.131\nout probably going back to\nthe days of open net right,\n\n73\n00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.544\nbefore we even had the Internet,\nall right.\n\n74\n00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:20.806\nThe, the Internet, what is it?\n\n75\n00:04:20.806 --> 00:04:23.926\nThe Internet's assigned numbers authority,\nINA at the time,\n\n76\n00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:25.785\nwas overseeing everything, right.\n\n77\n00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:32.455\nThe unique identifiers that we have,\nthings like MAC addresses if you will,\n\n78\n00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:39.449\nwell they set up a structured set of\nclasses, if you will, for IPv4 addresses.\n\n79\n00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.675\nAnd it's important to understand that at\none time we were following a strict class\n\n80\n00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:49.919\nfull addressing scheme, all right, and\nit is important to address the classes.\n\n81\n00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.700\nNow, what do we mean by classes?\n\n82\n00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.400\nWell it meant if you had a certain IP\n\n83\n00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.390\nwith a certain subnet mask\nyou are in a certain class.\n\n84\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.680\nAnd depending on how many nodes\nyou needed within a network,\n\n85\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.902\nwould dictate which\nclass you would follow.\n\n86\n00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:10.435\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's talk a little bit about the classes,\n\n87\n00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.821\ninside an IPV4 address space, right?\n\n88\n00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:21.052\nQuite literally 0.0.0.1 all the way\nup to 255.255.255.255, right?\n\n89\n00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:24.065\nThe highest value you can have,\nyou have blocks,\n\n90\n00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:28.530\nthese individual blocks that are called\nranges and you have to know them.\n\n91\n00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.220\nSo, I've actually got a diagram here and\nlet's talk a little bit about the classes.\n\n92\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.380\nAll right, we have A through E\nclasses that we have to work with.\n\n93\n00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.350\nNow if you're coming from A+, one of\nthe things that we identified in A+,\n\n94\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.460\nwe really only talked about three classes.\n\n95\n00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.242\nWe talked about Class A, Class B, Class C,\n\n96\n00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.346\nif this is the first time you've seen\nthis, then maybe it's all new to you.\n\n97\n00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:53.531\nAnd we didn't talk about class D and\nclass E, all right, so\n\n98\n00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:56.014\nI want you to know as you\nmove into net plus, and\n\n99\n00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:59.980\nif it's the first time you've\nseen it well it's all new to you.\n\n100\n00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.610\nThis might be important on the net plus\nexam cuz they will want you to know\n\n101\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.950\nthe additional classes.\n\n102\n00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.780\nSo what are these classes?\n\n103\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.973\nWell, you have what is known\nas a class A IP address range.\n\n104\n00:06:10.973 --> 00:06:14.980\nYou have A, Class B, Class C,\nClass D and Class E.\n\n105\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.595\nNow I want you to know,\n\n106\n00:06:16.595 --> 00:06:21.953\nthat the first three classes are the IP\naddresses that are allocated out for\n\n107\n00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:26.907\nour communications that uniquely\nidentify computers on a network.\n\n108\n00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:31.275\nI will tell you that we have two\nadditional classes, one class, Class D,\n\n109\n00:06:31.275 --> 00:06:33.400\nand I will get on to this in a second.\n\n110\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.720\nClass D, all your computers use.\n\n111\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.071\nClass E is one that was just out there for\nresearch purposes and\n\n112\n00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:45.765\nexperimental and really we didn't\nallocate these to computers.\n\n113\n00:06:45.765 --> 00:06:51.285\nSo what is the criteria for\nbeing in a Class A range, right?\n\n114\n00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:57.165\nHow do we know that looking at my IP\naddress, that I'm in a Class A range?\n\n115\n00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:02.624\nWell, that means that your IP\naddress falls somewhere between\n\n116\n00:07:02.624 --> 00:07:07.576\n1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.\n\n117\n00:07:07.576 --> 00:07:13.025\nNow I'll come back to that because\ntechnically, this whole entire\n\n118\n00:07:13.025 --> 00:07:19.829\n127 range even though it falls within\na Class A range, it's actually reserved.\n\n119\n00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:24.212\nAnd we've actually talked about this\nbefore, we talked about a loop back\n\n120\n00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:29.020\naddress, we'll get back to that,\nbut technically 127 is reserved.\n\n121\n00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.260\nBut I do want you to know\nthat it does exist, and\n\n122\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.920\nit actually is kind of in that class\nrange, or that class if you will.\n\n123\n00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:45.030\nNow, what can be allocated to computers\nmore appropriately is anything from\n\n124\n00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.388\n1.0.0.0 all the way to 126.255.255.255.\n\n125\n00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:56.109\nAgain, let's just hold 127 network,\nit's all on it's own.\n\n126\n00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:58.125\nSo I know that if I have an IP address,\n\n127\n00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.065\nin fact,\nlet's go back to our IP addresses, right?\n\n128\n00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:05.256\nNotice I have a 70.201.10.186?\n\n129\n00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:11.726\nWell, if I compare that to our class, does\n70., whatever the last three octets are,\n\n130\n00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:17.964\ndoes that fall between 1.0.0.0.,\nand 126.255.255.255?\n\n131\n00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.450\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n132\n00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.120\nSo on the exam, they might give you\na question that says, this IP address,\n\n133\n00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.595\nwhat range does this fall in?\n\n134\n00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:27.625\nAnd if they give you something like a 70.,\nright?\n\n135\n00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:31.690\n201.10.186, you should know these classes.\n\n136\n00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.510\nYou should commit them to memory, and\n\n137\n00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.110\nmake sure that you recognize\nthat that is class A address.\n\n138\n00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.340\nAnd it falls within that range.\n\n139\n00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.691\nNow, class B.\n\n140\n00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:44.832\nAll right, when we talk about a class B,\nclass B starts, well, at 128.\n\n141\n00:08:44.832 --> 00:08:48.843\nAnd again, I want you to keep 127 just to\nthe side, because again, that is used for\n\n142\n00:08:48.843 --> 00:08:52.210\nwhat we call loopback processing,\nand that's our loopback network.\n\n143\n00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.480\nAnd more specifically,\nlike we've shown you in past episodes,\n\n144\n00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.970\ndepending on at what point you're\nwatching this, we ping the loopback.\n\n145\n00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.940\nWe use the loopback address within that\nnetwork just for loopback processing.\n\n146\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.460\nSo class B starts at 128.0.0.0 and\n\n147\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.110\ngoes all the way up to 191.255.255.255.\n\n148\n00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:14.520\nThat means that if I have got an IP\n\n149\n00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.120\naddress that falls\nwithin this range right?\n\n150\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.780\nAnd I am looking at that very\nfirst octet and it falls anywhere.\n\n151\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.340\nLet's say 110.10.18.31, right?\n\n152\n00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.169\nI know that 110 sits within\nthis class B range, and\n\n153\n00:09:31.169 --> 00:09:34.245\nI should be able to\nidentify it on the exam.\n\n154\n00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:36.532\nClass C range starts at 192.\n\n155\n00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:39.865\nNotice it's kinda easy if you can\nsee where the last one left off,\n\n156\n00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:41.756\nthe next one kinda picks up, right?\n\n157\n00:09:41.756 --> 00:09:50.060\n192.0.0.0 all the way to 223.255.255.255.\n\n158\n00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.710\nNow, these are the ranges that we\nactually allocate out to computers.\n\n159\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.430\nNow, that class D range.\n\n160\n00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.219\nLet's go ahead and\ntalk where the range is, and\n\n161\n00:09:58.219 --> 00:10:01.015\nthen we'll talk a little bit more\nabout what it's actually doing for us.\n\n162\n00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:05.209\nNotice it starts at 224.0.0.0, and\n\n163\n00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:10.595\nit ends at 240.255.255.255, all right?\n\n164\n00:10:10.595 --> 00:10:12.590\nThat's known as the multicast range.\n\n165\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.394\nAll right?\nAnd like we've established with\n\n166\n00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:17.578\nour network communications we've\ntalked about protocols like IGMP.\n\n167\n00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:21.820\nWe've talked about having to send a\nmulticast as a one to many communication.\n\n168\n00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.950\nWell guess what?\n\n169\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.550\nAll of your computers when they need to\nsend multicast communications are going to\n\n170\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.410\nbe using multicast addresses\nwithin this range.\n\n171\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.180\nThose are the multicast,\nclass D is the multicast range.\n\n172\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.083\nAll right?\n\n173\n00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:36.789\nNow the last one you'll see is class E.\n\n174\n00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:42.744\nThat's 241.0.0.0 all\nthe way to 255.255.255.255.\n\n175\n00:10:42.744 --> 00:10:47.556\nAnd this is essentially\nan experimental research purposes and\n\n176\n00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:50.742\nit is reserved for exactly that, right?\n\n177\n00:10:50.742 --> 00:10:52.203\nIt's not a multicast range,\n\n178\n00:10:52.203 --> 00:10:54.960\nwe don't actually allocate\nthis out to our computers.\n\n179\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.750\nThat being said I also want you to know\nthat within this range there's also\n\n180\n00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.010\na default subnet mask that would\nbe applied to these ranges.\n\n181\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.430\nAnd let's talk a little bit about\nwhat the subnet masks would be that\n\n182\n00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.170\nfall within these classes, too.\n\n183\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:20.040\nAnd that's 255.0.0.0,\nthat is the very first subnet mask.\n\n184\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.220\nAll right?\n\n185\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.210\nAnd I wanna kinda stop here because\nwe've kinda already learned.\n\n186\n00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:25.840\nWhat's up?\n\n187\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.440\n&gt;&gt; Hey Wes, as I was looking there on the\nscreen I kind of noticed that your class\n\n188\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.290\nD range, I think you had 240 there and\nthat might have to be a 239, I think.\n\n189\n00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look it.\n\n190\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.730\nSure enough.\n\n191\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.540\nSee this is why I'm\nglad I got Ronnie here.\n\n192\n00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.002\nLet's look at this.\n\n193\n00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:43.770\nThe range is actually wrong here.\n\n194\n00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.995\nIt's actually 224 to 239 and the class\nE range, that experimental range?\n\n195\n00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:51.375\nThat actually starts at 240 so,\ngood catch Ronnie I'm glad you,\n\n196\n00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:53.430\noop we'll get it right eventually here.\n\n197\n00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.612\n239 and\nthat class E range actually starts at 240.\n\n198\n00:11:57.612 --> 00:12:01.200\nSo as a recap,\nlet's make sure I get this right here.\n\n199\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.705\nIt is going to be 224.0.0.0 all the way to\n\n200\n00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:09.740\n239.255.255.255 is going\nto be the multicast range.\n\n201\n00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.709\nAnd then the class E experimental range.\n\n202\n00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:18.918\nStarts at 240.0.0.0 and\nmakes its way to 255.255.255.255.\n\n203\n00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:21.031\nThanks again Ronnie, I do appreciate that.\n\n204\n00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:23.074\nNow, I want you to notice something.\n\n205\n00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:26.953\nOne of the things that I mentioned is\nthat, when we look at the classes, right?\n\n206\n00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:30.858\nWhen this first started out depending\non how many nodes you needed within\n\n207\n00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:33.940\na network,\nwould put you within these ranges.\n\n208\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.180\nRemember when we talked\nabout our subnet mask?\n\n209\n00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.169\nWe said where all the zero bits were, that\nwould be the host portion of your address?\n\n210\n00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:45.007\nWhen we have 24 zero bits,\n24 bits that are part\n\n211\n00:12:45.007 --> 00:12:49.746\nof the hosts,\nthat's a lot of nodes on a network.\n\n212\n00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:57.540\nTechnically it's 16,777,216 possibilities,\nright?\n\n213\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.170\nWe'll go as to why that's\na little bit different, but for\n\n214\n00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.330\nthe most part, that's 16 million nodes\nthat you would need on a network.\n\n215\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.850\nAnd I can't remember\nsome of the companies,\n\n216\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.270\nI think Apple's still one of them.\n\n217\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.780\nI think Ford at one time,\nwhen this first started out,\n\n218\n00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.160\nthey were large enough that\nthey needed a block that big.\n\n219\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.470\nNow, the next subnet mask that we\nhave to understand for class B.\n\n220\n00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:27.489\nThis is gonna be a 255.0.0,\nor excuse me I'm sorry.\n\n221\n00:13:27.489 --> 00:13:32.656\n255, will get that right eventually,\n255.255.0.0.\n\n222\n00:13:32.656 --> 00:13:37.452\nThat is the subnet mask for your class\nB range here, let me do a little\n\n223\n00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:42.100\nformatting there and make it\na little easier to see, there we go.\n\n224\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.642\nNow in class C, all right?\n\n225\n00:13:44.642 --> 00:13:52.780\nYou would have a 255.255.255.0, all right?\n\n226\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.110\nSo remember, that is the subnet\nmask range, or the subnet mask,\n\n227\n00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.854\nif you will, for class C.\n\n228\n00:13:58.854 --> 00:14:04.031\nThat would be 255.255.255.0, all right?\n\n229\n00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:08.807\nNow, like I told you that with the amount\nof nodes within a class A network\n\n230\n00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:13.035\nbeing just over 16 mil, or\nactually just under 17 million,\n\n231\n00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:16.747\nnotice that we have two octets\nof 0s in our subnet mask.\n\n232\n00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:21.491\nThat means that we have 16 0s, 16 bits\nthat are reserved for the node portion.\n\n233\n00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:27.502\nIf I remember right, that's 65,536\ncombinations and we'll talk about\n\n234\n00:14:27.502 --> 00:14:33.078\nwhy that's not exactly that many nodes\nhere coming up a little bit later.\n\n235\n00:14:33.078 --> 00:14:37.590\nClass C, notice how when you have a single\noctet that's reserved for our nodes?\n\n236\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.409\nWell that means you, if you had an IP\naddress or a network that was at range,\n\n237\n00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:46.195\nthat means you only have\n256 potential combinations.\n\n238\n00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:51.702\nYou're talking about just under,\nover 250 computers right?\n\n239\n00:14:51.702 --> 00:14:55.482\nSo, even smaller the size of the network.\n\n240\n00:14:55.482 --> 00:14:59.790\nAnd these would be the classes that\nyou would fall into, all right?\n\n241\n00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.704\nNow, there's another way that you\ncan kind of remember which of\n\n242\n00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:09.531\nthese ranges an IP address falls in,\nif you look at the binary.\n\n243\n00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:10.450\nBecause you never know.\n\n244\n00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.400\nThey might give you a binary octet and\nsay,\n\n245\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.100\nif this is your first octet, all right?\n\n246\n00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.480\nWhich range does this fall into?\n\n247\n00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.380\nBecause back in the days when we\nonly had these three subnet masks,\n\n248\n00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.230\nit was very easy to tell, just like you\nprobably, if you’ve been following along,\n\n249\n00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.440\nprobably see, you can tell right away\nwhat portion of our network is, or\n\n250\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.590\nour IP address is gonna be the network\nportion and the host portion, right?\n\n251\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.230\nOr the node portion by now.\n\n252\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.670\nSo I can tell that in the class A range,\n\n253\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.330\nthe very first octet is\nyour network portion.\n\n254\n00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.047\nSo that's all I have to look at when I\nneed to find with a subnet mask like this\n\n255\n00:15:45.047 --> 00:15:45.940\napplied to that.\n\n256\n00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.491\nSee all I need to do is,\nfind out what is that first octet.\n\n257\n00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:52.866\nLet me show you a pattern here.\n\n258\n00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:57.744\nSo we got our eight bits out here and\nif I was to just real quickly convert\n\n259\n00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:01.520\nthis value here from\nthe decimal value into binary.\n\n260\n00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.740\nJust looking at that first octet,\nwell I would see this is kinda easy here.\n\n261\n00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.080\nLet me do some formatting again with this.\n\n262\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.430\nMake this a little bit easier for us.\n\n263\n00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.136\nAll right, so look at that first octet.\n\n264\n00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:19.810\nOn our 1.0.0.0, right,\nif I convert that into binary,\n\n265\n00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.140\nyou're gonna see that I have,\nwell, what do we have?\n\n266\n00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.675\nWe have zeroes all the way\nacross the board until we get\n\n267\n00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:28.785\nGet to that last place value, right,\nand that last place value is 1.\n\n268\n00:16:28.785 --> 00:16:31.695\nIf I do the same thing with\nsomething like 126, right,\n\n269\n00:16:31.695 --> 00:16:37.155\nwe're gonna see that that, well,\nthat first one is going to be a 0.\n\n270\n00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:42.995\nAnd I can't remember 126, help me out,\nRonnie, that's 0 and it is\n\n271\n00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:48.620\nI believe 0 1, no, is it one or\nones if I remember, right?\n\n272\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.170\n&gt;&gt; We don't want it at 64.\n\n273\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.300\n&gt;&gt; That's one at the 64\nthat's what it is yep,\n\n274\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.650\nand if I see that then-\n&gt;&gt; Everything but the last one.\n\n275\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Everyone but the last one,\nthank you very much there.\n\n276\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.590\nAll right,\nnow I want you to see something here,\n\n277\n00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.700\nnotice that the first bit position here,\nright, the 128 is zeroes.\n\n278\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.070\nIf your first octet starts with a 0,\n\n279\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:16.540\nit is going to be on the class A range,\nall right?\n\n280\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.820\nIt's an easy way cuz remember,\ntime is of the essence on the exam.\n\n281\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.160\nSometimes you need to save\na little bit of time, right?\n\n282\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.440\nAnswering a question.\n\n283\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.930\nWell, if you're looking at the binary,\n\n284\n00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.240\nit's easy to tell if it's in the class\nA range right away, that first octet.\n\n285\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.330\nThat first bit is going to be zero.\n\n286\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.400\nNow the next one we're\ngonna look at is 128.\n\n287\n00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.288\nAll right, well, let's go a head and\ndo a fairly quick conversion here and\n\n288\n00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.650\nI might tag you in on this\none to help me Ronny.\n\n289\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:49.535\n128 is well, a 1 in the 28 position and\nall 0's, right?\n\n290\n00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:53.811\nThe next one is 191, and\nif we do a 1 in that first position,\n\n291\n00:17:53.811 --> 00:17:57.710\nwe do a 0 in the second position,\nand then fill in 1's.\n\n292\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.895\nA real easy way to just convert that 191.\n\n293\n00:18:01.895 --> 00:18:05.630\nI want you to look at these\nfirst two bit positions.\n\n294\n00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.770\nNotice they are one zero.\n\n295\n00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.370\nWell, if I noticed that one zero in\nthe first two bit positions, I know it's\n\n296\n00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.960\na class B, it's gotta be a class B\nrange in that first range octet, right?\n\n297\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.120\nNow how about 192 or\nwhat does 192 look like.\n\n298\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.080\nWell, if we do 192 real quick,\nwe'll see one bit, two bits, right,\n\n299\n00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.200\nare ones and then the rest are zeros.\n\n300\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.240\nAnd if I look at 223,\nthat's a one, a one and\n\n301\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.710\na zero and then from 16 down is all ones.\n\n302\n00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.090\nNow you're gonna notice\na pattern here too.\n\n303\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.020\nNotice the first three bit positions,\nall right?\n\n304\n00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.780\nThe first three bit positions\nare a one one zero.\n\n305\n00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.715\nIf I see a one one zero in\nthis first three bit position,\n\n306\n00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:55.129\nI can tell right away that\nthis is a class C range.\n\n307\n00:18:55.129 --> 00:18:59.199\nSo there are some things that you can\ndo to kind of help you out if you\n\n308\n00:18:59.199 --> 00:19:02.090\nneed to save a little bit\nof time on your exams.\n\n309\n00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.370\nSo if we highlight those,\n\n310\n00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:10.040\nyou will see very easy that there's\na pattern to these, all right.\n\n311\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.900\nNow that's a little bit\nabout your classes,\n\n312\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.530\nright that's important to\nknow on the exam as well.\n\n313\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.890\nNow I will tell you that one of the things\nwe have to keep in mind is that,\n\n314\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.500\nWe followed for a while.\n\n315\n00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.350\nWe followed what's known\nas the classical system.\n\n316\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.801\nWell, there's a limitation to IPv4.\n\n317\n00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:33.730\nOne of the limitations, many limitations.\n\n318\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.970\nOne of the limitations is\nthat you only have 32 bits\n\n319\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.410\nwide to make up IP addresses, right?\n\n320\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:46.190\nNow, the total possibilities\nin the entire 32 bit\n\n321\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:52.020\nrange from zeroes to all the way to\nones is 4.3 billion combinations,\n\n322\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.750\nit's 4.294 billion change, but\nit's 4.3 billion combinations.\n\n323\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.200\nAnd if we go back to our\naddress classes D and\n\n324\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.350\nE, they're not allocated to anybody,\nright?\n\n325\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.570\nD everybody uses, E is for\nresearch purposes.\n\n326\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.630\nSo what that does is that shortens\nthe overall pool of addresses even less.\n\n327\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.772\nOnce a problem, right now when this\nsystem first came out, yeah, five or six.\n\n328\n00:20:17.772 --> 00:20:20.567\nI don't know how many,\nI'm gonna be in a [INAUDIBLE] here.\n\n329\n00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:24.350\nYeah, like five or six, maybe ten entities\non the backbone of [INAUDIBLE] right?\n\n330\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.190\nWith universities, if you will,\n\n331\n00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.680\nmilitary but then as it expanded and\nmore companies started joining.\n\n332\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.713\nAnd then we had things like the dot\ncom boom, you might think 4.3 billion,\n\n333\n00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:36.980\nthat should be enough, right?\n\n334\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.770\nWell, it wasn't, they didn't know that the\nInternet was gonna become as popular as it\n\n335\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.170\nis when they came up with\nthis classical system.\n\n336\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.700\nThey knew that eventually we were\ngonna run through all possibilities\n\n337\n00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.610\nthat we could run through and\nwe weren't gonna have any left.\n\n338\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.430\nSo what they did is they came up with\na way, kind of like a stop gap or kind of\n\n339\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:00.360\nstalling the inevitable depletion of these\nIP addresses and they said, you know what?\n\n340\n00:21:01.425 --> 00:21:05.150\nWe're gonna set aside a range,\nthere's gonna be essentially two ranges.\n\n341\n00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:10.100\nThere's gonna be what's known as a public\nrange, a public range of IP addresses.\n\n342\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.770\nAnd there's gonna be a private\nrange of IP addresses, all right.\n\n343\n00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.740\nNow the private range of addresses\nis something that you can use\n\n344\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.660\ninternally on your networks and\n\n345\n00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.865\nto understand the difference between\na public and a private range.\n\n346\n00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.185\nLet's go a little bit further, all right?\n\n347\n00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:26.845\nHow do I get an IP address?\n\n348\n00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:28.725\nAll right, well, you get an IP address and\n\n349\n00:21:28.725 --> 00:21:31.255\nthat's what allows you to communicate\nacross the networks,so what you\n\n350\n00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:34.765\nhave are known as regional\nInternet registrars, all right?\n\n351\n00:21:34.765 --> 00:21:36.495\nWe've been talking about INA, right?\n\n352\n00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.485\nThe Internet assign numbers authority.\n\n353\n00:21:38.485 --> 00:21:44.515\nAnd we said in 2003, it changed ICAN\nas overseeing this IP address spaces,\n\n354\n00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:47.560\nthe international corporation for\nassign names and numbers.\n\n355\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:52.560\nWell, what they did is they\nallocated out geographical regions\n\n356\n00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.750\nto what are known as RARs,\nregional Internet registrars, all right?\n\n357\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:03.280\nAnd if you wanna have access to\nthe Internet, we go to our local ISPs.\n\n358\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.220\nBut if you want to be able to\ncommunicate across the Internet,\n\n359\n00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:11.730\nthen what you have to do is you have to\nget one of these public IP addresses.\n\n360\n00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.920\nAll right, and\nwhere do we get those, right?\n\n361\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.380\nWell, we get those from the RIRs.\n\n362\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.870\nNow like I said, you might never have\nheard of a regional Internet registrar.\n\n363\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.680\nYou may have your local ISP but you\nhave to understand these are the top of\n\n364\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.180\nthe hierarchy when it comes\nto these IP addresses.\n\n365\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.660\nThe IPv4 address space,\n\n366\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.720\nand even the IPv6 address space out\nthere on the Internet, all right?\n\n367\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:37.370\nAnd let me show you some of the regional\nInternet registrars, all right?\n\n368\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.080\nWell, we have, what is it,\nfive of them I believe?\n\n369\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.610\nSix of them?\n\n370\n00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:41.410\nFive of them, right?\n\n371\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:47.760\nWe have AFRINIC, right, and\nthey control the IP address spaces for\n\n372\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.070\nis it five for the portions of Africa and\nthe Indian Ocean you see.\n\n373\n00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.970\nWe have APNIC there and that's\nthe Asiatic Pacific States if you will,\n\n374\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.482\nAsia and Oceanic, sorry.\n\n375\n00:22:59.482 --> 00:23:00.985\nARIN, that's here in the states,\n\n376\n00:23:00.985 --> 00:23:05.530\nthat's American Regional Internet\nNetwork Registrar I think and\n\n377\n00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.540\nthey do Canada, Caribbean, you have\nNorth Atlantic and the United States.\n\n378\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.480\nWe have LACNIC and that's the Latin\nAmerica and portions of the Caribbean and\n\n379\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.300\nthen RIPE NCC and that's Europe,\nMiddle East, and Central Asia.\n\n380\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.210\nAll right, so\nin order to get an IP address,\n\n381\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.060\nyou go to a local ISP and you say hey\nI need an Internet connection and for\n\n382\n00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.840\na fee they give you a public IP address\nand now you can connect to the Internet.\n\n383\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.979\nWell, the local ISPs get\nit from regional ISPs,\n\n384\n00:23:32.979 --> 00:23:37.806\nwhich finally get from these get there\nall their pool of IP addresses within\n\n385\n00:23:37.806 --> 00:23:42.886\nthe IPv4 address space from the big dogs\nhere, the top part of the hierarchy.\n\n386\n00:23:42.886 --> 00:23:48.426\nWell, these guys have\nessentially depleted.\n\n387\n00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:52.824\nWe've seen that were gonna\ndeplete the overall IPv4 space.\n\n388\n00:23:52.824 --> 00:23:56.154\nSo what happened was they said, all right,\n\n389\n00:23:56.154 --> 00:24:02.200\nlet's come up with a block within each\nclass of IP address ranges, right?\n\n390\n00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.930\nAnd we're gonna set those aside and\nwe'll let you use those internally\n\n391\n00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.270\non your networks, but you can't\nroute traffic across the Internet.\n\n392\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.020\nAnd what that does is that creates\na private IP address space\n\n393\n00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.900\nthat I don't need to go to\nan Internet service provider.\n\n394\n00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.210\nThe Internet service providers don't go\nto these regional Internet registrars and\n\n395\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.850\nhave to register those IP addresses\nbecause they're gonna be used\n\n396\n00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.910\non your internal networks and\nonly on your internal networks, right?\n\n397\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.890\nWe cannot communicate across the Internet\nwith them without additional technologies.\n\n398\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.052\nSo I want you do know to\ncommunicate with the Internet,\n\n399\n00:24:40.052 --> 00:24:44.684\nyou use public IP addresses and then\nthat's where you get those from your ISPs.\n\n400\n00:24:44.684 --> 00:24:46.736\nNow on your internal networks,\n\n401\n00:24:46.736 --> 00:24:50.388\nyou can use a set of IP addresses\nthat have been reserved.\n\n402\n00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:51.721\nI believe we were talking about this.\n\n403\n00:24:51.721 --> 00:24:56.100\nIt's [INAUDIBLE] RFC 1918,\nand that said, you know what?\n\n404\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.170\nWe're gonna reserve a portion of these\nIP addresses that anybody can use anyway\n\n405\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:04.120\nthey want, and we're not gonna\nrequire you to register with them.\n\n406\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.150\nYou don't have to lease these from\nanybody, you can use them as you see fit.\n\n407\n00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.130\nAnd we need to know\nthe private IP address range.\n\n408\n00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.700\nSo if we look, I believe I've\ngot these up here, there we go.\n\n409\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:21.270\nSo here is a private IP address range for\nthe classes that we had.\n\n410\n00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.352\nNow, keep in mind,\n\n411\n00:25:22.352 --> 00:25:26.376\nI don't need to go to an Internet\nservice provider to get these addresses.\n\n412\n00:25:26.376 --> 00:25:30.007\nWe can configure these on our\ninternal networks as much as we want.\n\n413\n00:25:30.007 --> 00:25:37.392\nAll right, Class A, we have 10.0.0.0\nall the way to 10.2.55.255.255.\n\n414\n00:25:37.392 --> 00:25:40.282\nThat's the private IP address ready for\nClass A.\n\n415\n00:25:40.282 --> 00:25:45.621\nClass B starts at 172.16.0.0 goes\n\n416\n00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:51.668\nall the way up to 172.31.255.255.\n\n417\n00:25:51.668 --> 00:25:58.089\nLast but not least is Class C,\nand that is the 192.168.0.0,\n\n418\n00:25:58.089 --> 00:26:02.837\nall the way up to 192.168.255.255.\n\n419\n00:26:02.837 --> 00:26:04.500\nKnow these ranges, right?\n\n420\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.740\nKnow that they actually sit with inside\nof the overall IPv4 address space.\n\n421\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.240\nThese IP addresses, any IP address\nthat falls within this range\n\n422\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.680\nI can configure it on my\ninternal network any way I want.\n\n423\n00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.210\nAny one of the ranges here\nI can use at my leisure.\n\n424\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.980\nAnd I don't have to go to some kind\nof Internet service provider and\n\n425\n00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.070\nget these IP addresses.\n\n426\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.060\nThere is a problem, though.\n\n427\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.520\nI can't use a private IP address\n\n428\n00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.517\nin order to communicate with\nthe Internet without technologies,\n\n429\n00:26:37.517 --> 00:26:41.630\nlike we'll talk about in other episodes,\nknown as network address translation.\n\n430\n00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.290\nThat was also a part of\nthe RFC 1918 that said, hey,\n\n431\n00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.100\nwe're gonna reserve a portion\nof these addresses.\n\n432\n00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.260\nThey'll be nonregistered.\n\n433\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.080\nPeople, companies can use them\ninternally as much as they want.\n\n434\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.560\nThey can't communicate with the Internet,\nbut we'll put a provision in there that\n\n435\n00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.260\nsays, hey, we'll introduce a technology\nthat'll allow you to do that.\n\n436\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.760\nWe'll talk in other episodes about\nnetwork address translation and\n\n437\n00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.260\nhow we can use private IP addresses\n\n438\n00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.370\nthrough our public IP addresses\nto communicate with the Internet.\n\n439\n00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.188\nThese are some of the technologies that\nyou need to be aware of in some of\n\n440\n00:27:11.188 --> 00:27:14.178\nthe DNA when it comes your\nIPv4 address restructure.\n\n441\n00:27:14.178 --> 00:27:17.573\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, just let me add in one more\nthing on those private IP addresses.\n\n442\n00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:21.266\nIf you'll bring that screen back up,\nthat will actually help us out.\n\n443\n00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:23.119\nThe other thing that we wanna talk out,\n\n444\n00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:26.490\ncuz this is where people get confused\nwhen they're starting to study,\n\n445\n00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.766\nis the idea of the subnet mask itself,\nwhich is a little bit strange.\n\n446\n00:27:29.766 --> 00:27:33.384\nSo you see the Class C, Wes has already\nshowed you the default subnet and mask for\n\n447\n00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:33.983\nthe class C.\n\n448\n00:27:33.983 --> 00:27:38.137\nBut in this private range\nat the very beginning,\n\n449\n00:27:38.137 --> 00:27:42.606\nit actually is gonna be a 255.255.0.0.\n\n450\n00:27:42.606 --> 00:27:43.669\nSo for the Class C one.\n\n451\n00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:44.432\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yes.\n\n452\n00:27:44.432 --> 00:27:46.170\n&gt;&gt; That is the one that that will be.\n\n453\n00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:47.775\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you remember that.\n\n454\n00:27:47.775 --> 00:27:50.459\nBecause if you don't take a look at that,\n\n455\n00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:53.538\nyou may find out that if\nyou're wondering why.\n\n456\n00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:59.879\nWhy does a Class C got a Class B\naddress or a Class B subnet mask.\n\n457\n00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:02.165\nThe other one in the Class B,\nthis is a strange one.\n\n458\n00:28:02.165 --> 00:28:07.872\nThis is where we get outside of the rules,\nand this one is actually 255.240.0.0,\n\n459\n00:28:07.872 --> 00:28:11.570\nwhich is something that you want\nto pay attention to as well.\n\n460\n00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.536\nMost of the time,\nnobody's gonnacall us out on that one, but\n\n461\n00:28:14.536 --> 00:28:17.116\nit is kind of a structure that\nyou want to make sure of.\n\n462\n00:28:17.116 --> 00:28:21.913\nAnd then the Class A is just a standard\none that we think of in the Class A which\n\n463\n00:28:21.913 --> 00:28:24.140\nis gonna be 255.0.0.0.\n\n464\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.310\nAnd those are kind of the basic ones.\n\n465\n00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.550\nYou do need to pay attention here,\nbecause even though you may not see it on\n\n466\n00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:34.100\nthe Network+ exam, it will be foundational\nas you start to move forward in\n\n467\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.710\nyour networking career to\nunderstand where they begin.\n\n468\n00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.600\nIf not, you'll be wondering, well, why are\nwe using this range and not this range,\n\n469\n00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.650\nand stuff like that?\n\n470\n00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.070\nAnd that's because these subnet masks\nreally do help to limit that range\n\n471\n00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.320\nof those 19, 18 addresses there.\n\n472\n00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.038\nSo that's what we wanna\npay attention to as well.\n\n473\n00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:57.577\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and it's interesting\nbecause you might wonder, well,\n\n474\n00:28:57.577 --> 00:29:01.747\nwhere did they get that number,\n172.16 to 172.31?\n\n475\n00:29:01.747 --> 00:29:04.610\nSo thank you for joining in on\nthere with that, Ronnie, as well.\n\n476\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.677\nSo keep in mind, some of the topics that\nRonnie and I have discussed in these,\n\n477\n00:29:08.677 --> 00:29:11.826\nwell what, four parts here when\nit comes to IP addressing.\n\n478\n00:29:11.826 --> 00:29:13.458\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, well,\nthank you again for\n\n479\n00:29:13.458 --> 00:29:16.034\nhelping us to get a little bit more\nunderstanding on the addressing.\n\n480\n00:29:16.034 --> 00:29:19.499\nAnd we see that it's not only about\nputting a number in a place that we don't\n\n481\n00:29:19.499 --> 00:29:20.165\nunderstand.\n\n482\n00:29:20.165 --> 00:29:22.218\nThere's a lot more technicality behind it.\n\n483\n00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:25.263\nBut these are some of the things you'll\ndefinitely need to pay attention to\n\n484\n00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.627\nwhen it comes to Network+ exam.\n\n485\n00:29:26.627 --> 00:29:30.864\nBut it also is basic skills, fundamental\nskills that you'll need as you advance\n\n486\n00:29:30.864 --> 00:29:33.120\nforward towards your networking career.\n\n487\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.353\nWithout these fundamental skills,\nyou will be lost.\n\n488\n00:29:36.353 --> 00:29:40.582\nSo make sure you pay attention to the idea\nof the IP addresses themselves, and\n\n489\n00:29:40.582 --> 00:29:44.049\nthese ranges, and where they're used and\nhow they're used.\n\n490\n00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:46.905\nBecause it's gonna be essential\nas you continue to move forward.\n\n491\n00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:49.765\nBut this is a great place for\nus to end this episode then.\n\n492\n00:29:49.765 --> 00:29:53.863\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n493\n00:29:53.863 --> 00:29:54.943\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n494\n00:29:54.943 --> 00:29:59.107\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore of the CompTIA Network+

00:00:08.570\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.915\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.075\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.075 --> 00:00:16.658\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:21.559\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA NET+ and\n\n8\n00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.490\nthis is Classless IPv4 Addressing.\n\n9\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.770\nMm, interesting?\n\n10\n00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.880\nAnd Wes Bryant is here to\ntell us all about that.\n\n11\n00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.700\nWes, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.137\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:33.802\nThat's right, we have been moving\nthrough things like IP Addressing and\n\n14\n00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:37.600\nIP structure and we've really been\ntalking about IP before the whole time.\n\n15\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.200\nBut now we're gonna get into\nkinda breaking the rules, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.075\nIn other episodes,\n\n17\n00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.965\nwe talked about the classes,\nwe kinda identified those classes.\n\n18\n00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:49.646\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna look\nat some of the concepts behind how\n\n19\n00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:53.882\nwe kind of break the rules and\nwe go with classless IP addressing.\n\n20\n00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.535\nAll coming up here in this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.895\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, why would we need\nclassless IPv4 addressing?\n\n22\n00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:03.745\n&gt;&gt; Well they came up with a classful\nsystem at a time that basically\n\n23\n00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:07.565\nthe Internet or back in the days of\nthe ARPANET when it first started out.\n\n24\n00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:12.283\nThey came up with a classful system, and\nit had a set of clearly defined walls,\n\n25\n00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:13.690\nif you will.\n\n26\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.923\nThe problem is with the classiful system,\nthe system was very wasteful.\n\n27\n00:01:17.923 --> 00:01:22.156\nAnd it's just because they really didn't\nknow at the time that they came up with\n\n28\n00:01:22.156 --> 00:01:22.920\nthat system.\n\n29\n00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.745\nThat there was gonna be an exponential\ngrowth of devices, nodes if you will,\n\n30\n00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:33.170\ncomputers that wouldl be out there, on\nthis thing that would eventually become.\n\n31\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.738\nThe Internet,\nwe go through the dot com boom.\n\n32\n00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:40.800\nWhat they noticed is that we were\nhaving with that exponential increase.\n\n33\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.637\nWe were also having an exponential\ndepletion of the available addresses\n\n34\n00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:48.266\nthat we had within this 32 bit space.\n\n35\n00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.678\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n36\n00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:54.647\nBack in the day, the old days,\nwe used to think that an IP address\n\n37\n00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:58.530\nwas assigned to a house,\na unit or an enterprise.\n\n38\n00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.780\nBut not the case, it's per unit.\n\n39\n00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.180\n&gt;&gt; It usually is,\nit's per host, any host, right?\n\n40\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.357\nAny node that wants to actually\ncommunicate across the Internet\n\n41\n00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.928\nin those days would have to\nhave an IP address, right?\n\n42\n00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:13.912\nWell, as they started to see that, hey,\n\n43\n00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:17.020\nwe were going to eventually run\nout of the available addresses.\n\n44\n00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.420\nThey said hey we've got to put some stop\ngaps in place to kinda stall, if you will,\n\n45\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.190\nnot to really eliminate it because\nit was still gonna happen.\n\n46\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.270\nBut can we put some kind\nof governor on it, right?\n\n47\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.852\nCan we push the clutch in and\nkinda ghost for\n\n48\n00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:33.095\na while if you will and try to stall\nthe inevitable depletion, right?\n\n49\n00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:38.470\nIn other episodes, we told you\na little bit about that RFC 1918.\n\n50\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.402\nWhich is the Internet engineering\ntask forces request for comments for\n\n51\n00:02:43.402 --> 00:02:46.950\nimplementing private IP address ranges,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.650\nPrivate IP address ranges were set\naside because they said, you know what?\n\n53\n00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.026\nThis is gonna help a lot of people.\n\n54\n00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:53.610\nIf you don't need to connect\nout to the Internet,\n\n55\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.930\nthen what we'll do is we'll\nreserve in each of those classes.\n\n56\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.395\nIn fact let me kinda show you here.\n\n57\n00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:02.401\nIf you remember our classes that we\nwere talking about in other episodes and\n\n58\n00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:04.130\nif not, go back and watch those episodes.\n\n59\n00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.603\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do.\n&gt;&gt; Remember we have our classes and\n\n60\n00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:12.167\nthen there's you know, there's only so\nmany addresses within class A, B, and C.\n\n61\n00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:15.357\nAnd then they put the private range\nin there, and they said okay,\n\n62\n00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:19.132\nwe're gonna make the private range here,\nand we're gonna set these aside.\n\n63\n00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:23.213\nAnd they don't have to be unique across\nthe Internet, but there is a stipulation,\n\n64\n00:03:23.213 --> 00:03:26.090\nyou can't route traffic across\nthe Internet with these.\n\n65\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.059\nBut you can use these internally, on your\nown networks, behind your routers, and\n\n66\n00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.829\nnot communicate with the Internet.\n\n67\n00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.609\nNow, they also put into play,\nsome technologies,\n\n68\n00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.016\nlike network address translation, right.\n\n69\n00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.998\nAnd that allows us to take an internal,\nprivate IP address, and\n\n70\n00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:41.820\nkinda do some packet mangling.\n\n71\n00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.380\nAnd replace a single public IP address\n\n72\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.950\nstill using multiple internal\nprivate IP addresses.\n\n73\n00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.160\nSo that also helped to kinda stall\nthe depletion of that classical system.\n\n74\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.320\nWell, they kind of figured out, that we\ngot to go a little bit farther than that,\n\n75\n00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.605\nwe can't just reserve a private range.\n\n76\n00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:03.300\nWe've got to make it to\nwhere there's less waste.\n\n77\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.617\nAnd let me show you what I mean here.\n\n78\n00:04:04.617 --> 00:04:08.826\nNow, if we go back to the classful system,\nlet's say that this is all that we had,\n\n79\n00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:10.351\nwas the classful system, and\n\n80\n00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.480\nlet's say that you got a network\nwithin this range, right?\n\n81\n00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.940\nAnd let's go ahead, and I tell you what,\nI'll just kind of bump this\n\n82\n00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.860\nfont up here a little bit and\nmake this a little bit bolder.\n\n83\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.400\nAnd let's say, I don't know,\nyou've got the 3.0.0.0 network, right?\n\n84\n00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.383\nWell you would have this\nsubnet mask right away, right?\n\n85\n00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:33.724\n255.0.0.0 and remember in other\nepisodes we said that those\n\n86\n00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:38.591\n255s represent one bits in the binary and\nabove that's where your IP sits.\n\n87\n00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.139\nThat means that that block or\nthat octet is a part of the network range.\n\n88\n00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.835\nWell, you can see that with a default or\n\n89\n00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:50.233\nclassical subnet mask of 255.0.0.0\napplied to this IP address means\n\n90\n00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:56.170\nthat we're gonna have three octets that\nare reserved all for our nodes, right?\n\n91\n00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.675\nWell three octets is 24 bits, and\nif you do two to the power of 24,\n\n92\n00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:04.498\nyou come up with just under\n17 million potential nodes.\n\n93\n00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:05.404\n&gt;&gt; Well that's a few.\n\n94\n00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:06.418\n&gt;&gt; That's right, right?\n\n95\n00:05:06.418 --> 00:05:10.027\nWell here's the thing,\nwhat if you only needed 10 million, right?\n\n96\n00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:13.280\nWell, you couldn't get one\nof these Class B ranges,\n\n97\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.590\nright, cuz the Class B\nrange reserves two octets.\n\n98\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.780\nRemember the 0s are our node bits.\n\n99\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.940\nReserves two octets for the host,\n\n100\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.890\nwhich means it's 65,534 hosts\nyou can get on a network, right?\n\n101\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.974\nSo if I needed 10 million,\nI would have to go into that A range and\n\n102\n00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:31.679\nI would have to lease from\nan Internet service provider.\n\n103\n00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:33.729\nI'd have to get one of\nthose class A ranges.\n\n104\n00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.706\nBut the problem is, what happens to\nthe other 6,777,214 nodes or addresses?\n\n105\n00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:43.723\nWell, you can't lease\nthose out to anybody else.\n\n106\n00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:46.522\nSo if you were a company\nthat was big enough and\n\n107\n00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:49.181\nhappened to need 10 million addresses.\n\n108\n00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.900\nWe just wasted 6 million because we\ncan't just release these over to anybody\n\n109\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.650\nelse, right?\n\n110\n00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.835\nSo that was a problem.\n\n111\n00:05:54.835 --> 00:06:01.487\nOr what if you are a company that\nmay be needed 3,000 addresses?\n\n112\n00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:04.150\nAll right, well you had a couple\nof things you could do.\n\n113\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.766\nYou could get one Class B network,\nright and\n\n114\n00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:10.522\nthat would give you the potential\nto have 65,533 nodes.\n\n115\n00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:14.162\nBut the problem is that\nyou only needed 3,000.\n\n116\n00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:17.577\nWhat do you do with\nthe other 62,000 addresses?\n\n117\n00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:18.823\n&gt;&gt; Give to my Aunt Gert.\n\n118\n00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:20.930\n&gt;&gt; You can't give them,\nyou can't gift them, right.\n\n119\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.362\nIt's not like the fruit cake,\nyou can't regift it, right?\n\n120\n00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.633\nAnd I know you like fruit cakes,\nso I'm picking on Zach, right?\n\n121\n00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:26.774\n&gt;&gt; I like them, I'm sorry.\n\n122\n00:06:26.774 --> 00:06:28.484\n&gt;&gt; You can't regift it, right?\n\n123\n00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:31.191\nSo those just become unused addresses.\n\n124\n00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.762\nSo what they were noticing is\nwith this classful system,\n\n125\n00:06:33.762 --> 00:06:36.454\nwell what would you do if\nyou needed 3,000 addresses?\n\n126\n00:06:36.454 --> 00:06:41.469\nWell, if I did a Class B,\nI'm wasting around 62,000 addresses or so.\n\n127\n00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.879\nIn a Class C,\nwell in order to get that 3,00,\n\n128\n00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.136\nremember that Class C\nonly has a single octet.\n\n129\n00:06:48.136 --> 00:06:50.131\nThe 0s are reserved for\nthe host bits, right?\n\n130\n00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:54.595\nSo at 8 bits, that only gives\nyou 254 potential nodes, and\n\n131\n00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:58.737\nwe'll talk about why that number\nis 4 at the end of there.\n\n132\n00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:03.648\nWell, 254 nodes, if I needed 3,000,\nthat means I would have to get, what,\n\n133\n00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:04.956\n6 of those networks?\n\n134\n00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:09.259\nI'd have to have at lease 6 of those\nnetworks to try to achieve my goal of\n\n135\n00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:13.511\nhaving 3,000 nodes, so\nthat isn't necessarily a lot of waste.\n\n136\n00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:15.972\nIt's more wasted money-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n137\n00:07:15.972 --> 00:07:20.053\n&gt;&gt; For the employer or for the person that\nneeds to lease those IP addresses from\n\n138\n00:07:20.053 --> 00:07:21.859\nthe Internet service provider.\n\n139\n00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:26.415\nSo again you had a rapid depletion of\nC networks because of the fact that,\n\n140\n00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:30.090\nyeah they're smaller but\nyou'd have to get more of them.\n\n141\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.026\nSo there really was no in between.\n\n142\n00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:35.521\nSo the classful system again,\nit implemented a lot of waste, right, or\n\n143\n00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:38.408\nit brought about a lot of waste\nbecause of those addresses.\n\n144\n00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.986\nThey said well what if, right,\nwhat if we break the rules?\n\n145\n00:07:41.986 --> 00:07:43.607\nWhat if we say you know what?\n\n146\n00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:47.393\nWe're gonna come up with\na system called classless.\n\n147\n00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:53.630\nAnd we're going to allow you to manipulate\nthis subnet mask any way you need it,\n\n148\n00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.470\nin order to Create the networks\nthat you need with the amount of\n\n149\n00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.307\nnodes you need,\nwith the least amount of waste.\n\n150\n00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:04.432\nAll right?\nOr at least to reduced the waste.\n\n151\n00:08:04.432 --> 00:08:05.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n152\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.200\n&gt;&gt; And that's where the classPAL system\ncomes up, and there are some components\n\n153\n00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.090\nwithin a classPAL system that\nyou're gonna have to be aware of.\n\n154\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.619\nSo when we talk about classless system, I\nwanna start with a default subnet mask and\n\n155\n00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:19.891\nkinda recap where we were when we were\ntalking about some things like decimal to\n\n156\n00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:21.071\nbinary conversion.\n\n157\n00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:23.804\nIf you remember,\nwe said decimal to binary conversion.\n\n158\n00:08:23.804 --> 00:08:30.065\nIf you're not familiar with that,\nShow, definitely go back and watch it.\n\n159\n00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:33.543\nBecause we're just basically using\nthe exact same information that we we're\n\n160\n00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:34.235\nusing before.\n\n161\n00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:38.915\nBut if you remember, I told you that\nthe default subnet masks right,\n\n162\n00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:42.800\nthat would be a single octet of 255 or\n1 bits, right?\n\n163\n00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.720\nSo we have the network portion of your\n\n164\n00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.890\naddress would be any octet\nthat's above those 1's.\n\n165\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.380\nNotice that in the class B default\nsubnet mask we would end up having well,\n\n166\n00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:53.990\nwhat would it be?\n\n167\n00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.220\nIt'd be two octets of 1 bits would be\nreserved for our network portion, and half\n\n168\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.170\nof those, the other 16 bits if you will,\nwould be reserved for the node portion.\n\n169\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.720\nAnd then last but not least,\nwe have the class B default subnet mass,\n\n170\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.324\nwhich would be a set of 24 1 bits,\nright, on that side, right,\n\n171\n00:09:15.324 --> 00:09:21.650\n255.255.255.0, with only a single\noctet reserved for the node portion.\n\n172\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.901\nSo I want you to understand,\nwhen we start talking about this,\n\n173\n00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:29.992\nI want you to keep in mind that\nhowever many host bits we have,\n\n174\n00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:34.565\nthe more host bits we increase,\nthe more host we have available, or\n\n175\n00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:38.039\nhost addresses we have\navailable on that network.\n\n176\n00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:43.596\nWell, with these fixed links, right, these\nfixed walls, there was no manipulation.\n\n177\n00:09:43.596 --> 00:09:50.176\nIf you had a 255.0.0.0 subnet mask on\nyour Class A address, that means fixed.\n\n178\n00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:53.000\nYou would have all of these\n24 bits reserved for hosts.\n\n179\n00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.480\nAnd there was no way to manipulate them.\n\n180\n00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.606\nAgain, If we only needed 10 million,\nwe needed 1 million.\n\n181\n00:09:57.606 --> 00:10:01.878\nThat would leave 15 million or more\nthat would be completely wasted, right,\n\n182\n00:10:01.878 --> 00:10:04.770\nhow would you get up to\nthat million any other way?\n\n183\n00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.950\nWell it would just be economically\ninfeasible for the company because they'd\n\n184\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.610\nhave to get multiple, and I wouldn't\neven begin to do the math right there,\n\n185\n00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.380\nto adding up 65,000, 65,000,\ntill you get up to 1 million, right?\n\n186\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.390\nThat's just not feasible.\n\n187\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.341\nSo again, it was a lot of waste.\n\n188\n00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:22.864\nSo when we start talking about\nthe classless system, all right,\n\n189\n00:10:22.864 --> 00:10:24.090\nI wanna go back again.\n\n190\n00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.690\nI want you guys to keep in mind that,\n\n191\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.140\nremember, that when we talk\nabout anywhere these 255's are,\n\n192\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.580\njust keep that in mind that, hey, those\nare part of your network bits, right?\n\n193\n00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.834\nThose are your network bits, and that's\nwhy I'm kinda keeping the same color\n\n194\n00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:40.065\ncoordination that we were\ngoing along with, right?\n\n195\n00:10:40.065 --> 00:10:43.089\nSo and that's gonna come into play\nbecause that's gonna make it easier for\n\n196\n00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:46.065\nsome of the other things that we have\nto talk about in the classPAL system or\n\n197\n00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:47.508\nthe classless system, excuse me.\n\n198\n00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:53.101\nSo notice that 255.0.0.0 is\nessentially one octet of 255's right?\n\n199\n00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:57.685\nAnd that first octet and then your last\nthree octets, the second, the third, and\n\n200\n00:10:57.685 --> 00:10:59.621\nthe fourth are all 0's, right?\n\n201\n00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.775\nWe've got 255.255.0.0,\n\n202\n00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:08.135\nagain that is the first octet of 1's,\nthe second octet of 1's.\n\n203\n00:11:08.135 --> 00:11:11.383\nAnd then the last, if you will,\nthe last two octets, the third and\n\n204\n00:11:11.383 --> 00:11:13.070\nthe fourth are all 0's, right?\n\n205\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.340\nWell, and then the last one being 255\nhere, and if we look at 255, or I'm sorry,\n\n206\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.620\nclass C subnet mass, if we look at\n255.255.255, you can now see that\n\n207\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.220\nwe've got what, one octet, two, three,\nall the way up to the third octet of 1's.\n\n208\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.766\nThe fourth octet is what is remaining for\nthe host, right?\n\n209\n00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:34.045\nSo these were the fixed walls, right?\n\n210\n00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:36.552\nThese barriers that we have about here,\nand\n\n211\n00:11:36.552 --> 00:11:41.110\nthere was really no way to manipulate them\nbefore we went to a classless system.\n\n212\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.574\nWell in order to go to a classless system,\nwhat they said is you know what,\n\n213\n00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:48.310\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna let you\n\n214\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.270\napply any subnet mask pretty much\nthat you want two IP addresses.\n\n215\n00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.028\nWe're gonna let you manipulate the bits,\nwe're gonna break down these walls, and\n\n216\n00:11:57.028 --> 00:12:00.392\nyou can manipulate those bits\nto basically get less waste.\n\n217\n00:12:00.392 --> 00:12:03.800\nTo reduce the amount of waste that\nyou have within those networks, and\n\n218\n00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.494\nalso to divide up the networks a little\nbit more to the way that you need them in\n\n219\n00:12:07.494 --> 00:12:11.550\norder to accomplish whatever your\nnetwork design might be, all right.\n\n220\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:16.090\nSo that's where we gotta start talking\nabout classless ranges, all right?\n\n221\n00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.180\nAnd what we mean by that\nis we can start to add or\n\n222\n00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.540\ntake away bits, if you will,\nfrom the host side.\n\n223\n00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.240\nIf we take away bits from the host side,\nwhat are we doing?\n\n224\n00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.940\nWell I want you to think about up here,\nright?\n\n225\n00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.471\nJust think about our\nsubnet masks in general.\n\n226\n00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:34.024\nIf I go from having three octets of 0's,\n\n227\n00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:38.307\nwhich is 16,777,214 possibilities.\n\n228\n00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:40.264\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Then what I do is if I go and\n\n229\n00:12:40.264 --> 00:12:43.433\nI reduce that down to 16 of those 0's,\nright,\n\n230\n00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:48.354\nwhat that does is it exponentially\ndecreases the amount of nodes that I have.\n\n231\n00:12:48.354 --> 00:12:54.570\nCuz now I when I have 16 bits for the\nnodes, that 65,534 possibilities, right?\n\n232\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.564\nIf we decrease it even more, which is\nwhat the classPAL system would do,\n\n233\n00:12:58.564 --> 00:13:02.817\nall the way down to eight bits, well now\nI only have eight bits for my host, and\n\n234\n00:13:02.817 --> 00:13:06.701\nthat's 254 potential nodes that\nwe can have on a network, right?\n\n235\n00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:09.390\nWell, you might need to\ntailor it a little bit more.\n\n236\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.026\nYou might have to shrink it down,\nmaybe you wanna add a couple of networks,\n\n237\n00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:16.085\nwhich we call subnetting, and\nwe'll look at here in a second,\n\n238\n00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:18.186\nor you wanna reduce the network even more.\n\n239\n00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:20.490\nSo maybe you only have 50 computers.\n\n240\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.650\nMaybe I have a class C network\nto start out with, and\n\n241\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.000\nwhat I want to do is I want to go, I don't\nwant to just have these eight bits and\n\n242\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.110\nhave all of these computers on\none giant 254-node network.\n\n243\n00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.580\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I only want 50 on one network.\n\n244\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.392\nWhy would I want 50 on one network?\n\n245\n00:13:37.392 --> 00:13:40.182\nWell, it's not only about waste,\nit's also about broadcast domains.\n\n246\n00:13:40.182 --> 00:13:44.140\nRemember, routers don't pass\nbroadcasts across their interfaces.\n\n247\n00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.016\nSo if I want to reduce the amount of\nbroadcasts, if you will, reduce or\n\n248\n00:13:49.016 --> 00:13:54.656\ndivide broadcast domains up what I can do\nis I can do what's known as subnetting.\n\n249\n00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:56.738\nSo subnetting isn't only done for\n\n250\n00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:59.763\nan elimination of the waste\nof your IP addresses.\n\n251\n00:13:59.763 --> 00:14:04.626\nIt's also, you could do this to\ndivide up broadcast domains likewise.\n\n252\n00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:08.818\nSo let's go ahead and talk about\nthese classless ranges, all right?\n\n253\n00:14:08.818 --> 00:14:14.180\nYou will see that our subnet mask still\nhas to follow the same rules, all right?\n\n254\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.640\nWhat are those rules, all right?\n\n255\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.310\nFrom left to right,\nthey have to be continuous 1-bits.\n\n256\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.844\nThere has to be a dividing line\nbetween the 1-bits and the 0-bits, and\n\n257\n00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:24.760\nthere can't be 0's interdispersed\nin between the 1's.\n\n258\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.875\nThat's why there's really\nonly eight numbers, and\n\n259\n00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:28.855\nlet me just count these\nmake sure I got this right.\n\n260\n00:14:28.855 --> 00:14:34.511\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, numbers that\nreally can follow that concept of\n\n261\n00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:40.528\nallowing your subnet mask to be continuous\n1's, and these are those numbers, right?\n\n262\n00:14:40.528 --> 00:14:42.885\nAnd if we look,\nI want you to think about it, right?\n\n263\n00:14:42.885 --> 00:14:48.724\nIf I was to say, you know what,\nI think up here 255.255.255.0,\n\n264\n00:14:48.724 --> 00:14:54.110\nI think I want to add another 1 bit\nin this subnet mask, all right?\n\n265\n00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.030\nIf I do that, let's say we just turn\nthat on and now that bit if you will,\n\n266\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:03.090\nis going to be no longer\na part of the host.\n\n267\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.310\nWell what that's actually gonna be\nnow is we're gonna make that part of\n\n268\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.120\nthe network,\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n\n269\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.002\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n270\n00:15:09.002 --> 00:15:10.170\nWell how do I do that?\n\n271\n00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.520\nI have to turn that from a 0 into a 1, and\n\n272\n00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.682\nnow it becomes part of my network bits,\nright?\n\n273\n00:15:14.682 --> 00:15:20.830\nIf I change my subnet masks, those 0's to\n1's, 1 bits now denote the network, right?\n\n274\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.600\nWell what that does is now what that\ndoes is that gives me an extra bit for\n\n275\n00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.240\nthe network.\n\n276\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.810\nAnd we'll figure out how that\nworks out possibilities-wise.\n\n277\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.345\nBut it reduces the amount of bits\nthat I have for my nodes, right?\n\n278\n00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:36.412\nSo now I only have 7 bits for my nodes.\n\n279\n00:15:36.412 --> 00:15:41.273\n&gt;&gt; All right, and if I have seven bits for\nmy nodes, then I go from eight bits\n\n280\n00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:46.328\nbeing 254 possibilities,\nI'm reducing it to 126 possibilities.\n\n281\n00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:49.122\nAll right,\nnow we'll see exactly how this works, but\n\n282\n00:15:49.122 --> 00:15:51.430\nyou understand that if\nI apply a subnet mask,\n\n283\n00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.590\nI also have to figure out What the decimal\nvalue of this binary number is, right?\n\n284\n00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.885\nWe still need to know,\n\n285\n00:15:56.885 --> 00:16:00.780\nbecause our subnet masks are denoted\nin decimal notation, right?\n\n286\n00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.490\nDotted decimal notation.\n\n287\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.250\nSo what is this number, right?\n\n288\n00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.310\nIs it still contiguous 1 bits?\n\n289\n00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:11.210\nWell if you can look from the left to the\nright, I still have contiguous 1s, right?\n\n290\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.170\nAll the way up to this fourth octet now.\n\n291\n00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.950\nRemember we're in the fourth octet here,\nbut we've added a 1 bit.\n\n292\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.900\nWe're basically what\nthey call borrowing bit.\n\n293\n00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.300\nYou're saying all right, I know that\nI've got a class C subnet mask, and\n\n294\n00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.280\nwhat I need to do is I need to\nbasically shorten the amount or\n\n295\n00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.790\nreduce the amount of hosts bits and\nwhen I do,\n\n296\n00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.440\nwhat I'm doing is I'm increasing\nnetwork bits in order to do that.\n\n297\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.240\nNow that does a couple of things.\n\n298\n00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.100\nIf I increase a network bit, that also\nadds an additional network to your,\n\n299\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.922\nor however many networks,\nwe'll get into exactly how many.\n\n300\n00:16:43.922 --> 00:16:46.620\nThat's gonna increase the amount\nof networks you have, but\n\n301\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.820\nit's gonna reduce the amount\nof nodes you have.\n\n302\n00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:53.650\nAnd that's what we do when we in\norder to have less waste, we reduce\n\n303\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:58.460\nthe amount of host bits that we have and\nwe do that with a classless system.\n\n304\n00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.700\nNow, you might say that,\nI want you to know the bits.\n\n305\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.300\nThat's gonna come into play here in a\nsecond, but notice that if I have one bit.\n\n306\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.790\nWe'll just focus on that last octet or\na single octet at this point, right?\n\n307\n00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.910\nWe'll just stay in the class C range\ncuz when you're first learning,\n\n308\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.145\nit makes it a little bit easier, right?\n\n309\n00:17:15.145 --> 00:17:17.240\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll stay in that class C range.\n\n310\n00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.370\nAnd notice that in that last octet,\nZack, I turned on 1 bit.\n\n311\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.830\nI call it turning it on cuz if it's off,\nit's 0.\n\n312\n00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:23.890\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Remember if we take,\n\n313\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.450\nif we think about binary, and electrical\nimpulses, the presence of electricity\n\n314\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:32.430\nas a binary 1, the absence of\nelectricity is a binary 0, right?\n\n315\n00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why I say, turning it on.\n\n316\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.670\nYou might hear that or borrowing a bit.\n\n317\n00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.470\nNow once I borrowed that bit,\n\n318\n00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.150\nI now have to figure out what\nthis eight bit decimal value is.\n\n319\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.490\nJust like we were when we're doing\ndecimal to binary conversion..\n\n320\n00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.596\nWe also showed them, if you remember, how\nto do binary to decimal conversion, right?\n\n321\n00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:53.190\n&gt;&gt; Lot of fun doing.\n&gt;&gt; And then what that means is that I just\n\n322\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.740\nuse the same chart and anywhere I see\nthe 1s, I add up those place values.\n\n323\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.720\nSo I can see that 128 is still a single 1,\nand\n\n324\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.590\nif I put it on the end of this octet here\nit completes those contiguous 1s, so\n\n325\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.210\nit's what's known as a valid subnet mask,\nall right?\n\n326\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.020\nNow, in order to denote this in the\ndecimal, I'm gonna change that last octet,\n\n327\n00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:20.070\nnow instead of being a 0, because we've\nturned that 1 bit on, it's now a 128.\n\n328\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.140\nSo this a subnet mask of 255.255.255.128.\n\n329\n00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:29.960\nWell, I also want you to know that what\nwould happen if we did that up here.\n\n330\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.550\nSo again, let's go to the default\nsubnet mask of 255.255.0.0 and we say,\n\n331\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.060\nhey we don't want to\nfollow the classes either.\n\n332\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.520\nWe want to kinda break all the rules.\n\n333\n00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.080\nWell, I can do the same thing as\nlong as the rule applies the same.\n\n334\n00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.190\nContinuous 1 bits.\n\n335\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.420\nNotice that I've got the first octet,\nsecond octet, that's 16 1 bits.\n\n336\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.754\nThey're contiguous, there's no breaks,\nno 0s inter-dispersed there.\n\n337\n00:18:53.754 --> 00:18:57.655\nBut if I turn around and\nI take this bit here,\n\n338\n00:18:57.655 --> 00:19:01.457\nand I turn it on, right,\nand I make it a 1.\n\n339\n00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:05.350\nWell guess what, I still have those\ncontiguous 1 bits, nothing's changed.\n\n340\n00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:10.020\nNotice I still got that octet right\nthere all 1s, second octet all 1s.\n\n341\n00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.060\nNow in the third octet,\n\n342\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.880\nI said you know what, we're gonna\nborrow some of those host bits.\n\n343\n00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.080\nAnd what we're gonna do is we'll\ntake 1 bit and we'll turn it on.\n\n344\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.300\nWell guess what, we're still dealing\nin the third octet with an eight,\n\n345\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.358\noops sorry guys and girls, we're still\ndealing with an eight bit range, right?\n\n346\n00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:26.280\n&gt;&gt; Hm mm.\n&gt;&gt; That 8 bit range well,\n\n347\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.500\nI guess what it's gonna be the same value.\n\n348\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.550\nBut, where we out the 128 is important\nhere, I can get put the 128 out here\n\n349\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.280\nbecause, if I put the 128 out here,\nright turn that on.\n\n350\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.390\nNow, what we have is we have a problem,\nright?\n\n351\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.370\nWhat's the problem here?\n\n352\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.510\nRemember the valid subnet\nmask that we talked about.\n\n353\n00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:48.270\nA valid subnet mask cannot have 0s and\nthen the 1s start up again.\n\n354\n00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.470\nIt's gotta be contiguous 1 bits\nfrom left to the right, so\n\n355\n00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.290\nthat is not a valid subnet mask.\n\n356\n00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.720\nThat's something I want to kinda lead you\ninto when we talk about the classical\n\n357\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.380\nsystem, is understanding that concept.\n\n358\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.790\nI can borrow the bits where I need, right.\n\n359\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.930\nThere's no longer these\ndividing lines if you will.\n\n360\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:14.170\nBut the subnet mask still has to follow\nthat same process of being contiguous 1s.\n\n361\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.568\nSo the question would be, is if on the\nexams if I see something like 255.255.128.\n\n362\n00:20:18.568 --> 00:20:21.677\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well, is that a valid subnet mask?\n\n363\n00:20:21.677 --> 00:20:26.250\nAnd you can see it is.\n\n364\n00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.020\nRight?\n\n365\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.200\nWe got 255, all 1, 255, all 1s again.\n\n366\n00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.981\nSo we still got contiguous 1s.\n\n367\n00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:37.170\nBut then in that third octet\nI turned the first bit on.\n\n368\n00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.190\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that's a 128, right?\n\n369\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.443\nSo that's 255.255 .128.0.\n\n370\n00:20:42.443 --> 00:20:46.880\nAnd you kinda have to understand that\nthat's what's going on now today.\n\n371\n00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.650\nWhat we can do is we could kind of\nvary that length of that subnet mask\n\n372\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.990\nto suit our needs.\n\n373\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.490\nNow, it's important to\nunderstand that concept, right?\n\n374\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:00.053\nAnd it's also important to understand\nthese valid subnet mask ranges.\n\n375\n00:21:00.053 --> 00:21:03.610\nAnd it's also important to understand\non the exam why something,\n\n376\n00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.120\nif we go back up here to that 255,\nwhy something like 128.255.255.\n\n377\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:14.272\nAnd let me take this back to classical,\n255.255.0.0.128.\n\n378\n00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:18.120\nWhy that wouldn't be a valid subnet mask?\n\n379\n00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.410\nWhy?\nWhy wouldn't it be a valid subnet mask?\n\n380\n00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:28.580\nBecause, well if I look at that, and\nwe go back to our binary, right?\n\n381\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.800\nRemember now we've got essentially\na 0 in this third octet.\n\n382\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.510\nSo that means all 0s in\nthe binary in that octet.\n\n383\n00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.665\nAnd then our 128 was on the end, right?\n\n384\n00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.180\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well, I can't do that.\n\n385\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.790\nAnd the reason I can't do that is\nbecause now I have 0s here, and\n\n386\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.790\nthen I got 1 starting back up.\n\n387\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.570\nSubnet masks cannot be that way.\n\n388\n00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.750\nYou always have to follow that rule.\n\n389\n00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.820\nThey have to be contiguous 1s\nfrom the left to the right.\n\n390\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.810\nNo matter how many we have,\nthey have to be contiguous 1s,\n\n391\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.100\nfrom the left to the right.\n\n392\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.780\nSo, that is important\nto keep that in mind.\n\n393\n00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.070\nAnd that's why you'll see that there are\nonly really eight ranges that follow this\n\n394\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.970\nrule, or eight decimal values,\nthat you'll ever see,\n\n395\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.470\nin subnet masks, that follow that rule.\n\n396\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:16.499\nLet's start with one that you commonly\nhave already seen, throughout what\n\n397\n00:22:16.499 --> 00:22:21.778\nZach and I have been going through,\nwith these IP structure episodes, right?\n\n398\n00:22:21.778 --> 00:22:22.510\nNotice 255?\n\n399\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.782\nWell it follows the rule because\nthe while entire octet wants.\n\n400\n00:22:25.782 --> 00:22:30.822\nBut I want you to also understand\nthat this is not a valid subnet mask\n\n401\n00:22:30.822 --> 00:22:35.980\nif I do something like this,\nif I do 255.255.0.255.\n\n402\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.060\nWell, why is that not a valid subnet mask?\n\n403\n00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.749\nWell let's take it to the binary right?\n\n404\n00:22:40.749 --> 00:22:45.944\nWhat that would do is that would mean\nthat we still have our first two octets,\n\n405\n00:22:45.944 --> 00:22:47.822\nright, 255.255.\n\n406\n00:22:47.822 --> 00:22:51.432\nThose are all 1s, but\nthen we have a .0 which is 0s, and\n\n407\n00:22:51.432 --> 00:22:56.870\nthen from here in that last octet if\nwe put the 255, well what's going on?\n\n408\n00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.900\nWell, unfortunately that's not gonna work\nbecause that turns these into 1s, and\n\n409\n00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:06.330\nremember what we said, you cannot have 0s\nand then the 1s pick up, not a single one.\n\n410\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.486\nThey have to be contiguous 1 bits.\n\n411\n00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:12.830\nAnd that's why these ranges are really,\nreally important here.\n\n412\n00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.480\nLet me see if I can change these\nback real quick, all right.\n\n413\n00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.690\nNow, let's not stop there.\n\n414\n00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:24.995\nLet me go ahead and fix our\nnon-examples [LAUGH] of subnet masks.\n\n415\n00:23:24.995 --> 00:23:26.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And let's kinda do a couple more.\n\n416\n00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.660\nAnd then we'll probably come back and\nfinish this here in a bit.\n\n417\n00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.590\nAll right.\nSo what if I decided that I was gonna do\n\n418\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.370\n192, right?\n\n419\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.172\nWell, is 192, does it follow our rules?\n\n420\n00:23:37.172 --> 00:23:38.030\nI don't know.\n\n421\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.509\nLet's go ahead and let's mark 192, and\n\n422\n00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:44.678\nlet's see what 192 is literally in\nthe decimal to binary conversion.\n\n423\n00:23:44.678 --> 00:23:49.140\nWell if you look, 192 is a 1 in the 128.\n\n424\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.520\n128 plus 64 is 192.\n\n425\n00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.758\nRight, my remainder is now 0s,\nthe rest are 0s behind it.\n\n426\n00:23:53.758 --> 00:23:57.123\nSo notice that I got, even in just\nthis octet, I've got contiguous 1s,\n\n427\n00:23:57.123 --> 00:24:00.070\nI've got two 1 beds from the left,\nto the right.\n\n428\n00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.742\nWell, if I put that on\nthe end of these 255s, well,\n\n429\n00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:06.680\nmy 255s are all one bits, right.\n\n430\n00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:12.790\nAnd then you add that last octet, I added\nanother bit, well, what has that done?\n\n431\n00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.130\nHas that followed the rule of our\nsubnet mask of being contiguous 1\n\n432\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.365\nbits from the left to the right?\n\n433\n00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:18.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n434\n00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.470\n&gt;&gt; And the answer is true, right?\n\n435\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.510\nSo that is a valid subnet mask range,\nso you have to be aware of it.\n\n436\n00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.679\nWell, let's not stop there,\nwhat if I said, okay,\n\n437\n00:24:27.679 --> 00:24:30.300\nwell we're gonna go to the next one,\nwe're gonna go to 224.\n\n438\n00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.470\nNow I kinda have these memorized, so\njust understand you'll start to see them\n\n439\n00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.870\nmore and more and\nyou'll have them memorized.\n\n440\n00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:39.930\nBut just understand the concept before you\nworry about memorization and shortcuts.\n\n441\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.290\nDon't shortcut your knowledge and\n\n442\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.980\nunderstanding of the subject, understand\nthe subject, then work on the shortcuts.\n\n443\n00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.953\nBecause you can get to the answer faster,\nbut getting to an answer faster is only\n\n444\n00:24:48.953 --> 00:24:52.290\ngonna help you if you understand\nthe underlying concept, right?\n\n445\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.663\nSo let's try 224, well for now I just\nwant you to go down to our chart here and\n\n446\n00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:59.645\nif you have to pause the video,\ncopy this chart down,\n\n447\n00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:02.655\nwrite it down on a piece of paper and\nstudy it, right.\n\n448\n00:25:02.655 --> 00:25:07.002\nSo 224, well that's actually three 1 bits,\nnotice in that octet, cuz we deal with\n\n449\n00:25:07.002 --> 00:25:10.950\nan octet at a time, that's three 1\nbits from the left to the right.\n\n450\n00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:15.660\nSo if I turn this into a 224,\nwe already know, not to sit here and\n\n451\n00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.710\nbeat this over and over and\nover across you all's head out there.\n\n452\n00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.640\nJust understand that the 255s,\nwe already know, are all 1s, right,\n\n453\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.100\nI'm just focusing on that last octet,\nright now.\n\n454\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.012\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; They call that, where the actions at,\n\n455\n00:25:27.012 --> 00:25:31.260\nall right, so now I'm gonna take this\nbit and I'm going to turn it on.\n\n456\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.470\nI'm gonna borrow it from the nodes or\nthe hosts, right, and\n\n457\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.500\nwe're going to turn that into a 1.\n\n458\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.500\nAnd that's actually 224, and I do this\ncolor-coded cuz it makes it easier to see,\n\n459\n00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.680\nyou can see the green bar.\n\n460\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.040\nNow do I have continuous 1 bits\nhere with a 224 at the end?\n\n461\n00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.270\nAnd the answer is yes I do, right, so\n\n462\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.230\nyou'll start to notice this pattern,\nright.\n\n463\n00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:54.154\nNotice that I have 128, 192, 224, 240,\n\n464\n00:25:54.154 --> 00:25:58.338\nis 4 1s from the left to the right,\nit's continuous 1s.\n\n465\n00:25:58.338 --> 00:26:04.586\nNotice that I have a 248, that's five 1s,\n252 is six, 254 is seven, and\n\n466\n00:26:04.586 --> 00:26:10.330\nthen we know all 1s within those eight\nbits, is gonna be 255, all right.\n\n467\n00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.175\nYou have to know this, right, because\nthey might ask you on the exam, and\n\n468\n00:26:14.175 --> 00:26:18.145\nthen when we start to get into more\nsub-netting, if you will, and learning\n\n469\n00:26:18.145 --> 00:26:22.075\nmore about our classless addressing,\nit's gonna be important, right?\n\n470\n00:26:22.075 --> 00:26:29.395\nYou have to know and be able to tell,\nwell is something like 255.255.248,\n\n471\n00:26:29.395 --> 00:26:33.424\nright, and\nlet me make sure I write that right.\n\n472\n00:26:33.424 --> 00:26:35.380\n248, is that a valid subnet mask, right?\n\n473\n00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.919\nDoes it follow the rules?\n\n474\n00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.580\nWell I can tell you it does right away,\nbut just because I know,\n\n475\n00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.146\nI want you to know, right.\n\n476\n00:26:44.146 --> 00:26:47.650\nWell, 248 is five contiguous 1\nbits from the left to the right.\n\n477\n00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.819\nSo what that would mean then is in\na going away from the class fault,\n\n478\n00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:55.256\naway from the defaults,\nright, we get into classes.\n\n479\n00:26:55.256 --> 00:27:01.342\nWe do 255.255.248, well,\nthat means I'm gonna have one,\n\n480\n00:27:01.342 --> 00:27:05.050\ntwo, three, four, and I believe, five.\n\n481\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.549\nFive bits that are now part of my node,\nand they, very well,\n\n482\n00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:14.945\nlike I said, they very well might ask\nyou on the exam to be able to do this.\n\n483\n00:27:14.945 --> 00:27:18.760\nAnd that's why we take the time,\nbecause this really sets the stage for\n\n484\n00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.016\nwhat we're gonna do when we\ntalk about subnetting, right?\n\n485\n00:27:22.016 --> 00:27:25.561\nSo you can see here that yes,\nif I try to zoom out there, there we go,\n\n486\n00:27:25.561 --> 00:27:28.850\nyou can see that yes,\nwe still have continuous 1 bits.\n\n487\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.050\nAnd this little chart will help you,\n\n488\n00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.740\nif you can remember these\nvalid subnet mask ranges.\n\n489\n00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.860\nIf they ask you on the exam,\nis this a valid subnet mask or not.\n\n490\n00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.460\nIf you know the decimal conversions,\nif you know\n\n491\n00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.750\nthat the eight valid subnet mask range is,\nthen you're gonna be doing good.\n\n492\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.190\nWhat I typically do is I looked at the\nchart and I counted eight bits on my hand.\n\n493\n00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.043\nAnd I would map them up to those eight\nbits, and I'd just do this over and\n\n494\n00:27:53.043 --> 00:27:53.670\nover and over.\n\n495\n00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.503\nSo I could think, I could say,\nokay, 1 bit's 128, 192,\n\n496\n00:27:57.503 --> 00:28:00.801\n224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255.\n\n497\n00:28:00.801 --> 00:28:03.560\nI know 255 is 8 bits, and\nI don't have to look at the chart.\n\n498\n00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.056\n&gt;&gt; But can you say that backwards?\n\n499\n00:28:05.056 --> 00:28:06.760\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I cannot do that backwards, and\n\n500\n00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.288\nthank you for\nputting me on the spot there.\n\n501\n00:28:08.288 --> 00:28:08.880\n[LAUGH] That's right.\n\n502\n00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.238\n[LAUGH] So this is just the start.\n\n503\n00:28:10.238 --> 00:28:12.280\nWe're gonna get into more but\nthese are some of the basics.\n\n504\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.294\nWhen we come back in the next one we're\ngonna look a little bit more at what is\n\n505\n00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:17.719\nknown as sider notation.\n\n506\n00:28:17.719 --> 00:28:22.185\nAnd as it relates to the subnet masks\nwhose bits we're moving all

00:00:10.815\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for choosing ITPRO\nTV, helping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.380\nI'm Zach Memos, your host,\n\n6\n00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.180\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net+\nClassless IPv4 Addressing Part Two.\n\n7\n00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.570\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.770\nWes, great to see you sir.\n\n9\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.068\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back Zach.\n\n10\n00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:33.050\nThat's right, we've gonna continue down\nthis path that leads to classless systems.\n\n11\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.910\nThat's right.\n\n12\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.930\nIn the first part here,\nwe were kind of talking about\n\n13\n00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.780\none of the reasons we would use classless\nsystems and it really just boils down to\n\n14\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.590\nthe inevitable depletion of\nthat 32 bit ipv 4 address base.\n\n15\n00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.360\nKeeping in mind that really\nall we can address or\n\n16\n00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.810\nthe only addresses that\nare available are in a, b and c.\n\n17\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.050\nRemember, we didn't even mention here that\nthe fact that D is all for multicast.\n\n18\n00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.600\nWe've mentioned it in other episodes, but\n\n19\n00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.710\nD is all for multicast and\nE was never given to the public anyways.\n\n20\n00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.924\nThat was basically held for\nresearch Scientific purposes only, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:09.889\nMilitary purposes if you will but\nit was never given out to the public, so\n\n22\n00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:12.371\nwe really only have a,\nb, and c to deal with.\n\n23\n00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.167\nAnd the problem is the classful system\nlike we said in the first part,\n\n24\n00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:17.088\nvery wasteful.\n\n25\n00:01:17.088 --> 00:01:21.435\nNow one of the last things that we\nmentioned is we started to look at some of\n\n26\n00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:25.644\nthe subnet masks that you could see\nin a classful addressing system and\n\n27\n00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:28.450\nwe started talking about\nthe decimal values.\n\n28\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.100\nIf we could go to my screen here,\nremember this is where we left off.\n\n29\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.160\nWe talked about hey,\nI could manipulate these bits,\n\n30\n00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.120\nI could borrow bits from the host,\nif I wanted to.\n\n31\n00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.950\nAnd I have to make sure\nthat the subnet mask still\n\n32\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.840\nhas that same contiguous one bits\nfrom the left to the right and\n\n33\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.310\nthat's where I told you that you could\nsee additional numbers like this,\n\n34\n00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.270\nbut you have to understand the binary,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.790\nSo we also look at this chart because\nthese are the eight values that\n\n36\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.150\nfrom the left side,\nlet's try that again there.\n\n37\n00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.772\nThese are the eight values from that side.\n\n38\n00:02:03.772 --> 00:02:10.020\nThat are really responsible or\nare the valid ranges.\n\n39\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.528\nAgain 128, 192, 224,\n240, 248, 252, 254, 255.\n\n40\n00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:14.153\nNow, if you can memorize these and\nalso memorize how much,\n\n41\n00:02:14.153 --> 00:02:17.706\nhow many bits they are,\nyou're going to be doing great for\n\n42\n00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:21.910\nthe exam but I also want to introduce\nsomething else that they call out\n\n43\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.550\non the exam objectives and\nthat's something known as CIDR notation.\n\n44\n00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.330\nBecause I want you to look at,\nwhen we denote something like this and\n\n45\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.155\nwe just say 255.255.255.248, right?\n\n46\n00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.530\nThat's a pretty big number to\nalways be writing out, right?\n\n47\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.210\nAnd as admins, we try to script everything\nout, any time we can automate the process.\n\n48\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.110\nWhat we wanna do, is we wanna reduce\nthe amount of administrative effort,\n\n49\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.818\nso we gotta kinda look at\nsomething known as CIDR notation.\n\n50\n00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:55.270\n&gt;&gt; So I can suppose we're not talking\nabout something made out of apples, right?\n\n51\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's spelled a little bit different, but\n\n52\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.630\nit's pronounced the same, right?\n\n53\n00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.706\nWhen we say CIDR, again, we're talking\nabout C-I-D-R and it's how your Internet\n\n54\n00:03:03.706 --> 00:03:08.366\nservice providers perform what's known\nas classless inter domain routing and\n\n55\n00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:12.674\nit has a way that it's written out and\nit really, if you start to write down\n\n56\n00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:17.541\nIP address or networks with their subnet\nmask ranges if you will in CIDR notations,\n\n57\n00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:21.520\nit comes easy, it's kind of like\na little short hand if you will.\n\n58\n00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.388\nBut how do we do that?\n\n59\n00:03:23.388 --> 00:03:25.830\nAll right, well,\nI want you to look at the,\n\n60\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.700\nwe'll start with the default subnet masks\nthat we've already been looking at here,\n\n61\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.840\nand I want you to look at how many 1 bits,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.075\nIf we talk about 255.0.0.0,\nhow many one bits are in that subnet mask?\n\n63\n00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:40.710\nWhat we've already talked\nabout this before.\n\n64\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.370\nRemember, that's one octet,\nwhere those 255s are.\n\n65\n00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.060\nThat's one octet.\n\n66\n00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.740\nThat is full of one bits.\n\n67\n00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.365\nSo what is a full octet of one bits?\n\n68\n00:03:48.365 --> 00:03:51.110\nHow many one bits?\n\n69\n00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.600\nEight, right?\n\n70\n00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.830\nSo rather than say, 255.0.0.0,\n\n71\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.039\nwhat we could do is we can change this and\nwe could do a /8.\n\n72\n00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.719\nWe do a /8,\nnow what we're saying is the same thing,\n\n73\n00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:06.440\n255.0.0.0, well,\nwe're writing it with CIDR notation.\n\n74\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.380\nAnd in CIDR notation, all we're doing is\njust representing the amount of one bits\n\n75\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.660\nthat are in the subnet mask,\n\n76\n00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.030\nrather than writing out\nthe entire decimal value there.\n\n77\n00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.620\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n78\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.280\nSo, if we go a little bit\nfarther than that, right?\n\n79\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.620\nAnd we look at, well, what?\n\n80\n00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.110\nOur classful b address, or\na b sub default subnet mask, right?\n\n81\n00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.149\nWell, how many one bits are inside\nof our class b default subnet mask?\n\n82\n00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:34.550\nWell, now I have two octects of one bits,\nright?\n\n83\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.500\nSo 8 plus 8 is what?\n\n84\n00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.650\n16, so rather than say 255.255.255 or\n\n85\n00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.850\nexcuse me, 255.255.0.0,\nI can just do a /16, right?\n\n86\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.440\nAnd /16 tells me right away that\nit's the same thing as 255.255.0.0.\n\n87\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.210\nBut instead, I'm doing it shorthand and\n\n88\n00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.810\nI'm saying 16 one bits in\nthe subnet mask right away.\n\n89\n00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.690\nAll right, now, let's do and\nfor completion,\n\n90\n00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.820\nlet me change this back to\na classful subnet mask.\n\n91\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.915\nLet's do that same thing.\n\n92\n00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:10.140\nCIDR notation, if we were for\nour class B or\n\n93\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.210\nexcuse me class C default subnet mask,\nthank you there, Zack.\n\n94\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.360\nAnd we do the same thing,\nwell now, what do we have?\n\n95\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.865\nWe've got three octets of one bits.\n\n96\n00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:23.600\n255.255.255.0, that's 8 + 8 + 8 or\n8 * 3 is 24.\n\n97\n00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.810\n&gt;&gt; /24.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n98\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.770\nSo this is going to be a /24.\n\n99\n00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.870\nNow, I could, if I was writing down and\nwe'll get to this part here, I could say\n\n100\n00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.170\nokay your network ID is 192.168.0.0.\n\n101\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.090\nAnd you have a subnet\nmask of 255.255.255.0 or\n\n102\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.860\nI could just write it out this way.\n\n103\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.928\nI could say /24.\n\n104\n00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:52.931\nAnd what we're saying is pretty\nmuch one in the same and\n\n105\n00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:54.900\nit's easier, it's a shorthand.\n\n106\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.219\nIt's just saying how many\nbits are in the subnet mask.\n\n107\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.920\nNow, here's where this\nstarts to get confusing for\n\n108\n00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.860\npeople who maybe have seen it for\nthe first time.\n\n109\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.260\nThere's a reason I started with\nthe classful subnet masks first.\n\n110\n00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.391\nBecause you might say, well, Wes,\nwe don't follow the class system anymore,\n\n111\n00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:18.278\nthe classful system, yet you're still\nsaying class A, class B, class C,\n\n112\n00:06:18.278 --> 00:06:20.645\nClass A default, class C or\nB default, well,\n\n113\n00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.786\nthat's because we still use\nthem as weigh markers, right?\n\n114\n00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:26.680\nI still say, hey, Zach,\nI've got a class B address, right?\n\n115\n00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.952\nWell, if Zach knows what the B range is,\nhe knows where that would fall, right?\n\n116\n00:06:30.952 --> 00:06:34.430\nThat would be between that 128 and\nthat 191, right?\n\n117\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.870\nIn that first octet, so, you would know.\n\n118\n00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.380\nSo, we still use them as weigh markers.\n\n119\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.360\nAnd I want you to use your CIDR notations,\n\n120\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.550\nI want you to use your classful\nsystem as a way marker, right?\n\n121\n00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.480\nAnd here's why I say that.\n\n122\n00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.810\nBecause if we take something like,\nI don't know,\n\n123\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.160\nmaybe something like this right here and\nwe decide, hey, I want to go ahead and\n\n124\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.960\nI'm gonna steer away\nfrom the classful system.\n\n125\n00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.474\nAnd they tell you, all right, I need a /9.\n\n126\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.960\nWell do you know how to figure out\nwhat the decimal value of a /9 is?\n\n127\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.594\nIf I know a /8, right, is 255.0.0.0.\n\n128\n00:07:09.594 --> 00:07:14.476\nWould you be able on the exam\nto get this right if they asked\n\n129\n00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:17.130\nyou what is a /9, all right?\n\n130\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.850\nNow we're classless, right?\n\n131\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.360\nWe're not,\nwe're breaking the barriers, right?\n\n132\n00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.560\nWell, this is where this chart that was\nshowing you comes in handy, all right?\n\n133\n00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.860\nIf I have a /9, well,\nI know that I have eight bits.\n\n134\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.690\nSo that means one octet has to be 255,\nright?\n\n135\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.360\nThat's my weigh marker.\n\n136\n00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.270\nSo what's the decimal value for\none extra bit?\n\n137\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.426\nWell, it's 128.\n\n138\n00:07:42.426 --> 00:07:48.367\nSo I can see that a /9 would\nhave to be 255.255.128 or\n\n139\n00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:52.045\nexcuse me, 255.128.0.0.\n\n140\n00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:58.364\nRight, cuz I'm using that class A default\nsubnet mask as my weigh marker.\n\n141\n00:07:58.364 --> 00:08:01.215\nI know /8 has gotta be 255.\n\n142\n00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.552\nWell, what would be one bit after that,\nright?\n\n143\n00:08:03.552 --> 00:08:06.260\nIf I borrowed that bit, well,\nwe've already kinda seen that.\n\n144\n00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.710\nIf I take and I add that one bit\nover here, and I turn that on.\n\n145\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.478\nAnd turn that into an additional bit.\n\n146\n00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:14.691\nWell now, I have those 9 bits, right?\n\n147\n00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:15.762\nThere's my /9.\n\n148\n00:08:15.762 --> 00:08:16.484\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n149\n00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:19.140\nremember what we said in\nthe first part that 2nd Octet.\n\n150\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.655\nWell, what is this 8-bit value?\n\n151\n00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:25.367\nWell, that's where this chart\nI'm showing you comes in handy.\n\n152\n00:08:25.367 --> 00:08:26.807\nI know that that's a 128.\n\n153\n00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:27.493\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n154\n00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:31.060\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nI know that a /9 is a 255.\n\n155\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.943\nCuz I've already got eight\nbits plus that one bit.\n\n156\n00:08:33.943 --> 00:08:36.120\nBut what's one bit extra?\n\n157\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.350\nThat's 128, and\nyou can do this very easy, right?\n\n158\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.300\nIf it happened to be a slash.\n\n159\n00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.083\nLet's just say, randomly,\nI say, /12, all right?\n\n160\n00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:48.840\nWell, if it's a /12,\nI know that I have at least 8 bits, right?\n\n161\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.370\nSo I know that I got 255,\nI've started there.\n\n162\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.770\nThat's why I colored these green here too.\n\n163\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.749\nTo kinda get me something that\nyou could look at, right?\n\n164\n00:08:55.749 --> 00:08:57.990\nI know that 255 is gonna be there, right?\n\n165\n00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.892\nI already have eight bits.\n\n166\n00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.580\nBut how many extra bits\ndo I have than eight?\n\n167\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.327\nWell, that's easy enough, 12-8 is what?\n\n168\n00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:04.827\nFour.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n169\n00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:05.335\n&gt;&gt; So now,\n\n170\n00:09:05.335 --> 00:09:08.288\nI have to figure out what four bits are.\nWell,\n\n171\n00:09:08.288 --> 00:09:11.843\nif you can remember the chart.\nFour bits, it's 240, right?\n\n172\n00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.857\nI can remember 128, 192, 224, 240.\n\n173\n00:09:14.857 --> 00:09:15.499\nI remember four bits.\n\n174\n00:09:15.499 --> 00:09:19.876\nAnd I can come to those answers\n\n175\n00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:24.932\nreally quick.\nAnd I know that a /12, right?\n\n176\n00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:26.830\nHas to be a 255,\n\n177\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.735\nbecause I've got those eight bits.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n178\n00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:32.533\n&gt;&gt; .240, right?\n\n179\n00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:34.617\nAnd those are my four bits.\n\n180\n00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:37.408\nAnd that would be no different here than\n\n181\n00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:42.312\nif we were turning on those extra four\nbits in this octet right here and\n\n182\n00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.457\nwe make them ones.\nSo that is CIDR notation and\n\n183\n00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:49.706\nit's important to understand that\nthey very well might ask you to\n\n184\n00:09:49.706 --> 00:09:53.150\ndo something like this on the exam,\nall right?\n\n185\n00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.545\nSo what we're doing is we're getting\naround some of the jargon that you might\n\n186\n00:09:57.545 --> 00:10:01.602\nsee as it leads us into more complex\ntopics again if you're seeing it for\n\n187\n00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:02.566\nthe first time.\n\n188\n00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:04.319\nWell let's not stop there, right?\n\n189\n00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:08.290\nLet's go ahead and say, and let me\nchange this back to class full, right?\n\n190\n00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.510\nSo now we've got back to our 255.0.0,\nall right?\n\n191\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:17.234\nWell what if I'm,\nwhat if they tell me I've got a /20?\n\n192\n00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:20.210\nWell I know 20 isn't as great as 24,\nright?\n\n193\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:23.000\nSo I know that I'm not within that range.\n\n194\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.694\nSo I still have my two octets\nthat are 16 bits, right?\n\n195\n00:10:27.694 --> 00:10:29.780\nWell what is 20- 16?\n\n196\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.740\nIt's gonna be four, right?\n\n197\n00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.250\nWell, I think we just did four bits.\n\n198\n00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.444\nWhat is that third octet\ngonna be with four bits?\n\n199\n00:10:39.444 --> 00:10:40.524\nWell didn't we just do that?\n\n200\n00:10:40.524 --> 00:10:42.055\nWe just looked at our chart, right?\n\n201\n00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:44.007\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And what was our chart for\n\n202\n00:10:44.007 --> 00:10:45.129\nfour bits up here?\n\n203\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.710\nUp here, right here, well,\nit's gonna be the same thing, right?\n\n204\n00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.566\nIf I go back to my chart,\nwe're still dealing with eight bits, and\n\n205\n00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:52.850\nfour bits is gonna be 240.\n\n206\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.470\nSo I kinda threw you a curve ball there,\nright?\n\n207\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little bit.\n\n208\n00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.878\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that just means\nthat that's gonna be 255.255.240.\n\n209\n00:10:57.878 --> 00:11:02.360\nAll I did was shift it\nover the 240 on you guys.\n\n210\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.900\nSorry, that was cruel of me, right?\n\n211\n00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.836\nBut you can see how I'm using\nthose class-ful Cyber notations as\n\n212\n00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.950\nmy way markers, right?\n\n213\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.060\nWell what if they give you,\nI don't know, let's do another one here.\n\n214\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.638\nWhat if they do a /19,\n\n215\n00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:19.630\nwell that means that I know that\nI still have my /16, right?\n\n216\n00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.200\nI know that that is my way marker,\nso what is 19- 16?\n\n217\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.770\nWhat does it give me left?\n\n218\n00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.350\nIt gives by three bits, well, that's okay.\n\n219\n00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.614\nThat means I'm gonna come\nover here in this last octet.\n\n220\n00:11:31.614 --> 00:11:36.305\nAnd what we're gonna do, cuz we know\nwe have the first two octets at 255, so\n\n221\n00:11:36.305 --> 00:11:40.100\nthen what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna add these three bits here.\n\n222\n00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.105\nAnd what are three bits?\n\n223\n00:11:41.105 --> 00:11:44.648\nWell, go back to your chart, right?\n\n224\n00:11:44.648 --> 00:11:45.348\n224, right?\nOne, two,\n\n225\n00:11:45.348 --> 00:11:48.220\nthree, that is that eight bit increments,\nright?\n\n226\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.345\nSo I know that a /19 is going to be,\nmy two five fives are there,\n\n227\n00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:56.260\nremember, my class B is my way mark,\nI already got 16 bits.\n\n228\n00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.556\nSo I know that that's going to be,\nand again, remember 224.\n\n229\n00:12:00.556 --> 00:12:03.684\nMake sure, just double check\nthat I marked that right.\n\n230\n00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:07.410\nAll right, so that's going to be 224.\n\n231\n00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.530\nSo there's your /19, and you can do this.\n\n232\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.991\nWe can even give you some examples.\n\n233\n00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:13.003\nLet me go ahead and\nchange these back to class-ful again.\n\n234\n00:12:13.003 --> 00:12:17.280\nWe can even give you some examples,\noops, gonna try that one more time.\n\n235\n00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.042\nWe could even give you some examples\nin the Class C range if they do this.\n\n236\n00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:24.020\nAnd I'm gonna come to completion\non why we're doing this.\n\n237\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.494\nBecause you might just see CIDR notation,\nand\n\n238\n00:12:26.494 --> 00:12:30.249\nthey might give you basic questions\nlike this in order to understand.\n\n239\n00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.660\nTo prove that you understand a concept.\n\n240\n00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.266\nBut what if I have a slash,\nI don't know, I was going to say 28, but\n\n241\n00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:41.255\nthat would be four bits again,\nhow about a /29, right?\n\n242\n00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:46.890\nWell, I know a 24 has got to be,\nwhoops, somewhere around here.\n\n243\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.400\n24 bits have to be there, right?\n\n244\n00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.760\nSo that's 255.255.255 Now I just take 29,\nand I subtract 24.\n\n245\n00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.338\nWhat does that give me a remainder of?\n\n246\n00:12:53.338 --> 00:12:54.800\nGives me a remainder of 5.\n\n247\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.657\nNow I know I'm dealing with 5 bits left,\nright.\n\n248\n00:12:57.657 --> 00:13:03.878\nSo, if we come back to this last octet\nthen we ensure that there are five bits,\n\n249\n00:13:03.878 --> 00:13:07.830\nagain turned on, all right,\nand I've got one.\n\n250\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.186\nSo there's my five bits, well.\n\n251\n00:13:09.186 --> 00:13:14.915\nNow I'm not even going to my chart,\ncuz I want you to be able to do 128,192,\n\n252\n00:13:14.915 --> 00:13:17.512\n224, 240, 248, right?\n\n253\n00:13:17.512 --> 00:13:22.529\nI know that this with a slash with five\nbits there, this has gotta be a 248.\n\n254\n00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:28.061\nAnd just until you get it memorized,\nif you wanna check, R5 bits A 248, right?\n\n255\n00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:31.822\nSo you can start to see how they\ncome up with these numbers, right?\n\n256\n00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:36.802\nYou have to be able to tell if they\ngive you a sCIDR notation and they say,\n\n257\n00:13:36.802 --> 00:13:40.208\nwhat's the subnet mask for\nthis CIDR notation?\n\n258\n00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.595\nOr it might be the other way.\n\n259\n00:13:41.595 --> 00:13:45.990\nThey might give you something\nlike this where they say,\n\n260\n00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.836\nwhat's the CIDR notation for\nthis subnet mask?\n\n261\n00:13:49.836 --> 00:13:51.921\nWell, let's make it easy.\n\n262\n00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:57.810\nI know I've got 24 one bits right here,\n255.255.255.\n\n263\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.901\n8+8+8.\nNow, I just have to figure out what's at\n\n264\n00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:01.629\n248?\n\n265\n00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:03.460\nAll right?\nWell, that's easy enough,\n\n266\n00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.450\nyou could subtract 255, and\nyou can kinda figure out.\n\n267\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:12.031\nBut the easiest way to do it is,\nagain, just counting those bits.\n\n268\n00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:15.150\nIf I know I have eight bits.\n\n269\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.668\nI got a 128, 192, 224, 240, 248.\n\n270\n00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:23.110\nI've got five bits, so\nI've 24+5 and that gives me my /29.\n\n271\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.564\nSo again,\nyou're kinda seeing both ways that\n\n272\n00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:31.094\nyou can kinda figure out how to\ndo the CIDR notation, right?\n\n273\n00:14:31.094 --> 00:14:32.670\nAnd that's gonna be important.\n\n274\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.514\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's move into a concept.\n\n275\n00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:39.287\nAnd we'll probably do a few of these,\n\n276\n00:14:39.287 --> 00:14:43.460\nbecause this is one that start\nto get a little bit tricky.\n\n277\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.570\nThis is one of those one which people are\nlike I understand, no I don't I lost it.\n\n278\n00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.680\nI'm gonna tell you what,\nI did that many, many times.\n\n279\n00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.636\nAnd I have to go back and I have to\nbrush the dust off of this where.\n\n280\n00:14:53.636 --> 00:14:55.645\nBut I want you to think about it,\n\n281\n00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:59.450\nwhen it comes to something\nknown as subnetting, all right.\n\n282\n00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.065\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n283\n00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:04.359\n&gt;&gt; Subnetting is a essentially nothing\nmore than taking one large network and\n\n284\n00:15:04.359 --> 00:15:06.617\ndividing it up into smaller networks.\n\n285\n00:15:06.617 --> 00:15:09.854\nNow, there's a couple different\nreasons that we can do this, right?\n\n286\n00:15:09.854 --> 00:15:14.240\nOne of the reasons we can do this is\nto divide up broadcast domains, right?\n\n287\n00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.237\nBecause when you have a router that's\nconnected to two different subnets,\n\n288\n00:15:19.237 --> 00:15:23.227\nthey do not pass broadcast\ntraffic between the subnet mass.\n\n289\n00:15:23.227 --> 00:15:25.430\nAt least not by default, right?\n\n290\n00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.170\nSo what does that do?\n\n291\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.672\nWell it can eliminate broadcast,\n\n292\n00:15:27.672 --> 00:15:30.640\nthe amount of broadcast traffic\nthat's on your networks, right?\n\n293\n00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.937\nIf you've got a couple of servers,\n\n294\n00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:34.109\nlike maybe you've got 10\nservers within your networks.\n\n295\n00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:37.861\nAnd they're all talking to each other,\nsending broadcast communications and\n\n296\n00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:40.610\nthey don't need to send\ncommunications to anybody else.\n\n297\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.274\nWhy don't I just put them\non their own subnet and\n\n298\n00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.880\nthey can just yell at\neach other all they want?\n\n299\n00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.620\nAnd they're not gonna impede the traffic\nthat is on another subnet because again\n\n300\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.827\nthat router isn't going\nto pass that traffic.\n\n301\n00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:56.612\nThe other reason we'll do something\nlike subnetting again is to make sure\n\n302\n00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:59.479\nthat we have less waste\nof our IP addresses.\n\n303\n00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:02.515\nLet me show you what I mean here,\nso very basically.\n\n304\n00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:08.137\nIf we look at, and I'm gonna use\na private IP address range, right?\n\n305\n00:16:08.137 --> 00:16:10.331\nWe've got a network right here, right?\n\n306\n00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:11.666\nAnd this is our network ID,\n\n307\n00:16:11.666 --> 00:16:15.497\nand we're gonna get into in the binary,\nhow I can tell what a network ID is, and\n\n308\n00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:18.541\nwe'll talk about another\naddress that's reserved, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:23.436\nSo, our network is the 192.168.0.0\nnetwork, and let me go ahead and\n\n310\n00:16:23.436 --> 00:16:24.301\nchange that.\n\n311\n00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.041\nSorry about that guys, there we go.\n\n312\n00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:29.070\nAnd we're just going with\na class full system, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.300\nWell, I want you to think of how many\nbits I have in the host portion.\n\n314\n00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.800\nRemember the 0 bits are the host portion,\nright?\n\n315\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.100\nIf I have 8 bits,\nthat's 2 to the power of 8, all right?\n\n316\n00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.680\nNow, technically that gives\nme 255 because 0 counts.\n\n317\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.790\nBut the very first address in a network is\nreserve, that's the network ID, all right?\n\n318\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.090\nAnd you can't give that to anybody.\n\n319\n00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.080\nSo I can't use that.\n\n320\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.540\nThat's one right off the top.\n\n321\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.350\nSo even though technically you would say\nwell actually 2 to the power of 8 is 256.\n\n322\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.710\nLet me be clear about that, right?\n\n323\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.658\nSo I can't give the very first\npossibility, if you will,\n\n324\n00:17:02.658 --> 00:17:07.670\nwithin that range because that very\nfirst possibility is the network ID.\n\n325\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.905\nAnd remember we told you the rules of IP\naddressing is that every computer has to\n\n326\n00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:15.060\nshare the same network ID\nkinda like the street name.\n\n327\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.280\nStreet name has to be the same if all the\nhouses are gonna be considered to be on\n\n328\n00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.260\nthe same street, right?\n\n329\n00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.570\nThey have to share the same street name\nwhich is the same thing with networking.\n\n330\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.550\nIf a computer's gonna be considered\nto be on the same network,\n\n331\n00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.840\nall those computers have\nto share that network ID.\n\n332\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.470\nSo unfortunately, we lose that\npossibility right off the top.\n\n333\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.880\nSo now I'm down to 255.\n\n334\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.950\nI went from 256 to 255.\n\n335\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n336\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.648\n&gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you, the last address\nwithin a range, network range and\n\n337\n00:17:42.648 --> 00:17:46.751\nin this case and I'll show you\nwhy in the bits here coming up,\n\n338\n00:17:46.751 --> 00:17:50.310\ncannot be allocated to\nanybody at all either, why?\n\n339\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.860\nWell, the last address within the range\nis what's known as the broadcast address.\n\n340\n00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:59.570\nWhen you need to send a broadcast\ncommunication over layer three\n\n341\n00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.760\nto that subnet, everybody on that subnet,\n\n342\n00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.870\nlike I said those servers that\nare shouting to everybody, right?\n\n343\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.020\nYou have to have a special address that\nyou send that communication to, and\n\n344\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.200\nyou send it to the broadcast address.\n\n345\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.690\nThat address, everybody uses, as well.\n\n346\n00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.620\nSo now we're down two addresses.\n\n347\n00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.226\nWe can't use the network ID,\n\n348\n00:18:16.226 --> 00:18:19.705\nthat's the very first possibility\nwithin your network range.\n\n349\n00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:24.810\nIn this case, it's 192.168.0.0.\n\n350\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.220\nThe very last address within the range is\nwhat's known as the broadcast address.\n\n351\n00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.966\nAnd all computers share that because\nthat's how they send broadcast\n\n352\n00:18:31.966 --> 00:18:32.730\ncommunications.\n\n353\n00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.570\nSo now we're down two.\n\n354\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.820\nNow, you can see why I told you that when\nwe were talking about the class pull\n\n355\n00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.170\nsystem and we mentioned,\nthat with 8 bits, right?\n\n356\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.530\nOnly 8 bits reserved for the host,\nI get 224 nodes on that network, why?\n\n357\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.390\nBecause technically, 2 to the power of 8\nis 256, but I cannot use the network ID,\n\n358\n00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.500\nand I can't use the broadcast, all right?\n\n359\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.950\nNow, that being said, that's how I'm\ngetting 254, and like I said, I'll show\n\n360\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:04.160\nyou guys and gals out there how exactly\nwe identify that coming up, all right?\n\n361\n00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.070\nSo, why would I want a subnet again?\n\n362\n00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:14.150\nWell, maybe I don't want 254 computers\non the same broadcast domain, right?\n\n363\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.590\nBecause that means every time somebody\nsends a broadcast, who hears a broadcast?\n\n364\n00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.630\nDo you remember,\nwe said that was a one to what?\n\n365\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.660\nThat was a one to everybody, right?\n\n366\n00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.940\nIn some of our other shows that Zach and\nI were together I said,\n\n367\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.120\nthat's like jumping up in the food court\nand screaming out your lungs, right?\n\n368\n00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.200\n&gt;&gt; That's an easy one to remember, too.\n\n369\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.680\nIt's broadcast it to everybody.\n\n370\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.660\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, everybody hears it.\n\n371\n00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.020\nWell, again, that's a lot of chatter.\n\n372\n00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.200\nAnd there is no reason for me to shout to\nwhere everybody back here in the studios\n\n373\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.029\nhears it if all I need\nto do is talk to Zach.\n\n374\n00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.250\nWe could just keep the communications\nwithin this studio, right?\n\n375\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.640\nSo what we do is again,\n\n376\n00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.010\nwe're gonna isolate some of those\nbroadcast communications, right?\n\n377\n00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.690\nAnd we can do that through subnetting.\n\n378\n00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.770\nThe other thing that we can\ndo to is we can also better\n\n379\n00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:04.950\nutilize the amount of IP\naddresses that we have, all right?\n\n380\n00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.610\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive into it,\n\n381\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.140\nit looks like we're gonna run\na little bit short on time here.\n\n382\n00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.830\nSo let's go ahead and\nkinda dive into what I know,\n\n383\n00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.420\nwhat I want you to know as\noctet isolation, all right?\n\n384\n00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.060\nAnd what I mean by that is,\nwhen we subnet, we have to determine what\n\n385\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.130\nare the host bits that we\nhave to work with, right?\n\n386\n00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.410\nThat's how you subnet.\n\n387\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.810\nIf you're gonna increase\nthe amount of networks,\n\n388\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.190\nyou only have 32 bits to work with, right?\n\n389\n00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.330\nSo if I increase the networks what do\nI have to do to increase networks?\n\n390\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.530\nI have to increase the amount\nof network bits that I have.\n\n391\n00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:44.138\nAnd in doing that what am I taking from?\n\n392\n00:20:44.138 --> 00:20:46.860\nThe host bits, right?\n\n393\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.740\nSo when you subnet what you're doing, and\n\n394\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.990\nthat's why I said borrowing bets, you're\nborrowing bets from the host, all right?\n\n395\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.680\nAnd that's why it's important.\n\n396\n00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.970\nSee, maybe up to this point, especially\nwith the classical system, you might have\n\n397\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.970\nsaid well Wes, why are we going through\nthe process of binary conversion?\n\n398\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.503\nI can look at a 255.255.255.0 and\n\n399\n00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:13.930\nI can see where the network bit start and\nstop.\n\n400\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.860\nWell, you can always see where they start,\nthey start from the left,\n\n401\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.851\nyou can see where they stop, and\nwhere the host bits start, all right?\n\n402\n00:21:19.851 --> 00:21:25.541\nBut what if I gave you a 255.255.255.224?\n\n403\n00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:29.347\nCould you in the decimal\nfrom the very first start,\n\n404\n00:21:29.347 --> 00:21:35.290\ncould you tell where the dividing line\nis between the network and node portion?\n\n405\n00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.327\nAnd it's not quite that easy and that's\nwhy you need to see these underlying bits.\n\n406\n00:21:39.327 --> 00:21:41.854\nAnd that's why we go through\nthe process of showing\n\n407\n00:21:41.854 --> 00:21:45.600\nyou the decimal to binary conversion\nit's important, all right?\n\n408\n00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.110\nSo in order to do this,\n\n409\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.150\nlet's understand that when you\napply a subnet mask, all right?\n\n410\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:56.090\nOr you are going to subnet, you're always\ngonna have a starting point, right?\n\n411\n00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.670\nAnd let's say for instance, let's that\nyour starting point is this right here.\n\n412\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.710\nAnd I'm gonna use, and\nlet me get to show you this example.\n\n413\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.840\nSo I'm gonna use both the sider\nnotation at this point and\n\n414\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.850\njust the regular decimal\nsubnet mask notation.\n\n415\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.960\nJust so\nwe can kinda see what's going on, and\n\n416\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.660\nif this is the first time you've seen it,\nmaybe it's all new to you, all right?\n\n417\n00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:21.630\nWell, if you look at this subnet mask,\nwhat octet are my host bits?\n\n418\n00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.070\nWhat octet do I have to work with?\n\n419\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.840\nBecause to add networks, I have to borrow\nfrom the host or the node bits right?\n\n420\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.040\nThe host bits.\n\n421\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.550\nWell, that's that last octet, right?\n\n422\n00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:36.020\nWe said when it comes to\nthe node portion of an address,\n\n423\n00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.710\nthat's where all the 0s are.\n\n424\n00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:43.920\nSo I don't have to worry about\nanything in the 255 range at all.\n\n425\n00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.100\nWhy don't I have to worry about\nanything in the 255 range?\n\n426\n00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.870\nI know they're already\npart of the network.\n\n427\n00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.140\nI need to make another network.\n\n428\n00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.310\nSo these network bits are already\nincluded, so I can just forget them.\n\n429\n00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.770\nWhat I need to focus on is this\noctet right here, all right?\n\n430\n00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.230\nSo what do we do?\n\n431\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.470\nWell, we're gonna take that octet and\n\n432\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.840\nwe're gonna start it out as though\nit was host bits, all right?\n\n433\n00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.930\nAnd yes, we're gonna put it in the binary,\nall right?\n\n434\n00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.170\nMaybe, there we go, and\n\n435\n00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.600\nlet me do a little formatting here and\nmake this a little easier to see.\n\n436\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.300\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n437\n00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, there we go.\n\n438\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:25.050\nAll right, so we have this octet\nis what we're working with, right?\n\n439\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.990\nThis last octet?\n\n440\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.860\nNow, that means I also am gonna work\nwith that portion of the IP address\n\n441\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.013\nthat's also a part of the host bits,\nright?\n\n442\n00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.790\nWhich would be that last octet as well.\n\n443\n00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.599\nSo we'll go ahead, and I already\nknow that last octet, since it's 0s,\n\n444\n00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.090\nwe got 0s over 0s, right?\n\n445\n00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.750\nAll right, so what we're gonna do is,\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n446\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.760\nwe'll put these 0s up here as well.\n\n447\n00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:55.270\nAnd we will move forward, all right?\n\n448\n00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.347\nSo I've got my 0, 0, 0,\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0, right?\n\n449\n00:23:58.347 --> 00:24:02.679\nSo this is the octet, keep in mind,\nlast octet in the IP address.\n\n450\n00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:06.848\nThis right here is the last octet\nin the subnet mask, all right?\n\n451\n00:24:06.848 --> 00:24:14.040\nSo if I want to start adding networks,\nI have to add network bits, alright?\n\n452\n00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.772\nNow when you do that, you're basically\nborrowing a bit from the host.\n\n453\n00:24:17.772 --> 00:24:22.180\nSo I'm going to take this bit and I'm\ngonna turn it on and if you remember that\n\n454\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:27.200\nturns that now, that portion of this\naddress into the network portion.\n\n455\n00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.126\nFollow the color coding.\n\n456\n00:24:28.126 --> 00:24:30.673\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Since we just turned that bit on in\n\n457\n00:24:30.673 --> 00:24:35.963\nthat last octet of the subnet mask,\nwe borrowed that bit from the node,\n\n458\n00:24:35.963 --> 00:24:41.930\nit now becomes in the IP address\na portion of the network bits, right?\n\n459\n00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:46.760\nWell, when you borrow one bit,\nhow many possibilities does that give you?\n\n460\n00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.090\nWell, I want you to think about how\nwe came up with our place values.\n\n461\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.910\nRemember I said, when you come up\nwith your place values that's two to\n\n462\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.380\nthe power of zero equals one.\n\n463\n00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.420\nTwo to the power of two.\n\n464\n00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.380\nWell, two to the power of one, excuse me.\n\n465\n00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.850\nLet me get that right again, two to the\npower of zero is two times itself, right?\n\n466\n00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:09.440\nTwo to the power of one is two times,\nwait a second.\n\n467\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.130\nI'm sorry I'm getting this wrong.\n\n468\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.792\nTry that again.\nTwo to the power of zero is one,\n\n469\n00:25:12.792 --> 00:25:15.910\nanything to the power of zero is one, and\nthat's where I was getting lost here.\n\n470\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.320\nTwo to the power of one is two\ntimes itself which is two.\n\n471\n00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.810\nTwo to the power of two\nis two times two is four.\n\n472\n00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.786\nSo, you see how we're getting these.\n\n473\n00:25:23.786 --> 00:25:25.738\nThese are exponential values.\n\n474\n00:25:25.738 --> 00:25:28.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I borrow one bit,\n\n475\n00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.260\nthat essentially is two to\nthe power of one, all right?\n\n476\n00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.188\nSo, if I have two to the power of one,\nwhat do I have?\n\n477\n00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:40.682\nI've got two times one, right?\n\n478\n00:25:40.682 --> 00:25:44.010\nTwo times one is what?\n\n479\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.130\nThat's basically going to be a two.\n\n480\n00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:53.030\nSo that tells me that I have two possible\nnetworks that I've just created.\n\n481\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.320\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n482\n00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.323\nYou always start with the very first,\nall right?\n\n483\n00:25:58.323 --> 00:26:00.252\nPossible, the zero, right?\n\n484\n00:26:00.252 --> 00:26:05.380\nSo the zero address is the very\nfirst network that we have.\n\n485\n00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.520\nBut when I turn this bit on and\nI make this part of the network.\n\n486\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.510\nWell what can those two\npossible values be?\n\n487\n00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.680\nWell those values can be a zero or\nthey can be a binary one, right?\n\n488\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.450\nAnd these two possible values,\nsince they're part of the network bits,\n\n489\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.740\nthey actually join up our network ID.\n\n490\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.950\nThey make our network ID.\n\n491\n00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.850\nAll right?\n\n492\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.610\nBecause the first address within any,\nremember I told you the first possibility\n\n493\n00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.400\nwithin any network essentially\nbecomes your network IDs.\n\n494\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n495\n00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:41.070\n&gt;&gt; Well, my two possibilities here\nare either binary zero or a binary one.\n\n496\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.440\nWell guess what?\n\n497\n00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.350\nWe're gonna move the dividing\nline in our network and\n\n498\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.820\nwe're gonna put it basically right here,\nall right?\n\n499\n00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.870\nWhere before in our classful system,\n\n500\n00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.940\nnotice that we had these\nclearly defined walls, right?\n\n501\n00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.490\nIn between each octet.\n\n502\n00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:00.900\nWell essentially that is like\ntaking this whole entire line and\n\n503\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.400\nwhat we're gonna do is we're\nessentially going to move it one place.\n\n504\n00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.690\nRight?\nWe're gonna move it from here\n\n505\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.570\nto this side.\n\n506\n00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.420\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's do that.\n\n507\n00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.670\nLet me see how I can do that real quick.\n\n508\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.420\nLet me just go ahead and insert.\n\n509\n00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.910\nLet me see.\nNope, that's not what I want.\n\n510\n00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.080\nLet's try that again.\n\n511\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.290\nOne more time.\n\n512\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.970\nSo, we're gonna insert a line here.\n\n513\n00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:27.560\nAnd, I want you to think of our\ndividing line now within our network.\n\n514\n00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.960\nBetween our network portion and\nour host portion as now being right here.\n\n515\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.080\nOops, that did not work.\n\n516\n00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:33.950\nLet's try that one more time.\n\n517\n00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.000\nThere we go, all right.\n\n518\n00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.590\nSo, these are the two possibilities.\n\n519\n00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.140\nThat if we borrow one bit,\nI get two to the power of one.\n\n520\n00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.700\nThat's that one bit that I borrowed and\n\n521\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.380\ntwo to the power of one\nexponentially is two, right?\n\n522\n00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.470\nWell, how does that literally\nmake those two combinations?\n\n523\n00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.410\nWell now that these are network bits,\nmy two possibilities are zero or one,\n\n524\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.020\nthat means that every one of these bits\nbehind here are all host bits, right?\n\n525\n00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.580\nOr all node bits.\n\n526\n00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.380\nWell, look here.\n\n527\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.650\nThe very first address within\na network is called the network ID,\n\n528\n00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:11.530\nand it's defined by all, now follow me on\nthis one, the network identifiers within\n\n529\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:17.760\na network are defined as being\nall zeroes in the host portion.\n\n530\n00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.550\nThat's how we tell the network IDs.\n\n531\n00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:25.210\nThat's how you identify that as being\nthe network ID that every node will share.\n\n532\n00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.420\nSo if I take and I go 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\n0, 0, all in the host bits,right?\n\n533\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.275\nFollow me there.\n\n534\n00:28:31.275 --> 00:28:31.890\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n535\n00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.065\n&gt;&gt; All in the host bits.\n\n536\n00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n537\n00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:39.025\n&gt;&gt; These two, and let me center these up\na little bit, that means this value right\n\n538\n00:28:39.025 --> 00:28:44.731\nhere taken out of binary becomes our very\nfirst network that we've just created.\n\n539\n00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:51.063\nAnd in this case it's 192.168.\n\n540\n00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:55.830\nOops, 192.168, thank you auto fill, .0.0.\n\n541\n00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.875\nAnd I know that doesn't seem like it\nchanged anything because it really didn't\n\n542\n00:28:59.875 --> 00:29:03.530\nbecause you still have that\nvery first base address.\n\n543\n00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.100\nBut now what you'll see is,\nI also have a second network, remember?\n\n544\n00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.810\nI've got two possibilities here for\nthis bit position.\n\n545\n00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:17.771\nAll zeroes in the host portion makes\nthis eight bit value our next network,\n\n546\n00:29:17.771 --> 00:29:21.092\nour next network ID that we just created.\n\n547\n00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:26.162\nSo that is going to be, and\nlet me change this around here.\n\n548\n00:29:26.162 --> 00:29:28.200\nProbably should have done\nthis before the show.\n\n549\n00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.880\nBut that's okay, we'll do it on the fly.\n\n550\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.970\nThat always works, right?\n\n551\n00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:36.400\nWe're gonna do 192.168, or .0., and\n\n552\n00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:43.088\nyou have to figure out, what is 1 followed\nby all 0s, from binary to decimal?\n\n553\n00:29:43.088 --> 00:29:46.197\nWell, it's 128.\n\n554\n00:29:46.197 --> 00:29:50.594\nAll right, so the two networks\nthat we just created here by\n\n555\n00:29:50.594 --> 00:29:55.940\nborrowing a bit from the host\ncreated us two networks, allright?\n\n556\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.115\nTwo networks and\nthese are what are known as the net IDs,\n\n557\n00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:06.969\n192.168.0.0 and\nwe could do a slash 25, right?\n\n558\n00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:08.850\nBecause we've now got an extra bit.\n\n559\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.999\nWe've borrowed a bit, no more 24.\n\n560\n00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:13.535\nNow we've got 25 bits.\n\n561\n00:30:13.535 --> 00:30:14.046\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n562\n00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:18.934\n&gt;&gt; So when you choose to\nmake a slash 25 on these,\n\n563\n00:30:18.934 --> 00:30:23.704\nyou've essentially subnetted a large 254\n\n564\n00:30:23.704 --> 00:30:28.244\nnode network into 2 126 node networks.\n\n565\n00:30:28.244 --> 00:30:32.860\nNow technically the possibilities,\nkeep in mind, are 128.\n\n566\n00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:39.086\nBut I cannot use this very first\npossibility as an IP address for\n\n567\n00:30:39.086 --> 00:30:44.030\nthe host,\nbecause it's the network ID, right?\n\n568\n00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:49.616\nI cannot use this second network\nhere the very first possibility\n\n569\n00:30:49.616 --> 00:30:54.176\nas a host IP address because\nit's also a network ID.\n\n570\n00:30:54.176 --> 00:30:58.550\nWell, how do we figure out the broadcast\nwithin these network ranges.\n\n571\n00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:03.185\nAll right?\nWell, that is defined as been all one\n\n572\n00:31:03.185 --> 00:31:07.500\nbits, in the host portion or node portion.\n\n573\n00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.136\nSo take the dividing line, and\njust past that dividing line\n\n574\n00:31:11.136 --> 00:31:14.931\nwhere you know these are node bits,\nand put all ones in there.\n\n575\n00:31:14.931 --> 00:31:19.451\nAnd then take that out of the binary.\n\n576\n00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:27.270\nSo if the network IDs for this is\n192.168.0.0, what is the broadcast ID?\n\n577\n00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:32.470\nWell the broadcast or\naddress as it's called, the broadcast\n\n578\n00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:38.380\naddress is going to be that number\nthat is all ones in the host portion.\n\n579\n00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:38.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n580\n00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:42.194\n&gt;&gt; Well what is this number if you will,\n\n581\n00:31:42.194 --> 00:31:46.150\ntaken out of the binary and\nput into decimal?\n\n582\n00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.609\nWell, it is 192.168.0.127.\n\n583\n00:31:49.609 --> 00:31:56.930\nSo that becomes the broadcast ID.\n\n584\n00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.607\nSo now we have what's\nknown as the network ID.\n\n585\n00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:01.520\nI can't give the network ID out.\n\n586\n00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.401\nRight?\nThe network ID is defined as all zeros.\n\n587\n00:32:04.401 --> 00:32:05.152\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n588\n00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:07.007\n&gt;&gt; In the host portion.\n\n589\n00:32:07.007 --> 00:32:12.171\nTake that same network, same thing,\nbut turn the host portion into all 1s,\n\n590\n00:32:12.171 --> 00:32:16.180\nand it tells me what the broadcast\naddress is, all right?\n\n591\n00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.980\nAnd if I pull that out of\nthe binary back into the decimal,\n\n592\n00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:26.120\nI can see that the broadcast address for\nthis network is 192.168.0.127.\n\n593\n00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.950\nWell, remember, the second network I told\nyou though the two possibilities was a 0\n\n594\n00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:30.770\nor a 1.\n\n595\n00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.200\nThat's part of the network.\n\n596\n00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:36.770\nSo all 0's in the host portion or\nnode portion becomes our network ID,\n\n597\n00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:41.210\nand that would be a 128, right,\na 1 followed by all 0's.\n\n598\n00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.450\nBut if I turn this into all 1's in\nthe node portion, that now gives me what\n\n599\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.270\nthe broadcast ID is or\nthe broadcast address is for that network.\n\n600\n00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.621\nWell, that tells me that\nthe broadcast ID or\n\n601\n00:32:52.621 --> 00:32:55.985\naddress, if you will, is going to be what?\n\n602\n00:32:55.985 --> 00:32:59.651\nWell, what's all 1's in an octet,\n\n603\n00:32:59.651 --> 00:33:04.252\nit's gonna be 192.168.0.255.\n\n604\n00:33:04.252 --> 00:33:09.449\nAll right, so\nwhat we end up having here is\n\n605\n00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:15.250\nwe have our Network ID's on one side,\nright?\n\n606\n00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.067\nThese are our network IDs.\n\n607\n00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:23.914\nAnd on this side what we end up having is\nwhat is known as our broadcast address,\n\n608\n00:33:23.914 --> 00:33:24.544\nright?\n\n609\n00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:27.645\nSo we can say,\nour Broadcast Address, all right?\n\n610\n00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:30.380\nAnd you have to know that, right?\n\n611\n00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.052\nWhen you start with this\nprocess of subnetting,\n\n612\n00:33:33.052 --> 00:33:35.079\nI have to know what is the network ID?\n\n613\n00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:38.685\nIf they give you an IP address\nwith this slash notation,\n\n614\n00:33:38.685 --> 00:33:43.447\nthey give you something\nlike 192.168.0.1.28/125,\n\n615\n00:33:43.447 --> 00:33:47.920\nthey say is this a valid IP\naddress within that network?\n\n616\n00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.720\nWell, you would have to know\nby doing the binary here that,\n\n617\n00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.530\nno, that cannot be a valid IP address.\n\n618\n00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:57.030\nBecause if I put it in the binary,\nand I do the division here,\n\n619\n00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.650\nbasically drawing that line between\nthe network portion and the node portion.\n\n620\n00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:07.623\nI notice that there are all\n0's in the node portion,\n\n621\n00:34:07.623 --> 00:34:14.960\nthat can't be an IP address,\nthat has to be a network ID, right?\n\n622\n00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.959\nJust like looking at 127,\nif I look at 192.168.0.127 and\n\n623\n00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:23.537\nit has a /25 on it, and they say, is this\na valid IP address for that network range?\n\n624\n00:34:23.537 --> 00:34:27.844\nWell, no, because if I look, 127,\nafter I've done my subnetting,\n\n625\n00:34:27.844 --> 00:34:32.420\nis all 1's in the host bit, that means\nit has to be the broadcast address.\n\n626\n00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.110\nI cannot allocate that to a computer.\n\n627\n00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.160\nSo what we know now is that\nin between these ranges\n\n628\n00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.040\nare where our IP addresses stand.\n\n629\n00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.420\nAnd what that means for me is that,\nwithin this network here,\n\n630\n00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:51.330\nwhat I'm gonna end up having\nis an addressable range.\n\n631\n00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.500\nAnd we'll just look at that last octet,\nright?\n\n632\n00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.380\nLooking at that last octet, that I know\nthat I can't use the first address, so\n\n633\n00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:05.360\nI can use .1, through, can't use the 127,\nthat's the broadcast address, right?\n\n634\n00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.485\nSo I can use .1 to .126.\n\n635\n00:35:08.485 --> 00:35:15.560\nAnd for this network, I can use what, I\ncan use, well, I can't use the 128, right?\n\n636\n00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.923\nThe 128 is going to be our network ID, so\n\n637\n00:35:19.923 --> 00:35:23.935\nthat means I can use .129, right?\n\n638\n00:35:23.935 --> 00:35:27.040\nThat's the first valid IP address.\n\n639\n00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.561\nI can't use 255, right,\nbecause 255 is the broadcast address,\n\n640\n00:35:32.561 --> 00:35:35.510\nso I have to use .254, all right.\n\n641\n00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.360\nSo that essentially is where\nwe're getting the 126 computers.\n\n642\n00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:45.922\nSo the question would be, if I do this,\nwhat is actually happening, all right?\n\n643\n00:35:45.922 --> 00:35:49.030\nWell, let's go ahead, and\nI know we're well out of time here,\n\n644\n00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.230\nwe'll come back in part 3.\n\n645\n00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.910\nBut what I've done with this is,\nI've essentially said okay,\n\n646\n00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:58.600\nI've created two networks now, right?\n\n647\n00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.025\nSo now we've got two subnets, right?\n\n648\n00:36:02.025 --> 00:36:04.900\nCuz we're subnetting here.\n\n649\n00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.626\nAnd Network A is,\n\n650\n00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:14.092\nthis is the network ID, so\n\n651\n00:36:14.092 --> 00:36:20.061\nNetwork A here, all right?\n\n652\n00:36:20.061 --> 00:36:28.580\nAnd Network B, or subnet B,\nif you will, Is, well, what?\n\n653\n00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.762\nIt is,\nremember what we said 192.168.0.128?\n\n654\n00:36:32.762 --> 00:36:35.930\nI've essentially created two subnets.\n\n655\n00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:40.060\nWe've got subnet or\nNetwork A and Network B, and\n\n656\n00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.709\nnow we have two broadcast domains as well,\nall right?\n\n657\n00:36:44.709 --> 00:36:49.901\nAnd essentially, I can now put 126\ncomputers on this network, and\n\n658\n00:36:49.901 --> 00:36:55.711\nI could put 100, [SOUND] I can put 126\ncomputers on this Network B as well.\n\n659\n00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:59.555\nAnd then I also, with inside of each\nof those networks, if I'm only using,\n\n660\n00:36:59.555 --> 00:37:03.701\nlet's say 50 computers, well,\nI still have 50 something extra addresses,\n\n661\n00:37:03.701 --> 00:37:07.032\n60 something extra addresses that\nI can use for future growth.\n\n662\n00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:10.990\nNow that's only one example, we got some\nmore examples that we wanna show you.\n\n663\n00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.230\nMaybe we wanna go even further, right?\n\n664\n00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.456\nMaybe we wanna make four networks.\n\n665\n00:37:15.456 --> 00:37:19.600\nWe wanna put 4 networks and we wanna\nhave 50 computers on each network.\n\n666\n00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.360\nOr maybe we want three networks,\nright, and\n\n667\n00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.380\nwe wanna have an extra network\njust left over for future growth.\n\n668\n00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.120\nWell, we're gonna show you how to do that,\n\n669\n00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.950\nbut we don't have time to\ndo it in this episode.\n\n670\n00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:34.291\n&gt;&gt; Classless IPv4 Addressing Part\n3 coming your way.\n\n671\n00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:36.760\nThis has been Part 2, there is a Part 1.\n\n672\n00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.366\nI tell you what,\nit's valuable information.\n\n673\n00:37:38.366 --> 00:37:41.820\nIf I were you, I'd be watching\nall three of them many times.\n\n674\n00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.156\nAnd in fact,\nsee everything that Wes' put together for\n\n675\n00:37:44.156 --> 00:37:45.810\nyou in the CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n676\n00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.760\nAnd inside that course library\nthere's hundreds of other videos,\n\n677\n00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.160\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n678\n00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.000\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n679\n00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.770\nITPro.TV is binge worthy.\n\n680\n00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.350\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n681\n00:37:56.350 -->

Wes Bryan, Wes Bryan, Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.290\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, hey, Zach,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.290\nThat's right, it's been fun.\n\n13\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.620\nAnd we are going to move on, right?\n\n14\n00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.320\nWe're gonna move along and we're gonna\npick up right where we left off.\n\n15\n00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.260\nRemember, in the last episode\nwe ended with showing you\n\n16\n00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.930\nhow to basically take a single larger\nnetwork and subnet it into, or\n\n17\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.440\ndivide it into, two smaller networks.\n\n18\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.470\nBut we're gonna go a little bit farther.\n\n19\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.560\nWe didn't wanna just leave\nyou with one example.\n\n20\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200\nWe wanna give you a couple of examples so\n\n21\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.350\nthat you will be prepared if they\nask you to do this on a Net+ exam.\n\n22\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.170\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive right in,\nand we'll pick up right where we left off.\n\n23\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.330\nIf you aren't aware of where we left off,\n\n24\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.550\ngo back and see part two and\nthen come back here and see part three.\n\n25\n00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.847\nAll right, so if we look at our sheet,\nthe last thing that we did, right,\n\n26\n00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:17.891\nis we took a larger network\nof 192.168.0.0 with a /24 or\n\n27\n00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:24.920\na classical subnet mask of 255.255.255.0,\nright, and we divided it up, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.418\nWe said that hey, if I put a /25,\n\n29\n00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:33.410\nthat 25 adds one extra\nbit in the 4th octet.\n\n30\n00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.775\nAnd when we turn that bit on, we found\nthat these were our two network IDs.\n\n31\n00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:40.380\nOop, this is not a network ID.\n\n32\n00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.050\nLet me go ahead and\nchange this around here just a little bit.\n\n33\n00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.400\nRemember we said that all zeroes in\n\n34\n00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.050\nthe host portion would be\nyour network IDs, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.420\nSo these network IDs would be all zeros.\n\n36\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.415\nWell, that's easy enough,\nthat would be 192.168.0.0.\n\n37\n00:01:57.415 --> 00:02:02.380\nThe second possibility that we had here,\nall right, was a binary 1, right?\n\n38\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.651\nSo if we take that out of the binary,\n\n39\n00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:11.226\nthat would be a network\nID of 192.168.0.128.\n\n40\n00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:14.140\nAgain /25, cuz we have that extra bit.\n\n41\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.640\nNow remember we also said that to find\nout what the broadcast address was for\n\n42\n00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.780\nany given network, would be all 1 bits,\nright, in the host portion.\n\n43\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.590\nSo since we know that we took that one\nbit and added it to the network portion,\n\n44\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.540\nif we put all ones in the host portion,\n\n45\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.260\nthese two binary numbers end up\nbecoming our broadcast addresses.\n\n46\n00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.570\nSo if I take this out of binary and\nI convert it back to the decimal.\n\n47\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.105\nAnd if you're not familiar with that,\n\n48\n00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:46.001\ngo back and look at some of the episodes\nin which we've done this, right?\n\n49\n00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.411\nI can see that that is\nactually going to be 127.\n\n50\n00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:53.864\nSo I know that the broadcast address,\nif you will, for this network here,\n\n51\n00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:57.930\nthe very first one we created,\nwas 192.168.0.127.\n\n52\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.940\nRemember, all 1 bits in the host\nportion for the second network as well.\n\n53\n00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.310\nThat's gonna be the broadcast address for\nthe second network we created.\n\n54\n00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.120\nAnd, well, all 1s we've already seen,\njust like our subnet mask, right?\n\n55\n00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.565\nAll 1s in 8 bits is 255.\n\n56\n00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:15.000\nThe largest decimal value\ncan have an 8-bit octet.\n\n57\n00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.697\nSo that means the broadcast address for\n\n58\n00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:19.844\nthe second network is also\n192.168.0.255 with a /25.\n\n59\n00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:25.244\nNow because we can't use\nthese two addresses,\n\n60\n00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:30.509\nI want you to remember\nthat that takes off two of\n\n61\n00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:35.865\nthe addresses for the overall pool, right?\n\n62\n00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:39.145\nWhen I need to figure out how\nmany possibilities do I have,\n\n63\n00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:40.660\nI said 2 to the power of 8.\n\n64\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.100\nYou have 8 bits in an octet\nthat you can work with, is 256.\n\n65\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.010\nBut as I've been kind of going back and\nforth telling you,\n\n66\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.580\nI said that gives you 254 available IP\naddresses, and we kind of told you why.\n\n67\n00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.940\nI can't give the network ID\nto any individual computer,\n\n68\n00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.562\ncuz all computers share the network ID,\nright?\n\n69\n00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:03.810\nI cannot give them the broadcast address.\n\n70\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.030\nI can't give that IP address\nto Zach's computer, why?\n\n71\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.530\nWell, cuz if I'm on that same network,\n\n72\n00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.530\nmy computer uses that as well to send\nbroadcast communications, right?\n\n73\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.330\nSo all computers use\nthe broadcast address.\n\n74\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.420\nSo these two addresses,\nthe first address or\n\n75\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.230\nthe first possibility,\nit's not really address, be careful.\n\n76\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.530\nThe first possibility within\na network range is the network ID.\n\n77\n00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.310\nAll zeroes in the host portion.\n\n78\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.462\nThe last possibility, all ones in the host\nportion or node portion of an IP address,\n\n79\n00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:36.610\nis going to be your broadcast,\nand that can't be given out.\n\n80\n00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.180\nSo even though 2 to the power of 8 is 256,\n\n81\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.310\nif we take off those two unusable\npossibilities, that gives us 254 nodes.\n\n82\n00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.610\nNow because we've now divided this\nright down the dividing line,\n\n83\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.050\nI don't have 254 possibilities.\n\n84\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.580\nWhat do I have, right?\n\n85\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.320\nWell, if you look at it,\nI now have what, 1 to 126.\n\n86\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.140\nEssentially, I had 128, right,\n\n87\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.731\n128 possibilities if we divide\nthat 256 right in half.\n\n88\n00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.567\nBut now that we've got 128,\n\n89\n00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:12.190\nwe've gotta keep in mind can't\ngive the first address out.\n\n90\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.870\nCan't give the last address out.\n\n91\n00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.790\nSo technically I've got 126.\n\n92\n00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.506\nSo that means the very first host,\nright, within this network,\n\n93\n00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:24.953\nis gonna be 192.168.0.1, right?\n\n94\n00:05:24.953 --> 00:05:29.780\nThat's the first host within that range,\nthe addressable range.\n\n95\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.598\nThat means since I can't give the very\nlast possibility, the 192.168.01.127,\n\n96\n00:05:35.598 --> 00:05:40.870\ncuz that's the broadcast address, it means\nlast one is one less than that, right?\n\n97\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.481\nSo it's .126.\n\n98\n00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.040\nSo this what we know as\nthe addressable range, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.680\nI called it the host range here,\nbut it's the addressable range.\n\n100\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.057\nWe can give out 192.168.0.1.2.3.4,\n\n101\n00:05:56.057 --> 00:05:59.428\nall the way up to .126, right?\n\n102\n00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:05.150\nBut that .126 is the last address\nwe can use within that range,\n\n103\n00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.280\ncuz then,\n127 becomes your broadcast address.\n\n104\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.079\nWe move over into the second\nnetwork that we've created.\n\n105\n00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:16.558\n128, I can't give that out, that's\nthe network ID, so that means 1.129.\n\n106\n00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:21.395\nSo 192.168.0.129, .128, .129,\n\n107\n00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:25.370\n.130, .131 all the way up to .254.\n\n108\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.248\nThat gives me another.\n\n109\n00:06:28.248 --> 00:06:32.420\nWell, it's overall 128 possibilities,\n\n110\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.390\nbut again,\nit's another 126 potential IP addresses.\n\n111\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.450\nSo what we did essentially is we\ntook all of this work in subnetting,\n\n112\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.690\nwent from a single,\nlarger network, of Network A.\n\n113\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.020\nNow we have Subnet A and\nSubnet B, all right?\n\n114\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.170\nWell, maybe you want to eliminate\nsome more of the waste, right?\n\n115\n00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:00.510\nBecause what if I have only 50\ncomputers on that one network, right?\n\n116\n00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.770\nOr maybe I need only 50\ncomputers on two networks.\n\n117\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.460\nWell, this isn't gonna work, right?\n\n118\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.390\nAnd what they might ask\nyou is they want you\n\n119\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.835\nto waste the least amount of addresses,\nright?\n\n120\n00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:17.877\nSo how can we further divide\nthis type of network in\n\n121\n00:07:17.877 --> 00:07:24.129\norder to give three networks\nwith 50 nodes apiece, right?\n\n122\n00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:25.180\nWell, let's find out.\n\n123\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.752\nLet's go back to the drawing board, right?\n\n124\n00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:29.600\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n125\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.280\nwe're gonna set all of this to the side.\n\n126\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.190\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nturn all of these to zeros.\n\n127\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.210\nAgain, kind of cancel this out.\n\n128\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.257\nIf you need a recap,\nplease remember to check out the first\n\n129\n00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:47.005\nparts of our little trilogy\nthat we have going on here.\n\n130\n00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Episode one and two.\n\n131\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.950\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n132\n00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.771\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\njust kinda zero all of these out and\n\n133\n00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:53.760\nwe're not gonna pay attention to those.\n\n134\n00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.614\nAnd what we're gonna do here is we're\nactually going to work now in this area,\n\n135\n00:07:59.614 --> 00:08:02.983\nand we'll see if we can Subdivide or\nsubnet,\n\n136\n00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:08.170\nif you will, this network even\nfarther making again less waste.\n\n137\n00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.270\nBecause if I only need 50 computers and\nI have available 126, I got,\n\n138\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.750\nwhat, 76 wasted I believe.\n\n139\n00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.480\nIf I can get my math right,\n\n140\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.710\nI have 76 addresses that are wasted\nthat I can't use, right?\n\n141\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.430\nSo how can we reduce the waste even more?\n\n142\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.520\nWell we're gonna subnet even farther,\nright?\n\n143\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.440\nSo how do I figure this out?\n\n144\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.750\nWell, I want you to remember that\nwhen we looked at our powers or\n\n145\n00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.845\nour exponential values,\nwhat we did is we did a 128.\n\n146\n00:08:36.845 --> 00:08:39.835\nWe borrowed one bit right?\n\n147\n00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:45.155\nOne bit, 2 to the power of 1 gave\nme two possible networks right?\n\n148\n00:08:45.155 --> 00:08:46.805\nI showed you those two possibilities.\n\n149\n00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:48.741\nThey gave me a binary one or\na binary zero.\n\n150\n00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:49.546\nAll right, so\n\n151\n00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:54.405\nthat's not going to work because that\nonly gives me two additional networks.\n\n152\n00:08:54.405 --> 00:08:57.495\nSo if I borrowed two bits from the host or\n\n153\n00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:01.870\nthe node portion, will that give\nme the three networks I need?\n\n154\n00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.640\nWell I don't know.\n\n155\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.970\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's do that exact thing.\n\n156\n00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.352\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nwhat we're going to do is we'll come back.\n\n157\n00:09:09.352 --> 00:09:11.265\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm going to start over.\n\n158\n00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:16.075\nYes, I am going to erase these\ncomputers off the network.\n\n159\n00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:18.875\nHopefully they weren't\ntrying to be productive.\n\n160\n00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:21.285\nAll right, so\n[LAUGH] those networks are gone, right?\n\n161\n00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:26.222\nNow, what we're gonna say, all right,\nwe're back to this larger network of,\n\n162\n00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:31.260\nwell network A here is, apparently\njoin the line here, back to that /24.\n\n163\n00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.600\nWe wanna see if we can subnet or\n\n164\n00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.965\nsubdivide this larger network\ninto more manageable chunks,\n\n165\n00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:46.320\n3 networks with 50 nodes\na piece on each network.\n\n166\n00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.850\nLet's go ahead and see if we can do that.\n\n167\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.640\nSo if I borrow 2 bits,\n\n168\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.080\nhow many possibilities does that give me,\nall right?\n\n169\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.850\nWell, let's go ahead and let's switch\nover, and we'll do exactly that.\n\n170\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.430\nI'm gonna go ahead and what I'll do\nis we'll start right here, Zach.\n\n171\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.140\nAnd I'll say, all right,\nwe're starting out with 192.168.0 and\n\n172\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.960\nwe're gonna do, or .0, that's our network\nID, and that's our starting network.\n\n173\n00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.910\nSo we're gonna say all right,\nwe're gonna borrow two bits.\n\n174\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.400\nSo instead of it being a /24,\nwe're gonna say it's a /26.\n\n175\n00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.030\nNow I want you to remember,\nsame rules apply here.\n\n176\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:26.790\nNow what I'm gonna do here is, let me\ninsert, I believe insert, there we go.\n\n177\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.870\nAnd that's not what we want.\n\n178\n00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.790\nLet's try that again here.\n\n179\n00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.360\nOops.\n\n180\n00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.130\nWe will get that right eventually here.\n\n181\n00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.050\nSo we're gonna delete that\nall together apparently.\n\n182\n00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.928\nYou gotta love Excel there.\n\n183\n00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.100\nAll right, one more time.\n\n184\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.500\nI'm going to delete this.\n\n185\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.170\nI'm going to get this out of here, right?\n\n186\n00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.390\nAnd what we're going to do is\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n187\n00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.630\nwe're going to start working and\nwhat we're going to say is,\n\n188\n00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.320\nhey we're going to divide and\njust two bits.\n\n189\n00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.820\nSo I'm going to do 1, 2 and\nthen 0, 0, 0, 0, all right?\n\n190\n00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.110\nSo those are those two\nbits that we borrowed.\n\n191\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.660\nWe're going to do 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n192\n00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:12.290\nAnd for some reason that one doesn't\nlike me, and is not playing nice.\n\n193\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.060\nBut that's okay,\nwe will make it do what we want.\n\n194\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.720\nAll right, there we go.\n\n195\n00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.980\nAll right, so this is going to\nbe that last octet, all right,\n\n196\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.860\nthat's gonna be in the IP address.\n\n197\n00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.840\nAnd these are the two bits that we\nborrowed in the subnet mask, so\n\n198\n00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.770\nwhat we're gonna do now is\nthat means that these bits\n\n199\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.080\nnow become a portion of the network,\nright?\n\n200\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.830\nJust like we did before.\n\n201\n00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.330\nSo what we're gonna do here is,\nlet's see if I can,\n\n202\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.590\nI'm gonna try this one more time Zach, and\nlet's see if Excel will play nice with me.\n\n203\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.430\nThere we go, that's what I want.\n\n204\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.430\nSo now our dividing line has\nmoved over just a little bit.\n\n205\n00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.790\nSo now the dividing line between\nour network bits and our node bits\n\n206\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.710\nare in the second position, unlike\nthe first example that was just one bit.\n\n207\n00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.110\nSo I divided the network and the node bits\nright there, so now I've moved them over.\n\n208\n00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.550\nSo now we gotta figure out, how many\npossibilities with two bits can I get?\n\n209\n00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.710\nAll right, and this could help\nyou out a lot if you'll do this.\n\n210\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.050\nI know that by default,\nI'll always have 0, 0,\n\n211\n00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.690\nthat's the first combination,\nthat's the combination we started with.\n\n212\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.450\nAnd we always start with that,\nthat's our base right?\n\n213\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.550\nBut then I'll want you to look at\nthe other possible combinations,\n\n214\n00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.360\nI can do a 0, 1.\n\n215\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.390\nI could do a 1, oops, and\nlet's try that again.\n\n216\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.610\nI can do a 1, 0 right?\n\n217\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.250\nAnd then I can do what, a 1, 1.\n\n218\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.920\nThose are the four possible combinations\nI can create with two bits, right?\n\n219\n00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.820\nThat's all the possible combinations.\n\n220\n00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.630\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n&gt;&gt; Now, if I wanna find out network IDs,\n\n221\n00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.680\nremember what I said,\nit's all zeros in the host portion.\n\n222\n00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.350\nNow the question would be,\ndid this create three networks?\n\n223\n00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.730\nWell I see four possibilities,\nso the answer is, well, yeah.\n\n224\n00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.030\nThis created, not three networks,\nbut it created four.\n\n225\n00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.730\nAnd I know that I need to\nat least create four, why?\n\n226\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.690\nBecause if I only borrow one bit, we've\nseen that only gives us two possibilities,\n\n227\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.050\ntwo networks.\n\n228\n00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.690\nSo now let's try to figure out\nsome network IDs, all right?\n\n229\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.400\nLet's identify in\nborrowing those two bits,\n\n230\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.990\nlooking at the possibilities,\nfilling in the host bits with zeros,\n\n231\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.638\nwhat the network IDs would be for\nthese networks that we've just created.\n\n232\n00:13:24.638 --> 00:13:29.532\nSo that's 192.168.0.0,\nwe always start with a base, right?\n\n233\n00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:30.440\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.340\n&gt;&gt; And we'll go ahead and\nsay now that's a /26.\n\n235\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:42.280\nNow we're gonna say 192.168 and I'll go\nahead and what would the next number be?\n\n236\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.410\nWell the next number I can\nkinda tell what it's gonna be.\n\n237\n00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.900\nI can just look up here and\nI can say, well that's 64, right?\n\n238\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.370\n64 and nothing else to add there.\n\n239\n00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:54.820\nSo I can see that the last octet is 192,\nthank you Excel,\n\n240\n00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:00.710\nI don't need your help,\n[LAUGH] .0.64/26, all right?\n\n241\n00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.875\nYou'll start to see a pattern come\non as we work through these, right?\n\n242\n00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:09.190\nNow, what is the next possible value,\nright?\n\n243\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.130\nWell, again, I'm just taking this out of\nthis chart that we've been working with\n\n244\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:18.940\nand converting it back to decimal,\n\n245\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.720\nwe've got a 192.168.0.128, and again,\nthat's with a /26 subnet mask, all right?\n\n246\n00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.200\nLast but not least,\nis the last possibility we have, and\n\n247\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.300\nif we take this 8 bit binary\nnumber out of the binary, and\n\n248\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.330\nconvert it back to decimal,\nit becomes the last network ID.\n\n249\n00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.950\nWhy is it a network ID?\n\n250\n00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.620\nBecause it's all zeros in the host\nportion of these possibilities.\n\n251\n00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.405\nThose become your network ID's.\n\n252\n00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:50.419\nIt's a very first possible\npossibility within that range.\n\n253\n00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:52.758\nSo we got a\n\n254\n00:14:52.758 --> 00:15:02.710\n192.168.0.192/26.\n\n255\n00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:08.460\nSo that tells me that hey, have we\ncreated at least the three networks?\n\n256\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.350\nWell the answer is I\nhave one network here.\n\n257\n00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.200\nOne and give me one moment here.\n\n258\n00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.870\nLet's kinda again manipulate\nthis a little bit.\n\n259\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.872\nWe'll make Excel do what we want it to do.\n\n260\n00:15:19.872 --> 00:15:23.430\nAll right, I've got one network first,\n\n261\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:31.910\nI've got the second network,\nthird network and fourth network.\n\n262\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:38.470\nSo Zach, so far we're borrowing those two\nbits, have I accomplished my mission?\n\n263\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Three networks.\n\n264\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.590\n&gt;&gt; At least.\n\n265\n00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.327\n&gt;&gt; Well we haven't really,\nwe haven't found out,\n\n266\n00:15:43.327 --> 00:15:47.707\nthe first part's taken care of and this\nis what you need to remember on the exam.\n\n267\n00:15:47.707 --> 00:15:49.636\nI threw Zacg a curve ball on purpose.\n\n268\n00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:50.136\n&gt;&gt; He did.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n269\n00:15:50.136 --> 00:15:52.753\nI said that part of the question was I\n\n270\n00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:56.346\nneed to create three networks.\nI said did we accomplish\n\n271\n00:15:56.346 --> 00:15:59.039\nwhat we needed to?\nWell, we accomplished the three networks.\n\n272\n00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:00.320\nI've got at least four here.\n\n273\n00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.310\nBut we also said you had to\nhave 50 nodes per network.\n\n274\n00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.410\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So the other part is we had to figure\n\n275\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.380\nout is do we have the ability\nto put 50 nodes per network?\n\n276\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.730\nWell, let's see how that plays out\nby now finding out our broadcast.\n\n277\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.590\nWe found out the ID, now let's go\nto the other side of the river and\n\n278\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.590\nlet's figure out what the last address is,\nright, cuz that's the broadcast.\n\n279\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.480\nAnd once we find out that, then we can\ntell what's in between and we can add up\n\n280\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.030\nwhatever the total is, figuring out\nwhether it's gonna be 50 addresses, right?\n\n281\n00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.280\nSo that's the other part.\n\n282\n00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.020\nAnd very good for playing along, too.\n\n283\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.530\nI didn't script any of this.\n\n284\n00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.550\nI just threw him a curve ball.\n\n285\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.662\nSo not bad out there, Zack.\n\n286\n00:16:34.662 --> 00:16:35.737\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] without a net.\n\n287\n00:16:35.737 --> 00:16:36.442\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n288\n00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:37.234\nThe high wire there.\n\n289\n00:16:37.234 --> 00:16:38.770\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.\n\n290\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.530\nSo let's go ahead and let's figure out\nwhat the broadcast address is, all right?\n\n291\n00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.260\nWell, remember,\nI told you how to do that, right?\n\n292\n00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.230\nAll you have to do is turn every\none of these bit positions\n\n293\n00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.470\nin the host portion to ones, right?\n\n294\n00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.270\nSo let me go ahead,\n\n295\n00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.670\nsee if I can do this, going back to\nthe days almost like an Atari game.\n\n296\n00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.910\nAnd apparently that's challenging,\nall right.\n\n297\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.020\nSo that's all I'm focusing on right now\nto figure out in these possibilities what\n\n298\n00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.170\nthe broadcast addresses.\n\n299\n00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:12.420\nNow what I gotta do is take each one of\nthese 8-bit values out of the binary and\n\n300\n00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.550\nconvert them back to decimals.\n\n301\n00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.170\nSo we can just add up all the 1's, right?\n\n302\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.810\nSo I know that the very first address, and\n\n303\n00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:25.324\nI can tell because I know that\nthis 8-bits of information, or\n\n304\n00:17:25.324 --> 00:17:32.831\nthese 8-bits right here actually\nmake up 192.168.0.63, all right?\n\n305\n00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:36.325\nAnd again, I'll use a /26 just so\n\n306\n00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:41.800\nyou know that that is the broadcast range,\nall right?\n\n307\n00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.790\nOr the broadcast address, excuse me.\n\n308\n00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:48.015\nNow, the next thing I have to do for the\nsecond network is I have to figure out,\n\n309\n00:17:48.015 --> 00:17:52.055\nall right, is this, or what is this\nvalue from the binary to the decimal?\n\n310\n00:17:52.055 --> 00:17:56.387\nSo we'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n311\n00:17:56.387 --> 00:18:01.726\nAnd that is 192.168.0.127, all right?\n\n312\n00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:05.269\nAnd you can always, if you want to,\nI encourage you to pause the video and\n\n313\n00:18:05.269 --> 00:18:09.880\nadd all this up, and you can always test\nby numbers out here to see if it's right.\n\n314\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.866\nAnd then, the third network,\nwhat is the broadcast address for\n\n315\n00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:16.817\nthat range, all right?\n\n316\n00:18:16.817 --> 00:18:22.715\nAnd we'll see that if I take these\neight bits out of the chart,\n\n317\n00:18:22.715 --> 00:18:26.802\nconvert them back from binary to decimal,\n\n318\n00:18:26.802 --> 00:18:32.152\nI'll get a 192.168.0.191, all right?\n\n319\n00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:35.760\nLooks like I missed the period there,\nso that dot right there.\n\n320\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.189\nAnd we'll do /26 here, just so we know\nwhat we are working with, all right?\n\n321\n00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:42.830\nAnd then I've got the very last one.\n\n322\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:47.414\nWell, Zach, do you remember what\nwe said all ones across all 8-bits\n\n323\n00:18:47.414 --> 00:18:51.231\nare just like our subnet mask\nif it was a full octet of ones?\n\n324\n00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:56.950\nOur Subnet masks are 255\n[CROSSTALK] he tried, that's right.\n\n325\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Remember the highest value-\n\n326\n00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:01.933\n&gt;&gt; For some reason I wanted to say 254,\n\n327\n00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:02.785\nbut yeah, 255.\n\n328\n00:19:02.785 --> 00:19:04.415\n&gt;&gt; That's all right,\nno worries, no worries.\n\n329\n00:19:04.415 --> 00:19:08.215\nSo what that means, keep in mind,\ndoesn't matter if it's a subnet mask or\n\n330\n00:19:08.215 --> 00:19:09.755\nwe're dealing with IP address, right?\n\n331\n00:19:09.755 --> 00:19:14.160\nIf you have all one bits in all\neight bit positions, right?\n\n332\n00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.620\nThat means it's 255.\n\n333\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.420\nSo I can tell,\ntaking this out of the binary back in\n\n334\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.840\nthe decimal, I can do a 192.168.0.\n\n335\n00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.400\nAnd that is .255/26.\n\n336\n00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.636\nAll right, so now we figured out\nwhat our network IDs are for\n\n337\n00:19:34.636 --> 00:19:38.520\nthe four networks that we've created.\n\n338\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.380\nWe've figured out, well,\nwhat is the broadcast address for\n\n339\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.580\nthese networks that we've created?\n\n340\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.412\nWhat is the range, all right?\n\n341\n00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:53.158\nWell, I can see that the very first range,\nand\n\n342\n00:19:53.158 --> 00:19:57.610\nI'm just going to focus on the last\noctet so we don't have a long cell here.\n\n343\n00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:59.310\nIs actually gonna be .1 right?\n\n344\n00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.400\nJust like before I can't give the .0,\nright?\n\n345\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.620\nThat 192.168.0.0,\nremember that's the network ID.\n\n346\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.090\nEverybody uses that, so\n\n347\n00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:13.085\nI have to have the very next address\nwhich is 192.168.0.1, right?\n\n348\n00:20:13.085 --> 00:20:16.020\nSo I know that's the starting point.\n\n349\n00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.173\nI can't give our the .63,\n\n350\n00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:21.900\nright, because we said that that's right\nhere is the broadcast address, right?\n\n351\n00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.242\nSo since I can't give out\nthe broadcast address,\n\n352\n00:20:24.242 --> 00:20:27.216\nthat means it's gonna be one\nless than the broadcast address.\n\n353\n00:20:27.216 --> 00:20:31.981\nSo that's gonna be instead of 0.63,\nit's gonna be 0.62, all right?\n\n354\n00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.320\nNow let's go ahead and let's do this for\nthe second network, right?\n\n355\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.620\nI can't give out 64.\n\n356\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.120\nAnd I can't give out 127.\n\n357\n00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.350\nSo it has to be in between.\n\n358\n00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.950\nOne more than the network ID,\none less than the broadcast, right?\n\n359\n00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.660\nAnd again,\nyou'll start to see these patterns, and\n\n360\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.910\nthat's why we wanna go over these and over\nthese, so that you can get these right.\n\n361\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.540\nAnd then what we'll do here at the end is\nwe'll kind of simulate a question that\n\n362\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.090\nmaybe something of the like\nyou might see on the exam.\n\n363\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.128\nSo, if I'm one more than\nwhatever the network ID is,\n\n364\n00:20:58.128 --> 00:21:00.232\nthat means it's going to be .65.\n\n365\n00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:04.949\nOne less because I can't\nuse the broadcast address\n\n366\n00:21:04.949 --> 00:21:09.236\nmeans it's going to be .126, all right?\n\n367\n00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:13.197\nSo I've got from .165, .66, .67,\n\n368\n00:21:13.197 --> 00:21:16.871\nall the way up to .126 in the last octet.\n\n369\n00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:18.241\nAll right, so next one.\n\n370\n00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:25.270\n192.168.01.128, can't give that out,\nso we know it's one more than that.\n\n371\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.275\nIt's gotta be .129, all right?\n\n372\n00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:31.207\nAnd the broadcast address is\n192.168.0.192, all right?\n\n373\n00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:36.229\nI can't give that out, so\nit's gotta be one less than that\n\n374\n00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:42.050\nwhich means that's gonna\nmake that range .191, right?\n\n375\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.000\nAnd you know what?\n\n376\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.720\nThat is wrong.\n\n377\n00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.260\nLet me correct my typo here.\n\n378\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.800\nI want you guys to pay attention here,\nall right, guys and gals out there?\n\n379\n00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.690\nThe network ID for this network is 192.\n\n380\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.860\nLet me make sure that\nI made a mistake here.\n\n381\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.877\nThat is actually 191.\n\n382\n00:21:59.877 --> 00:22:01.320\nThat is what it should be.\n\n383\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.247\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n384\n00:22:02.247 --> 00:22:04.788\njust make sure that I correct that\nbecause I was looking at that,\n\n385\n00:22:04.788 --> 00:22:07.726\nI'm like wait a second, I have seen\nthe numbers enough, that's wrong.\n\n386\n00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:11.880\nSo I can't get 191 out because\nthat is the broadcast address.\n\n387\n00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.710\nLet's make sure we get that right.\n\n388\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.749\nSo if I am giving one more than 128,\n\n389\n00:22:17.749 --> 00:22:22.682\nthat's .129 through .190, right?\n\n390\n00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:24.283\nWe've got to make sure that\nI get that right, all right?\n\n391\n00:22:24.283 --> 00:22:27.979\nSo we have .129 to .190.\n\n392\n00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:33.607\nFor the last network,\nwe've got 192.168.0.192.\n\n393\n00:22:33.607 --> 00:22:37.929\nCan't give that out, so it's got to be\n.193 is going to be the first address,\n\n394\n00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:39.760\nall right, within this network.\n\n395\n00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.195\nThe last address, I can't give out the\n.255, so it's gotta be one less than that.\n\n396\n00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:46.938\nSo it's gonna be .254.\n\n397\n00:22:46.938 --> 00:22:51.434\nAll right, Zach, from what you\ncan see here, I've got 1, and\n\n398\n00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:54.450\n1 is included in this, right?\n\n399\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.540\n1 to 62.\n\n400\n00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.580\nso that means I got 63 addresses,\nall right?\n\n401\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.150\nSo the original question was, and\n\n402\n00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.078\nnow I am not throwing you a curve ball\nanymore that we worked past that.\n\n403\n00:23:03.078 --> 00:23:03.662\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n404\n00:23:03.662 --> 00:23:04.600\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n405\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.990\nDid I create at least three networks?\n\n406\n00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.500\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n407\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:09.920\n&gt;&gt; I did create three networks.\n\n408\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:15.980\nNow, the question is, with 63 nodes, can\nI put 50 nodes on each of these networks?\n\n409\n00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.050\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we can.\n\n410\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.200\nThat's right, very good.\n\n411\n00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.510\nSo, what you can see is that if\nI wanted to accomplish this,\n\n412\n00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.570\nand good job, too, Zach.\n\n413\n00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.850\nCuz I'm throwing these,\nthese are on the fly to him, so great job.\n\n414\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:33.150\nAll right, so I want you to remember that\non the exam, when you come to a question\n\n415\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.550\nlike this, they might ask you I need so\nmany networks and so many hosts.\n\n416\n00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.414\nRemember, once you've figured out how many\nnetworks are, that you're not done there,\n\n417\n00:23:43.414 --> 00:23:44.058\nall right?\n\n418\n00:23:44.058 --> 00:23:49.450\nRemember, I noticed that, yes, there\nare four networks, but I couldn't tell\n\n419\n00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:54.843\nwhat the range was, if I had accomplished\nthat range The amount of nodes they want\n\n420\n00:23:54.843 --> 00:24:00.263\nuntil I figure out what the network ID is\nand what the broadcast ID is, all right.\n\n421\n00:24:00.263 --> 00:24:01.106\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n422\n00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:04.190\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's important to keep that in mind.\n\n423\n00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.140\nNow let's go ahead and, I know we\ngot a few more minutes here, Zach.\n\n424\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; We're probably going to have to go into\n\n425\n00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.150\nanother part here.\n\n426\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:09.951\nBut I want to see,\n\n427\n00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:13.279\nI've got a question here that I want\nto kinda let you guys see, all right.\n\n428\n00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:16.090\nNotice that we got a question here.\n\n429\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.000\nYou're a network administrator for\ndemo.itpro.tv and you've been tasked by\n\n430\n00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.370\ndividing the network into subnets and\nyou've received the following information.\n\n431\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.721\nAll right, so\nhere is our base address, all right.\n\n432\n00:24:27.721 --> 00:24:29.950\nAnd again,\nwe're just giving you this as an example.\n\n433\n00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.720\nIt's a /24, all right.\n\n434\n00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:39.020\nYou need five networks with 28\nhosts per network, all right.\n\n435\n00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.310\nAnd you need to provide additional\nnetworks for the future, all right.\n\n436\n00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:48.265\nWhich of the following in this list, and\nthis isn't a question for you, Zach.\n\n437\n00:24:48.265 --> 00:24:49.884\nDon't worry, I won't do that to you.\n\n438\n00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.432\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Wes.\n\n439\n00:24:51.432 --> 00:24:55.727\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which of the following would accomplish\n\n440\n00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:57.460\nthis task?\n\n441\n00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.934\nAll right, now this might be\na question that they ask you, right.\n\n442\n00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:08.330\nThey're gonna ask you, hey,\nyou gotta know that a /24, what is it?\n\n443\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.130\nAll right, well let's look at answer that\nI can tell you right away I know is wrong,\n\n444\n00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.298\nall right.\n\n445\n00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:14.938\nNotice what /24 is, right.\n\n446\n00:25:14.938 --> 00:25:16.257\nThat's 24 1 bits.\n\n447\n00:25:16.257 --> 00:25:23.244\nWell notice this last answer here,\n8 plus 8 plus 8 is 24.\n\n448\n00:25:23.244 --> 00:25:25.930\nI know that can't be the right answer.\n\n449\n00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that doesn't look right.\n\n450\n00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.570\n&gt;&gt; Why isn't the right answer?\n\n451\n00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.940\nBecause it's the same thing that\nwe already have to start with.\n\n452\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.560\nNotice it is already what\nthey've given us to start with.\n\n453\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.340\nSo right away I can eliminate this\nanswer as being the right answer,\n\n454\n00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.930\nand you can do that on the exam.\n\n455\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:47.010\nA lot of times what you'll see is, if you\ndon't know right away what the answer is,\n\n456\n00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.680\nlook for possible wrong answers.\n\n457\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.920\nRight away eliminate it,\nget it out of your mind.\n\n458\n00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.680\nThat's not what you want.\n\n459\n00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.808\nBut then you also have to know,\nlike we've told you here and\n\n460\n00:25:56.808 --> 00:26:01.620\nwe've shown you in this,\nas we've been working through this.\n\n461\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.050\nRemember what I told you\nthose ranges were, right.\n\n462\n00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:13.272\nThe ranges here are 128, 192,\n224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255.\n\n463\n00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:14.289\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n464\n00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, you have to know that, right.\n\n465\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.310\nI have to know how many\nbits that makes because,\n\n466\n00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:24.120\nrelated to this question, I don't have\na nice even dividing line, all right.\n\n467\n00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:30.642\nWell let's figure out this next answer,\nanother possible wrong answer, all right.\n\n468\n00:26:30.642 --> 00:26:36.364\nNotice I have a 255.255.255.255.\n\n469\n00:26:36.364 --> 00:26:41.477\nWell what that means is it masks out and\nit says, every single bit if I\n\n470\n00:26:41.477 --> 00:26:46.890\nwas to apply this subnet mass,\nevery single bit would be a network bit.\n\n471\n00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.670\nThat would be zero hosts.\n\n472\n00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.630\nNo hosts on the network at all.\n\n473\n00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.780\nSo I can tell right away that\nthat's gotta be wrong, all right.\n\n474\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n475\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.730\nwhat we have to do is eliminate this,\nand we get that out of there, all right.\n\n476\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.280\nSo now I'm down to two possible\nright answers, all right.\n\n477\n00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:07.820\nWell, how am I gonna go about\ntackling the last two answers?\n\n478\n00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.840\nBecause it looks like either\none of these might be right.\n\n479\n00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.320\nWell, I gotta figure out how many bits,\nright, these are.\n\n480\n00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.266\nAnd if you can remember,\nlike I've said before,\n\n481\n00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:21.633\nif you write down, you'll have time\nthat once you push start on the exam.\n\n482\n00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:26.299\n[CROSSTALK] You can write stuff down,\nright, or you can do what I said.\n\n483\n00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:32.494\nMemorize the eight bits on your fingers,\n128, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255.\n\n484\n00:27:32.494 --> 00:27:34.620\nThat's your eight bits, right?\n\n485\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.418\nI can figure out that, hey,\nI know given this question, that 224.\n\n486\n00:27:40.418 --> 00:27:42.260\nWhat is that?\n\n487\n00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.300\n128, 192, 224, that's 3 bits.\n\n488\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.260\n&gt;&gt; Three bits.\n\n489\n00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.180\n&gt;&gt; So I can tell right away\nthat this has gotta be a /, and\n\n490\n00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:57.290\nagain I have 8 plus 8 plus 8, right, is\n24 plus 3 bits must be a /27, all right.\n\n491\n00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.920\nWell, what's the 248?\n\n492\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.480\nAgain, you're talking about this chart.\n\n493\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.060\nYou can do it by the chart or\nyou can kinda memorize it if you will.\n\n494\n00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.500\nAnd again, I want you to see\n248 is actually 5 1 bits.\n\n495\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.550\nSo I know that I have 24 already.\n\n496\n00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.760\nLike we've told you before here, right.\n\n497\n00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.390\nPlus 5 is gonna give me a /29, all right.\n\n498\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:25.440\nNow I have to figure out,\nwell which of these, /27 or /29,\n\n499\n00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:32.040\nis going to accomplish 5 networks\nwith 28 hosts, all right.\n\n500\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.760\nSo let's go back one more time\nto our subnetting, all right.\n\n501\n00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.320\nAnd what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n502\n00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.820\nwe're going to eliminate all of this.\n\n503\n00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.400\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe will eliminate all of this.\n\n504\n00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.350\nAnd we're gonna work through this problem,\nall right.\n\n505\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.310\nAnd I know it seems a little bit\nmonotonous and I understand that.\n\n506\n00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:01.720\nSo we've got, this is our address\nthat we're working with, all right.\n\n507\n00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.730\nSo this is where we're starting.\n\n508\n00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.578\nNow we gotta figure out is\nthis going to be a 209?\n\n509\n00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:11.600\nIs this gonna be a, let's see here,\ndo that one more time.\n\n510\n00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.018\nIs this gonna be a 27?\n\n511\n00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:15.144\nMake sure that's what I wrote down.\n\n512\n00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:19.536\nOr is this going to be a 29?\n\n513\n00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:23.825\nWell, I'm not exactly sure, but\nwe can work through the problem,\n\n514\n00:29:23.825 --> 00:29:27.832\nand we can kinda work this out,\nwhich is what we're here to do.\n\n515\n00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:28.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n516\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.690\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if I do a 27, right,\nthat's 3 bits, that means I'm going to\n\n517\n00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:39.380\ntake three bits and we're gonna turn\nthem into our network portion, right.\n\n518\n00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.480\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n519\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.290\nWe'll turn this into our network portion,\nall right.\n\n520\n00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.491\nThat means we're gonna move\nthis dividing line, right.\n\n521\n00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:48.121\nAnd if we move this dividing line,\n\n522\n00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:51.850\nwe end up having to move\nit over just a little bit.\n\n523\n00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.483\nSo what we'll do is we'll move\nthat line here, all right,\n\n524\n00:29:56.483 --> 00:29:59.450\nand make sure I get that\ndividing line right.\n\n525\n00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.840\nThat did not do it.\n\n526\n00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.930\nTry that one more time.\n\n527\n00:30:07.974 --> 00:30:09.210\nNope, that didn't work either.\n\n528\n00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.869\nWe'll get this right eventually,\nI swear [LAUGH].\n\n529\n00:30:12.869 --> 00:30:17.100\nAll right, that's what I want and\nwe'll go ahead and,\n\n530\n00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.270\nagain, just kind of manipulate\nthis a little bit here.\n\n531\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.215\nNow this becomes the dividing line for\nmy network,\n\n532\n00:30:23.215 --> 00:30:25.348\nif we were using these bits, right.\n\n533\n00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:29.048\nAnd we're going to turn these into ones,\nright, and\n\n534\n00:30:29.048 --> 00:30:32.100\nwe gonna work with that last octet, right.\n\n535\n00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.763\nAll right, so what are the possibilities\nthat I have now, all right?\n\n536\n00:30:37.763 --> 00:30:43.640\nWell you could go through the process\nof going 0 0 0, which we will.\n\n537\n00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.097\nAnd then we can do 1, right, 0 0.\n\n538\n00:30:46.097 --> 00:30:52.660\nWe can do 1 1 0, and\nyes we can do 1 0 0, and then 1 0 1.\n\n539\n00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.652\nBoy isn't this fun, right.\n\n540\n00:30:56.652 --> 00:31:01.882\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and it looks like we're\n\n541\n00:31:01.882 --> 00:31:08.520\ngonna need a few more\ncells formatted here.\n\n542\n00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.430\nMake them a little bit easier to read.\n\n543\n00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:17.978\nAll right, so now we have one1 1 0,\nand there's 1 0.\n\n544\n00:31:17.978 --> 00:31:21.807\nAnd then last but but not least, 1 1.\n\n545\n00:31:21.807 --> 00:31:27.143\nAll right, so the question is,\nright off the bat,\n\n546\n00:31:27.143 --> 00:31:31.250\nall right, do I have my five networks?\n\n547\n00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:37.216\nWell I have one, I have two, three,\n\n548\n00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:44.400\nfour, five, six, seven, all right.\n\n549\n00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.585\nSo I have seven networks, right.\n\n550\n00:31:45.585 --> 00:31:49.003\nJust like I threw that curve ball at Zach,\nI said, well, wait a second here.\n\n551\n00:31:49.003 --> 00:31:51.165\n.Do I have my five networks,\nand we'll stop there.\n\n552\n00:31:51.165 --> 00:31:52.136\nDo I have my five networks?\n\n553\n00:31:52.136 --> 00:31:53.377\nI won't throw a curve ball at you.\n\n554\n00:31:53.377 --> 00:31:54.065\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do.\n\n555\n00:31:54.065 --> 00:31:58.423\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now what we need to do is\nfigure out Will any one of these five\n\n556\n00:31:58.423 --> 00:32:02.950\nnetworks, and you can see there's\nmore than five networks, right?\n\n557\n00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.840\nThere's one, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, and I'm missing one,\n\n558\n00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.880\nthere should be eight,\nif I remember right.\n\n559\n00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.630\nLet me figure out where I am missing,\nyeah okay, so\n\n560\n00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:19.490\nif I take this whole thing, and\nI'm just gonna move it down one.\n\n561\n00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.720\nMight see that we are missing,\ntechnically missing one here,\n\n562\n00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.240\nI was like, well,\nthere's supposed to be eight.\n\n563\n00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.219\nAnd it's just cuz I've worked with it\nenough to know I must be missing one, and\n\n564\n00:32:28.219 --> 00:32:29.440\nwhat am I missing here?\n\n565\n00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.803\nI'm missing a 0, oops,\n0 and that is what a one,\n\n566\n00:32:34.803 --> 00:32:41.020\nI see, I see what I'm missing,\nI'm missing a 1 0, right.\n\n567\n00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.594\nSo that's the other one that we were\nmissing and now that's one, two, three,\n\n568\n00:32:45.594 --> 00:32:48.510\nfour, five, six, oops, get away, get away.\n\n569\n00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.589\n[LAUGH] Let's try that again, one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven, and\n\n570\n00:32:52.589 --> 00:32:54.620\neight so we got eight networks, right?\n\n571\n00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.390\nWe got our five, I had to make sure,\nI'm missing one there, all right.\n\n572\n00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.780\nLike I said if you work with it enough\nyou'll kinda know right away what\n\n573\n00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.930\nthe number of networks are, all right.\n\n574\n00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.150\nNow what I need to do is I need\nto figure one, two, three, four,\n\n575\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.430\nfive bits, all right.\n\n576\n00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:15.023\nWith five bits can I get,\nwhat was the question again?\n\n577\n00:33:15.023 --> 00:33:16.227\nCan I get 28 nodes?\n\n578\n00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:20.551\nAll right, well if you have a /27 and\n\n579\n00:33:20.551 --> 00:33:24.088\nyou have 5 bits for your nodes,\n\n580\n00:33:24.088 --> 00:33:29.740\nthat gives you essentially\n30 nodes available.\n\n581\n00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.470\n32 is your number, right,\n32 is how many you get.\n\n582\n00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:35.910\nBut you can't use the first and\nyou can't use the last, so\n\n583\n00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.980\nI don't get 32, I actually get 30.\n\n584\n00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.670\nAt this point right here,\nI know that's the right answer.\n\n585\n00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:47.212\nI don't have to go any\nfather in the subnetting\n\n586\n00:33:47.212 --> 00:33:53.322\nbecause I now know that\na /27 gives me 8 networks\n\n587\n00:33:53.322 --> 00:33:58.320\nwith 30 nodes per network, all right.\n\n588\n00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.750\nAnd, essentially,\nthe question was 5 networks,\n\n589\n00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:08.110\n28 nodes per network, you need to provide\nadditional networks for the future.\n\n590\n00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.680\nSo I get my five networks,\n\n591\n00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.740\nI've got three additional networks,\neight total for the future.\n\n592\n00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.915\nAnd looking at the node portion,\nI can see that I have enough bits,\n\n593\n00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:25.655\n5 bits for the nodes gives\nmean 32 total possibilities,\n\n594\n00:34:25.655 --> 00:34:30.705\ntake away the first and the last,\nI get my 30 nodes in my addressable range.\n\n595\n00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:33.241\nSo, it meets the 20 nodes for\nthe question.\n\n596\n00:34:33.241 --> 00:34:37.988\nSo, I can tell right away that this\ncan't be the right answer either\n\n597\n00:34:37.988 --> 00:34:43.000\nbecause of the fact that well,\n29 would give me 2 bits less, right.\n\n598\n00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.500\nAnd if that's two bits less that would\nbe three bits total for the node.\n\n599\n00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.560\nAnd if we're talking about three bits,\n\n600\n00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.990\nthen you know what you get,\nyou get four hosts.\n\n601\n00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.570\nAnd as you start to do this more and more,\nyou'll see where those numbers come up.\n\n602\n00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.500\nSo just keep that in mind that\nthis is another example, but\n\n603\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.540\nI tell you what,\nwe got to do [LAUGH] a lot more, right?\n\n604\n00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.150\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We need to get into things like\n\n605\n00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.820\nvariable length subnet masking,\nor variable length subnet masks.\n\n606\n00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.460\nSo we're probably gonna have to go\ninto a part four on this one, and\n\n607\n00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.460\nwe'll come back in that part four and\nwe'll wrap up some\n\n608\n00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.030\nof the additional concepts that we\ncouldn't take care of in the trilogy.\n\n609\n00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.260\n&gt;&gt; Well you've done a wonderful job, Wes.\n\n610\n00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.810\nAnd the more we do this,\nthe better it's gonna become for us and\n\n611\n00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.250\nthen it'll be ingrained IPv4, and\n\n612\n00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.420\nhis classless IPv4 addressing\npart four coming your way.\n\n613\n00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.220\nMake sure you watch parts one,\ntwo, and three, and\n\n614\n00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.710\nsee everything in the CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n615\n00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.610\nAnd when you're in that course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos,\n\n616\n00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.000\nthey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n617\n00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.850\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be mighty glad you did.\n\n618\n00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:44.540\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n619\n00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n620\n00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching, see you soon.\n\n621\n00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:53.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n622\n00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:55.835\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

[CROSSTALK]\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.710\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.739\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.560\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTia and Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.400\nThis episode is classless\nIPv4 addressing Part 4.\n\n9\n00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.000\nAnd Wes Bryan,\nis here once again to take us through it.\n\n10\n00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.600\nWes, great to have you here, thanks.\n\n11\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.850\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.670\nYeah, this is the never ending episode.\n\n13\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.500\nBut there's a lot of concepts\nthat we have to talk about.\n\n14\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.736\nEspecially when it comes\nto things like subnetting.\n\n15\n00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.131\nWe talk about things like classless\ninter-domain, routing, notation,\n\n16\n00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:42.168\nsider notation.\n\n17\n00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:46.056\nSo we've actually looked at a lot of\ndifferent things here as we've gone\n\n18\n00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:47.530\nthrough these four parts.\n\n19\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.820\nSo if you're not aware of some of those\ntopics you can definitely go back and\n\n20\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.890\nwatch the first three parts.\n\n21\n00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.696\nAnd then, come back here and\njoin us in Part 4.\n\n22\n00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.950\nBecause this is really\ngonna be a continuation.\n\n23\n00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.090\nAnd we're picking up\nright where we left off.\n\n24\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.640\nIn fact, if you remember in the last part,\nthe last episode right at the end,\n\n25\n00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.951\nif we could take a look at the question.\n\n26\n00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:10.213\nWe were looking at a couple of a few\nanswers that you could potentially see on\n\n27\n00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:11.160\nthe exam.\n\n28\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.896\nAnd we noted it down to this being the\nright answer that if we needed 5 networks,\n\n29\n00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.886\n20 hosts per network, right?\n\n30\n00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:24.989\nWhat kind of slash notation or subnet masK\nwould we need with the base information if\n\n31\n00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:30.473\n209.123.221.0, and\nwe provided that, right?\n\n32\n00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:36.591\nWe found out that a subnet\nmask 255.255.255.224 or\n\n33\n00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:44.620\njust a /27 would give us, and we went\nback over to our trusty Excel sheet here.\n\n34\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.030\nAnd we looked at borrowing those\nthree bits right, 224 is in that\n\n35\n00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.030\nlast octet would give us 8 networks and\nthen we counted the host bits up, right?\n\n36\n00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.720\nWe said, okay if we've got a certain\namount of host bits, right?\n\n37\n00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.670\nFive of those host bits if we\ndid the math on that, right?\n\n38\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.500\nWe come out here to our calculator, and\nlet me go ahead and just change this to\n\n39\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.760\na scientific calculator, and\nwe do a two to the power of five.\n\n40\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.110\nWe see that that gives\nus 32 possibilities.\n\n41\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.620\nRemember, we cannot we cannot give\nthe first and the last address, so\n\n42\n00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.480\nthat's 30 overall hosts that would be on\neach of these 8 networks that we created.\n\n43\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.950\nSo, we did accomplish our goal, right?\n\n44\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.190\nWe have two extra addresses per network,\nright.\n\n45\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.970\n28 hosts is what we needed.\n\n46\n00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.250\nWe got 30, so we have done\nthe first part of the question.\n\n47\n00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.161\nNow, I kind of added onto this question\nbecause there might be some other things\n\n48\n00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.483\nthat they ask you in the context of\njust general sub netting to see if you\n\n49\n00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:42.171\nunderstand where the broadcast and\nthe network IDs stand.\n\n50\n00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.984\nAnd then you can find out if an address\nis actually addressable within a certain\n\n51\n00:02:45.984 --> 00:02:49.530\nnetwork, so we want to go ahead and\nwe kind of want to move into that next.\n\n52\n00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.440\nSo, the next part of the question,\nwe're gonna ask here is well what\n\n53\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.800\nare the individual network, or\nexcuse me, what are the network ids for\n\n54\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.730\nthe individual networks that\nwe've created, all right?\n\n55\n00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.480\nAnd then, we'll come back and\nwe're gonna look at a couple other things.\n\n56\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.200\nWe're gonna look at\nthe broadcast addresses.\n\n57\n00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.550\nAnd then finally, the last thing that\nwe're gonna look at is we're gonna look at\n\n58\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.520\nwhat is the addressable range for\nthe host, right?\n\n59\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.370\nThese are all types that\nyou might see on the exam.\n\n60\n00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.810\nSo we want you to be prepared, and we want\nyou to have a clear understanding of that.\n\n61\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.833\nSo, remember that we said if we needed\nto find out what network IDs are,\n\n62\n00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:26.470\nall we have to do is take these\nsix networks that we've created.\n\n63\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.140\nRemember, we can go ahead and we are\nworking with this, oops, sorry about that.\n\n64\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.648\nThis side are notation right here, right?\n\n65\n00:03:37.648 --> 00:03:41.315\n209.123.221.0/27 and\nthat gave us these networks right here.\n\n66\n00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:44.373\nAnd remember that I told you that once\nyou know what your network bits are.\n\n67\n00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:47.675\nYou've got a certain amount of network\nbits that are just going to stay the same.\n\n68\n00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:50.285\nLike I know the first 3255's all ones.\n\n69\n00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:52.555\nI don't have to worry about\nanything within that range.\n\n70\n00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:53.923\nI just have to focus on that 224.\n\n71\n00:03:53.923 --> 00:03:57.732\nWell, once I've established that\nthose three bits are now part of\n\n72\n00:03:57.732 --> 00:03:59.024\nthe network portion,\n\n73\n00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:03.900\nnow all I have to do is come back here to\nthe host portion right our dividing line.\n\n74\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.490\nAnd just basically put 0's in\nevery one of these fields, and\n\n75\n00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.570\nwhat that'll do is that will show\nme what our network IDs are, right?\n\n76\n00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.440\nAnd then we take these out of binary,\nwhich we're gonna do.\n\n77\n00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.709\nWe're gonna do this for\nevery one of the networks here again.\n\n78\n00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.549\nI'll give you multiple examples and\nthen what we want you to do here is,\n\n79\n00:04:24.549 --> 00:04:27.749\nas you are practising this,\nin getting ready for the exam,\n\n80\n00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:31.250\nwe definitely want you to be\npractising this as well at home.\n\n81\n00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.830\nBut this should give you plenty of\nexamples that you can be on board with,\n\n82\n00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.020\nand again like I said,\nshould make it easier for\n\n83\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.710\nyou should they ask you on the exam.\n\n84\n00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.040\nSo, now that we've got our 0's in\nthe host or known portion filled out.\n\n85\n00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.080\nRemember, that it's just a matter\nof taking these numbers and\n\n86\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.580\nputting them back in decimal form, and\nthen attaching them to that last octet.\n\n87\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.520\nBecause that last octet is really\nwhere's the actions at, right?\n\n88\n00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.323\nOctet isolation,\nif I'm worried about subnetting,\n\n89\n00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:03.680\nI'm only gonna focus on the octet that\nwe're actually borrowing bits, right?\n\n90\n00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.700\nSo, we can take this out and we can see\nthat the first network ID, if you will,\n\n91\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.280\nis going to be, what is it gonna be?\n\n92\n00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.161\nIt's gonna be 209.123.0,\nI missed one octet,\n\n93\n00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:24.782\nsorry, 123.221.0 /27, right?\n\n94\n00:05:24.782 --> 00:05:27.800\nSo that's always gonna be the first start,\nright?\n\n95\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.130\nThat is essentially where you\nstart with any kind of subnetting,\n\n96\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.855\nyou're gonna at least have that very\nfirst base address, which is 0.\n\n97\n00:05:36.855 --> 00:05:37.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n98\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.170\n&gt;&gt; Then we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna move to the next octet, right?\n\n99\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.200\nAnd we have to figure out.\n\n100\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.600\nWell, what is this next octet?\n\n101\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.272\nWell, I can kinda see that since there's\nonly a 1 in the 32 bit position,\n\n102\n00:05:49.272 --> 00:05:52.560\nthat place value,\nwell that's gonna be the number.\n\n103\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.440\nCuz to take it out from the binary to\nthe decimal we just add up all the 1s.\n\n104\n00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.170\nWell I've got 1,\n1 bit right in the 32 place value, right?\n\n105\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.930\nSo that's gonna be 209.123.221.32,\nand /27.\n\n106\n00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.613\nAll right,\nnow we're gonna go to the next octet,\n\n107\n00:06:10.613 --> 00:06:16.318\nwe're gonna say,\nwell what's the network ID for this one?\n\n108\n00:06:16.318 --> 00:06:20.190\nRemember, all 0's in the host bit,\ntake this out of the binary,\n\n109\n00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.940\nput it back into the decimal,\nand when we have 209.123.221 and\n\n110\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.680\nin this case it is .64/, again, 27.\n\n111\n00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.763\nJust to keep with our notation.\n\n112\n00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:36.770\nAll right, so then the next one\nthat we have here is going to be,\n\n113\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.540\nwell, notice that there are two bits,\nright?\n\n114\n00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.300\nWe have the 64 and we have the 32.\n\n115\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.430\nSo, if you need to,\nyou can always get out the calculator.\n\n116\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.030\nRemember, that even on\nthe exam by the way.\n\n117\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.600\nLet me let you know that they\nwill bring you a calculator out.\n\n118\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.930\nSo, if you don't know to have\nthat calculator ready to go\n\n119\n00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.020\nthen you can add your 64 and\nyour 32 we get 96.\n\n120\n00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.826\nSo I can see the next octet, or\n\n121\n00:07:03.826 --> 00:07:08.654\nthe next network if you\nwill is gonna be 209, and\n\n122\n00:07:08.654 --> 00:07:15.080\nthis'll be 123.221, and\nagain .96, and then /27.\n\n123\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.478\nAll right,\nmoving down to the next network, right,\n\n124\n00:07:19.478 --> 00:07:23.690\nwe're gonna do a 209.123.221.0.\n\n125\n00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.960\nNotice that there is only a single\n0 in the very first bit position\n\n126\n00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.750\nmaking that 128 for\nthat network's network ID, if you will.\n\n127\n00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.901\nNow again, following down,\nnotice that there is a pattern here,\n\n128\n00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:38.714\nnothing is really changing, right?\n\n129\n00:07:38.714 --> 00:07:41.924\nNow we have got a 128 and a 32.\n\n130\n00:07:41.924 --> 00:07:45.833\nAnd I'm not even going to prove\nto you how bad my math is.\n\n131\n00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:49.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we are doing 128 + 32 and\n\n132\n00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.345\nthat give us 160.\n\n133\n00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:57.553\nSo we tell the network ID for\nthe next network is 209.123.221 And\n\n134\n00:07:57.553 --> 00:08:01.145\nagain, let me just double-check myself.\n\n135\n00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:02.301\nAs a-\n&gt;&gt; 160.\n\n136\n00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.273\n&gt;&gt; 160, thank you there, Mr. Zach.\n\n137\n00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:04.898\nAppreciate it.\n\n138\n00:08:04.898 --> 00:08:07.110\nAnd again a /27.\n\n139\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.840\nAll right, now, moving on down,\nwe've got two bits.\n\n140\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.000\nYou should recognize these if you've\nbeen following along with us.\n\n141\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.350\nYou should recognize these as one of\nthe those valid subnet mask ranges, right?\n\n142\n00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.533\nBecause there's two one-bits here.\n\n143\n00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.563\nRemember, 128, 192.\n\n144\n00:08:21.563 --> 00:08:23.078\nSo I don't even have\nto count this one out.\n\n145\n00:08:23.078 --> 00:08:31.083\nI can see that this is\n192.209.123.221.192/27.\n\n146\n00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:33.905\nAnd then the last one is,\nwell, three bits, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:33.905 --> 00:08:35.353\nWe look at the three bits there.\n\n148\n00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:37.028\nWell, I can tell that that's 224.\n\n149\n00:08:37.028 --> 00:08:40.582\nAgain, because counting those\nconsecutive bits, those continuous bits,\n\n150\n00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:42.558\nyou'll start to see that pattern come up.\n\n151\n00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Back to the chart that you made.\n\n152\n00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.849\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n153\n00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:53.897\nSo it's 209.123.221.224/27.\n\n154\n00:08:53.897 --> 00:08:58.441\nAll right, so we've got, one, two,\nthree, four, five, six, seven,\n\n155\n00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:02.140\neight networks,\nremember there's eight possibilities.\n\n156\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.220\nAnd how did we come up with\nthose eight possibilities?\n\n157\n00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.700\nWell, you can do the math,\nif you want, on that one as well.\n\n158\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.970\nAnd if we bring back our calculator and\nwe clear this out,\n\n159\n00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.790\nwe could do 2 to the power of 3,\nthose 4 bits.\n\n160\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.556\nAnd notice that we have 8 right there.\n\n161\n00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.831\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n&gt;&gt; So you can see it's always\n\n162\n00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:18.720\nan exponential value.\n\n163\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.160\nJust 2 to the power of how\never many bits you have.\n\n164\n00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.120\nIf you're talking about network bits,\nthat's how many networks you have.\n\n165\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.870\nTwo to the power of how ever many bits.\n\n166\n00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:30.100\nIf you're talking hosts, that's how many\nhosts you have, and then minus the two.\n\n167\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.746\nOne of those two being the network\nIDs that we're working on right now.\n\n168\n00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:36.722\nNow we also have to look at the next\npart of the question, all right?\n\n169\n00:09:36.722 --> 00:09:39.615\nIf we know now what the network IDs are,\n\n170\n00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:44.360\nthe next part of this would be\nwhat are the broadcast addresses?\n\n171\n00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.220\nAnd let me go ahead and\n\n172\n00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.840\nuse a little bit better English there so\nmy math teacher isn't mad at me.\n\n173\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.657\nOr not math teacher, that's probably\nwhy he's mad at me and I can't spell.\n\n174\n00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.084\nI was in math-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] English.\n\n175\n00:09:53.084 --> 00:09:54.454\n&gt;&gt; That's right, my English teacher.\n\n176\n00:09:54.454 --> 00:09:58.798\n[LAUGH] So what are the broadcast\naddresses for these networks?\n\n177\n00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:03.251\nWell, remember what we're gonna do\nhere is we're just gonna take every\n\n178\n00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:05.880\nsingle one of these place values, right?\n\n179\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.426\nAnd we're just gonna essentially\nmake every one of them ones, right?\n\n180\n00:10:10.426 --> 00:10:17.834\nSo we'll do that, and\nwe'll make those ones one and again one.\n\n181\n00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:19.870\nYou can kinda see the pattern here.\n\n182\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.100\nBecause in the host bits,\nall ones say, hey,\n\n183\n00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.700\nthat lets me know right away that that\nis going to be your broadcast address.\n\n184\n00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.558\nNotice that all we have to do now, again,\nthat's why these place values are so\n\n185\n00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:34.377\nimportant.\n\n186\n00:10:34.377 --> 00:10:40.371\nAnd if you can remember them,\nwrite them down.\n\n187\n00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:42.683\nThe moment the test starts,\nwrite this little chart down.\n\n188\n00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.366\nAnd you should be doing well for\n\n189\n00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:48.194\nthe exam when it comes to figuring\nout problems like this, all right?\n\n190\n00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:53.155\nSo now that we know what the network\nIDs are, let's go ahead and\n\n191\n00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:58.411\nwe'll take these out of the binary and\nconvert them into decimal.\n\n192\n00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:01.007\nAll right,\nour very first one is gonna be 209.\n\n193\n00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:05.892\nIf you want, you could always do the math\nhere with me at home, you could pause it.\n\n194\n00:11:05.892 --> 00:11:11.857\nBut the very first one is\ngonna be 209.123.221.31.\n\n195\n00:11:11.857 --> 00:11:15.238\nAnd again, we'll do our /27 just so\nwe keep it consistent.\n\n196\n00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:23.340\nThe next one is gonna\nbe 209.123.221.63/27.\n\n197\n00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:32.347\nAll right, you'll see 209.123.221.95 for\nthe next one.\n\n198\n00:11:32.347 --> 00:11:38.060\nAnd again, if you wanted to add this up,\nyou would see that comes out to 95.\n\n199\n00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.357\nAll right, so that is the broadcast\naddress for that network.\n\n200\n00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:45.751\nAnd again,\nthe next one's going to be 209.123.221.\n\n201\n00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:50.662\nAnd that next one is gonna be .127 and\n\n202\n00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:53.413\nagain /27 as well.\n\n203\n00:11:53.413 --> 00:12:01.843\nAll right, our next one,\nthe broadcast address will be 209.123.221.\n\n204\n00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:08.293\nAnd that will be .50159 and again /27.\n\n205\n00:12:08.293 --> 00:12:10.312\nAgain, just moving down the list here.\n\n206\n00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:14.460\nLike I said, if you need to pause this,\nyou need to compare those bits and\n\n207\n00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:17.657\nyou actually want to add them up,\nby all means go ahead.\n\n208\n00:12:17.657 --> 00:12:25.262\nThe next one, it is going to be a .191 in\nthe last octet for that broadcast address.\n\n209\n00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:33.257\nThen we have 209.123.221.-\n&gt;&gt; 223.\n\n210\n00:12:33.257 --> 00:12:35.100\n&gt;&gt; 223, you got it, very good.\n\n211\n00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.940\nThank you there, Zach, do appreciate it.\n\n212\n00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.210\nAnd the last one, of course,\nis gonna be the highest one in the list.\n\n213\n00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.992\nAll right, all ones, and\n\n214\n00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:49.017\nby now we know all ones is the largest\nnumber that you can have in any octet.\n\n215\n00:12:49.017 --> 00:12:53.403\nSo that is going to be 255,\nand again, /27.\n\n216\n00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:56.824\nSo what we've done is we've\nsolved the problem of,\n\n217\n00:12:56.824 --> 00:12:59.010\nwhat are my network IDs, right?\n\n218\n00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.870\nSo here are our network IDs right here.\n\n219\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:07.499\nThese let us know what networks\nthese computers would belong in.\n\n220\n00:13:07.499 --> 00:13:10.921\nAnd these are our broadcasts addresses.\n\n221\n00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:13.780\nThese let us know,\non each of this networks,\n\n222\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.500\nwhere we send our broadcast\ncommunications, all right?\n\n223\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.090\nSo the last part of this question\nhere just to kinda take this into\n\n224\n00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.800\ncompletion is what is the addressable\nrange of the host, right?\n\n225\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.126\nNow that we know what we can't give,\nright?\n\n226\n00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:30.905\nRemember, we can't give\nthe first possibility.\n\n227\n00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:34.600\nI don't even wanna call it an address cuz\nthe first possibility's the network ID.\n\n228\n00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.230\nThe last one is an address.\n\n229\n00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.260\nBut we still can't give that out\ncuz that's a broadcast address.\n\n230\n00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.310\nNow we have to figure out,\nwell, what is in between?\n\n231\n00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.610\nAll right, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n232\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.960\nKeep in mind that it's kinda simple.\n\n233\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.340\nPlus one on the network IDs.\n\n234\n00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.319\nMinus one on the broadcast gives\nyou what your addressable range is.\n\n235\n00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:54.691\nAnd we're gonna do this\nlike we did before.\n\n236\n00:13:54.691 --> 00:14:01.266\nWe'll do .1 through .30, all right?\n\n237\n00:14:01.266 --> 00:14:04.150\nAnd there is our 30 computers.\n\n238\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.076\nNow, the next one that we are going\nto look at, we will look,\n\n239\n00:14:09.076 --> 00:14:13.880\nwe've got 32 for our network ID, and\nagain, 63 for a broadcast address.\n\n240\n00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.538\nAnd again, that's in that last octet.\n\n241\n00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:22.596\nSo that is going to be .33 to .62,\nall right?\n\n242\n00:14:22.596 --> 00:14:29.077\nAnd then moving down the list, we have .65\nand again that's cuz it's one past .64.\n\n243\n00:14:29.077 --> 00:14:32.088\n.64 is the network ID.\n\n244\n00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:38.070\nAnd then .94 for\nthose nodes on that network.\n\n245\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.899\nThen we have .97 though .126.\n\n246\n00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:51.166\nFor the next network, you'll see we\nhave .129 to link UXL, but you're wrong.\n\n247\n00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] To .158.\n\n248\n00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:55.566\n&gt;&gt; It's interfering.\n\n249\n00:14:55.566 --> 00:14:56.080\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n250\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.655\nIt really wants to help me, but it would\nhelp me just by staying out of my way.\n\n251\n00:15:01.655 --> 00:15:05.765\n[LAUGH] .161 for\nthe next network is the first address.\n\n252\n00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:10.643\nAnd then the last address that\nwe can give the host is .190.\n\n253\n00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.977\nAgain, .190.\n\n254\n00:15:12.977 --> 00:15:16.106\nIf I can get my cursor to\nget in the right spot there.\n\n255\n00:15:16.106 --> 00:15:21.635\nSecond to last network, we've got .193,\nagain, because we can't get .192.\n\n256\n00:15:21.635 --> 00:15:22.995\nThat's the network ID.\n\n257\n00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:27.665\nThen we have 223 here, so\nwe can't give that out, so it's .222.\n\n258\n00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:32.682\nLast but not least, yes,\ndrumroll please, we're gonna say\n\n259\n00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:37.905\nlast one is .225 through all\nway up to .254, all right?\n\n260\n00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:40.580\nSo we've done three things with this,\nright?\n\n261\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.880\nWe've identified and solved for\nthe fact that on this problem,\n\n262\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.700\nyes, we did provide 5\nnetworks with 28 hosts.\n\n263\n00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.410\nWe need to provide additional networks for\nthe future.\n\n264\n00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.336\nWe accomplished that.\n\n265\n00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:55.282\nSo we've got our 5 networks,\nwe've got our 28 hosts, and\n\n266\n00:15:55.282 --> 00:15:58.352\nwe've got 3 additional networks\nthat we can use in the future.\n\n267\n00:15:58.352 --> 00:16:02.781\nThen we solve for, well,\nwhat are the network IDs for\n\n268\n00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:08.060\nthese individual networks, and\nwe solved for that as well.\n\n269\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.990\nWhat are the broadcast addresses,\nand you have to know those.\n\n270\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.840\nAnd you have to know\nhow to figure them out,\n\n271\n00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.165\nbecause they might just give you a slash\nnotation like we have right here.\n\n272\n00:16:17.165 --> 00:16:21.795\nAnd they might say,\nis this a valid host address?\n\n273\n00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:26.635\nIt is a valid address on the network,\nbut it's not a valid host address.\n\n274\n00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:30.640\nAnd you would have to know why\nthat is not a valid host address.\n\n275\n00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.110\nAnd again,\nthat's because of the fact that, well,\n\n276\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.540\nit's a broadcast address, right?\n\n277\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.700\nAnd then the last part is, we found\nin the question was, not only, what\n\n278\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.552\nare the broadcast address, but what is\nthe addressable range for the host there.\n\n279\n00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:46.720\nMy head's kind of covering it up there,\nbut there we go.\n\n280\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.150\nWhat is the addressable range for\nthe host?\n\n281\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.400\nThat was the last thing that we\nsolved for, and well, guess what?\n\n282\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.900\nWe've done that.\nYou've seen the ranges.\n\n283\n00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.720\nYou've seen how we come up with that.\n\n284\n00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.600\nSeen how we come up with it in the binary.\n\n285\n00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.110\nAnd then how we move it from the binary\nback into something that we can actually,\n\n286\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.440\nus as humans, can read a little bit easier\nback into the decimal dotted notation.\n\n287\n00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.700\nNow one of the things that\nI wanna mention to you is,\n\n288\n00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.300\nthis is what's known as\na fixed-length subnet mask.\n\n289\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.860\nAnd why I say that is,\nwe had a network range, all right?\n\n290\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.690\nAnd within this network range,\nwe're using a single subnet mask.\n\n291\n00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:24.040\nAll right, now the subnet mask is\nclassless in the fact that we don't\n\n292\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.670\nhave the three default\n\n293\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.945\nclassful subnet masks, 255.0.0.0,\n255.255.0.0, 255.255.255.0.\n\n294\n00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:36.180\nRight?\nWe've kind of manipulated the bits, but\n\n295\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.030\nit's still a single subnet mask,\nall right?\n\n296\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.350\nWell, you can go a little bit farther than\nthis, and you can actually shrink and\n\n297\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.030\ndivide the networks into the ranges and\n\n298\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:51.460\nonly those ranges that you need, even\nbasically reducing the waste even more.\n\n299\n00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.902\nLet's show you how do something known as\nvariable length subnet masking, all right?\n\n300\n00:17:56.902 --> 00:17:59.414\nVLSM, all right?\n\n301\n00:17:59.414 --> 00:18:04.178\nSo, got another question here for you,\nand let me figure out where it is.\n\n302\n00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:05.743\nOkay, so here we got a question,\nall right?\n\n303\n00:18:05.743 --> 00:18:10.778\nThe question is, you are a network\nadministrator for the Demo.ITPro.TV and\n\n304\n00:18:10.778 --> 00:18:15.059\nhave been tasked with designing\nthe network subnets for the team.\n\n305\n00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:18.855\nYou'd been given the following\ninformation, all right?\n\n306\n00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:22.752\nSo we're starting out with just a class C,\nclassful, class C,\n\n307\n00:18:22.752 --> 00:18:24.783\nprivate IP address, all right?\n\n308\n00:18:24.783 --> 00:18:29.250\nNow, notice that we have the Edutainers\ngroup is gonna need 28 hosts,\n\n309\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.473\nthe marketing group is\ngonna require 100 hosts,\n\n310\n00:18:32.473 --> 00:18:37.305\nthe sales group is gonna to require 42\nhosts, and then, last but not least,\n\n311\n00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:40.487\nthe managers group requires 9 hosts,\nall right?\n\n312\n00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:42.280\nNow, what are we required to do?\n\n313\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.465\nAll right, well we're required\nto provide the CIDR notation for\n\n314\n00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:50.346\neach subnet using the least\namount of bits for each network,\n\n315\n00:18:50.346 --> 00:18:53.650\nwith the required amount of hosts,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.290\nAnd this is what variable\nlink subnet masking does.\n\n317\n00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.870\nIt means I can start with a base address,\nand\n\n318\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.560\nI can use different subnet\nmasks to put just those hosts\n\n319\n00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.900\nwithin the subnets that I want, right,\nbearing the length of the subnet mask.\n\n320\n00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.890\nSo how would I go about doing this if\nI needed to approach this on the exam?\n\n321\n00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.180\nAll right.\n\n322\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.640\nFirst of all, we have to understand what\nthe keywords are here, and the keyword is,\n\n323\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.450\nyou need the CIDR notation, right,\nand the least amount of bits for\n\n324\n00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.490\neach network, but\nyou also have to have the required host.\n\n325\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.420\nSo we have the least waste, right?\n\n326\n00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.170\nAnd that's really what it comes\ndown to when we talk about\n\n327\n00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.030\nvariable link sublet masking, right?\n\n328\n00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.850\nIs the way to tailor make and\ncustomize your network so\n\n329\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.860\nthat you don't have additional waste,\nall right?\n\n330\n00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.800\nSo how would I attack this, all right?\n\n331\n00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.470\nWell, the first thing I need\nto do is I need to figure out,\n\n332\n00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.000\nwhat is the largest pool of\nhosts that I need, all right?\n\n333\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.130\nBecause what you wanna do is you\nwanna make sure that there aren't\n\n334\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:50.770\noverlapping networks, right?\n\n335\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:55.070\nIn variable link subnet masking,\nyou are creating individual subnets, but\n\n336\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.320\nyou really just don't mix and\nmatch, right?\n\n337\n00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.570\nThings just become crazy that way.\n\n338\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.800\nSo, what I like to do and what a lot\nof people will do is they'll start with\n\n339\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.570\nthe largest amount first and\nsay, how many nodes or how many\n\n340\n00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:13.650\nbits do I need to accomplish the largest\nnetwork or the largest subnet?\n\n341\n00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.370\nSo in that case,\nyou can see that what I would do\n\n342\n00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.000\nhere is I would rearrange\nthese right away in my head.\n\n343\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.820\nI'd say, okay,\nmarketing group requires 100 hosts.\n\n344\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.806\nThat's the biggest.\n\n345\n00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:27.110\nAll right, and\nthen the sales group requires 42 hosts, so\n\n346\n00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.880\nthat's the next one in line.\n\n347\n00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:34.440\nAll right, and then what we're gonna do\nis the Edutainers, they're third in line.\n\n348\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.250\nThey have 28 hosts that they need.\n\n349\n00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.430\nIt's kinda funny,\nsometimes we call ourselves hosts.\n\n350\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.730\nWe like to call ourselves edutainers,\ncuz we try to educate and be funny and\n\n351\n00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.460\ntry to entertain you at the same time.\n\n352\n00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.830\nBut was kinda funny,\nI originally put hosts, and\n\n353\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.570\nI was gonna say the host\ngroup needs 28 hosts.\n\n354\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.015\nWell, that was a little redundant,\nso I changed it to Edutainers here.\n\n355\n00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:56.950\n[LAUGH] All right, last but\nnot least, managers.\n\n356\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:02.870\nManagers aren't gonna be consuming a lot\nof the network hosts that we need here,\n\n357\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.530\nbut we can see,\nthis would be the first thing I do.\n\n358\n00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.400\nAgain, arranging these\nlargest to smallest.\n\n359\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.942\nNow, what I need to do is figure out,\nwell, what's my base address?\n\n360\n00:21:11.942 --> 00:21:17.130\nAll right, well,\nmy base network address is 192.168.0.0.\n\n361\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:22.980\nAll right, if you remember, with 24 bits,\nthat tells me that the first three octets,\n\n362\n00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.660\nessentially, if this was a subnet\nmask it could be 255.255.255.0.\n\n363\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.160\nThat let's me know right away\nthat the first three bits\n\n364\n00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.190\nare gonna be part of my network,\nall right?\n\n365\n00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.740\nAnd when we talk about being a part of our\nnetwork, I don't care about those bits.\n\n366\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.570\nI only care about this last octet.\n\n367\n00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.940\nSo that's where the action is, and that's\nwhere we're gonna do our subnetting.\n\n368\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:46.880\nAnd that's where we're gonna apply\na variable length subnet mask to each one\n\n369\n00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.740\nof these networks.\n\n370\n00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.510\nSo, let's start by\nfiguring out how many bits\n\n371\n00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.250\nin this network do I need to get\n100 hosts within a single subnet?\n\n372\n00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.340\nWell, if you remember here,\n\n373\n00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.808\nwe can go back to how many bits\nit requires to get this amount.\n\n374\n00:22:02.808 --> 00:22:08.960\nWell, what's kinda interesting is,\nif you notice that 128 number,\n\n375\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.370\nif I was going to make\na network with 128 nodes,\n\n376\n00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:20.380\nI would know right away by counting\nthe host bits more than anything here.\n\n377\n00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.350\nLet me go ahead and just delete our line\nhere, cuz we don't really need it right\n\n378\n00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:30.380\nhere for this example, and\nwe will do a no fill on that.\n\n379\n00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.600\nAll right, I say that, there we go.\n\n380\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.090\nAll right, so what I need to do is I\nneed to figure out, all right, in these\n\n381\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:42.390\namount of bits, what does it take\nto put 100 nodes on a network?\n\n382\n00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.160\nWell remember, I said that if you're\nlooking at network bits, it's 2 to\n\n383\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:49.510\nthe power of however many bits, gives\nyou this amount of subnets, all right?\n\n384\n00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.470\nBut we used a fixed link subnet mask,\nall right?\n\n385\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.960\nNow what I wanna do is,\nI'm gonna focus on the host bits, right?\n\n386\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.740\nI'm gonna focus on the node bits and\nsee how many bits it takes me, right?\n\n387\n00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.790\nAll right, my guess is that it's gonna be\n\n388\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.070\n7 host bits which means\n7 zeroes that I need.\n\n389\n00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.630\nI don't know.\n\n390\n00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.720\nIs that right?\n\n391\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.900\nWell, we can find out.\n\n392\n00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.220\nIf we bring up our calculator again,\nlet's go ahead, and let's do exactly that.\n\n393\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:22.780\nLet's go ahead, and do a 2,\nto the power of 7, equals, well, 128.\n\n394\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.929\nMinus our 2, right?\n\n395\n00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:26.670\nCuz we can't give two of those out.\n\n396\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.090\nThat lets me know that that is\ngoing to be how many bits I need to\n\n397\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.570\ngive me 100 hosts within a network, right?\n\n398\n00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.530\nSo what I can do here is,\nquite literally, I can say, all right,\n\n399\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.780\nwell, I know that in doing this,\nand I tell you what,\n\n400\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.340\nlet's go ahead, and\nlet me quit zooming in and out here.\n\n401\n00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.850\nTry to make it a little easier for\nyou guys to see that.\n\n402\n00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.700\nI'm gonna go ahead, and\nI'm gonna be a glutton for punishment.\n\n403\n00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.511\nWhat we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna take all of this, and\n\n404\n00:23:52.511 --> 00:23:53.355\nwe're gonna get rid of it.\n\n405\n00:23:53.355 --> 00:23:58.755\nAll right, so\nif I want to have 100 hosts, right,\n\n406\n00:23:58.755 --> 00:24:04.401\nI know that I'm gonna need a 192.168.0.0.\n\n407\n00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:08.796\n/ and that would be a /, what would it be?\n\n408\n00:24:08.796 --> 00:24:10.510\n25, right?\n\n409\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.386\nNow, why is it a /25?\n\n410\n00:24:11.386 --> 00:24:17.825\nWell, to determine how many bits\nwould I need for the host bits.\n\n411\n00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:20.477\nWell, that was 7, so that's 7 zeroes,\n\n412\n00:24:20.477 --> 00:24:24.619\nthat leaves me 1 bit that I'm\ngonna turn into, if you will, a 1.\n\n413\n00:24:24.619 --> 00:24:28.903\nAll right, and let me go ahead and just\nkinda reset some of these here real quick,\n\n414\n00:24:28.903 --> 00:24:29.537\nall right.\n\n415\n00:24:34.955 --> 00:24:39.505\nThere we go and we'll just kinda\nwork with these, all right.\n\n416\n00:24:39.505 --> 00:24:41.535\nSo /25 255.255.255 dot well, 128, right?\n\n417\n00:24:41.535 --> 00:24:46.990\nThat is one bit turned on to\nthe network there it gives me a 128.\n\n418\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:51.041\nNow, I need to figure out in how\nmany networks did that make?\n\n419\n00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:55.850\nWell, if you remember earlier, we showed\nyou how to determine that, right?\n\n420\n00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.714\nI know that that actually makes two\nnetworks, all right, so I know that\n\n421\n00:25:00.714 --> 00:25:06.812\nthe two networks that we've created\nhere is gonna be 192.168.0.0, right?\n\n422\n00:25:06.812 --> 00:25:11.030\nThat's the first network,\nright, with a /25.\n\n423\n00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.279\nI also know that the next network is\n\n424\n00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:20.417\n192.168 .0.128, right?\n\n425\n00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:24.626\nIf you remember, we actually sub netted\nthis before where we had a zero,\n\n426\n00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:28.697\nthat first network range, and\nthen the second network that we created\n\n427\n00:25:28.697 --> 00:25:32.150\nwas a 128 and that's because\nyou can do it in the binary.\n\n428\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.870\nRemember, if you're not familiar how we\ngot those possibilities and combinations.\n\n429\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:40.980\nDefinitely refer back to\nthe earlier portions of this show.\n\n430\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.755\nAll right, so these are the two\nnetworks that we have, all right.\n\n431\n00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:49.378\nAnd that lets me know that yes,\nI can get 126 hosts on that one network,\n\n432\n00:25:49.378 --> 00:25:53.838\nall right,\nwhich accomplishes my 100 hosts, right.\n\n433\n00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.780\nNow, here's where you\nstart to vary the length.\n\n434\n00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.810\nAll right, these two networks, right,\n\n435\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.702\nsince I could put these on either one\nof these networks, right, with a /25.\n\n436\n00:26:03.702 --> 00:26:07.668\nBut the problem is in\ncreating those two networks,\n\n437\n00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:12.462\nI I have to pick am I gonna put\nthose in that very first network or\n\n438\n00:26:12.462 --> 00:26:15.855\nam I gonna put them in another network?\n\n439\n00:26:15.855 --> 00:26:20.082\nWell, for me I'll go ahead and leave\nthis first network that we've created,\n\n440\n00:26:20.082 --> 00:26:22.210\nI'm gonna leave it alone, all right?\n\n441\n00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.376\nBecause what I'm gonna do now is,\n\n442\n00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:29.394\nI'm gonna take another portion of\nthat network range, 192.168.0.\n\n443\n00:26:29.394 --> 00:26:34.505\nLet's see here, I tell you what,\n\n444\n00:26:34.505 --> 00:26:40.861\nI'm getting ahead of myself, all right?\n\n445\n00:26:40.861 --> 00:26:45.960\nSo I've got my hundred host let's\nswitch back over, all right.\n\n446\n00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.860\nNotice we got our hundred host.\n\n447\n00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.350\nWell, what is the next address\nthat I wanna give, right?\n\n448\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.990\nWell, I can't give out the network of 128,\nright?\n\n449\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:00.060\nBecause that's part of this subnet mask,\nright?\n\n450\n00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.000\nSo the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna go ahead with the 62 host, or\n\n451\n00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.295\nI say 62 host, excuse me.\n\n452\n00:27:05.295 --> 00:27:09.930\n42 hosts and I'm going to figure out\nhow many bits do I need in order\n\n453\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.060\nto accomplish 42 hosts on a network,\nall right.\n\n454\n00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.240\nSo what I'm gonna do is since I'm gonna\nput those 100 computers, if you will,\n\n455\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.650\nI'm gonna put those 100 computers\nin this very first network.\n\n456\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.180\nWell, that means I still got this other\nnetwork that I can work with with.\n\n457\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:30.510\nSo If you look I can do, starting with\na 128, since I'm not using that network.\n\n458\n00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:38.110\nI could say, hey,\nI'm gonna use a 168.0.128, right?\n\n459\n00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.759\nBecause we're not using that network,\nand what I'm gonna do is\n\n460\n00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:47.420\nfigure out how many bits do I\nneed to make 42 hosts, all right?\n\n461\n00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.340\nWell, 32 isn't quite enough, right?\n\n462\n00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:55.007\nSo how many bits, how many 0s do\nI need to make those 42 hosts?\n\n463\n00:27:55.007 --> 00:27:59.140\nWell, let's count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\n\n464\n00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.420\nWell, let see.\n\n465\n00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.400\nDo I need seven?\n\n466\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.000\nWell, I don't need seven, right?\n\n467\n00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.600\nBecause if I turn just the one bit on,\nright?\n\n468\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.929\nAnd that makes the rest\nof those host bits, well,\n\n469\n00:28:07.929 --> 00:28:09.763\nthat's what we already started with.\n\n470\n00:28:09.763 --> 00:28:12.520\nSo that's a little bit,\nthat's a little bit too much, right?\n\n471\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.190\nThere's a lot of waste there,\nwe don't want any waste.\n\n472\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:20.504\nSo what about if I make two\nof these network bits does 1,\n\n473\n00:28:20.504 --> 00:28:23.830\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 bits.\n\n474\n00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.510\nDoes that give me 42 hosts?\n\n475\n00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.400\nWell, I don't know, let's go back\nto our calculator, right, and\n\n476\n00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.350\nif I do 2 to the power of 6 and\ndo an equals,\n\n477\n00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.170\nwell, that gives me 64, 62 cuz we can get\nthe first and the last address, right.\n\n478\n00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.520\nWell, is that too much waste?\n\n479\n00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.910\nWell, I'm not sure.\n\n480\n00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.270\nLet's see if I reduce it even more and\nI say not six bits.\n\n481\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.310\nLet's say five bits.\n\n482\n00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.550\nAll right, so\nwe'll do 2 to the power of 5 and\n\n483\n00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.820\nwe'll say, all right,\nlet's figure out what that equals.\n\n484\n00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.755\nWell that' equals 32 minus the 2 is 30.\n\n485\n00:28:55.755 --> 00:28:58.050\nSo that's not enough, right?\n\n486\n00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.960\nSo that is as many as I need.\n\n487\n00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.850\nSo I can't use 32, that means what I\nneed is I need those 6 bits, right?\n\n488\n00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:12.520\nAgain, because those 6 bits,\n2 to the power of 6 equals 64,\n\n489\n00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.830\nthat gives me the 42.\n\n490\n00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.650\nAnd that's the smallest I can make it\nI can't make it any more smaller or\n\n491\n00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:18.739\nI don't have enough bits.\n\n492\n00:29:18.739 --> 00:29:21.330\nI wouldn't have enough host addresses.\n\n493\n00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.118\nSo what i'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n494\n00:29:24.118 --> 00:29:26.430\nI'll do is slash 26 on that network.\n\n495\n00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.685\nStarting with the 128,\n\n496\n00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:31.255\nyou know the one we aren't using\nwith the 100 hosts, all right.\n\n497\n00:29:31.255 --> 00:29:34.537\nSo I'm gonna do a /26 here and\n\n498\n00:29:34.537 --> 00:29:40.372\nwhat that does is that gives\nme /26 will essentially,\n\n499\n00:29:40.372 --> 00:29:44.401\ngive me It gives me 62 hosts, right?\n\n500\n00:29:44.401 --> 00:29:47.980\nWe've already seen that,\ncuz we can't give the first and the last.\n\n501\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.860\nBut that also allows me\nto accomplish my goal\n\n502\n00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.960\nof 42 hosts on that network, all right.\n\n503\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.492\nSo there we go, all right.\n\n504\n00:29:54.492 --> 00:30:01.400\nWe've accomplished 42 hosts for\nthe second network.\n\n505\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.420\nWell now, we've got the third network\nthat we need to figure out how do we vary\n\n506\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:11.260\nthe length of the subnet mask yet,\nagain, to create another network, right?\n\n507\n00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.630\nWith these 28 hosts, all right.\n\n508\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:18.170\nWell, that means I have to figure out\nwhat is the broadcast address for\n\n509\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.490\nthis network, all right?\n\n510\n00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:23.340\nWell to figure out the broadcast address\nfor this network, we would have to go\n\n511\n00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.788\nthrough the process of putting, finding\nout what the dividing line is, right?\n\n512\n00:30:28.788 --> 00:30:32.270\nMaking sure that all our host bit are\nturned into ones and then we take it back\n\n513\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.185\nout of the binary and we figure out\nwhat that decimal value is, all right?\n\n514\n00:30:36.185 --> 00:30:39.805\nWell, I could tell you the broadcast\naddress with this, I know we're kind of\n\n515\n00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:43.045\nrunning out time here, but\njust to kind of move it forward and again,\n\n516\n00:30:43.045 --> 00:30:47.695\nyou can stop and\ntake the time to do this is\n\n517\n00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:52.359\nactually 192.168.0 and that is a .191.\n\n518\n00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:59.570\nAll right, 191 and\nlet me see with my calculator 128,\n\n519\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:04.090\noops, let me clear that out.\n\n520\n00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:10.038\n128 plus 62, 128, no,\nactually, plus darn it,\n\n521\n00:31:10.038 --> 00:31:17.547\nwe want to get this right eventually\n128 plus 64 equals 192, all right.\n\n522\n00:31:17.547 --> 00:31:20.608\nAnd if we take that out, all right.\n\n523\n00:31:20.608 --> 00:31:26.913\nSo basically, what I'm doing to figure\nout what the broadcast address is,\n\n524\n00:31:26.913 --> 00:31:34.320\nis essentially just going ahead and taking\nthat 128, which counts as a possibility.\n\n525\n00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.534\nSo got to kind of gotta take it off and\ndo a plus 63, and that gives me 191.\n\n526\n00:31:40.534 --> 00:31:43.560\nEasy way, very easy way to find\nthe broadcast address, right?\n\n527\n00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.020\nCuz once you know how many nodes that puts\nwithin that network, I just take 128,\n\n528\n00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.910\nyou got to subtract that one,\nbecause you'll using that possibility.\n\n529\n00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.576\nAnd then how many possibilities are left,\njust add it.\n\n530\n00:31:53.576 --> 00:31:55.204\nThat tells you what\nthe broadcast range is.\n\n531\n00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:59.364\nA little shortcut there that you can do,\nbut again that tells me that 191 is\n\n532\n00:31:59.364 --> 00:32:03.780\nthe broadcast address And remember that\nI can't give the broadcast address out,\n\n533\n00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:09.300\nthat let's me know that the network that I\nhave to work with is 192.168.0.192, right?\n\n534\n00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.010\nSo that's the next network ID, right?\n\n535\n00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:18.878\nIf this is the broadcast address for\nthat network, that means the following\n\n536\n00:32:18.878 --> 00:32:24.250\naddress has to be the network ID for\nthe next network in line, right?\n\n537\n00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.460\nAll right, so we've taken care of\nour first two networks, right?\n\n538\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.580\nWe've got our 100 host,\nwe've got our 42 host, right?\n\n539\n00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.800\nAnd we have reduced the amount of waste.\n\n540\n00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.810\nNext thing we have is, we need to figure\nout how many host bits do we need if\n\n541\n00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:44.310\nwe are going to make a network that\nneeds at least 28 hosts, all right?\n\n542\n00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.290\nSo let's figure that out.\n\n543\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:53.170\nHow many bits do I need if I'm going to\ncreate a subnet that needs 28 host, right?\n\n544\n00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.580\nWell, all I have to do is figure out\nhow many bits do I need, all right?\n\n545\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.220\nSo I'm gonna kinda take a guess here and\nI'm gonna say,\n\n546\n00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:05.430\nyou know what I think I need 1, 2, 3,\n4, 5 bits, and we did those just before.\n\n547\n00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.286\n&gt;&gt; But we did it 32 is what they.\n\n548\n00:33:07.286 --> 00:33:08.064\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n549\n00:33:08.064 --> 00:33:12.562\nSo if I look I say 2, So\nthe power of 5 equals 32, well guess what?\n\n550\n00:33:12.562 --> 00:33:16.203\nI know that's my answer\nbecause minus two gives me 30.\n\n551\n00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:18.796\n28 fits within that range, right?\n\n552\n00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:23.180\nSo what is if I have five one bits,\nand I'll just go ahead and\n\n553\n00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.769\ndo these right here.\n\n554\n00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:29.635\nIf I have five one bits, not one bits,\nexcuse me, five zero bits is what I meant.\n\n555\n00:33:29.635 --> 00:33:33.080\nI should have just left them alone.\n\n556\n00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.420\nAll right, that means that in\norder to make that happen,\n\n557\n00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.250\nI have to turn these into the one bits,\nright?\n\n558\n00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.145\nThat'll be a portion of my network, and\nthat tells me essentially what the subnet\n\n559\n00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.239\nmask is gonna be in that last octet,\nright?\n\n560\n00:33:44.239 --> 00:33:49.055\n1, 2, 3, that's 128, 192, 224 so\n\n561\n00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:55.215\nI can tell right away that in that\nlast one, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n562\n00:33:55.215 --> 00:34:00.714\nI'm gonna put 224,\nthat's 3 bits, so what is that?\n\n563\n00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:05.128\n24 plus 3,\nthat's gonna be a slash 27, right?\n\n564\n00:34:05.128 --> 00:34:07.746\nSo 192.68.0.\n\n565\n00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:12.940\nWhat'd we say, 192/27, all right.\n\n566\n00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.640\nWell, that gives me those 32 hosts.\n\n567\n00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.740\nAnd if I do like that little shortcut I\ntold you, if I turn out my calculator.\n\n568\n00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.230\nAnd I say, okay, so what's 192,\nthat's one of the possibilities.\n\n569\n00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.900\nSo I can't use 32, I gotta subtract\none of the possibilities there.\n\n570\n00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.002\nPlus 31, oops, and that is not right,\nlet's try that again.\n\n571\n00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:35.623\n192 plus 31 the remaining possibilities\ntells me that 223 on that\n\n572\n00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:39.220\nnetwork is going to be\nthe broadcast address.\n\n573\n00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.200\nAll right, and again you can take\nthe time to do the binary if you want.\n\n574\n00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.930\nBy now, you should be able to\nfigure out how to do the binary.\n\n575\n00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:49.731\nBut we know that that is\nthe broadcast address and\n\n576\n00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:54.322\nI'm trying to figure this out so I know\nwhat the next networks gonna be, right?\n\n577\n00:34:54.322 --> 00:34:59.012\nSo there's a couple of things that\nI'm doing here in doing this,\n\n578\n00:34:59.012 --> 00:35:04.044\nwhat I'm doing is also finding out\nwhat is the next network ID that I get\n\n579\n00:35:04.044 --> 00:35:08.821\nto work with, so\nthis is gonna be 192.168.0.224 and\n\n580\n00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:13.630\nthen we'll worry about this last\nnotation coming up, all right.\n\n581\n00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.640\nSo remember, 30 hosts on this network\ngives me the 28 that I need and\n\n582\n00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.480\nI have very, very little waste.\n\n583\n00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.290\nNow that I know that I'm working with\na 224 for my next network ID, all right,\n\n584\n00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.970\nI've got a few possibilities, right,\nthat we still need to work on, right?\n\n585\n00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.620\nI need a manager's group\nthat has 9 hosts in it.\n\n586\n00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.070\nNotice how we're working and\n\n587\n00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:38.910\nwe're doing this basically in a continuous\nfashion with no overlap, right?\n\n588\n00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.830\nSo each network is separate, we're working\nwith the overall pool of addresses we\n\n589\n00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.400\nhave, and we're dividing it up using\nvariable length subnet masks to put\n\n590\n00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.780\nthose nodes within the networks\nspecifically that we wanna create.\n\n591\n00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.782\nAll right, so how many bits do I need for\n9 hosts, all right?\n\n592\n00:35:54.782 --> 00:35:58.648\nWell, let's go ahead and\nlet's try 3 bits, all right?\n\n593\n00:35:58.648 --> 00:35:59.450\nLet me see.\n\n594\n00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:05.220\nSo if we do 1, 2, 3 of these host bits,\nright let's go ahead and clear our screen.\n\n595\n00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.862\nLet's do 2, excuse me,\n2 to the power of 3 equals,\n\n596\n00:36:08.862 --> 00:36:11.490\nall right well I need 9 hosts, right?\n\n597\n00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:18.340\nI've got 8 here, but I've gotta subtract\n2, well that really only gives me 6 hosts.\n\n598\n00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.923\nI know that 3 bits isn't enough, right?\n\n599\n00:36:20.923 --> 00:36:24.340\nSo let's go ahead and say,\nhow would 4 bits work?\n\n600\n00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:29.030\nWell, 2 to the power of 4 equals 16.\n\n601\n00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.760\nWell, is 16 enough?\n\n602\n00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.139\nWell minus 2, gives me 14,\nI only needed 9 hosts.\n\n603\n00:36:35.139 --> 00:36:37.990\n&gt;&gt; Little bit of waste but-\n&gt;&gt; But it's as short as we can get, right?\n\n604\n00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.160\nBecause if I go anymore,\nthen we've got 32, we're back up to 32 and\n\n605\n00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.200\nthat's way too much waste.\n\n606\n00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.700\nSo I can see that I have 4 host bits,\nright?\n\n607\n00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:52.730\n1, 2, 3, 4, then I'm gonna turn\nthe rest of these bits in 1's,\n\n608\n00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:56.090\nand that becomes the subnet mask for\nthe final network, right?\n\n609\n00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.400\nSo what's the slash notation?\n\n610\n00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:03.600\n24 is already reserved, 255.255.255, so\nI already got a number of those baselines.\n\n611\n00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:10.320\nI already got /24, so\nplus 4 is gonna be at /28, right?\n\n612\n00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.950\nWe do a /28, all right?\n\n613\n00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:16.150\nAnd well,\nthat ends up giving us our last network.\n\n614\n00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.360\nAnd that puts, what'd we say?\n\n615\n00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.170\nWe said that's 16 nodes.\n\n616\n00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.510\nSo if I wanna figure out what\nthe broadcast address is with a /28,\n\n617\n00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.434\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\ndo a 24, right?\n\n618\n00:37:27.434 --> 00:37:32.449\nPlus, I can't use 16,\ncuz 224 is one of those possibilities,\n\n619\n00:37:32.449 --> 00:37:36.093\nso plus 15, oops,\nyou gotta do the rest, Wes.\n\n620\n00:37:36.093 --> 00:37:40.360\n[LAUGH] 224 plus 15 equals 239.\n\n621\n00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.978\nSo, I can see that on this network,\nthe broadcast address is\n\n622\n00:37:44.978 --> 00:37:50.500\n168.0., what did I say?\n\n623\n00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.170\nI said it was 239.\n\n624\n00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.490\nAll right, now the reason I was showing\nyou how to figure out the broadcast IDs.\n\n625\n00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.950\nAnd we were showing you\nas well the network IDs.\n\n626\n00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.390\nIs in order to do variable\nlength subnet masking,\n\n627\n00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.250\nI gotta make sure that there's no overlap.\n\n628\n00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.260\nSo I need to know what the broadcast\naddress is in that network that I created,\n\n629\n00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.420\nso I know what the network ID is\nin the adjacent network that we're\n\n630\n00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.120\ngonna create with the next set of bits.\n\n631\n00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.020\nAll right, so that is our 16.\n\n632\n00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:23.670\nNot a lot of waste there but\nwhat we've done is essentially we've used,\n\n633\n00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.610\nif you noticed,\nwe've used a variable link subnet mask.\n\n634\n00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:35.206\nAnd let me fill this one in for\ncompleteness, 192.168.1 and\n\n635\n00:38:35.206 --> 00:38:40.440\nthat as 0.127, all right and a /25.\n\n636\n00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.420\nAll right,\nnotice what we've done here, right?\n\n637\n00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.800\nWe've varied the length\nof the subnet masks.\n\n638\n00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.330\nThere's four different subnet masks on\nthis network now, other than the /24.\n\n639\n00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:55.490\nAnd what we've done is we've tailored\nthem down to specifically what we need so\n\n640\n00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.330\nthat we don't have any of\nthe waste within our network.\n\n641\n00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:03.460\nAnd that's what VLSM does, it allows\nyou to shorten the amount of waste to,\n\n642\n00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.770\nand to more efficiently design\nyour networks the way you need to.\n\n643\n00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.430\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nthat they implemented VLSM.\n\n644\n00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.240\nNow, one of the things that I also want\nyou to keep in mind is that you have to\n\n645\n00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.000\nhave a routing protocol.\n\n646\n00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.620\nBack to our routing protocols,\ncuz remember our routing protocols\n\n647\n00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.820\nare responsible-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n648\n00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.770\n&gt;&gt; For handling IP.\n\n649\n00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.390\nYou have to have a routing protocol\nthat supports VLSM, right?\n\n650\n00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:29.150\nRIP version 2, ISIS, EIGRP, BGP, OSPF,\n\n651\n00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.540\nall of those routing protocols\nthat we've talked about.\n\n652\n00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.380\nThey support VLSM.\n\n653\n00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.411\nKeep that in mind, right?\n\n654\n00:39:34.411 --> 00:39:35.800\nSomething early, very early,\n\n655\n00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.700\nprobably outdated by now protocols that\nwe would have might not support VLSM.\n\n656\n00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:46.090\nThis has been around since the 90s so\nby now, most of our routing protocols do.\n\n657\n00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.460\nBut again,\njust make sure that on the exam,\n\n658\n00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.340\nif they ask you about variable length\nsubnet masks that you do know,\n\n659\n00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.470\nwhich of those routing\nprotocols support that feature?\n\n660\n00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Great job Wes, thank you very much.\n\n661\n00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.510\nClassless iPv4 addressing part four.\n\n662\n00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.795\nMake sure you watch all four parts,\ncuz it's very important.\n\n663\n00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:06.855\nAnd in fact, watch everything in the\nCompTIA Net+ series while you're in that\n\n664\n00:40:06.855 --> 00:40:10.775\ncourse library, hundreds of other\nvideos to help you go further.\n\n665\n00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:15.005\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nITProTV

00:00:08.354\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.354 --> 00:00:10.909\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.637\n&gt;&gt; Hallo and thank you for\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:16.740\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.220\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net+ And\n\n8\n00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.590\nthis episode is Network Topologies.\n\n9\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.450\nWhat is that all about?\n\n10\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.020\nWell, Wes Bryan is here\nto show us the way.\n\n11\n00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.200\nWes, glad to have you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.740\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.070\nThat is right, we are gonna be talking\nabout, well, Zach already said it,\n\n14\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.370\nnetwork topologies.\n\n15\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.370\nAnd let's go ahead and we'll waste no\ntime, dive in, what is a topology?\n\n16\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.470\nWell a topology basically describes the\nlayout of the network and the relationship\n\n17\n00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.700\nto connectivity devices and\nthe nodes that we have within the network.\n\n18\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.712\nThe end system, so the end systems,\nend points if you will.\n\n19\n00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:59.410\nIn other episodes, we talked about source\nand destination of the communication.\n\n20\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.675\nThose are our end points.\n\n21\n00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:04.630\nAnd there's some different topologies\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n22\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.752\nI do want you to understand, though,\nwhen it comes to topologies,\n\n23\n00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:11.592\nyou have two different theories.\n\n24\n00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:16.590\nNot eally theories, but you have what's\nknown as a physical topology, and\n\n25\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.940\nyou have what's known\nas a logical topology.\n\n26\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.850\nWhen we talk about the physical topology,\nwe talk about, again,\n\n27\n00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.370\nthe physical characteristics,\n\n28\n00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.210\nthe layout of the network, and the\nrelationship of the nodes to one another.\n\n29\n00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.720\nBut the logical topology describes how\nthe data flows across the network.\n\n30\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.300\nAnd what I'll do is, I'll show you\nhere in a second what I mean by that.\n\n31\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.990\nBut understand there is a physical\ntopology, which means you can actually see\n\n32\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.540\nall the wires and the cables,\nand if you were to zoom out and\n\n33\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.090\nlook down on top of this network,\nthat's what it would look like.\n\n34\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.780\nBut just because the network\nlooks like that,\n\n35\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.680\ndoesn't necessarily mean that's\nhow the data is gonna travel.\n\n36\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.470\nThe data could travel in\na completely deterministic manner.\n\n37\n00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.320\nSo we have to know, logically,\nthe logical topology as well too.\n\n38\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.660\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into our first one and\n\n39\n00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.990\nthe first one I wanna talk\nabout is an oldie but goodie.\n\n40\n00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.820\nAnd this is what's known as a bus network.\n\n41\n00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.640\nNow when I say oldie but\ngoodie in communication networks,\n\n42\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.240\nprimarily we don't use a lot\nof bus topologies anymore.\n\n43\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.560\nHowever, there are plenty of buses,\nand I don't mean the yellow buses that\n\n44\n00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.330\nare taking your kids to and from school or\ntransporting you all across the city.\n\n45\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.220\nWhat I'm talking about is, there are buses\nall over our computing environment today.\n\n46\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.450\nWe have essentially electrical\ncopper conductors that\n\n47\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.950\nare sending information to and\nfrom components on our motherboards.\n\n48\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.190\nThose are buses.\n\n49\n00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.340\nSo when I say oldie but goodie,\n\n50\n00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.370\nunderstand that we're talking in the\nstrict form of a network communication.\n\n51\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.720\nLet me give you an example of what\na bus topology would look like.\n\n52\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.545\nWhat you end up having is,\nyou end up having this,\n\n53\n00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:56.805\nalmost like this central conductor,\nthis central communication cable.\n\n54\n00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:01.585\nIt really forms what's known as\nthe backbone for the entire network.\n\n55\n00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:05.665\nIn the earlier days, these were the type\nof networks that we were using commonly.\n\n56\n00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:09.818\nThe very first Ethernet networks,\n802.3, the 10BASE2 and\n\n57\n00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:12.117\n10BASE5, Thinnet and Thicknet.\n\n58\n00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.419\nThese were bus-based networks.\n\n59\n00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.271\nNow some of the advantages you have to\nthe bus based networks is the fact that\n\n60\n00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:22.210\nit was relatively easy to attach\na new device to the network.\n\n61\n00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.660\nSo it was very simplistic.\n\n62\n00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.050\nAnd because of the fact that you\nhad this centralized bus and\n\n63\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.080\nyou're only attaching a single\nnode to the backbone cable,\n\n64\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.055\nit was relatively easy and simplistic\nwhen it comes to the physical cabling.\n\n65\n00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:41.044\nHere's the problem with\nthe bus-based network.\n\n66\n00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:45.990\nIt's that bus networks are what\nare known as contention-based networks.\n\n67\n00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.280\nAnd the reason I say that,\na contention-based network,\n\n68\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.240\nunderstand that your communication type\nmeans that everybody is contending for\n\n69\n00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.430\naccess to the media.\n\n70\n00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.640\nIn the earlier bus-based network what\nwe'd be using, especially in Ethernet,\n\n71\n00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.240\nwas something known as Carrier-Sense\nMultiple Access Collision Detection.\n\n72\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.260\nAnd what this means is, again,\ncontention-based media, it just means that\n\n73\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.550\nif this computer right here sent out\ncommunications, well guess what?\n\n74\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.490\nEvery single node connected to this\nentire bus would receive the signal.\n\n75\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.350\nNow that doesn't mean that they would\nprocess it, because they would look at\n\n76\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.940\nthat information in the normal,\nas we've talked about in other episodes.\n\n77\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.260\nOSI model would apply, so we would look\nat that data and see the MAC address and\n\n78\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.560\nthen the computer would say, well wait\na second here, that's not my MAC address.\n\n79\n00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.730\nSo even though I received it,\nI didn't process the information.\n\n80\n00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.700\nSo what that means for\nus is that we've got a lotta extra\n\n81\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.290\ncommunications that are going on our\nnetwork that we don't necessarily need.\n\n82\n00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.880\nSo a lot of contention on these networks.\n\n83\n00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.200\nWhich means they weren't very scable,\nand that's a problem,\n\n84\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.650\nbecause as we add additional computers,\n\n85\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.387\neven though we add additional computers to\nthese networks and it becomes fairly easy\n\n86\n00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:03.360\nto add additional computers,\nwe're increasing the contention.\n\n87\n00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.580\nBecause now, when this one\ncomputer sends communications,\n\n88\n00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.720\nit doesn't just go now to the four\nother computers on this network.\n\n89\n00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.320\nNow, it also goes to\nthese computers as well.\n\n90\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.736\nThere's another problem with these\nkind of networks likewise, too.\n\n91\n00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:22.220\nIt's the fact that a single break in\nthe cable, so let's say if we had a break\n\n92\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.440\nin these cables, anywhere,\nwould bring the entire network down.\n\n93\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.370\nBring the entire network down.\n\n94\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.730\nOne break in the cable and everybody\nis looking up over their cubicles,\n\n95\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.660\nwondering why the network is down.\n\n96\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.340\nAlright, the other thing about these\nnetworks, the bus-based networks,\n\n97\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.290\ntoo, is you had to basically\n\n98\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.220\nmatch the electrical characteristics\nof the cable that you were using.\n\n99\n00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.840\nSo you would use what\nare known as terminators.\n\n100\n00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.530\nNow when we're talking about\nterminators in this sense,\n\n101\n00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.548\nwe're not talking about a machine sent\nback in time to destroy Sean Conners.\n\n102\n00:05:51.548 --> 00:05:53.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I was just going to ask you.\n\n103\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.080\n&gt;&gt; What we're talking about is basically,\nit's a resistor, really, is what it is.\n\n104\n00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.030\nAnd again, you would have 50 and\n75 ohm resistors,\n\n105\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.090\none of the most common\nwas the 50 ohm resistor.\n\n106\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.102\nAnd it would terminate the end of\nthe cable, because one of the things about\n\n107\n00:06:07.102 --> 00:06:13.460\nthis bus-based cable is that if you send\nan electrical communication down it and\n\n108\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.370\nit met an abrupt change in impedance,\nit would cause signal reflection.\n\n109\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.190\nIt would bounce back.\n\n110\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.010\nSo what we'd have is,\n\n111\n00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.730\nwe'd have a bunch of electrical\nsignals bouncing back and forth.\n\n112\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.020\nAnd if every computer is\nsending these signals out,\n\n113\n00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.520\neventually what you would have, it would\njust bring down the network completely.\n\n114\n00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.780\nSo you would terminate the ends\nof each side of the bus.\n\n115\n00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.390\nAnd that was again important.\n\n116\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.445\nSo again, keep in mind that they were\nrelatively simplistic to add an additional\n\n117\n00:06:37.445 --> 00:06:42.050\nnode, but they were not very good for\nvery large environments.\n\n118\n00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.240\nSo it is important.\n\n119\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.880\nNow what do we use today\nin very large environments?\n\n120\n00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.330\nWell, we use something\nknown as a star topology.\n\n121\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.452\nAnd I got an example of\na star topology right here.\n\n122\n00:06:51.452 --> 00:06:55.760\nSo your star topology is just one where\nyou have the devices that are connected in\n\n123\n00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.790\na star formation around\na central connectivity device.\n\n124\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.840\nNow this has its benefits too, and\n\n125\n00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.500\nthis is the most common type\nof implementation today.\n\n126\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.990\nWell, one of the things that it has\na really good benefit, is the fact\n\n127\n00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.110\nthat if one of the cables breaks here,\nIt only takes that node offline.\n\n128\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.670\nIt doesn't bring down\nthe entirety of the network.\n\n129\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.320\nSo please keep that in mind.\n\n130\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.600\nNow remember that I told you\nthat this is physical topology.\n\n131\n00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:34.110\nLogical topology dictates the way the data\nactually moves across the network.\n\n132\n00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.490\nThe logical topology does.\n\n133\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.570\nWell, how could we have a connectivity\ndevice that, even though this is\n\n134\n00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.290\na physical star topology,\nlogically would make it act like a bus.\n\n135\n00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.167\nWell if it's a hub, if this central\nconnectivity device is a hub, and\n\n136\n00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.940\nI send a signal from\nthis device into the hub.\n\n137\n00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.790\nRemember when I told you about a hub and\nwe were talking about the OSI model?\n\n138\n00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.380\nIf not, you need to go back and watch.\n\n139\n00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.698\nIs the hub is hard coded to\nbroadcast out all other ports,\n\n140\n00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:03.020\nto the devices that\nare connected to the hub.\n\n141\n00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.607\nWell, guess what?\n\n142\n00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:04.798\nThat's a lot of contention.\n\n143\n00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:07.970\nSo now, even though physically\nwe have a star topology,\n\n144\n00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.555\nif you look at it logically,\n\n145\n00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:14.690\nwe have a communication that goes right\nback to our contention based physical bus.\n\n146\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.670\nSo that's what we mean when we say the\ndifference between a logical topology and\n\n147\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.300\nphysical topology.\n\n148\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.170\nIf this is a switch, it's a physical star.\n\n149\n00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.030\nAll right, it isn't a logical bus.\n\n150\n00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.970\nAll right, because the switch is basically\nconnecting ports together, all right.\n\n151\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.690\nThe other benefit of this\nis it's relatively easy\n\n152\n00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.000\nto add another device, right.\n\n153\n00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.789\nWe just add another device, and\n\n154\n00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.308\nwe can just essentially hook a cable from\nthat device essentially to the switch.\n\n155\n00:08:42.546 --> 00:08:44.724\nSo, good benefit in a star topology,\n\n156\n00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:49.360\nagain one of the most common\nimplementations that you have today.\n\n157\n00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.190\nNow, there are some other ones that\nare kind of blurring the lines between\n\n158\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.230\noldies but goodies but some of them\nthat are topology is still unused today.\n\n159\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:59.460\nAnd it's really one of\nthe fastest networks today.\n\n160\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.200\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n161\n00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.390\nWell again, let's go ahead and take a trip\nback in time, let's go back to the 80s.\n\n162\n00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.350\nFebruary 1980, when the IEEE came\ntogether and they said, you know what,\n\n163\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.310\nwe're gonna try to standardize these\ncommunication types that all you vendors\n\n164\n00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.460\nout there are manufacturing.\n\n165\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.768\nOne of them I told you,\n802.3, was Ethernet.\n\n166\n00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:20.320\nEthernet uses bus-based\ntechnologies up until today,\n\n167\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.132\nwhen they got into\nthe switch star topology.\n\n168\n00:09:23.132 --> 00:09:27.196\nWell in those earlier days, we also\nhad something and you can see here,\n\n169\n00:09:27.196 --> 00:09:29.095\nwe had ring topologies.\n\n170\n00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:32.240\nAnd the earliest of the ring technologies\nwas what was known as Token Ring.\n\n171\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.800\nAnd there were two\ndifferent variants of it.\n\n172\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.990\nThere was a proprietary variant\nof it that was made by IBM, and\n\n173\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.588\nit was called the IBM token ring,\ngo figure.\n\n174\n00:09:39.588 --> 00:09:44.109\n[LAUGH] And then we also had one that\nthe IEEE said, okay IBM, again, remember,\n\n175\n00:09:44.109 --> 00:09:48.444\nall the vendors come in, let's\nstandardize these communications types.\n\n176\n00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:51.145\nAnd the IEEE said,\nwe'll standardize a Token Ring,\n\n177\n00:09:51.145 --> 00:09:54.340\nit'll be slightly different\nthan the propriety IBM, right?\n\n178\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:59.242\nCuz that's their technology, and\nwe'll put it out as 802.5, all right?\n\n179\n00:09:59.242 --> 00:10:02.469\nSo 802.5 is your Token Ring technology.\n\n180\n00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:07.740\nYou have to understand that, so\nwhat goes on with this type of network?\n\n181\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.202\nNow this network it has benefit since and\nit has draw back as well.\n\n182\n00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:13.650\nAll right, one of the benefits was for\n\n183\n00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.480\ndetecting problems, very easy to tell\nwhich node had the problem, why?\n\n184\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.676\nWell, because you would\nhave what are known as,\n\n185\n00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:23.690\nlet's say relative to this very\nfirst computer here, all right.\n\n186\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.749\nYou would have what are known as upstream\nneighbors and downstream neighbors.\n\n187\n00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:30.585\nSo again from the perspective\nof this single computer here,\n\n188\n00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:33.530\nwe would have an upstream neighbor and\na downstream.\n\n189\n00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.180\nWhat do we call upstream and downstream?\n\n190\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.090\nWell, I want you to think about\nhow a river flows, right.\n\n191\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.550\nIf I made a central point and\n\n192\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.940\nI'm down that river where it's\nflowing this way, I'm upstream.\n\n193\n00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:47.540\nBut if I'm on the other side,\nI'm downstream.\n\n194\n00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.590\nInformation flow, well,\ncuz information flows kinda like a river.\n\n195\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.439\nSometimes it can be just as\ndetrimental to your health as well.\n\n196\n00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:56.703\n[LAUGH] So the Token Ring networks,\nwhat they would do is they\n\n197\n00:10:56.703 --> 00:11:00.770\nwould pass information in a unidirectional\nfashion, in one direction.\n\n198\n00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.090\nSo you always knew what the upstream\nneighbor was and the downstream neighbor\n\n199\n00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.120\nrelative to the computer that might\nbe having a problem at this point.\n\n200\n00:11:08.437 --> 00:11:09.850\nHere's the drawback.\n\n201\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.876\nThe drawback is that, A single loss of one\n\n202\n00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:21.470\ncomputer brings down the whole network,\nall right, and that is a problem.\n\n203\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.640\nNow it's not very fault tolerant,\nall right.\n\n204\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.860\nThe other thing too is that unlike\n\n205\n00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.610\nEthernet which was a contention-based\nmedia type where you're always\n\n206\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.280\ntrying to put your data on the wire\nif something collides, right?\n\n207\n00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.100\nTwo electrical signals sent in the same\ndirection on a single physical medium.\n\n208\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.096\nThey collide, they bounce back to their\nsource, and the source detects it,\n\n209\n00:11:44.096 --> 00:11:45.675\nthat's coalition detection, right?\n\n210\n00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:47.614\nThis is deterministic media.\n\n211\n00:11:47.614 --> 00:11:52.350\nAll right, deterministic media in\nthe fact that your Token Ring devices\n\n212\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.740\nwould make sure that the information\nwas passed in a unidirectional fashion.\n\n213\n00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.570\nNow there's a pros and cons,\njust like everything else, right.\n\n214\n00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.160\nPros and\ncons of the contention-based media is that\n\n215\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.470\nit keeps the devices cheaper.\n\n216\n00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.240\nProblem with the Decon is the fact\nthat you could have fragment of data,\n\n217\n00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.310\nyou could have a lot of extra\ncommunication that you don't need.\n\n218\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.560\nDeterministic media,\nthe good thing is everybody is guaranteed\n\n219\n00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.400\naccess to the wire,\nthe wire being figurative to the network,\n\n220\n00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.960\nright, the cable that were\ntransmitting the information across.\n\n221\n00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.350\nThe bad thing is, there could be wasted\ncommunication time, if you will.\n\n222\n00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.921\nAnd what I mean by that is you would have\nthe token, right, we say token ring.\n\n223\n00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:29.870\nWell, there's the ring.\n\n224\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.190\nWhat the heck is the token?\n\n225\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.560\nThe token was just a special set\nof bits that would be passed\n\n226\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.750\naround the Token Ring.\n\n227\n00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.000\nAnd if it was captured,\nthe token was in a captured state\n\n228\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.975\nit means when this information, let's say\nthis information was from 12 o'clock,\n\n229\n00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:47.170\nyeah, we will to 6 o'clock computer here,\nright?\n\n230\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.060\nAnd that's you we're sending information.\n\n231\n00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.650\nWell, it would go to this computer first,\nright, unidirectional fashion.\n\n232\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.350\nAnd that computer will look at the token,\nand say, it's capture.\n\n233\n00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.275\nWell, all right, well,\n\n234\n00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.390\nI can't send my data yet and\nthen it'd go to this computer.\n\n235\n00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.320\nAnd this computer would say,\nit's captured.\n\n236\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.394\nOkay, it's supposed to go to the next\ncomputer downstream to me, so\n\n237\n00:13:03.394 --> 00:13:06.210\nit's not my data, so let me go ahead and\npass it on, all right.\n\n238\n00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.287\nBut what if these two\ncomputers had data to send?\n\n239\n00:13:09.531 --> 00:13:11.117\nWell, the token is already captured,\n\n240\n00:13:11.117 --> 00:13:13.930\nthey're gonna have to wait their turn,\ndeterministic media.\n\n241\n00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.050\nThe other thing is deterministic\nmedia access like this in Token Ring,\n\n242\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.700\nthe price point was higher on\nthe devices themselves, right.\n\n243\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.090\nThe great thing too, and I wanna give\nprops out to our chatroom out there,\n\n244\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:31.820\nas all our viewers keeping us on track\nhere is that the loss of the token,\n\n245\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.410\na corruption of the token,\nit could be regenerated and sent back in.\n\n246\n00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.410\nAlright, so do keep that in mind.\n\n247\n00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.373\nNow I mentioned that that's an oldie but\n\n248\n00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:43.780\nwhat are the newer type\nof technologies here?\n\n249\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.285\nWell, we're still back in time,\nunfortunately.\n\n250\n00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:49.602\nLet's go ahead and look back at my\ncomputer screen here for a second.\n\n251\n00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:54.943\nWe have a dual ring topology, and the cool\nthing about the dual ring topology\n\n252\n00:13:54.943 --> 00:14:00.070\nis this tried to bring a little\nold bit of fault tolerance, right?\n\n253\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.230\nAnd that's what's known as Fiber\nDistributed Data Interface, all right?\n\n254\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.310\nIn this definitely had it's benefits\nbecause it was a fiber communication.\n\n255\n00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:12.860\nSo in the earlier days, where Token Ring\nwas prevalent and 10 based T or 10 megabit\n\n256\n00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.110\nEthernet, the fact that you could get\na single wire in a fiber distributed\n\n257\n00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.160\ndata interface would operate at 100\nmegs was pretty impressive in the day.\n\n258\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.449\nAnd then what you could do is link\naggregation instead of using the backup\n\n259\n00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.556\nring as a failover for\nredundancy, which is great.\n\n260\n00:14:29.556 --> 00:14:32.261\nUnlike the Token Ring,\nwhich if you have a break in the cable,\n\n261\n00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:33.780\nthe whole network failed.\n\n262\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.180\nFiber Distributed Data Interface, if one\nof the nodes failed, well, that's okay.\n\n263\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.930\nThis device would see that\nthat nodes failed, and\n\n264\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.180\nit would send the transmission\nin the opposite direction.\n\n265\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.350\nSo it was like a fault tolerant\nself-healing type of nature.\n\n266\n00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.679\nBut if you weren't worried about that,\nyou didn't want the fault tolerate,\n\n267\n00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:56.200\nyou could take and do a link\naggregation or a link bonding and\n\n268\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.736\ntake two of those\nFiber Distributed Data Interface links.\n\n269\n00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:03.316\nAnd you could aggregate them together to\nnot only get a 100 megabit transfer speeds\n\n270\n00:15:03.316 --> 00:15:05.680\nbut to get 200 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n271\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.010\nNow I know what some of\nyou are saying out there,\n\n272\n00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.340\nespecially if you're gamers getting\ninto the networking industry.\n\n273\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.720\nYou're like, wow, 200 megs,\nthat's so yesterday's news.\n\n274\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.840\nWell, it is by today's standards, but\nit wasn't back then, I can tell you.\n\n275\n00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.120\nAnd the fact that it scales up very well,\nmade it a very, very popular but\n\n276\n00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.230\nvery expensive implementation.\n\n277\n00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.797\nAnd now that we have things like\ngigabit Ethernet, that is, again,\n\n278\n00:15:26.797 --> 00:15:27.843\nEthernet is cheap,\n\n279\n00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:32.040\nit pretty much has signaled the death\nblow to Fiber Distributed Data Interface.\n\n280\n00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.690\nBut those are the oldies.\n\n281\n00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.010\nNow, time for the newbies,\nif you will, not really newbies,\n\n282\n00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.390\nbeen around for a little bit.\n\n283\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.582\nBut your Internet service providers,\nthey will use sonic and\n\n284\n00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:44.495\nsynchronous digital hierarchy, right.\n\n285\n00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:46.156\nAgain, sonic being here at ANSI,\n\n286\n00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:49.870\nthat the specifications of\nAmerican National Standards Institute.\n\n287\n00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.400\nInternational Telecommunication Union\nin Europe calls it SDH,\n\n288\n00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.974\nSynchronous Digital Hierarchy,\nif you will.\n\n289\n00:15:55.974 --> 00:16:01.239\nThis is also a dual ring fiber based\ntechnology that operates basically\n\n290\n00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:05.716\nat speeds, we're talking about\nSome pretty hefty speeds,\n\n291\n00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:09.680\nI believe they have some that\ngo well beyond ten gigs.\n\n292\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.730\nWe're talking hundreds of gigs and\nagain, fiber-optic communication that\n\n293\n00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.043\nyour Internet service providers use to\nsend traffic across the Internet, right?\n\n294\n00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:23.250\nAnd it uses a dual ring topology again\nbecause it's fault tolerant, right?\n\n295\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.115\nSo you do have those type of ring\ntechnologies that you need to be aware of.\n\n296\n00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:32.840\nNow the next one that we wanna look at,\nis something known as the mesh topology.\n\n297\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.870\nNow the mesh topology,\n\n298\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.680\nwe got a couple of examples in\none here of some mesh topology.\n\n299\n00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.730\nBut mesh topology essentially\nis one where a single device\n\n300\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.920\nhas a connection to every other\ndevice within the network, all right?\n\n301\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.722\nNow that has its benefits right?\n\n302\n00:16:50.722 --> 00:16:52.252\nWhat is the benefit?\n\n303\n00:16:52.252 --> 00:16:56.095\nWell the benefit is if one of these\nlinks fails, if you notice that link,\n\n304\n00:16:56.095 --> 00:16:58.470\nboy, it's gone, well guess what?\n\n305\n00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:03.495\nThat's okay, because I've got this link\nthat can still maintain communications,\n\n306\n00:17:03.495 --> 00:17:06.984\nI still have this link that\nmaintains communications, and\n\n307\n00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.075\nthis link that maintains communications,\nright?\n\n308\n00:17:10.075 --> 00:17:13.855\nAnd that's one of the benefits\nto the mesh based\n\n309\n00:17:13.855 --> 00:17:18.687\nnetwork when you have a redundancy,\nmore than one, right?\n\n310\n00:17:18.687 --> 00:17:23.228\nRedundancy allows you fault tolerance,\nthey are not one and the same guys.\n\n311\n00:17:23.228 --> 00:17:27.100\nUnderstand that fault redundancy means I\nhave more than one, because I have more\n\n312\n00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.940\nthan one, doesn't necessarily mean\nI'm tolerant to failure, right?\n\n313\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.500\nIf I have a fiber distributed data\ninterface ring and both of those rings\n\n314\n00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.640\nare used at a 100 megabits, 100 megabits,\nI don't have any full tolerance.\n\n315\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.360\nI have redundancy, but I'm using them,\n\n316\n00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.180\nunfortunately, to make more bandwidth,\nall right?\n\n317\n00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.841\nSo understand that the mesh based\nnetwork is very, very fault tolerant,\n\n318\n00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:50.557\nproblem is, also very, very expensive.\n\n319\n00:17:50.557 --> 00:17:52.546\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's something that we typically see in\n\n320\n00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:54.820\nthings like ethernet or\nwire based networks, right?\n\n321\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:02.058\nBecause of the fact that every device\nhas a connection to every other device.\n\n322\n00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:06.903\nThen what it essentially means is\nthat when you add a single device to\n\n323\n00:18:06.903 --> 00:18:12.173\nthe network, you are exponentially\nincreasing the amount of cables that\n\n324\n00:18:12.173 --> 00:18:18.045\nyou have to use in order to connect all of\nthese devices if you can see that, right?\n\n325\n00:18:18.045 --> 00:18:21.480\nSo there is an exponential\nincrease of the connections.\n\n326\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.790\nSo it's typically not something\nthat you will see in.\n\n327\n00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.420\nNow I say that, but\nthere are things like frame relay, but\n\n328\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.460\nyou don't actually see the underlying\narchitecture of frame relay.\n\n329\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.200\nNow notice that I also have\nsome laptops here too.\n\n330\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.786\nBecause there are mesh mode networks,\nfor instance an ad hoc based network.\n\n331\n00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:45.740\nIn this episode, we'll talk more\nabout wireless local area networks.\n\n332\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.815\nBut when we have wireless adaptors\nthat can be put into an ad hoc mode,\n\n333\n00:18:49.815 --> 00:18:54.526\nthen it essentially means your wireless\ncommunications might, in this case,\n\n334\n00:18:54.526 --> 00:18:59.686\nmy laptops, can communicate to every other\nlaptop that's also in the ad hoc network.\n\n335\n00:18:59.686 --> 00:19:01.891\nAnd it forms a wireless mesh network, and\n\n336\n00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:05.356\nthat's something that we use\npretty prevalent today is wireless\n\n337\n00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:10.210\nmesh networks in order to get things\nlike greater coverage areas, all right?\n\n338\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.470\nBut now we also have\nwhen it comes to mesh,\n\n339\n00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.270\nthat's what was known as a full mesh and\nit's in the diagram here.\n\n340\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.100\nIt's a full mesh, because you also have\nthings like partial meshes as well.\n\n341\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.336\nNotice that we don't have full redundancy,\nright?\n\n342\n00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:26.482\nTo have full redundancy I would\nhave to have a cable here,\n\n343\n00:19:26.482 --> 00:19:30.635\nI'd have to have a cable here, and\nI'd have to have a cable there, right?\n\n344\n00:19:30.635 --> 00:19:31.156\nThat's a full mesh.\n\n345\n00:19:31.156 --> 00:19:33.492\nBut you can have a partial mesh, right.\n\n346\n00:19:33.492 --> 00:19:37.047\nYou'll see this too, you can say partial\nmeshes to like if you were ever to look at\n\n347\n00:19:37.047 --> 00:19:40.082\nthe topology of the internet and\nlook at all the autonomous systems,\n\n348\n00:19:40.082 --> 00:19:42.460\nyou'll see them all like\nsome of them all connected.\n\n349\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.734\nAnd then they'll come down to one portion\nwhere there's three autonomous systems and\n\n350\n00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:50.201\nthey're connected, all interconnected\ntogether for redundancy.\n\n351\n00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:52.739\nAnd then they just kind of snake off\nto one autonomous system that's by\n\n352\n00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:54.040\nitself with a single link, right?\n\n353\n00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.092\nIt's partial mesh network,\nyou also have those too, and\n\n354\n00:19:57.092 --> 00:19:58.721\nwe want you to be aware of them.\n\n355\n00:19:58.721 --> 00:20:02.513\nAll right, well that takes\nus to our next concept, and\n\n356\n00:20:02.513 --> 00:20:06.066\nthat is what are wireless topologies,\nall right?\n\n357\n00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.012\nAnd there are few different types of\ntopologies that I want you to be aware of,\n\n358\n00:20:10.012 --> 00:20:10.640\nall right?\n\n359\n00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.870\nWhen we talk about wireless topologies,\n\n360\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:18.030\nyou'll see that they mention mesh\nnetwork and they mention ad hoc network.\n\n361\n00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:21.950\nWhen you have a mesh network, remember\nwhat I was telling you that it's in, for\n\n362\n00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:27.830\nthe purposes of increasing the overall\ncommunication distance, right?\n\n363\n00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.720\nThis is where we have more than\none wireless access point all\n\n364\n00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.030\nservicing the same network.\n\n365\n00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:37.390\nAnd you can see that we have again,\nmore than one wireless access point.\n\n366\n00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.420\nAnd they're all servicing\na single network, so\n\n367\n00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.470\nyou can see that we have our mesh network.\n\n368\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:46.653\nLet me go ahead and finish my diagram\nthere, and we will make our colors match.\n\n369\n00:20:46.653 --> 00:20:48.244\nThere we go [LAUGH] all right.\n\n370\n00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:56.320\nNow this is done basically to\naccomplish a greater coverage area.\n\n371\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.896\nAnd what you'll a lot of times see is that\nyou'll have a wireless land controller\n\n372\n00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:03.871\nthat is actually controlling\nall of these devices.\n\n373\n00:21:03.871 --> 00:21:06.066\nBut then there's also ad hoc mode.\n\n374\n00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:10.873\nNow ad hoc mode is one in which you don't\nneed an access point to communicate with\n\n375\n00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:12.760\nanother device, right?\n\n376\n00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.019\nSo both Zach and I right now,\nwe have our Mac books hooked up and\n\n377\n00:21:16.019 --> 00:21:18.288\nwe're on a wireless network, all right?\n\n378\n00:21:18.288 --> 00:21:21.567\nIn order for us to communicate\non that wireless network,\n\n379\n00:21:21.567 --> 00:21:23.860\nwe're actually sending our.\n\n380\n00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:31.409\nIf right now I was gonna send Zach if\nyou will, let's say an email, right?\n\n381\n00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:33.535\nWell, or if I was just gonna\nsend him a direct message,\n\n382\n00:21:33.535 --> 00:21:35.398\nit doesn't even have to\ngo out to the Internet.\n\n383\n00:21:35.398 --> 00:21:37.256\nI have to go through the access point, and\n\n384\n00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:41.027\nthe access point is what controls who can\ncommunicate across the wireless network,\n\n385\n00:21:41.027 --> 00:21:43.570\nthat's what's known as\ninfrastructure mode.\n\n386\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.930\nYou have an access point basically\ncontrolling the wireless devices.\n\n387\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.110\nBut there might be let's say a situation\nwhere you might have to use something\n\n388\n00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.900\nknown as ad hoc mode because I\ndon't have a wireless access point.\n\n389\n00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.170\nSo if your network adaptors and your\nlaptop will support it, so for instance,\n\n390\n00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.520\nmaybe Zach and I, we have to go to\na location where we can't have access for\n\n391\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.170\nwhatever, let's say security reasons.\n\n392\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.520\nWe can't have access to their wireless\nnetwork, it's for them but Zach and\n\n393\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.950\nI have to give a presentation.\n\n394\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.806\nHe's got some PowerPoint slides on his\ncomputer and I've got some stuff on my\n\n395\n00:22:15.806 --> 00:22:19.144\ncomputer and unfortunately we've\ngot our thumb drives, right?\n\n396\n00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:21.964\nWell we can set our computers\nup in an ad hoc network, and\n\n397\n00:22:21.964 --> 00:22:24.470\nwe don't have to go\nthrough the access point.\n\n398\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.480\nThis is where your wireless mesh comes in,\nbecause now we're not going through\n\n399\n00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.730\ninfrastructure mode cuz the access\npoint isn't controlling this.\n\n400\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.070\nMy computer is acting like\nan access point, I can send and\n\n401\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.980\nreceive signals at will.\n\n402\n00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.840\nZach can send information back to me,\n\n403\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.780\ndoesn't have to go\nthrough the access point.\n\n404\n00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.557\nSo the difference between ad hoc mode and\ninfrastructure mode.\n\n405\n00:22:42.557 --> 00:22:46.139\nInfrastructure mode,\nmanaging wireless access point,\n\n406\n00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:48.696\nad hoc mode eliminate the access point and\n\n407\n00:22:48.696 --> 00:22:53.160\nour computers will talk to each\nother without that access point.\n\n408\n00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.124\nThat is important to understand.\n\n409\n00:22:55.124 --> 00:22:59.305\nAll right, so\nthose are some of the topologies, right?\n\n410\n00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:02.640\nThose are some of the topologies\nthat we need to look at.\n\n411\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.788\nSo the next thing that we're gonna have to\nlook at are the types of networks that we\n\n412\n00:23:06.788 --> 00:23:10.036\nhave that are really just based,\nthey say types generically.\n\n413\n00:23:10.036 --> 00:23:15.360\nBut I want you to think about it based\non your geographical coverage area.\n\n414\n00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.560\nThat's what we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna look at next.\n\n415\n00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.849\nAnd here's one of the very first ones,\nright?\n\n416\n00:23:19.849 --> 00:23:23.017\nThis is what's known as a LAN, and\nthey call that out, Local Area Network,\n\n417\n00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:23.540\nall right?\n\n418\n00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:29.925\nLocal area network essentially is a series\nof devices, connectivity devices and\n\n419\n00:23:29.925 --> 00:23:34.652\nyour end systems that span\na single geographical location.\n\n420\n00:23:34.652 --> 00:23:38.934\nNow that location could be a building, it\ncould be multiple floors within a building\n\n421\n00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:42.452\ndepending on the company, but\nit's a single geographical region.\n\n422\n00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:45.720\nIt's connected with a typically\nshort range media and\n\n423\n00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.310\nyou as the administrator\nare in control of it, right?\n\n424\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.830\nNow if you have bigger company\nthat has multiple LANs,\n\n425\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.030\nmultiple local area networks,\nthe single geographical locations but\n\n426\n00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.571\nthey might wanna allow them to\ncommunicate together, right?\n\n427\n00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:07.545\nSo maybe the company,\nthey have a LAN in Boston, right?\n\n428\n00:24:07.545 --> 00:24:10.494\nMaybe they have a LAN in New York,\nthey have a LAN down in Miami,\n\n429\n00:24:10.494 --> 00:24:13.516\nthey have a LAN over in Cali,\nlet's say in Los Angeles, right?\n\n430\n00:24:13.516 --> 00:24:16.672\nSo it's a massive for\nus it would be a national company, right?\n\n431\n00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:19.520\nIt could be an international company,\nright?\n\n432\n00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.560\nAnd they want to allow all those\nnetworks to communicate together.\n\n433\n00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.497\nWell then what we end up having is\nwhat's known as a wide area network.\n\n434\n00:24:27.497 --> 00:24:32.285\nSee a wide area network is comprised\nof typically connects multiple\n\n435\n00:24:32.285 --> 00:24:35.410\nlocal area networks together, all right?\n\n436\n00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:41.633\nAnd a wide area network spans\nmultiple geographical locations.\n\n437\n00:24:41.633 --> 00:24:43.735\nAgain, that's the wide area network,\nright?\n\n438\n00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:48.002\nYou can essentially say like the Internet\nis one massive WAN, all right?\n\n439\n00:24:48.002 --> 00:24:50.306\nI mean it's a bunch of local\narea networks all holding hands,\n\n440\n00:24:50.306 --> 00:24:53.364\nI don't know if they're singing kumbaya\nbut their all holding hands together and\n\n441\n00:24:53.364 --> 00:24:55.670\nyour ISPs are connecting them together.\n\n442\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.125\nNow a WAN let's get a little\nmore technical than that.\n\n443\n00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:00.343\nWhen we talk about a WAN,\n\n444\n00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:03.600\na WAN is typically under control\nof a single administrative body.\n\n445\n00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.236\nYou go to Internet service provider to get\nyour WAN links that allow you to connect\n\n446\n00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:11.184\nthose multiple geographical locations,\nright?\n\n447\n00:25:11.184 --> 00:25:14.334\nSo we have a local area network, right?\n\n448\n00:25:14.334 --> 00:25:19.200\nThe local area network is comprised\nof a single geographical location.\n\n449\n00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.490\nIt's typical in control under a single\nadministrative body, if you will.\n\n450\n00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.910\nWhen you have multiple\ngeographical locations, and\n\n451\n00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.110\nthey are connected together\nthat forms a wide area network.\n\n452\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.940\nAnd even the wide area network, typically,\nis under the control if you will,\n\n453\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.450\ntypically like a single company,\nall right?\n\n454\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.970\nSo, those are some of\nthe network types if you will,\n\n455\n00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.822\nkeep in mind as geographical location.\n\n456\n00:25:46.822 --> 00:25:49.662\nBut I'm looking at our list and it looks\nlike we have got quite a few more to go,\n\n457\n00:25:49.662 --> 00:25:51.735\nbut I don't know if we have\nall the minutes on the clock.\n\n458\n00:25:51.735 --> 00:25:54.163\n&gt;&gt; That's right, we'll be at\npart two of network topologies.\n\n459\n00:25:54.163 --> 00:25:56.020\nAwesome work as usual Wes.\n\n460\n00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.181\nThank you, make sure you watch everything\nwhen it comes to you in Net Plus series.\n\n461\n00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:02.446\nAnd take a look at all the other\nvideos we have on our course library.\n\n462\n00:26:02.446 --> 00:26:05.335\nHundreds of them, and they're all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n463\n00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:07.398\nNow tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro.TV.\n\n464\n00:26:07.398 --> 00:26:09.009\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n465\n00:26:09.009 --> 00:26:10.280\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n466\n00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:10.962\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n467\n00:26:10.962 --> 00:26:11.897\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you soon.\n\n468\n00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:19.622\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:26:19.622 --> 00:26:22.343\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

watching IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:14.944\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone, and welcome back to\na To another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:19.822\nI'm your host, Justin Dennison and well,\nwe're back with a part two because we left\n\n6\n00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:23.700\na little bit of a cliffhanger here\nin our CompTIA Network+ series.\n\n7\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.280\nIn particular, we're back to talk\nmore about network topologies.\n\n8\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.020\nAnd luckily we have someone in\nthe studio who knows all about those\n\n9\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.120\nthings, Mr Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.480\nHow are you doing to day, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I am doing great Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.540\nIt is great to be here.\n\n13\n00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.540\nThat's right we did.\n\n14\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.690\nWe left off in the last episode,\n\n15\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.320\nwe were talking about the types of\nnetwork topologies that we have.\n\n16\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.200\nWe talked about wire topologies.\n\n17\n00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200\nWe talked about wireless\ntopologies in the first episode.\n\n18\n00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610\nAnd we really started to talk about\nthe layout of the networks, right,\n\n19\n00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.980\nand it's really related to their\ngeographical coverage area if you will.\n\n20\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.130\nA geographical location.\n\n21\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.930\nIf you can remember.\n\n22\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.035\nIf not, got back and\nwatch that first episode.\n\n23\n00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:02.315\nWe'll see you back here for part two but\nif you remember in the first\n\n24\n00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:05.925\npart we talked about the difference\nbetween a LAN and a WAN right?\n\n25\n00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.885\nTalk about a LAN, Local Area Network\nremember I told you that\n\n26\n00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:12.490\nit basically spans a single\ngeographical location.\n\n27\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.820\nNow, don't get too tripped up on\ngeographical location meaning hey,\n\n28\n00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.790\nis it a building, single floor in\na building, multiple floors in a building.\n\n29\n00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.190\nAgain, it's just a single\ngeographical location.\n\n30\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.270\nThere'd be more than one\nfloor in a building, but\n\n31\n00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.610\nit's under the control of\na single administrative body.\n\n32\n00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.957\nRight?\nIf you have multiple geographical\n\n33\n00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:33.214\nlocations, remember you can have\nmultiple LANs and tie them altogether.\n\n34\n00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:35.970\nAnd if you're the company that\noversees those multiple LANs,\n\n35\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.790\neven though they reside in\ndifferent geographical locations.\n\n36\n00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.030\nThen you have essentially what's\nknown as a wide area network.\n\n37\n00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.079\nThat's where we left off and\nwe are going to pick back up and\n\n38\n00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.830\nwe are going to talk about A WLAN.\n\n39\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.070\nNow I know what you're\nprobably saying there, Justin.\n\n40\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.930\nWell wait a second, we're talking about\na LAN, and we're talking about a WAN.\n\n41\n00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.490\nAnd now you just kind of mixed\nboth letters together, right?\n\n42\n00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.760\n&gt;&gt; I just figured you were making it up.\n\n43\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.860\nYou were like, we have wide and\nlocal, and now we have wide\n\n44\n00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.570\nlocal I don't know what they are but\nI assume that's what you are going to say.\n\n45\n00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNot really but it's close.\n\n46\n00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.250\nGood try though.\n\n47\n00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.490\nWe have consolation prizes at the door for\nhim.\n\n48\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.005\nWe are looking at something called\na wireless local area network and\n\n49\n00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.727\nthat is something that is\nreally really coming see.\n\n50\n00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:19.780\nIn other episodes, we talked about\nthe wireless standards, right?\n\n51\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.635\nWe talked about 802.11 standards,\nright, the IEEE?\n\n52\n00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:26.450\nWell here we wanna talk about\nthe layout of the network.\n\n53\n00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.310\nRemember, that's what\ntopology is all about, right?\n\n54\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.220\nIt's about the relationship\nof the nodes and\n\n55\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.640\nhow they're organized within the network,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.940\nSo let's dive into a wireless\nLocal Area Network.\n\n57\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.560\nThat's be a LAN.\n\n58\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.650\nAll right so, if we jump right in here\nI've got a little diagram here and\n\n59\n00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.890\nit shows you some of the major components\nthat you would see inside of a wireless\n\n60\n00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.450\nnetwork.\n\n61\n00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.830\nNow, they get a little technical jargon-y\nhere, but just please understand.\n\n62\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.170\nIt really is simplistic.\n\n63\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.670\nWhen I talk about an STA,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n64\n00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.400\nWe're talking about a station.\n\n65\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.971\nThat's essentially what\na wireless device is, right,\n\n66\n00:03:01.971 --> 00:03:04.068\nif I have a table that's\nconnected to my WiFi.\n\n67\n00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:06.520\nIf I have my cell phone\nthat's connected to my WiFi.\n\n68\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.110\nIf I have any device\nthat is being managed and\n\n69\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.380\nit's connected to my wireless network,\ntechnically,\n\n70\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.600\naccording to the WLAN architecture, if you\nwill, let's just call it STA, a station.\n\n71\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.720\nIt's a managed device\nwithin a wireless network.\n\n72\n00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.570\nThen we have what is known as an AP and\n\n73\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.950\na random word large there,\nwe'll take that out of there.\n\n74\n00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.605\nNot sure exactly why that's there,\nbut it's gone.\n\n75\n00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.840\n[LAUGH] Then we have what's\nknown as the AP, all right, and\n\n76\n00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.040\nyou might have heard the term used in\nother episodes, a wireless access point.\n\n77\n00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.050\nAll right, well I just want you to\nunderstand that if we're talking about\n\n78\n00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.070\nwireless local area network\ninfrastructure the wireless is implied.\n\n79\n00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.760\nSo that's why you'll see it just\nabbreviated AP, access point all right?\n\n80\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.040\nNow the next thing that we have, and a\nlittle more about the access point right?\n\n81\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.680\nThe access point is\nthe managing device all right?\n\n82\n00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.450\nThat's important because\nwe have talked about.\n\n83\n00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.330\nThings like in our wireless topologies,\n\n84\n00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.030\nwe talked about the difference\nbetween an infrastructure mode and\n\n85\n00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.190\nan adhock mode back in part one of\nnetwork topologies here, right.\n\n86\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.920\nAnd remember one of the that things\nI said was in infrastructure mode\n\n87\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.730\nYou have an access point that is\nthe commander-in-chief, if you will,\n\n88\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.790\nof the wireless network.\n\n89\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.470\nIt is the managing device,\nit's what controls the communication for\n\n90\n00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.560\nall other devices including\nmanagement frames,\n\n91\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.690\nbeaconing, reporting what the network\nname is that we'll get in here as well.\n\n92\n00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.190\nIt manages the entire network.\n\n93\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.590\nAnd again, this is what you see\nright here is infrastructure mode.\n\n94\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.750\nNow the next thing we have is what\nis known as a distribution system.\n\n95\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.820\nIf we take a look the distribution system\njust looks like a little blue bar, but\n\n96\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.030\nwhat really is that?\n\n97\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.680\nThe DS,\nas sometimes they'll abbreviate it.\n\n98\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.110\nBecause remember in IT,\ninformation technology,\n\n99\n00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.360\nwe always have to have acronyms.\n\n100\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.940\nWe don't speak in English.\n\n101\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.980\nWhatever language you might\nbe native to your location,\n\n102\n00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.630\nthe distribution system is nothing\nmore than the wireless network.\n\n103\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.420\nIt's interesting.\n\n104\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.210\nI like the fact there that they call it\nan access point, because it is confusing.\n\n105\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.000\nWhen you look at a wireless access\npoint It isn't a wireless device.\n\n106\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.140\nIt's a wired device.\n\n107\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.070\nThe wireless access point, what its job\nis is to give the stations access to\n\n108\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.650\nthe wired network or in this case\nthe distribution system as they call it.\n\n109\n00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.150\nThat's all it really is.\n\n110\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.450\nNow when you have a single\naccess point managing\n\n111\n00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.250\nall of the devices on your network you\nhave what's known as a BSS, all right?\n\n112\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.130\nWe're not talking BFF that's\na different term all together, right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.360\nWe're talking about a basic service set.\n\n114\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.330\nAll right, now sometimes you\nneed a greater coverage area.\n\n115\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.590\nRight?\nSo what can you have?\n\n116\n00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.800\nWell, we can actually put two of\nthese access points together and\n\n117\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.980\nboth access points can essentially\nrespond to the same SSID.\n\n118\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.810\nAll right.\nSo there's a term that we got thrown\n\n119\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.320\nat you and we didn't explain what it is.\n\n120\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.150\nWhat's an SSID?\n\n121\n00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.360\nThe SSID is an alphanumeric string that\nessentially identifies the network.\n\n122\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.320\nIt's called the Service Set Identifier.\n\n123\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.255\nAnd when you look at your Computers.\n\n124\n00:06:02.255 --> 00:06:05.465\nIn fact,\njust right here on my computer, Justin,\n\n125\n00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:08.425\nI've got tons of SSIDs\nthat we can actually see.\n\n126\n00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:11.835\nWe just call them,\ngenerically we call them network names.\n\n127\n00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:19.079\nWell, if you have a single access point,\nthat is managed by, again, a single SSID.\n\n128\n00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.620\nIt's broadcasting a single SSID and\nthat's the only access point.\n\n129\n00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.210\nYou have a basic service set.\n\n130\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.620\nThe great thing is you can expand the\ncoverage area by two Putting two access\n\n131\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.080\npoints on the same network essentially,\nand you have two basic service sets.\n\n132\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.570\nWhen they're joined together and both\naccess points are responding to the same\n\n133\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.760\nservice set identifier, it becomes\nwhat's known as an extended service set.\n\n134\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.260\nThink about it as extending\nthe range of the network, and\n\n135\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.450\nthis is where things like WiFi and\nroaming come in.\n\n136\n00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.270\nWhen I leave the proximity of one\naccess point we have something knwn as\n\n137\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.615\nthe relative signal strength indicator\ninside your devices and when it says.\n\n138\n00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:00.375\nI'm getting too far from this\none axis point it starts\n\n139\n00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:03.345\ncalling out to the next axis point and\nguess what.\n\n140\n00:07:03.345 --> 00:07:07.105\nThe next access point says yeah I\nsee you're part of the same network.\n\n141\n00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:11.215\nI can see that you are part of the same\nextended service set identifiers so\n\n142\n00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:12.995\nit starts to manage these devices.\n\n143\n00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.815\nAnd that's essentially what\nthe extended service set is.\n\n144\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.060\nWhen you first see it,\nit seems like it's a little technical.\n\n145\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.630\nBut it's not.\nIt's essentially two access points\n\n146\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.100\nthat are responding to\nthe same service identifier.\n\n147\n00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.740\nAnd they're both managing devices in\na larger network, greater coverage area.\n\n148\n00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.090\nBut again, they're giving your wireless\ndevices access to your wireless network.\n\n149\n00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.820\nNow the other thing that we also have to\nkeep in mind is that If I do not have\n\n150\n00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:44.070\nan access point, and honestly, I don't\neven have a distribution system, right?\n\n151\n00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.800\nWe don't even have to\nhave a wireless network.\n\n152\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.300\nIf I have no managing device on a network,\n\n153\n00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.150\nI have what's known as\nan independent basic service set.\n\n154\n00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.835\nIt's also ad hoc mode.\n\n155\n00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:59.030\nAnd this is where your computers can form\ntheir own mesh-type wireless network.\n\n156\n00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.751\nAnd remember,\nwe're talking about mesh mode.\n\n157\n00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:03.042\nMesh topologies.\n\n158\n00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.557\nYou don't typically see them in a wired\nnetwork because of the exponential\n\n159\n00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:08.119\nconnections that it would cost,\n\n160\n00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:11.490\nhaving redundant connections every\nother device within the network.\n\n161\n00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.430\nWell, guess what?\n\n162\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.589\nIf I'm in an area where maybe\nI don't have access to.\n\n163\n00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:16.727\nWell, that's a little redundant.\n\n164\n00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:20.807\nAccess to an access point,\nyou can start a ad-hoc mode or\n\n165\n00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:23.360\nan independent basic service set.\n\n166\n00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.550\nAnd that's independent.\n\n167\n00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:30.500\nAnd if you need a way to remember\nit on the exam independent of NAP.\n\n168\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.900\nSo those are a little bit about\nthe wireless local area networks.\n\n169\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.860\nNow there are some other technologies\nthat I also wanna talk about that they\n\n170\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.900\nmention here.\n\n171\n00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.560\nNow understand that I'm putting some of\nthese technologies under the personal area\n\n172\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.716\nnetwork, because they do kind of\nform their own mini networks, right.\n\n173\n00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:49.050\nWhat is a PAN?\n\n174\n00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.293\nWell, you're gonna say that's\nsomething you fry an egg in, or\n\n175\n00:08:52.293 --> 00:08:56.270\nI don't know, a kid that's flying away\nfrom a pirate named Hook, not right.\n\n176\n00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.580\nReally, no, it's a Personal Area Network.\n\n177\n00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.230\nA personal area network is typically\n\n178\n00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.060\njust a few computers that\na single person is using.\n\n179\n00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.750\nHence the term personal area network,\nright, and there's wired and\n\n180\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.500\nthere's also a WPAN.\n\n181\n00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.500\nWireless Personal Area Network too.\n\n182\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.480\nNow you probably are more familiar today\nwith the wireless personal area network\n\n183\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.190\nthen maybe your are with\na personal area network.\n\n184\n00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.580\nWell why do I say that?\n\n185\n00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.600\nWell you've probably seen\nthings like Bluetooth.\n\n186\n00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.780\nI know Justin you use Bluetooth heavily.\n\n187\n00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.545\nI know I use it.\n\n188\n00:09:29.545 --> 00:09:33.095\nFairly easy to get devices paired up.\n\n189\n00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:35.445\nSometimes it can give you a problem but\nfor\n\n190\n00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:38.795\nthe most part it's a simple pairing\nprocess and it's wireless communication.\n\n191\n00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:41.335\nWell what's the wired side of this?\n\n192\n00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:44.475\nWell USB, believe it or not but\nUSB, the Universal Serial Bus,\n\n193\n00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:46.890\nis actually a mini networking protocol.\n\n194\n00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.274\nNow what,\nyou say well what do you mean there?\n\n195\n00:09:49.274 --> 00:09:54.220\n127 devices believe it or\nnot can be connected to a single host.\n\n196\n00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.380\nNow those of you that know your binary\nmight say well wait a second, 127.\n\n197\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.410\nThat doesn't sound like a binary number.\n\n198\n00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.620\n128 does though, right?\n\n199\n00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.210\nSo what happened to the extra bit?\n\n200\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.485\nOr member 0 accounts.\n\n201\n00:10:04.485 --> 00:10:07.717\nThe only reason we say 127 devices,\nnot 128,\n\n202\n00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:11.860\nis cuz one of those bits is reserved for\nthe host controller.\n\n203\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.540\nThe device that is actually managing\nall the other secondary devices.\n\n204\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.250\nYou might hear the term,\nwhat do they call it, master slave.\n\n205\n00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.160\nI hate that term.\n\n206\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.680\nThose terms should go by the wayside.\n\n207\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.450\nA lot of times what I do is I replace\nit with primary and secondary.\n\n208\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.880\nThe primary devices is what's\ncontrolling the secondary devices.\n\n209\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.940\nWell guess what?\n\n210\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.940\nIEEE 1394,\nmaybe you haven't heard of that.\n\n211\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.515\nThose of you that are coming over\nfrom your A+ training moving on into\n\n212\n00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:37.840\nNet+ should be aware of this.\n\n213\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.820\nThat's firewire.\n\n214\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.620\nThat's all due to Apple's marketing and\nstuff.\n\n215\n00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.920\nBut the IEEE standard 1394 same thing,\nright.\n\n216\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.750\nYou got up to 63 devices\nconnected to a port.\n\n217\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.920\nAnd we could probably even put\nThunderbolt in here today.\n\n218\n00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.560\nIt's not called that formally on the exam,\nbut\n\n219\n00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040\nyou could throw a Thunderbolt in here too.\n\n220\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.700\nBecause you can daisy chain wired devices,\nright?\n\n221\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.140\nSo that's the wired personal area network.\n\n222\n00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.340\nThe wireless personal area networks that\nwe talk about are things like Bluetooth.\n\n223\n00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.450\nBluetooth is one of the most common and\nit's been around for a very long time.\n\n224\n00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:14.510\nIn fact, maybe you didn't realize it,\nit goes all the way back to 2002.\n\n225\n00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.250\nWe have different versions that I\nwant you to be aware of some of their\n\n226\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.920\ncharacteristics, just in case\nthey ask you on the exam.\n\n227\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.520\nRemember that with the CompTIA exams,\nspecifications mean a lot so\n\n228\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.980\nyou have to know these.\n\n229\n00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.580\nSometimes the sheer memorization.\n\n230\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.330\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive into Bluetooth.\n\n231\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.070\nBluetooth is a very simplistic\nway to set up communications, and\n\n232\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:44.040\none of the things that Bluetooth does is\nit operates in the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n233\n00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.050\nIt's that ISM band that we talked about,\nthe industrial, scientifical, and\n\n234\n00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:47.940\nmedical band.\n\n235\n00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.080\nSo it operates in the same frequency\nrange, if you will, of other technologies,\n\n236\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.790\nlike for instance, WiFi.\n\n237\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:12:00.220\nThe versions that we have, going back to\n2002, the very first version, version one.\n\n238\n00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:07.220\nVersion one, it's actually a one megabyte,\nif you will, or a one megabit connection.\n\n239\n00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.212\nAnd it's actually broken\nup in the two channels.\n\n240\n00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:16.690\nIt's broken up into 768k data channel,\nI know I got to look at my notes.\n\n241\n00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.770\nI'll have to correct my notes here, that\nwe leave for you guys in the episodes.\n\n242\n00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.390\nBut it's a 768k data channel.\n\n243\n00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.920\nThat was what was reserved for\n\n244\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.900\ndata, because you also had a voice\ncommunication part of that,\n\n245\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.830\nthat was about 232-ish kilobits for\nan overall 1 megabit transfer speed.\n\n246\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.460\nNow there were some of the things that\nI want you to remember is that when\n\n247\n00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.880\nthe very first version came out,\nwe lacked what we have today with\n\n248\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.710\nall the versions after that, and\nit was a bad security vulnerability.\n\n249\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.710\nReally easy to get into things like\nBluesnarping and Bluejacking back\n\n250\n00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.580\nin those earlier days, you could still\ndo it today but it's a lot more complex.\n\n251\n00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.890\nThe fact was,\nthere was no secure pairing, all right.\n\n252\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.350\nWhen these devices would pair up together,\nthere was no way to secure that.\n\n253\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:06.370\nSo it did lend itself to attack.\n\n254\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:14.690\nAnd that's what in 2005,\nthe 1.2 standard would solve, all right.\n\n255\n00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.140\nIt would introduce secure pairing.\n\n256\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.770\nThat's one of the big differences, right?\n\n257\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.800\nAs far as the communication\nspeeds go it's still that\n\n258\n00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.860\n768k kilobit per second data channel,\nall right?\n\n259\n00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.230\nBut it did introduce the secure pairing.\n\n260\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:35.180\nNow in 2004 they would release\nsomething known as the Bluetooth and\n\n261\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.570\nit would be 2.0 plus EDR, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.470\nAll right, EDR, another acronym.\n\n263\n00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.425\nSorry to keep feeding you guys and\ngals [LAUGH] out there alphabet soup,\n\n264\n00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:45.890\nbut we're talking about\nenhanced data rate.\n\n265\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.790\nWe would go from 768\nkilobits per second all\n\n266\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.040\nthe way up to 2.1 megs\nover enhanced data rate.\n\n267\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.140\nNow it also supported\nbackwards compatibility,\n\n268\n00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.690\nand that's the other thing that\nI probably should mention,\n\n269\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.241\nis that it was backwards compatible with\nthe earlier versions of Bluetooth as well.\n\n270\n00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:06.578\nIn 2007, they came up with\na half-life type revision 2.1.\n\n271\n00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:08.338\n2.1 what that would do,\n\n272\n00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:13.440\nis that would increase the speeds if\nyou will to 3 megabits per second.\n\n273\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.330\nAll right, now both of these,\n2.0 and 2.1 also had secure pairing.\n\n274\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.070\nBut here's where I want you to start\nunderstanding the distances, right?\n\n275\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.180\nBecause that's one of the things they\nwant you to know about Bluetooth\n\n276\n00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.080\ntechnologies too.\n\n277\n00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.880\nHow far could a Bluetooth\ncommunication reach out and\n\n278\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.450\ncommunicate with another device.\n\n279\n00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.020\nIf we said, all things were perfect,\nall conditions,\n\n280\n00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.390\nwireless communications have many factors\nthat can reduce the distance in them.\n\n281\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.170\nYou increase the gain of the signal.\n\n282\n00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.520\nGuess what?\nYou're gonna reduce the distance.\n\n283\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.200\nYou put an interference in there,\n\n284\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.040\nwe get radio frequency interference in\nthe way, we get fluorescent lighting.\n\n285\n00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.240\nA lot of factors can come in to play.\n\n286\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.110\nSo I want you to know the theoretical\nmaximums for the exam.\n\n287\n00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.880\nIt doesn't mean, in performance, in the\nreal world, that you'll actually get this,\n\n288\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.770\nbut you can get up to 10 meters for\nboth 2 and 2.1, all right.\n\n289\n00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.350\nThat is our common range.\n\n290\n00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.910\nActually, it's pretty\nmuch our common range for\n\n291\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:09.090\nall of these Bluetooth standards is\nthat it's about 32.8 feet, all right.\n\n292\n00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.070\nNow, I don't know which one they're\ngonna give you on the exam.\n\n293\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.765\nAnd I'm not one of these ones that can go\nfrom the imperial system to metric and\n\n294\n00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:15.315\nback, right.\n\n295\n00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:20.050\nBut there is one that I always know and\nI've always told our students.\n\n296\n00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.140\nYou should know this, 10 meters.\n\n297\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.390\nHow about we start out with 1 meter.\n\n298\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:30.220\nIf they say it's a 1 meter\ntransmission distance, 3.28 feet.\n\n299\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.940\nIf it's 10 meters, well,\nguess what, it's 32.8 feet.\n\n300\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.620\nIf it's 100 meters, you're just\nmoving the decimal point, right?\n\n301\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.170\nIt's gonna be 328 feet.\n\n302\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.600\nNow, I just want you to remember that\nbecause a lot of the technologies that we\n\n303\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.380\ntalk about across the entire\nnet plus deal in those 10,\n\n304\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.025\n1 meter 10 meter and\n100 meter ranges, right?\n\n305\n00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:53.103\nEthernet cable, maximum distance\nis 100 meters, or 328 feet, so\n\n306\n00:15:53.103 --> 00:15:56.614\nthat's a commonality that I want\nyou to remember for the exam.\n\n307\n00:15:56.614 --> 00:16:01.098\nIn 2009, they would come out was\nsomething known as Bluetooth.\n\n308\n00:16:01.098 --> 00:16:03.390\nVersion 3.0 HS.\n\n309\n00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.072\nHS just stands for High Speed.\n\n310\n00:16:06.072 --> 00:16:10.680\nThey're basically just\nincreasing the speeds.\n\n311\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.909\nNow, this is kind of mind boggling,\ncuz they went from the earlier one,\n\n312\n00:16:15.909 --> 00:16:22.540\nthe 2.1 EDR being 3 mbps, I'll let\nthe 24 mbps, which is pretty impressive.\n\n313\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.968\nNow up until this point,\n\n314\n00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:28.630\nup until 3.0, one of the things that we\nhad to worry about with bluetooth, and\n\n315\n00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.630\nall bluetooth communications, was the fact\nthat it was very, very power hungry.\n\n316\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.900\nYou just like to scrape and scrape that\npower, because what was interesting is\n\n317\n00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.500\nthe protocol underneath, when you go\nthrough the pairing process, right, and\n\n318\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.910\nthese devices they essentially\nthey do a handshake, and they\n\n319\n00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.360\nbasically form this trust relationship and\nthe communication's protected.\n\n320\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.700\nWell the problem with bluetooth is\nthat even though that communication,\n\n321\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.090\nthat pairing process had happened,\nperiodically they'd have to repair, and\n\n322\n00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.810\nI'm not talking about fix everything, but\nrepairing up together, and every time they\n\n323\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.380\nwould have to do that, well guess what,\nthat's gonna chew up some power.\n\n324\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.110\nSo when 4.0 came out this\none was Bluetooth LE.\n\n325\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.134\nLE, if you don't know,\nstands for low energy.\n\n326\n00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:16.648\nIn fact, they were raving about it.\n\n327\n00:17:16.648 --> 00:17:19.869\nI remember the special interest\ngroup put out this Justin, and\n\n328\n00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.756\none of the things they were raving about\nthis is they said, you can power your\n\n329\n00:17:23.756 --> 00:17:27.706\nbluetooth technology with a battery\nthat's less than the size of a dime, and\n\n330\n00:17:27.706 --> 00:17:29.265\nit should last for ten years.\n\n331\n00:17:29.265 --> 00:17:32.700\nSo we're talking about, and\nthe thought process behind this.\n\n332\n00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.330\nHow many of you have had a cellphone out\nthere with Bluetooth capabilities in it,\n\n333\n00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.120\nand kept it for ten years?\n\n334\n00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.993\nSo essentially what they're saying is that\nthe bluetooth technology would outlast,\n\n335\n00:17:43.993 --> 00:17:46.807\npower-wise, outlast\nthe device that it's in.\n\n336\n00:17:46.807 --> 00:17:49.850\nSo didn't really change the speed.\n\n337\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.630\nSo 3.0 and 4.0 all have that\n24 megabit transfer speed.\n\n338\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.093\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, I've got a quick question\nabout that low energy portion.\n\n339\n00:17:57.093 --> 00:18:01.381\nIs that kind of a theoretical, there's\na lot of factors that come into play, and\n\n340\n00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:05.165\nI might actually use more energy, or\nis it like pretty staunchly said,\n\n341\n00:18:05.165 --> 00:18:07.436\nhey, we've reduced it by a factor of ten,\n\n342\n00:18:07.436 --> 00:18:11.373\nas far as energy usage during these\nhandshakes and maintenance periods?\n\n343\n00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:13.770\n&gt;&gt; It's the one thing\nthat isn't theoretical.\n\n344\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.950\nIt actually is a low powered\nimplementation, and as of 2017,\n\n345\n00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:22.200\nI know we don't like to put\ntimeframes on these, but I have to,\n\n346\n00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.790\nbecause 5.0's in the works right now.\n\n347\n00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.785\nSo you don't have to worry about 5.0,\nbecause it's still in draft mode, but\n\n348\n00:18:28.785 --> 00:18:31.722\nyeah, that is one of those\nthings where it's not ranges and\n\n349\n00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:35.466\ndistances where it's like, okay,\nwell I put a metal building in the way.\n\n350\n00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:37.471\n[LAUGH] Well,\nyou're not gonna get the same distance,\n\n351\n00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.960\nbecause there's a building in the way.\n\n352\n00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.741\nSo great question there.\n\n353\n00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:43.666\nAll right, now,\nsome of the other ones that we have here,\n\n354\n00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:47.727\nthat was just one, and that's one of the\nones that have a lot of specifications,\n\n355\n00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.730\ncuz of a lot of the different versions.\n\n356\n00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.457\nSome of these other ones here like Z-Wave,\nZ-Wave is a great technology.\n\n357\n00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:55.190\nMaybe you've seen it before.\n\n358\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.698\nIt started back in 2001, and\none of the main usages for\n\n359\n00:18:59.698 --> 00:19:03.201\nZ-Wave really is home automation, right?\n\n360\n00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:06.582\nAn example would be things like light\nsensor controls within your homes and\n\n361\n00:19:06.582 --> 00:19:09.880\nstuff, and there's all kinds\nof different implementations.\n\n362\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.393\nOne of the really cool things about\nthe Z-Wave technology is that,\n\n363\n00:19:13.393 --> 00:19:16.966\njust like we talk about the OSI has\ndifferent layers, the OSI model,\n\n364\n00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:20.725\nwell it's great, cuz the designers,\nthe engineers behind the stuff,\n\n365\n00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:23.401\nall these protocols are just\nbrilliant geniuses.\n\n366\n00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:27.413\nIs that they actually put an inner\noperability layer in there that says,\n\n367\n00:19:27.413 --> 00:19:31.691\nif you follow, whether you're developing\nthe software, you're building\n\n368\n00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:36.491\nthe devices that the software is gonna run\non, if you develop to the Z-Wave standard,\n\n369\n00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:40.620\nall devices will be interoperable,\nand that's one of the great things.\n\n370\n00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.850\nRemember that's one of reasons\nthat we kind of stress standards.\n\n371\n00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:49.009\nStandards aren't put in place to make\nComptia candidates just blow their minds\n\n372\n00:19:49.009 --> 00:19:54.566\nwith all these different specifications,\nbut it's about that interoperability.\n\n373\n00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:59.169\nNow understand that it's a low latency\ntransmission, and we're talking very,\n\n374\n00:19:59.169 --> 00:20:00.645\nvery small data packets.\n\n375\n00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:04.225\nIt also operates in the ISM band as well.\n\n376\n00:20:04.225 --> 00:20:10.810\nIt operates at right around\n908.42 MHz here in North America.\n\n377\n00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.340\nIn Europe and other countries,\nit's gonna be slightly different.\n\n378\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.204\nIt's got a 30 meter range.\n\n379\n00:20:16.204 --> 00:20:20.334\nAll right, so be aware of that too, and\none of the cool things that I really like\n\n380\n00:20:20.334 --> 00:20:24.714\nabout this, and I know that when it comes\nto things like Internet of things, cuz all\n\n381\n00:20:24.714 --> 00:20:29.535\nof these technologies, that's essentially\nwhat they're supporting, and I know Justin\n\n382\n00:20:29.535 --> 00:20:33.690\nthat you've worked pretty heavily\nwith things like razzpies and stuff.\n\n383\n00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.497\nAnd one of the things I really like about\nZ-Wave devices is that, even though we\n\n384\n00:20:38.497 --> 00:20:42.899\nhave a 30 meter range, the messages\ncan actually hop up to four nodes.\n\n385\n00:20:42.899 --> 00:20:45.240\nSo they can daisy chain\nacross multiple devices.\n\n386\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.510\nReally cool technology.\n\n387\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.920\nHere's the drawback.\n\n388\n00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.794\nIt competes with cordless phones.\n\n389\n00:20:51.794 --> 00:20:56.914\nIt doesn't compete with Wi-Fi or\nBluetooth, but it does compete with other\n\n390\n00:20:56.914 --> 00:21:01.969\nsmall devices to as well, but mainly\nwith things like the cordless phones.\n\n391\n00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:05.874\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes I do have a clarifying\nquestion, I think I understand, so\n\n392\n00:21:05.874 --> 00:21:10.489\nif I can jump four nodes does that mean,\nif I have enough Z-Wave components,\n\n393\n00:21:10.489 --> 00:21:15.370\nat exactly 30 meters, than my effective\ndistance can be up to 120 meters?\n\n394\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.657\n&gt;&gt; You can extend it, and that's why, and\nthen one of the reasons they did the whole\n\n395\n00:21:18.657 --> 00:21:24.190\nfour node hop is they thought,\nwell that should be adequate for\n\n396\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.640\nanybody's house, as big as the house is.\n\n397\n00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.600\nNow, if you're an athlete and\nyou make a lot of money,\n\n398\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.120\nmaybe you need five or [LAUGH] six hops,\nmaybe you need to pair them together, but\n\n399\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.840\nfor the most part, they figure that that\nwould be adequate for the average house.\n\n400\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.619\nAll right, so let's see what else now.\n\n401\n00:21:42.619 --> 00:21:44.955\nOkay, so the next one we have in here,\n\n402\n00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:48.701\nit looks like we're going to\nthe study of bugs here, Ant+.\n\n403\n00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:52.090\nAnt+ is another wireless\ncommunication protocol, and\n\n404\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.380\nthis one's used all over the place,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n405\n00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.484\nIt's used in things like the medical\nfield, heart rate monitors,\n\n406\n00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.148\nmonitoring your vital signs and stuff, and\n\n407\n00:22:01.148 --> 00:22:06.416\nreporting that information over a wireless\ncommunication to a central nerve system.\n\n408\n00:22:06.416 --> 00:22:07.841\nNot your nervous system, but\n\n409\n00:22:07.841 --> 00:22:11.920\na central like nerve device that would\nbe monitoring all the sensors and stuff.\n\n410\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.867\nThings like your tires in your cars,\nthings like tire pressure.\n\n411\n00:22:16.867 --> 00:22:22.663\nHome devices, I know fitness monitors\nare a real big thing right now,\n\n412\n00:22:22.663 --> 00:22:25.423\nso Ant+ is also in there as well.\n\n413\n00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:29.056\nIt also has its own\ninoperability layer too.\n\n414\n00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:34.780\nSo, if, like Z-Wave,\nif these devices are developed and\n\n415\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.230\nmade according to the Ant+ standard,\nthen they should be interoperable\n\n416\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.130\nregardless of the vender\nthat you are working with.\n\n417\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.020\nOne of the things that it does is it\nuses asynchronous communication, and\n\n418\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.170\nthe reason for\nthe asynchronous communication, remember,\n\n419\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.160\nwe say asynchronous, so A, against,\n\n420\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.870\nsynchronization, so it's against timing,\nchronos, if you will, timing.\n\n421\n00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.570\nWhy is it against timings,\nany kind of synchronize timing?\n\n422\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.640\nWell that's because what\nthe designers wanted is,\n\n423\n00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.380\nlet's say that I have to send\na communication out to, I don't know,\n\n424\n00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.220\nlike any kind of device,\nany kind of application.\n\n425\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.664\nWe want it to be able to\nsend at any time it wants.\n\n426\n00:23:18.664 --> 00:23:22.988\nWe basically only make an over\nthe air transmission when\n\n427\n00:23:22.988 --> 00:23:25.430\nrequired by the application.\n\n428\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.639\nSo it's one of the reasons\nthey're asynchronous.\n\n429\n00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:30.486\nIt operates as well,\nin the 2.4 GHz spectrum, and\n\n430\n00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:33.660\nit uses something that we talked\nabout in another episode.\n\n431\n00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.261\nRemember we talked about code\ndivisional multiple access, and\n\n432\n00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:40.328\nwe talked about time divisional\nmultiple access, and\n\n433\n00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:43.878\nfrequency divisional multiple access,\nthis just uses TDMA.\n\n434\n00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:47.755\nSo in order to spread that communication,\nif you will,\n\n435\n00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:52.620\nacross the 2.4 GHz spectrum it uses\nthose discrete time slots, and\n\n436\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.333\nit just reuses the time slots,\nif you will, across that spectrum.\n\n437\n00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:58.880\nAll right, what else have we got, Justin?\n\n438\n00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.815\n&gt;&gt; Now, I do have a quick\nquestion about this AMP Plus.\n\n439\n00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:04.259\nBecause I think I've actually\nseen a device like this,\n\n440\n00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:07.077\nwhere it gathers a bunch of information,\nlike a heart monitor.\n\n441\n00:24:07.077 --> 00:24:12.035\nAnd then when it regains connectivity,\nit transmits all of this information,\n\n442\n00:24:12.035 --> 00:24:14.480\nasynchronous transmission.\n\n443\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.690\nThe one question, though, are there\nlimitations to these end devices.\n\n444\n00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.739\nLet's say I collect a lot of data.\n\n445\n00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:24.710\nIs there a bandwidth limit or\ndo you just have to wait until it's done?\n\n446\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.602\nDo you know?\n\n447\n00:24:25.602 --> 00:24:27.470\n&gt;&gt; No, honestly, I'm not really sure.\n\n448\n00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.021\nI haven't really studied on it that\nmuch if we had any kind of bugging down,\n\n449\n00:24:32.021 --> 00:24:35.721\nbasically, chewing through all\nthe bandwidth on that one.\n\n450\n00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:40.070\nAll right,\nlet's see what is next that we have here?\n\n451\n00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.550\nI guess we got a couple more,\n\n452\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.009\nwe've got one that's been around for a\nwhile there, and that one's IR, infrared.\n\n453\n00:24:46.009 --> 00:24:49.304\nInfrared is used in quite\na few different products.\n\n454\n00:24:49.304 --> 00:24:52.818\nOne of the products I can think\nof right now that it's used for,\n\n455\n00:24:52.818 --> 00:24:56.610\nis things like remote controls and\nany kind of IRDA-based device.\n\n456\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.134\nNow IRDA, just understand that the IRDA,\nthe infrared data association,\n\n457\n00:25:00.134 --> 00:25:04.061\nthey're essentially the consortium or\ngroup that oversee the standards, right.\n\n458\n00:25:04.061 --> 00:25:08.080\nWith the one common one that we use today,\nI always call it vFIR.\n\n459\n00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.420\nLittle v, FIR.\n\n460\n00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.454\nIts very fast infrared, and\nit operates at 6 megabits per second.\n\n461\n00:25:13.454 --> 00:25:19.210\nAnd essentially, what it does is it\nuses an LED to admit infrared radiation.\n\n462\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.940\nAnd then it goes and\n\n463\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.990\nit shoots through a plastic lens that\nreally focuses it into a very narrow beam.\n\n464\n00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:29.294\nThe wavelengths are akin to some of\nthe fiberoptic communications that we talk\n\n465\n00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:30.214\nabout, right.\n\n466\n00:25:30.214 --> 00:25:37.598\nWhen we talk about signal mode, fiberoptic\ncommunications, the wavelengths are 1330.\n\n467\n00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:42.491\nSo 1,330 nanometers or\nthe one that has the extremely long\n\n468\n00:25:42.491 --> 00:25:47.970\nrange fiber-optic communication,\nthe 1550 nanometers.\n\n469\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.760\nAgain, I'm not sure if they're\ngoing to ask you that on the exam,\n\n470\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.080\nyou just never know.\n\n471\n00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.647\nThey might ask you a characteristic,\nand if they do,\n\n472\n00:25:55.647 --> 00:25:57.823\nhopefully you're gonna be prepared for it.\n\n473\n00:25:57.823 --> 00:26:02.694\nAll right, we've got two more that we need\nto talk about, and I will go ahead and\n\n474\n00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.800\nmention the first one here, NFC.\n\n475\n00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.890\nWe're looking at NFC,\nthat's Near Field Communication.\n\n476\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.570\nA Near Field Communication essentially\nenables your portable devices\n\n477\n00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.440\nto establish a communication.\n\n478\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.740\nAnd all you have to do is bring them\nwithin a few centimeters of each other.\n\n479\n00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.833\nI believe the standard normally,\ncalls out like four centimeters, but\n\n480\n00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:22.748\nvery, very close to each other.\n\n481\n00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:27.710\nAnd also operates in the ISM band\nat around 13.56 megahertz and\n\n482\n00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.590\nthe data rates here very small packages\n\n483\n00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.550\nbout 106k on up to about\n424 kilobits per second, so\n\n484\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:42.840\nreally really small data packets, and\nagain I say small by todays standards.\n\n485\n00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.978\nAll right, last one, last one we need\nto talk about is RFID, and again, RFID\n\n486\n00:26:47.978 --> 00:26:53.614\nuses electromagnetic fields to identify,\nand track, and tag different objects.\n\n487\n00:26:53.614 --> 00:26:55.491\nIt operates at, it depends,\n\n488\n00:26:55.491 --> 00:27:00.894\nit's gotta couple of different ranges that\nit operates in, give an example of some,\n\n489\n00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:06.597\nyou can, they'll operate at an around 120\nK, all the way really up to 10 gigahertz,\n\n490\n00:27:06.597 --> 00:27:11.550\nso you can see there's a pretty wide\nspectrum that RFID will operate in.\n\n491\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.490\nSome of the common uses of it\nare like your smart cards for\n\n492\n00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.810\nsmart card authentication,\nthat's the 1356 that it operates at.\n\n493\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:24.250\nJust in the same range,\nif you will, and frequency as NFC.\n\n494\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.732\nYou can do things like for\ninstance, tracking animals, goods,\n\n495\n00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:30.340\npeople, if you want.\n\n496\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.650\n[LAUGH] Things like your contact list,\npayment systems,\n\n497\n00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.110\nif you've ever used those, where you've\ntouched your phone to a payment system.\n\n498\n00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.890\nAndroid Pay, Apple Pay, I think are some\nof the kinds that we have out there\n\n499\n00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:45.480\nas well as even your travel documents\nhave RFID chips built into them too.\n\n500\n00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.480\nNow, there is one that is mentioned,\nbut I don't have on the list.\n\n501\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.142\nAnd why is that, because we've talked\nheavily about it in other episodes, and\n\n502\n00:27:53.142 --> 00:27:54.302\nthat's 802.11.\n\n503\n00:27:54.302 --> 00:27:58.738\nGo back and watch our episodes where\nwe talk about each one of the 802.11\n\n504\n00:27:58.738 --> 00:28:03.652\nstandards just in case they ask you a\nquestion on it, but remember the 802.11 is\n\n505\n00:28:03.652 --> 00:28:08.940\ntechnically the IEEE's implementation\nof a wireless local area network.\n\n506\n00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, you've definitely helped\nus kind of ease through these variety\n\n507\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.920\nnetwork biologies and\nassociated technologies.\n\n508\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.080\nBut before we get out of here for\nthis part two,\n\n509\n00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.240\nare there any parting words that\nyou'd like to leave us with?\n\n510\n00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Justin, I got so excited with all\nthe different ANs, the LAN, WAN, WLANs,\n\n511\n00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.880\nthat I forgot a couple that are important\nenough, we've got to mention them here.\n\n512\n00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.120\nSo we want you to be aware of them.\n\n513\n00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.935\nIn fact, one of them, I've actually\ngot pulled up on my screen and\n\n514\n00:28:35.935 --> 00:28:39.087\nthat is what is known as\na Storage Area Network, a SAN.\n\n515\n00:28:39.087 --> 00:28:43.722\nUnderstand that a SAN essentially is\na way to aggregate drives together, and\n\n516\n00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:47.997\ntypically, what happens is you'll\nhave these, they call them SANs,\n\n517\n00:28:47.997 --> 00:28:51.878\nthe SAN device, right, and\nit will have a bunch of hard drives.\n\n518\n00:28:51.878 --> 00:28:54.610\nNow, where are these hard\ndrives are located is,\n\n519\n00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:59.200\nit really could be all across the network\nhence, the term storage area network.\n\n520\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.906\nAnd that what you'll have depending\non how you want to implement this,\n\n521\n00:29:02.906 --> 00:29:07.359\nusually, they're fairly expensive\nimplementations, we're talking starting at\n\n522\n00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:11.216\naround anyone worth their weight\nabout 50 to $70,000, right?\n\n523\n00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:13.744\nSo very, very expensive,\nhigh speed fiber optic\n\n524\n00:29:13.744 --> 00:29:17.840\ncommunications that's where we get\nterms like fiber channel, right?\n\n525\n00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.781\nWhat you'll have is, you'll have things\nlike your servers will have what are known\n\n526\n00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:25.568\nas HBA's, host bus adapters, and then\nthat will connect into fiber switches.\n\n527\n00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:30.066\nAnd you can see there is a whole bunch\nof spaghetti all over this diagram,\n\n528\n00:29:30.066 --> 00:29:32.965\nbecause they want high speed and\nredundancy.\n\n529\n00:29:32.965 --> 00:29:37.125\nSo you'll end up seeing that you have\nthese fiber channel switches, and then you\n\n530\n00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:41.467\nhave what's known as you switch fabric and\nyou can see enough lines there that almost\n\n531\n00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:45.843\nmakes some fabric, and then you typically\nhave redundancy into the storage array.\n\n532\n00:29:45.843 --> 00:29:49.337\nAnd that's essentially what\nthese storage network is.\n\n533\n00:29:49.337 --> 00:29:55.748\nIt's a way that you can give access to\nnetwork or network disks, if you will.\n\n534\n00:29:55.748 --> 00:30:00.528\nHard drives that are in systems that\ncan be distributed across the entire\n\n535\n00:30:00.528 --> 00:30:04.780\nnetwork or in a single enclosure,\ndepending on how you have it set up.\n\n536\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.331\nNow, one of the other ones that we need\nto be aware of is what is known as a MAN,\n\n537\n00:30:08.331 --> 00:30:08.897\nall right.\n\n538\n00:30:08.897 --> 00:30:12.411\nNow, a MAN is a Metropolitan Area Network,\nall right.\n\n539\n00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:17.908\nAnd a metropolitan area network I want you\nto think of it as really the geographical\n\n540\n00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:22.380\ncoverage area there is going to be\nkind of like a city, if you will.\n\n541\n00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.610\nThat's why they call it\na metropolitan area network and\n\n542\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.310\nI've got an example of a couple\nof different technologies here.\n\n543\n00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.160\nNothing really fancy here\nas far as the diagram goes.\n\n544\n00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:36.188\nBut metro Ethernet is one,\nbecause metro Ethernet is a cheap\n\n545\n00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:42.904\nimplementation that ISPs can provide\na service to business users, if you will.\n\n546\n00:30:42.904 --> 00:30:46.508\nThe other one is WiMAX,\nnow, I will say WiMAX,\n\n547\n00:30:46.508 --> 00:30:51.480\nWiMAX was part of that whole 4G\ntechnology long term evolution.\n\n548\n00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.940\nLTE is the one that actually won out,\nand that's what everybody uses today.\n\n549\n00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.905\nBut the wireless interoperability for\nmicrowave access or\n\n550\n00:30:57.905 --> 00:31:02.210\n802.16 was one of those\ncompeting technologies, and\n\n551\n00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:07.866\nit literally is what they call\na wireless metropolitan area network.\n\n552\n00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.970\nNow, a WMAN isn't called out on the exam,\n\n553\n00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.170\nbut if you're gonna talk about\na metropolitan area network,\n\n554\n00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.620\nyou'll almost have to talk about WiMAX,\nand WiMAX technically,\n\n555\n00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:22.990\neven though it is a metropolitan\narea network, type if you will.\n\n556\n00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.724\nIt is a wireless communication.\n\n557\n00:31:24.724 --> 00:31:28.594\nRight now, the last one that we have to\ntalk about real quick and is one that I\n\n558\n00:31:28.594 --> 00:31:32.711\ndon't have a diagram and I know that\nyou've worked for colleges before, so you\n\n559\n00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:37.216\nprobably understand this one really well,\nand that's campus area network, right?\n\n560\n00:31:37.216 --> 00:31:39.980\nHere in Gainesville,\nwe have the University of Florida.\n\n561\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.225\nUniversity of Florida has buildings\nall over Gainesville, and\n\n562\n00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:46.963\ntheir buildings are interconnected\ntogether their on network, right?\n\n563\n00:31:46.963 --> 00:31:51.816\nSo, a campus area network is typically\none of these networks that can span\n\n564\n00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:53.330\nacross the city.\n\n565\n00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.299\nBut it's under the control of a single,\nyou know academic institution, right, and\n\n566\n00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:00.585\nhence, the term campus area network.\n\n567\n00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:04.955\nUF, again, is a classic example of one\nof these cans, cuz they have, again,\n\n568\n00:32:04.955 --> 00:32:08.145\nbuildings everywhere and they have one\nmassive network that they're connected to.\n\n569\n00:32:08.145 --> 00:32:11.585\nSo just a few things there,\nJustin, that we had to wrap up.\n\n570\n00:32:11.585 --> 00:32:16.510\nDo keep in mind, though, for\nyour exam know these different networks,\n\n571\n00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.730\nknow the different network types.\n\n572\n00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.350\nKnow the technologies that support IoT,\nInternet of things.\n\n573\n00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.537\nAgain, things like your Z-wave,\nAmp Plus, right, Bluetooth.\n\n574\n00:32:26.537 --> 00:32:30.884\nWe've talked about 802.11 as well,\nand you should be doing good for\n\n575\n00:32:30.884 --> 00:32:32.930\nyour next Net+ exam.\n\n576\n00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.980\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, you definitely\nhave some added value there.\n\n577\n00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.643\nLeaving no stone unturned as we continue\nour venture into CompTIA's Network+.\n\n578\n00:32:39.643 --> 00:32:43.129\nWow, I messed that up, but\nwe are done with this episode, but\n\n579\n00:32:43.129 --> 00:32:45.290\nwe do have more on Net+ coming at you.\n\n580\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:46.930\nSo definitely stay tuned, so\n\n581\n00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.890\nsigning out for ITPRO.TV,\nI have been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n582\n00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.676\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n583\n00:32:50.676 --> 00:32:52.730\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n584\n00:32:52.730 -->

Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.030\nThe name of this episode\nis Wireless Technologies.\n\n9\n00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.300\nAnd we've asked Wes Bryan to come\non by and help us out with this.\n\n10\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.520\nWes, good to see you again, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.900\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.635\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at\none of the most prevalent communication\n\n13\n00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:33.979\ntypes in the world right now.\n\n14\n00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:35.930\nYeah, that's right, wireless, right?\n\n15\n00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.921\nIt is becoming more and\nmore popular as we speak.\n\n16\n00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.665\nAnd I tell you, there are just tons and\ntons of these devices,\n\n17\n00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:47.417\nmillions of these devices out there\nacross the global internet, if you will,\n\n18\n00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.580\non local area networks worldwide.\n\n19\n00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.887\nSo it is important as a Network+\ntechnician that you are familiar with\n\n20\n00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.650\nsome of the standards that\nwe're gonna talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.900\nNow speaking of standards, we're gonna\ntalk about something known as 802.11.\n\n22\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.540\nNow let's go ahead, step back just\na little bit and review a little bit.\n\n23\n00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.930\nWe've talked about Ethernet\nstandards in other episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.648\nRemember, Ethernet is an 802.3 standard,\nwell, what is 802.11?\n\n25\n00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:15.320\nWell, if you don't remember,\nall right, let's recap.\n\n26\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.910\nIEEE, the Institute for\nElectrical and Electronic Engineers,\n\n27\n00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.710\nmet in February of 1980 to discuss local\narea network communication technologies.\n\n28\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.100\nAnd bring some kind of formal\nstandardization to them, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.531\nRemember that standardization give us\ninteroperability between networks.\n\n30\n00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:39.276\nAnd that's what we want because, in those\nearly days, everybody was talking about,\n\n31\n00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:42.340\neverybody was inventing\nnetworking communications.\n\n32\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.500\nAnd it wasn't one-size-fits-all, and\n\n33\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.076\neverybody was doing things\na little bit different.\n\n34\n00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.820\nWell, they decided to standardize them,\nall right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.820\nMove forward now from 1980, February,\nthat's where 802 gets its name from,\n\n36\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.640\nagain, February of 1980.\n\n37\n00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.410\nBut move forward in time to\naround the mid-, late-90s.\n\n38\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.890\nAnd they decided that it was time\nto start with 802.11 standards.\n\n39\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.395\nAnd that 802.11 standard\nspecifies wireless local area\n\n40\n00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.600\nnetwork communications, all right?\n\n41\n00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.090\nSo when we talk about 802.11,\nI want you to realize that that\n\n42\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.465\nis wireless local area\nnetwork implementation.\n\n43\n00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:20.620\nAnd there are some\nvariations of it that have,\n\n44\n00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.980\nwe've gone through different revisions\nof the standard, new technologies.\n\n45\n00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.180\nAnd one of the things that you'll see,\nin fact, I got a little list here,\n\n46\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.615\nis that 802.11 is the overall standard.\n\n47\n00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:37.515\nAnd after that, what you have is usually\nthis letter that denotes which revision of\n\n48\n00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.196\nthe standard it is, right?\n\n49\n00:02:39.196 --> 00:02:43.114\nAnd each revision will bring new\ntechnologies, new features, if you will.\n\n50\n00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:46.020\nSometimes you'll have old\nfeatures that'll still be there.\n\n51\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.430\nBut as they develop the technology,\nyou'll see that we'll advance and\n\n52\n00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.030\nprogress with different types of\ncommunication features, all right?\n\n53\n00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.390\nSo what are those 802.11 standards\nthat you have to be aware of for\n\n54\n00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.402\nthe Network+ exam?\n\n55\n00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:04.707\nWell, a, b, g, n, and\none of the ones that is more current\n\n56\n00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:10.652\nat the time of this episode\nthat we're taping is 802.11ac,\n\n57\n00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:17.020\nwhich is one of the newer\n802.11 standards, all right?\n\n58\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.673\nNow when we look at these standards,\na and b, they were released in 1999.\n\n59\n00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:24.100\nBelieve it or not,\nthey were released at the same time.\n\n60\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.817\nThe b devices that would be out there\nwere a little bit cheaper when they were\n\n61\n00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:28.590\nimplemented.\n\n62\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.960\nSo they became a little bit more prevalent\nthan the a devices cuz the a devices were\n\n63\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.750\nvery expensive, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.050\nSo you wouldn't start to see some of those\na devices until about a year later or so.\n\n65\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.220\nSo people think that the b\nactually came out first.\n\n66\n00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.330\nWhen, really,\nthey were standardized at the same time.\n\n67\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.040\nIn 2003,\nthey came out with the 802.11g standard.\n\n68\n00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.240\nAnd then in 2009,\nthey come out with the 802.11n standard.\n\n69\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.188\nAnd then later, I wanna say maybe 2013,\n\n70\n00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:02.222\nI believe it was,\ndon't quote me on that one.\n\n71\n00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.760\nAnd if you know it's the newest one,\nyou'll be doing good.\n\n72\n00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.530\nThey came out with the ac standard,\nall right?\n\n73\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.320\nSo that's a little bit about the history\nand the timeline of these standards.\n\n74\n00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.578\nNow you might wanna know some other\ncharacteristics for the exam.\n\n75\n00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:18.010\nOne of the things that they call\nout is frequencies, all right?\n\n76\n00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.120\nNow on your exam objectives, they just say\n2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz frequencies.\n\n77\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.455\nLet's just stop there for a second.\n\n78\n00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:28.678\n2.4 gigahertz spectrum, that is the ISM\nband, the industrial, scientifical, and\n\n79\n00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:29.420\nmedical band.\n\n80\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.645\nThe 5 gigahertz band, if you will, is\nthe UNII band right, 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n81\n00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:37.055\nNow inside of this spectrum,\n\n82\n00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:40.825\nunderstand that it's broken up\ninto smaller sub-carriers, right?\n\n83\n00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:44.261\nAnd depending on how we combine\nthose carriers tells us what\n\n84\n00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:46.194\nour channel bandwidth might be.\n\n85\n00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:49.415\nAnd we'll look at the channels\na little bit later on, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:52.335\nBut know those are the two different\nfrequencies that some of these standards\n\n87\n00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.020\nare operating in.\n\n88\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.920\nThat is important for the exam.\n\n89\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.010\nLet's go ahead, and\nwhen it comes to frequencies,\n\n90\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.200\nlet's take a look at the top, right?\n\n91\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.668\nAnd that'll be the very first\nspecification we look at.\n\n92\n00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:06.775\nAnd when we look at frequencies, 802.11a,\n\n93\n00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:11.270\nwhen it was released,\noperates in the 5GHz spectrum.\n\n94\n00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.360\nb devices,\nthey operate on the 2.4GHz spectrum.\n\n95\n00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.280\nSo you also have to know a little\nbit about compatibility, right?\n\n96\n00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.080\nBecause one is operating\nin the 2.4GHz spectrum.\n\n97\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.350\nThe other is operating\nin the 5GHz spectrum.\n\n98\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.560\nThey're not compatible with each other,\nall right?\n\n99\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.500\nHowever, when they came\nout with the g devices,\n\n100\n00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.630\none of the things that they kinda had\nthe foresight to say, hey, you know what?\n\n101\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.660\nMaybe, when we come out with this new\nstandard, we really should make it\n\n102\n00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.850\ncompatible with one of the ones\nthat was so popular, right?\n\n103\n00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.260\nAnd I don't know if that's their actual\nthinking cuz these are brilliant\n\n104\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.010\nelectrical engineers\nthat design this stuff.\n\n105\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.597\nBut when they released\nthe 802.11g standard,\n\n106\n00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.792\nit also operated in the 2.4GHz spectrum.\n\n107\n00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:56.014\nSo compatibility, one of the great\nthings about the g technology,\n\n108\n00:05:56.014 --> 00:06:00.850\nit's standard when it came out is that\nit was backwards-compatible with b.\n\n109\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.540\nWhich means that if I brought\na brand-new network online,\n\n110\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.130\nthe g network online, guess what?\n\n111\n00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.851\nIf you had existing,\nwhich many people did, existing b devices,\n\n112\n00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:11.452\nthey could connect, no problem, all right?\n\n113\n00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:15.341\nNow in 2009 when the IEEE changed\nthe standard, if you will,\n\n114\n00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:20.150\nadded to the standard, actually, they\nwanted to make sure that you get improved\n\n115\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.000\nperformance with backwards-compatibility\non all existing protocols at the time.\n\n116\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.250\nSo when they released\nthe 802.11n standard,\n\n117\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.560\nwhat you end up seeing is that\nit is a dual-band technology.\n\n118\n00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.368\nThat's right, you have radios,\nor antennas, if you will,\n\n119\n00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:38.068\non it that are operating in\nthe 2.4 gigahertz spectrum,\n\n120\n00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:39.799\nas well as the 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n121\n00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:41.230\nNow what does that do for us?\n\n122\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.140\nWell, if we look at our chart here,\nyou'll see that the 2.4GHz spectrum,\n\n123\n00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.670\nthat means that n devices\nare compatible with g and b devices.\n\n124\n00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.490\nWell, it's also operating\nin the 5GHz spectrum.\n\n125\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.570\nSo it means it's also\ncompatible with the a devices.\n\n126\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.750\nSo they achieved their goal.\n\n127\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.970\nThat was their goal, to make sure that\nwe have backwards compatibility with\n\n128\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.640\nall existing protocols, right?\n\n129\n00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.570\nNow ac devices,\nthey operate in the 5GHz spectrum.\n\n130\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.849\nNow that doesn't mean, by the way,\nand not for that exam,\n\n131\n00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.325\nbut it doesn't mean that you might\nnot find ac devices that have\n\n132\n00:07:13.325 --> 00:07:17.810\ntwo radios in them that actually operate\nin 2.4GHz spectrum as well as 5GHz.\n\n133\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.790\nI know the one that I got at\nmy house will operate on both.\n\n134\n00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.571\nThat's not part of the ac standard,\ntthough.\n\n135\n00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:25.626\nThe ac standard says the 5GHz spectrum,\nwhy is that?\n\n136\n00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:31.295\nWell, the 2.4GHz spectrum is heavily used,\nit's oversaturated, right?\n\n137\n00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:36.172\nA lot of congestion,\na lot of devices use 2.4 GHz spectrum.\n\n138\n00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:41.565\n5GHz spectrum is relatively unused,\nit'll become more and more popular.\n\n139\n00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.900\nAnd it'll become more and\nmore congested as time goes on.\n\n140\n00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.597\nBut given the lifespan between these two,\n2.4GHz spectrum is very,\n\n141\n00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:53.219\nvery heavily used, so\nit can cause a lot of congestion.\n\n142\n00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:58.536\nSo those are some of the things that you\nhave to know about the frequencies and\n\n143\n00:07:58.536 --> 00:08:00.709\ntheir respective standards.\n\n144\n00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:04.509\nThe next thing we have to know is,\nwell, speed, transmission speeds.\n\n145\n00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:05.960\nWell let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n146\n00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.960\nAcross the board when A devices\ncame out they were operating\n\n147\n00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.620\nat 54 Mbps transfer speeds.\n\n148\n00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.230\nNow, very expensive technology, but\n\n149\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.210\ncorporate environment could justify\nthe cost, if you will, to get the speeds.\n\n150\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:23.430\nBecause if you look by comparison of\nthe day, it was five times faster, or\n\n151\n00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.970\njust under five times faster than\nwhat the B devices were operating at,\n\n152\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.340\n11 Mbps transfer speeds.\n\n153\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.500\nThe G devices, one of the things that\nwas really good about the G devices, and\n\n154\n00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.450\nkind of signaled the death blow for\nthe A devices.\n\n155\n00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.095\nIs that it not only operates in the 2.4\nGHz spectrum, but as you can see,\n\n156\n00:08:39.095 --> 00:08:44.050\nit also gives you the 54 Mbps\ntransfer speeds, all right?\n\n157\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.960\nSo again very, very good standard.\n\n158\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.400\nAnd you can see that they were increasing\nthe performance levels of these\n\n159\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.160\ntechnologies.\n\n160\n00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.297\nNow, the next one that we have is 802.11n,\nand\n\n161\n00:08:56.297 --> 00:08:59.870\n802.11n operates up to\n600 Mbps transfer speeds.\n\n162\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.112\nNow, that doesn't mean that in actuality,\n\n163\n00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:05.770\nyou know, in practical implementation\nthat you're gonna get 600 Mbps.\n\n164\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.412\nIt just means that\nthe theoretical upper limit,\n\n165\n00:09:08.412 --> 00:09:12.430\nthey gotta to put a capacity on\nwhat it potentially is capable of.\n\n166\n00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.500\nIt's really related to how many\nantennas you have in the device.\n\n167\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.750\nAnd we'll get back to that, cuz we've\ngotta talk about something known as MEMO.\n\n168\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.720\nNo, this isn't a little fish\nthat we're trying to find.\n\n169\n00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.420\nThis is the multiple in,\nmultiple out, all right?\n\n170\n00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.265\nSo Finding MEMO, not the other one.\n\n171\n00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:29.540\n[LAUGH] But we'll get back to that.\n\n172\n00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.313\nNow, if we can look at the AC devices,\n\n173\n00:09:32.313 --> 00:09:37.450\nnotice that the AC devices up to\n1.3 Gbps transfer speeds, right?\n\n174\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.810\nWe're talking gigabit wireless.\n\n175\n00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:45.150\n1300 Mbps transfer speeds if\nyou want the other comparison.\n\n176\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:50.206\nSo, you can see that today, these wireless\nnetworks are pumping a lot of information,\n\n177\n00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:54.190\nand they have to, because high\ndefinition is very prevalent today.\n\n178\n00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.370\nStreaming media is very prevalent today.\n\n179\n00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.255\nAnd we're having more and more of\nthese devices on wireless networks, so\n\n180\n00:09:59.255 --> 00:10:01.430\nwe definitely need the bandwidth.\n\n181\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.110\nAnd increased bandwidth to make\nsure that these devices can\n\n182\n00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.410\noperate at the performance levels that\nwe're expecting them to operate at.\n\n183\n00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.410\nAll right, so\nthat is a little about speed.\n\n184\n00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.880\nNext thing that we have to know they call\nout is not only the transmission speed but\n\n185\n00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.030\nthe transmission distance.\n\n186\n00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.790\nAnd I've got some basic distances here.\n\n187\n00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.540\nI will tell you that sometimes\nyou will see variations,\n\n188\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.480\nslight variations on these.\n\n189\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.490\nYou might even see them measured\nin feet versus the metric system,\n\n190\n00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.370\nmeters, but I'll go ahead and\ngive these to you in meters, right?\n\n191\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.380\nSo A devices are 10m per range.\n\n192\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.210\nUnderstand that that increased speed was\ngreat, but it was a really short range.\n\n193\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.700\nHowever, the B and the G devices, we're\ntalking about 100m, right, or 328 feet.\n\n194\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.690\nWhen you get to N, you're talking about\nbeyond 200m, same thing with AC devices.\n\n195\n00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.310\nHowever, I will tell you,\nwhether you're indoors or\n\n196\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:02.240\noutdoors has a heavy effect on, you know,\nhow far the distance is, right?\n\n197\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.400\nA lot of manufacturers don't\nlike to quote distances.\n\n198\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.070\nJust because there are things that,\nif they do quote you a distance, and\n\n199\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.140\nyou don't get that range\nbecause of obstacles,\n\n200\n00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.298\nbecause of interference,\nbecause of placement of the access point.\n\n201\n00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.217\nThen you could think that\nmaybe their devices are,\n\n202\n00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:18.040\nyou know,\nsubpar performance when in actuality,\n\n203\n00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.970\nit's just because there's a lot of\nthings that are hindering the signal.\n\n204\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.845\nAll right, so, definitely want you to\nknow those transmission distances.\n\n205\n00:11:25.845 --> 00:11:28.465\nNow, the next thing I also wanna talk\nabout briefly is something known as\n\n206\n00:11:28.465 --> 00:11:29.715\nchannel bandwidth all right?\n\n207\n00:11:29.715 --> 00:11:32.455\nSee, inside of like 2.4 Ghz, and\n\n208\n00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:35.285\ninside of the 5 Ghz you have\na range of channels right?\n\n209\n00:11:35.285 --> 00:11:38.865\nAnd we'll look more at those\nchannels in a second here.\n\n210\n00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.375\nAll right, in the earlier days\nwhat you would see is that you\n\n211\n00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:43.412\nwould get a 20 Mhz bandwidth right?\n\n212\n00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:48.980\n20 Mhz basically your overall spectrum,\nhow much of that slice\n\n213\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.080\nwould you get basically to communicate\nbetween a source and an endpoint, right?\n\n214\n00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.040\nIn the earlier days, things like your\nA devices and your B devices and\n\n215\n00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.758\nG devices for that matter operated\nin a 20 Mhz bandwidth, right?\n\n216\n00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:07.503\nHowever, when end devices came out,\nremember one of the things that I said is\n\n217\n00:12:07.503 --> 00:12:11.156\nthat backwards compatibility\nwith all legacy protocols,\n\n218\n00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:13.433\nincluding increased performance.\n\n219\n00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:17.937\nWell, that's because they've found\na way that in the end devices you\n\n220\n00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.700\ncould take two of those 20Mhz channels.\n\n221\n00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.250\nBy the way,\nyou're taking all of those channels,\n\n222\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.510\nyou can only have two\nof the 20 Mhz channels.\n\n223\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.910\nOr you can combine them together and\nyou can get a 40 Mhz channel, all right?\n\n224\n00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.820\nNow there is something\nthat I'm also gonna,\n\n225\n00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.730\nthere's a slight caveat to that too\nthat I'm going to come back to as\n\n226\n00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.000\nwell because it depends on what kind\nof mode your wireless router is in.\n\n227\n00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.600\nWhether it can operate at the 20 or\nthe 40 Mhz, all right?\n\n228\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.780\nNow if we can look at this slide here, so\n\n229\n00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.440\nnot only do we have A, B,\nG operating all at 20 MHz.\n\n230\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.930\nRemember, n can operate in 20 MHz or\nit can operate in 40 MHz, all right?\n\n231\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.287\nIf I want backwards\ncompatibility operate at 20 Mhz.\n\n232\n00:13:01.287 --> 00:13:04.332\n20 Mhz is going to be reserved for\nthe end devices,\n\n233\n00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:09.000\n20 Mhz is going to be reserved for\nthose earlier devices, right?\n\n234\n00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.450\nWhen AC comes out, check this out.\n\n235\n00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:16.530\nThe base minimum bandwidth is 40 Mhz,\nand then it doubles over there.\n\n236\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:23.166\nWe can take more, and this why it\noperates in the 5 Ghz spectrum, right?\n\n237\n00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:25.253\nWe can have a 40 Mhz bandwidth, or\n\n238\n00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:29.857\nwe can combine two of those 40 Mhz\nbandwidths and get 80 Mhz, or what is it?\n\n239\n00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:33.271\nThe total of, and\nI've got some of the totals down here,\n\n240\n00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.061\ncuz I can't remember these.\n\n241\n00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:37.620\nYou can get 12 40 Mhz, 5 Ghz channels.\n\n242\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.950\nYou can get six of the 80 Mhz, or\nyou can get two at 160 Mhz, right?\n\n243\n00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.920\nSo, just basically like channel bonding,\n\n244\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.196\nyou're just putting all of these channels\ntogether in one big communication pathway.\n\n245\n00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:53.720\nAnd it's increasing the overall\ncommunication speed that you get.\n\n246\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.200\nIt's one of the great things about doing\nthings like channel bonding or you might\n\n247\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.700\nhear it if you're talking about wireless\ncommunications, link aggregation right?\n\n248\n00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.780\nNIC teaming where I take\none gigabit port and\n\n249\n00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.460\nI team it together with\nanother gigabit port.\n\n250\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.550\nOne's for sending and\none's for receiving, so\n\n251\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.230\nessentially what you get is a two\ngigabit communication pathway.\n\n252\n00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.560\nWell that's essentially\nwhat channel bonding is.\n\n253\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.495\nEssentially when you go from a 20 Mhz\nbandwidth, take another 20 Mhz bandwidth\n\n254\n00:14:19.495 --> 00:14:24.880\nand you bond those two channels together.,\nnow you get a 40 Mhz bandwidth, all right?\n\n255\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.850\nSo, it's something that depending on how\nthey do it, sometimes they do it for\n\n256\n00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.440\nredundancy and fault tolerance.\n\n257\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.570\nBut in this case in wireless,\nwe're gonna do it for\n\n258\n00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.610\nincreased communication speed or\nincreased performance, all right?\n\n259\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.730\nSo those are some of the things that I\nwant you to be aware of when it comes to\n\n260\n00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.610\nyour bandwidth.\n\n261\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.520\nNow the other thing that I wanna just\nkinda go over again is the compatibility.\n\n262\n00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.405\nBecause they might set you in\na scenario where you have to find out,\n\n263\n00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:53.860\nis this device compatible\nwith this network?\n\n264\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.120\nAnd you have to be aware of that.\n\n265\n00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.800\nSo, if we can review\nthis chart one more time.\n\n266\n00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.390\nI want you to keep in mind that A devices,\n\n267\n00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.700\nthey're only compatible\nwith your N devices, right?\n\n268\n00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.660\nMy head's kinda covering this up here, but\n\n269\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:12.138\nyour A devices are only compatible with N\ndevices, because of the 5 GHz spectrum.\n\n270\n00:15:12.138 --> 00:15:16.480\nHowever, these 2.4 GHz spectrums, right?\n\n271\n00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.560\nYeah, they're a little different, right?\n\n272\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.930\nBecause the B devices G and\n\n273\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.260\nN all operate in 2.4 Ghz, they're all\ncompatible with each other, right?\n\n274\n00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.550\nAnd if you have to pause the video to get\nthis down and under your belt, do it.\n\n275\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.200\nThis chart right here,\nI've written down many times before, and\n\n276\n00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.770\nit has saved my bacon\nwhen it comes to an exam.\n\n277\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.900\nIt is the easiest way that\nI found to study this.\n\n278\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.000\nNow, that being said, N is backwards\ncompatible with all of them.\n\n279\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.355\nThe last one, again my head's kind\nof covering up here is the n,\n\n280\n00:15:48.355 --> 00:15:49.574\nn devices for AC.\n\n281\n00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:54.877\nCuz AC is only operating in 5 Ghz,\nthat does not make it compatible\n\n282\n00:15:54.877 --> 00:15:59.910\nwith A devices, it is compatible\nwith n and n only, all right?\n\n283\n00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.882\nAll right next thing I want to talk about\nis what is known as antenna technology\n\n284\n00:16:03.882 --> 00:16:04.820\nall right?\n\n285\n00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.630\nNow I've mentioned MIMO,\n\n286\n00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.800\nlike I said this is not a little\nfish that we're trying to find.\n\n287\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.360\nThis is multiple in\nmultiple out all right?\n\n288\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.210\nAnd what it means in the earlier days\nis let's say I was an antenna sending\n\n289\n00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.620\na communication to Zach, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:23.965\nIt was send the communication and\nwait to receive the communication.\n\n291\n00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:30.165\nSend the communication and wait to\nreceive the communication on an antenna.\n\n292\n00:16:30.165 --> 00:16:34.036\nNow what about taking more than\none antenna and sending and\n\n293\n00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:36.400\nreceiving communications.\n\n294\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.960\nThat's multiple in,\nmultiple out, all right?\n\n295\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.340\nNow it uses more than one spatial stream,\nif you will,\n\n296\n00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.290\nfor the communication and\nit allows us to send and receive,\n\n297\n00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:53.070\nif you will, at the same time which,\nearlier standards, we couldn't do that.\n\n298\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.260\nNow remember, if we can go back to this\nchart here, remember one of the things\n\n299\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.090\nthat I told you is that with 802.11 N\nyou would get up to 600 megabit transfer\n\n300\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:06.850\nspeeds theoretically and I said that was\nbased on how many antennas you have.\n\n301\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.141\nWell here we go with the streams,\nall right?\n\n302\n00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:13.013\nNo, not total protonic reversal,\nwhat we're talking about is\n\n303\n00:17:13.013 --> 00:17:18.340\nthe end devices would have four\nsimultaneous MIMO streams.\n\n304\n00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.480\nAnd every individual stream\noperated at 150 megabits,\n\n305\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.570\nif you multiply that times 4,\nyou'll get 600.\n\n306\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.470\nHowever, not all your device\nmanufacturers would put four streams.\n\n307\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.771\nOne of the streams might be done for\nerror detection and\n\n308\n00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:35.720\ncontrol of the communications\nwhere three of your antennas might\n\n309\n00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.971\nbe actually sending and\nreceiving the information.\n\n310\n00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:42.900\nSo it's really dependent upon how\nthe manufacturer implements it.\n\n311\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.894\nNow if we look here we've\ngot from 801.11 AC,\n\n312\n00:17:47.894 --> 00:17:53.124\nit supports MIMO and\nsomething else called MU-MIMO.\n\n313\n00:17:53.124 --> 00:17:55.789\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or M-U-MIMO if you will,\n\n314\n00:17:55.789 --> 00:18:01.042\nthat's multi-user MIMO, because not\nonly does this have the four streams\n\n315\n00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:06.280\nMIMO technologies that N does where\nit doubles the bandwidth, all right?\n\n316\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.871\nAnd that means 8 streams and\n\n317\n00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:12.390\nthat's where we get again up to that\n1.3 gigabit transfer speed, all right?\n\n318\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.855\nThat's multi-user multiple in,\nmultiple out.\n\n319\n00:18:16.855 --> 00:18:18.765\nEasiest way to think of this,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n320\n00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.055\ndon't let that acronym fool you, right?\n\n321\n00:18:21.055 --> 00:18:24.805\nIt just allows you to send and receive\ncommunications at the same time, right?\n\n322\n00:18:24.805 --> 00:18:27.885\nAnd then you also have things like\nadaptive antenna technologies.\n\n323\n00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:31.015\nAdaptive antenna technologies just\nmeans that we can do things like\n\n324\n00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:34.435\nif the access point supports it,\nit can do things like beam forming.\n\n325\n00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:37.307\nIt tell Zack, you know what,\nI can see you're over here in this cell,\n\n326\n00:18:37.307 --> 00:18:40.590\nlet me go ahead and point those antennas\nadaptively in that direction, right?\n\n327\n00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.415\nBut that's something I don't believe\nthat you have to worry about for\n\n328\n00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.600\nthe exam, all right?\n\n329\n00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.290\nNow, speaking of antennas, we've got\na couple different types of antennas that\n\n330\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.180\nthey want you to be aware of, all right?\n\n331\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.730\nOne of the ones that they want you to\nbe aware of really only does things\n\n332\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.160\nin a single direction and that's called\nunidirectional antenna, all right?\n\n333\n00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.907\nAnd I got kinda an example of\nunidirectional antenna, right?\n\n334\n00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:10.043\nUnidirectional antennas are ones\nthat have a beam, if you will and\n\n335\n00:19:10.043 --> 00:19:14.272\nit's focused, again uni,\none, single direction.\n\n336\n00:19:14.272 --> 00:19:19.368\nVerses an omnidirectional antenna,\nwhich kinda if you would\n\n337\n00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:25.250\nlook at a 360 degree pattern and\nit is important to understand that.\n\n338\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:30.080\nLike for instance,\nyou can take a piece of software to\n\n339\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.300\nfind out where are my\nantennas placed right now?\n\n340\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.850\nWhat access points do we have around\nthat aren't my access points?\n\n341\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.289\nAnd we can do something\nlike a site survey, right?\n\n342\n00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:43.487\nAnd when we do a site survey\nwe might wanna be finding out,\n\n343\n00:19:43.487 --> 00:19:45.960\nwhere do I place my antennas, right?\n\n344\n00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.470\nWell, I want you to see if I have\na direction antenna like say\n\n345\n00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.260\nthis right here, all right?\n\n346\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:57.845\nLet me see if I can grab that, there we\ngo, and I put that antenna facing out.\n\n347\n00:19:57.845 --> 00:19:59.725\nWell I am not really\ndoing much justice for\n\n348\n00:19:59.725 --> 00:20:02.385\nthe coverage of that,\nof that building right?\n\n349\n00:20:02.385 --> 00:20:05.425\nBut it might be good for the person who\nis in the van outside collecting your\n\n350\n00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.550\ninformation you know without\nyou knowing about it.\n\n351\n00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.555\nBut it is not really gonna do much for\nyour coverage right?\n\n352\n00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:16.730\nSo in this case I want you to know that\nthese antennas are directional and\n\n353\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.100\nthey can be unidirectional or\nomnidirectional, right?\n\n354\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.104\nUnidirectional you might say highly\ndirectional as well, all right?\n\n355\n00:20:23.104 --> 00:20:29.381\nBecause they focus that beam in one\ndirection where omnidirectional\n\n356\n00:20:29.381 --> 00:20:35.330\nagain radiates it in a 360\ndegree range if you will.\n\n357\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.634\nUnderstand that antennas,\n\n358\n00:20:37.634 --> 00:20:42.822\ntheir signal strength is measured\nin gain or decibels, right?\n\n359\n00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:44.778\nYou do wanna understand\nthat you increase the gain,\n\n360\n00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:46.430\nyou increase the signal strength, right?\n\n361\n00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.760\nIt doesn't mean that you\nincrease signal clarity,\n\n362\n00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.785\nit just means you increase\nthe signal strength, right?\n\n363\n00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:54.760\nAnytime you increase power on\nanything you also run the risk of\n\n364\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.560\nhaving electromagnetic interference or\nradio frequency interference, right?\n\n365\n00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.990\nSo definitely know the difference\nbetween the unidirectional and\n\n366\n00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.480\nthe directional antennas.\n\n367\n00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.948\nNow I did mention channels, and I wanna go\nahead go ahead and just take a second and\n\n368\n00:21:07.948 --> 00:21:10.154\nkinda mention wireless channels too,\nall right?\n\n369\n00:21:10.154 --> 00:21:11.909\nWhen we look at wireless channels,\n\n370\n00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:15.510\nI've got an example of our\n2.4 gigahertz spectrum here.\n\n371\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.840\nIf we take a look at that,\nyou're gonna see that we have 11 channels,\n\n372\n00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.200\nnow I know some of you out there\nprobably looked at a map like, or\n\n373\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.540\nlike a document like this, and\nI know what you're gonna say.\n\n374\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.380\nWes, I know there are 13 channels,\nall right?\n\n375\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.670\nWell, there are but\nwe can't use 13 channels.\n\n376\n00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.943\nHere in the States, we're only allowed\nto use according to the FCC 11 channels.\n\n377\n00:21:35.943 --> 00:21:40.916\n12 and 13 I'm pretty sure, I think it\nmight even be 14 channels now, I think but\n\n378\n00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:45.280\nthey're already used in Europe and\nthe last one's only used in Japan.\n\n379\n00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.960\nIt's only one country\nthat uses them all so\n\n380\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.330\nyou don't have to worry about those extra\nchannels beyond 11 for the Net+ exam.\n\n381\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.110\nWhat you do have to understand\nis that these channels,\n\n382\n00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.210\nremember I said they're like subcarriers.\n\n383\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:03.653\nYou have an overall range of\n2.4 gigahertz spectrum and\n\n384\n00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:08.913\nmore specifically is 2.412 megahertz all\n\n385\n00:22:08.913 --> 00:22:13.920\nthe way up to 2,462 megahertz, right?\n\n386\n00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.358\nBut, then take this overall range and\nchop it up into individual subcarries,\n\n387\n00:22:18.358 --> 00:22:19.982\nthese channels if you will.\n\n388\n00:22:19.982 --> 00:22:22.680\nNow, you're gonna notice that\nI have these color coded.\n\n389\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.390\nWhat's that about?\n\n390\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.410\nWhy do I have them color coded, right?\n\n391\n00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.825\nWell, it's not just making it easier for\nme, little bit maybe.\n\n392\n00:22:29.825 --> 00:22:31.755\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it also what it's doing,\n\n393\n00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:36.640\nI want you to notice that three of these\nchannels are typically what we used here\n\n394\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.860\nin the States, cuz they're\ncalled non-overlapping channels.\n\n395\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.980\nWe can use all of them, one through 11,\nyou really can but a lot of time\n\n396\n00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.850\nwhat you see is your wireless access\npoints will default to 1, 6, or 11, why?\n\n397\n00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.860\nThere's no overlap, and\nthis is why I color coded that, right?\n\n398\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.060\nIf you notice that the green channels,\n1, 6, and 11,\n\n399\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.810\nnotice that they don't overlap with\neach other, and that's great, right?\n\n400\n00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.140\nWe don't get channel overlap,\n\n401\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.770\nwe don't get signal congestion,\nit gives us better performance.\n\n402\n00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:12.530\nHowever, if I was to place an axis\npoint let's say channel 2 and\n\n403\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.980\nsomebody else is on channel 1,\n\n404\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.400\nnow we can have a performance hindrance\nbecause we are overlapping the channels.\n\n405\n00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.010\nSo you wanna remember what\nthe non-overlapping channels are.\n\n406\n00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:28.240\nNow you can see that inside of the UNII\nspectrum, the 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n407\n00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.444\nYou start at 5.1 or 5,180 megahertz\nall the way up to 5,825 megahertz and\n\n408\n00:23:34.444 --> 00:23:38.079\nthen they divide it from there on out,\nall right?\n\n409\n00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:43.005\nYou don't have to worry I believe about\nthe individual channels on here in\n\n410\n00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.870\nNorth America for 5 gigahertz spectrum.\n\n411\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:51.110\nThese are the ones according to the FCC\nthey're also regulated here in the States.\n\n412\n00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.990\nAll right, let's see so\nthat's got our channels here,\n\n413\n00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.609\nthat is definitely something\nwe needed to talk about.\n\n414\n00:23:55.609 --> 00:23:59.779\nI think one of the last things that I\nwannna mention Zach before we wrap this\n\n415\n00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:04.152\none up are just a couple of the cellular\ntechnologies that they want you to just\n\n416\n00:24:04.152 --> 00:24:06.659\nkind of To be aware of and\nthey call out a few.\n\n417\n00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:09.650\nSome of them maybe you've seen,\nmaybe you haven't heard of them and\n\n418\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.550\nthere are other ones out there by\nthe way too ladies and gentleman.\n\n419\n00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:17.511\nBut the three cellular technologies\nthat they call out, there's GSM,\n\n420\n00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:19.391\nTDMA, and CDMA all right?\n\n421\n00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.250\nSo what are these about?\n\n422\n00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.720\nJust more alphabet soup to throw your way.\n\n423\n00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.689\nLet's see if we can hand you a fork and\nteach you how to eat it.\n\n424\n00:24:24.689 --> 00:24:28.230\n[LAUGH] Global systems for\nmobile communication.\n\n425\n00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.820\nIt is one of the most popular,\n\n426\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.090\nhighly distributed cellular\ncommunications worldwide.\n\n427\n00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.750\nI think there's 210 plus\ncountries that use it, right?\n\n428\n00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.320\nTDMA, this is called time\ndivisional multiple access.\n\n429\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.500\nAnd when we talk about TDMA, I want you\nto understand that what it does is it\n\n430\n00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.970\ntakes your radio, we were talking\nabout those channels and stuff.\n\n431\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:54.220\nIt takes your radio frequency and\n\n432\n00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.350\nit divides those channels into\ndiscrete time slots, all right?\n\n433\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.780\nAnd then those time slots are allocated\nto the people that are using\n\n434\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.500\nthe communication channel, right.\n\n435\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.285\nSo, I could say for\nsomething like this I could say,\n\n436\n00:25:06.285 --> 00:25:09.500\nokay Zach it's your time to talk,\nokay Zach it's not your time to talk.\n\n437\n00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.150\nWes, it's your time to talk.\n\n438\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.080\nYou can use the communication and\nwe keep rotating through those time slots.\n\n439\n00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:22.670\nThis is a way you can use a single finite\ndomain and we can use multiple channels.\n\n440\n00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.350\nMultiple communications\ncan use those channels and\n\n441\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.640\nrotate through the channels all within\nthat same fixed bandwidth, right?\n\n442\n00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.710\nI can tell you Zach,\nZach it's your time to talk.\n\n443\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.040\nI can tell the next person.\n\n444\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.940\nNow, it's their turn to talk and\n\n445\n00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.650\nagain we keep rotating through\nthose channels, right?\n\n446\n00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.820\nSo, that's time-divisional multiplexing.\n\n447\n00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:46.260\nThe other one is CDMA, and\nCDMA is interesting, all right?\n\n448\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:52.444\nIt uses what's known as a spread\nspectrum technologies as well.\n\n449\n00:25:52.444 --> 00:25:57.105\nAgain spreading that information that,\nthose communications, if you will,\n\n450\n00:25:57.105 --> 00:25:59.480\namongst all those different channels.\n\n451\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.220\nBut it does it a little different, right?\n\n452\n00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.280\nIt doesn't use time slots, right,\nlike time divisional multiplexing does.\n\n453\n00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.400\nThis uses codes.\n\n454\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.960\nAnd a code I want you to think\nof as a language, all right?\n\n455\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.430\nThe sender and receiver,\n\n456\n00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.950\nthey have to be speaking the same language\nin order to understand the communication.\n\n457\n00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:20.020\nSo if I assign a code to Zach and\nassign that same code to myself, and\n\n458\n00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.580\nagain it's the underlying technology.\n\n459\n00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.800\nI'm not gonna do anything here, right?\n\n460\n00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.860\nIt's built-in to the technology and\nZach and\n\n461\n00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.060\nI can communicate within that spectrum,\nright?\n\n462\n00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:32.144\nIf somebody else, I give you an example,\nI love Mexican food,\n\n463\n00:26:32.144 --> 00:26:35.856\nabsolutely love me some guacamole now,\nlet me tell you.\n\n464\n00:26:35.856 --> 00:26:37.729\nBut if I'm sitting down\nin a restaurant and\n\n465\n00:26:37.729 --> 00:26:41.109\nwe have a family that's sitting next to\nme, and I wish I could speak Spanish,\n\n466\n00:26:41.109 --> 00:26:45.540\nI'm still wanna learn beautiful language,\nbut I don't speak Spanish, right?\n\n467\n00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.284\nSo if they're sitting next to me, and\nlet's say they're communicating, right?\n\n468\n00:26:49.284 --> 00:26:51.470\nThey're speaking in a different language.\n\n469\n00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:52.590\nIt's not meant for me.\n\n470\n00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.920\nAnd because I don't know that language\n\n471\n00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.980\nI can't partake in that communication,\nright?\n\n472\n00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.890\nThat's what a code is.\n\n473\n00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.270\nAll right, so when we say code\ndivisional multiple access,\n\n474\n00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.860\nyour codes have to match\nfrom the sender or receiver.\n\n475\n00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.200\nAll right and we can use multiple codes\nwithin that bandwidth, right, and\n\n476\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.390\nspread those different communication\nchannels based on the codes,\n\n477\n00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.550\nprovided the sender and\nreceiver have the same code.\n\n478\n00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.630\nThat's code divisional multiple access.\n\n479\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.970\nI'm just gonna throw one out here for\nyou guys and gals.\n\n480\n00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.930\nCuz I don't like leaving\nthis one this way.\n\n481\n00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.620\nCuz there's another one there, and\nthat's something known as frequency\n\n482\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.330\nFDMA, frequency divisional\nmultiple access.\n\n483\n00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.150\nI said multiplexing, let me back up here.\n\n484\n00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.220\nTime divisional multiple access,\n\n485\n00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.940\nthat's the A part there is no I\ndon't know why I said multiplexing.\n\n486\n00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.460\nMultiplexing in general says hey,\n\n487\n00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.550\nhow can I take more than one signal and\ncombine it over the same medium?\n\n488\n00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.160\nAgain, with time divisional multiple\naccess, it's discrete time slots.\n\n489\n00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.520\nCode divisional multiple access,\nits codes, languages,\n\n490\n00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.770\nif you think about them codes or\nlanguages right?\n\n491\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.700\nThe best way I can think of how to explain\nit, you don't understand the language?\n\n492\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.990\nYou're not a part of the communication.\n\n493\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.680\nYou don't have the code?\n\n494\n00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.280\nYou are not a part of that communication.\n\n495\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.440\nBut the last one I do wanna kinda\nmention even though it's not in the exam\n\n496\n00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:14.116\nobjectives and that's FDMA,\nfrequency division multiple access, right.\n\n497\n00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:17.332\nSo if I have one person,\nin fact let's go back to my diagram,\n\n498\n00:28:17.332 --> 00:28:20.730\nlet's say we've got all these\nindividual frequencies.\n\n499\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:27.561\nIt means I can have somebody, it's also\ncalled frequency hopping spread spectrum.\n\n500\n00:28:27.561 --> 00:28:31.916\nAnd this means that the transceiver, or\nnot the transceiver the transmitter and\n\n501\n00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:36.290\nthe receiver have to know beforehand\njust like codes, just like time slots.\n\n502\n00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.980\nThey have to know what the frequency\nis as they're gonna change.\n\n503\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.345\nThis goes all the way\nback to the late1800s.\n\n504\n00:28:41.345 --> 00:28:44.075\nAnd this would be where,\n\n505\n00:28:44.075 --> 00:28:47.165\nlet's say that Zach and\nI are communicating at this point.\n\n506\n00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:52.858\nWe're communicating on channel\none at 2,412 megahertz.\n\n507\n00:28:52.858 --> 00:28:55.475\nHe has to be on 4,012 megahertz as well.\n\n508\n00:28:55.475 --> 00:28:58.835\nBut then we jump up,\nall right, and we jump up.\n\n509\n00:28:58.835 --> 00:29:04.680\nNow, we're operating on 4,000 or\nexcuse me, 2,417 megahertz.\n\n510\n00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.510\nAnd we hop through the spectrum.\n\n511\n00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.860\nThat means once we hop to two or\nwe hop to three or\n\n512\n00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.360\nin this, case non-overlapping channels,\n\n513\n00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.900\nI go from one and I go to six, well that\nmeans in somebody else can use one, right.\n\n514\n00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.220\nWhy can they use one?\n\n515\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.820\nI'm not using it anymore.\n\n516\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.970\nAnd we can keep hopping through\nthe different channels.\n\n517\n00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:27.010\nAnd that's how you can have multiple,\nindependent communications within the same\n\n518\n00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.830\ndomain like that, cuz you're hopping\nthrough the different channels, all right?\n\n519\n00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.200\nSo those are some of the things and\n\n520\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.270\nsome of the technologies that we want you\nto be aware of when it comes to the exam.\n\n521\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.110\nRemember, I know it's a lot of standards.\n\n522\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.480\nI know it's a lot of specifications.\n\n523\n00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:42.660\nBut if you can get these under your belts\nnow, you're gonna be doing great for\n\n524\n00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.170\nthe next Network+ exam.\n\n525\n00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.650\n&gt;&gt; And you're very fortunate, because this\nis a video that you can watch again, and\n\n526\n00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.940\nagain, and again when it's finally\nmounted to our course library.\n\n527\n00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.730\nSo this has been Wireless Technologies,\ngreat episode.\n\n528\n00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.730\nIn fact, in the CompTia Net+ series,\nwatch them all.\n\n529\n00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.210\nThey're all fantastic.\n\n530\n00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.490\nWes did a great job.\n\n531\n00:30:00.490 -->

be\nlooking at some cloud concepts today.\n\n8\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.663\nAnd luckily, we have a very special\nindividual in the studio today to lead us,\n\n9\n00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.005\nto guide us to be, our one and\nonly, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:32.830\nHow are you doing today, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.610\n&gt;&gt; Hey, I'm doing great, Justin,\nthanks for having me back here.\n\n12\n00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790\nAnd that is right, we're gonna put\nour heads in the clouds, right?\n\n13\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.140\n[LAUGH] But more importantly,\nwhat is the cloud?\n\n14\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.990\nWell, the cloud,\nit's an interesting thing.\n\n15\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.510\nYou say, well,\nwhere does the cloud reside?\n\n16\n00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.720\nWell, the cloud resides a little here,\na little there, and really,\n\n17\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.280\njust a bit of everywhere.\n\n18\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.170\nEssentially what you're doing is,\nyou're paying a provider.\n\n19\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.500\nAnd you're using some form\nof their resources, right?\n\n20\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.445\nWhether it be maybe network components,\n\n21\n00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:03.150\nmaybe a way it'd be development\nenvironments, right, firewalls.\n\n22\n00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150\nYou're essentially paying\nanother provider, and\n\n23\n00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.280\nthey provide you with a service.\n\n24\n00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.400\n&gt;&gt; So as a real quick question about\nthose service, when you say service,\n\n25\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.800\nthat seems like a very broad term.\n\n26\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.150\nWhat are some services, that if I am\npaying a provider, what am I getting back?\n\n27\n00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.440\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question, Justin.\n\n28\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.740\nThe fact, I guess it really just\ndepends on what you need, all right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.000\nWhen it boils down, we typically have\nthree different kinds of services.\n\n30\n00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.540\nThree of the common services, I want you\nto understand that there are more and\n\n31\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.960\nmore services being added probably,\nas we speak right now [LAUGH] and\n\n32\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.800\nwe don't even know it.\n\n33\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.306\nBut they call out on the exam three of\nthe main services offerings if you will,\n\n34\n00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:43.773\nthat have been around for awhile.\n\n35\n00:01:43.773 --> 00:01:47.257\nThe very first one up we're gonna talk\nabout, you probably use and have used for\n\n36\n00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:49.130\na while and maybe you didn't even know it.\n\n37\n00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.600\nMaybe you didn't even know that\nthat's what you were doing, right?\n\n38\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.110\nI want you to think of your email service,\nall right?\n\n39\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.370\nI haven't really paid for\nan email service in a very long time,\n\n40\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.020\nbut I do get the ability\nof sending emails.\n\n41\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050\nWell, who is it that manages and\nmaintains that?\n\n42\n00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.860\nWell, it depends on which provider\nyou're talking about, but for\n\n43\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.720\nthe most part I use Gmail, right?\n\n44\n00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.000\nGmail, Google's Gmail if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.850\nBut we have things like Hotmail that are\nout, I know it's Outlook.com today, right?\n\n46\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.380\nYou have things like Ymail or\nyou just call it Yahoo Mail, right?\n\n47\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.775\nBut these providers are essentially\ngiving you a service basically\n\n48\n00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.404\nallowing you to use their application.\n\n49\n00:02:26.404 --> 00:02:27.980\nAnd that’s one of the fist offerings.\n\n50\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.430\nIn fact, Ive got a little slide here or\na diagram here and\n\n51\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.300\nit’s what’s know as software as a service,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.060\nSoftware as a service, you probably\nseen it abbreviated before, SaaS, right?\n\n53\n00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.780\nThis is where you have a provider and\nthey are essentially going to manage and\n\n54\n00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.290\nmaintain applications, and they're gonna\nlet you access their applications.\n\n55\n00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.560\nAgain, provided as a service.\n\n56\n00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.790\nNow sometimes you get a free services.\n\n57\n00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.060\nSometimes you don't have to pay.\n\n58\n00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.010\nBut on the business side of things,\n\n59\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.030\nif you're going like what we use here\nat ITProTV, we use Office 365, right?\n\n60\n00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.216\nMicrosoft's software as a service\noffering, or a portion of it.\n\n61\n00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.500\nRight, they have got a lot of different\nservices that they provide but\n\n62\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.680\nit gives you an example, right?\n\n63\n00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.710\nSo for instance,\nI can log into a web interface and\n\n64\n00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.180\nthat's one of the great things\nabout the software as a service,\n\n65\n00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.840\nis that a lot of times with software as\na service if we're using an application.\n\n66\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.490\nWe access it through a web browser,\nand that's great.\n\n67\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.010\nWhy, cuz the web browser is\ncommonly built into your devices.\n\n68\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.203\nMost of your devices that you use will\nhave some form of web browser build right\n\n69\n00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:31.858\ninto them.\n\n70\n00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:34.826\nNow, that doesn't mean that I'm\nusing software as a service that\n\n71\n00:03:34.826 --> 00:03:36.920\nyou're only gonna go\nthrough a web browser.\n\n72\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.568\nA lot of times they have stand alone apps\ntoo that allow you to perform the same\n\n73\n00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:41.595\nfunctionality, but\n\n74\n00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:45.375\nat least it allows you that functionality\nwithout additional applications.\n\n75\n00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:50.676\nThe one of the great things about this too\nis that, if you are using an application,\n\n76\n00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:55.320\nagain software as a service,\nthey're maintaining the updates.\n\n77\n00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.980\nThey maintain things like\nas the platform develops,\n\n78\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.910\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n79\n00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.100\nThey maintain it,\nthey give you things like redundancy and\n\n80\n00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.190\nfor the most part, a lot of times,\nyou don't even see outages, right?\n\n81\n00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.971\nSo that's a great thing and as a company,\nsometimes it's inconvenient if you\n\n82\n00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:17.534\nhave a very very small IT staff\nwhich a lot of companies do.\n\n83\n00:04:17.534 --> 00:04:21.513\nAnd maybe you don't want to\nmaintain an on-premise server.\n\n84\n00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:23.801\nAll right,\nthat's what we call a local resource and\n\n85\n00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.703\nthat relationship between local resources\nand cloud resources just essentially says,\n\n86\n00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:29.900\nif I have local resources,\nwe're gonna have to.\n\n87\n00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.980\nMy company's gonna have to manage and\nmaintain them.\n\n88\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.000\nIf I have an email server, and\nI want access to an email platform?\n\n89\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.370\nWell guess what,\nwe've got to deploy or install,\n\n90\n00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.360\nif you will, that email client\nacross every one of our devices.\n\n91\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.360\nThat's gonna connect back to our email\nserver, and then we're gonna have\n\n92\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.970\na system administrator that manages and\nmaintains that server.\n\n93\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.520\nWhich means there's a potential\nsomething could have down time,\n\n94\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.160\nif something on that server fails,\nall right?\n\n95\n00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.030\nSo that's another one of the benefits\nthat you are offloading that\n\n96\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.290\nbasically to the service provider.\n\n97\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.200\nAnd they provide that service for\nwhatever the fee might be.\n\n98\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.890\nSo that is one of the very first services\nthat I want you to be aware of, and again,\n\n99\n00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.850\nlike I said, you've probably used it\nbefore and maybe didn't even know it.\n\n100\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.370\nNow, the next service that we have\nis what is known as infrastructure.\n\n101\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.030\nInfrastructure as a service, right?\n\n102\n00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.240\nNow, with infrastructure as a service,\n\n103\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.350\nI got a little diagram here just to\nkinda show what IaaS does, right?\n\n104\n00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.105\nThis provides things\nlike your computation,\n\n105\n00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:30.590\nyour computer resources, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.920\nThings for instance,\nyour memory, your storage.\n\n107\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.330\nThings like network and communications,\nyour operating systems, your servers.\n\n108\n00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.500\nAnd you might be saying,\nthey give you a physical server?\n\n109\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.900\nNo, not really, because one of\nthe things you have to keep in mind\n\n110\n00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.940\nthat almost go hand in hand is\nvirtualization technologies which we'll\n\n111\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.490\ntalk about in other episodes,\nand cloud based technologies.\n\n112\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.470\nRight, I want you to think about\nthe ability to, or maybe you require.\n\n113\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.739\nYou require setting up a web server,\nright?\n\n114\n00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:02.490\nFor redundancy,\nyou wanna set up maybe a web server farm.\n\n115\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.240\nSo you wanna have multiple web servers.\n\n116\n00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.677\nWell, that takes a lot of money,\na lot of time, a lot of resources.\n\n117\n00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:13.050\nA lot of money has to be invested into\nthose devices, a lot of power concerns,\n\n118\n00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.220\nif you will.\n\n119\n00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.570\nImagine the ability to offload\nthat service to somebody else,\n\n120\n00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.970\nto another provider and they,\nin the background, have the servers,\n\n121\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.450\nhave the networking cable,\nhave the memory.\n\n122\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.300\nThe storage and\nthey maintain that for you, right?\n\n123\n00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.020\nThe other great thing about things\nlike infrastructure as a service,\n\n124\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.940\nis rapid deployment.\n\n125\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.564\nRight, I don't have to wait for a server\nto come in, sit it in the server closet,\n\n126\n00:06:39.564 --> 00:06:43.780\nstill in the box and let it acclimate\nitself to the server room temperature\n\n127\n00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.020\nbefore I take it out and\nthen we install it, right?\n\n128\n00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.690\nOnce we install it in the rack mounts,\n\n129\n00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.670\nthen we install the operating system,\njust for a single server.\n\n130\n00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.860\nIt can be a lot.\n\n131\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.510\nBut imagine the ability just to spin\nup an instance of a device and say,\n\n132\n00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.080\nI want this amount of memory,\nI want this amount of storage.\n\n133\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.340\nI want to communicate with this\ntype of device over the network and\n\n134\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.020\nwe're ready to go.\n\n135\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.790\nSomebody else is maintaining it.\n\n136\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.930\nThat's one of the greatest things of\ninfrastructure as services that we can\n\n137\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.370\nhave multiple operating systems,\ndifferent server platforms, if you will,\n\n138\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.010\nnetwork communications,\nstorage and memory.\n\n139\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.870\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, those are all incredible\n\n140\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.950\nkind of wonderful features of\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n141\n00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.380\nI think one of the things that stick out\nto me is, I actually gained access to\n\n142\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.530\nhardware that is updated and\nkind of outside of my range.\n\n143\n00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.920\nCase in point,\ndo a little bit of programming.\n\n144\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.198\nGPU computing is all the rage.\n\n145\n00:07:36.198 --> 00:07:40.900\nYou can actually gain access to\nGPUs that are 60 grand a pop.\n\n146\n00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.040\nWell, I didn't have to buy a GPU that\nwas 60 grand and put it in my server and\n\n147\n00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.270\ngo, I hope it works.\n\n148\n00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.160\nI can actually more or less rent out space\non one for a small fine just to try things\n\n149\n00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.880\nout, and I don't have to worry about\nall the shenanigans associated with it.\n\n150\n00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.096\n&gt;&gt; And most definitely, and\nyou could do it rapidly too.\n\n151\n00:07:58.096 --> 00:08:00.129\nAnd I'm sure you've probably\nhad to do that before,\n\n152\n00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:01.620\nwhere maybe somebody's called you and\n\n153\n00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.577\nsaid hey Justin, I need this program\nrunning on these machines at this time.\n\n154\n00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:06.600\nAnd they need to be available right away.\n\n155\n00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.072\nThat's the great thing as infrastructure\nas a service is the fact that you do have\n\n156\n00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:11.360\naccess to the technologies.\n\n157\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.680\nAnother one to kind of piggyback\noff of that too, Justin,\n\n158\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.640\nis when you think about storage, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.730\nI want a one terabyte solid state drive.\n\n160\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.600\nOkay, sure, no problem.\n\n161\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.680\nFor about 8 to $900,\nyou can have one of those and\n\n162\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.490\nyou can install them or\nyou can pay a storage tier.\n\n163\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.380\nYou can pay a little bit higher and\nthey got those.\n\n164\n00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.335\nThey got those solid state drives already\nin the background, waiting for you.\n\n165\n00:08:34.335 --> 00:08:39.320\nYou just need to pay them the extra\nmoney and for only what you need.\n\n166\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.080\nMaybe I didn't need a one terabyte,\nmaybe I didn't need a one terabyte SSD.\n\n167\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.540\nI only needed one that was about 500 gigs.\n\n168\n00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.460\nBut they only had one available, and\nat the time it was a one terabyte.\n\n169\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.810\nSo it alleviates that.\n\n170\n00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.260\nYou don't have to worry about\nthat underlying hardware.\n\n171\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.780\nI'm glad you mentioned that, too.\n\n172\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.680\nIt's the fact that you get access\nto the latest and greatest.\n\n173\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.820\nAnd the service provider maintains\nthe patching of the systems,\n\n174\n00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.720\nif you will, in the background, and\nthat's all transparent to the end user.\n\n175\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.810\nAll right, so we have one more and\n\n176\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:16.335\nI know this one I'm gonna throw back\nto you here in a second, Justin.\n\n177\n00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:18.660\nThis is platform as a service, right?\n\n178\n00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.340\nAnd platform as a service it's\na great offering here and\n\n179\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.020\nif you look, you don't just generically,\nplatform is a service.\n\n180\n00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.980\nIt essentially gives developers, right?\n\n181\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.180\nThings like application run time, and\n\n182\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.240\nexecution environment if you will, as well\nas the infrastructure to support things\n\n183\n00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.460\nlike computational resources when you\ncouple that with things like IAAS.\n\n184\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.910\nDevelopment teams, Dev teams, they can\nwork with a lot of the different common\n\n185\n00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.160\nprogramming languages that are out there.\n\n186\n00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.710\nAnd it makes it a lot easier,\n\n187\n00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.770\nwe can have our Dev team that has access\nto the environments that they need and\n\n188\n00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.390\nsometimes they don't even have to\ngo get our IT staff anymore, right?\n\n189\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.320\nBecause that's one of the things\nthat you would have to do.\n\n190\n00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.180\nWe talk about DevOps, right, operations\nand development team working together.\n\n191\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.345\nWe have to have an IT admin that's sitting\nthere waiting to spin up an instance,\n\n192\n00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:12.910\nwe're not even an instance, spin up\na server that supports the platform that\n\n193\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.180\nthey need for that moment,\nbut then what if it changes?\n\n194\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.570\nWell, now we've got to tear it down.\n\n195\n00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.160\nWe've got to put it in maybe\nanother operating system,\n\n196\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.510\nmaybe another platform altogether,\nin order to support something else.\n\n197\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.900\nSo it gives you that flexibility.\n\n198\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.140\nNow, I know you,\nwith programming and stuff,\n\n199\n00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.340\nhave you worked with things\nlike platform and service?\n\n200\n00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.310\n&gt;&gt; So,\nI can actually give you a comparison,\n\n201\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.040\nbecause I've dealt with some on prem\nstuff, where we have a server or\n\n202\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.710\nwe have a rack of servers and we're trying\nto do some computational expensive things.\n\n203\n00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.970\nWe have our raid array and that's all fun.\n\n204\n00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.602\nBut now every one of\nthose servers we have to.\n\n205\n00:10:46.602 --> 00:10:49.420\nAll I need to make sure\nthe Python runtime is there.\n\n206\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.496\nI need to make sure all\nthe versions match.\n\n207\n00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:55.100\nI need to, you know what, Server 2\njust went down, something messed up.\n\n208\n00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.240\nI gotta make sure that I\nreinstall the operating system.\n\n209\n00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.740\nCome back, make sure that Python matches,\nand it was a lot of maintenance.\n\n210\n00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.130\nAnd it provided very, it was more focused\non maintaining the infrastructure than\n\n211\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.180\nit was rapid development of these\ntechnologies that we were trying to,\n\n212\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.020\nessentially they were\nacross multiple nodes.\n\n213\n00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.060\nThey were like distributed applications.\n\n214\n00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.720\nWell, when we move to\nplatform as a service,\n\n215\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.240\nhey, I need something that\nwill run Python code.\n\n216\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.970\nAnd has this storage,\n\n217\n00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.730\nright, we used a little bit of\ninfrastructure as a service to do this.\n\n218\n00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.820\nBut once it was done, we could take it up,\n\n219\n00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.970\ntear it down,\nnot have to worry about anything.\n\n220\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.249\nIt was reproducible,\nit increased our run time,\n\n221\n00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:37.166\nit also from a business perspective,\nit allowed us to not.\n\n222\n00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:42.872\nNo offense, to not necessarily at\nthe time employ like sysadmins or anyone.\n\n223\n00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:46.443\nWe're just trying to do\nsome prototype in R&amp;D.\n\n224\n00:11:46.443 --> 00:11:51.666\nWe don't need someone going, what do you\nneed an instance now, or how about now?\n\n225\n00:11:51.666 --> 00:11:55.101\nWe can do it all ourselves until\nwe've figured out what we needed and\n\n226\n00:11:55.101 --> 00:11:58.832\nthen at that point, hey, we need you\nto maintain this, keep an eye on it,\n\n227\n00:11:58.832 --> 00:12:00.959\nmaybe pager duty, something like that.\n\n228\n00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:05.551\nBut it was incredibly empowering\nversus Server 2 went down in\n\n229\n00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:07.880\nthe server room again.\n\n230\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.510\nGo turn it off and turn it back on.\n\n231\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right, reboots fix everything.\n\n232\n00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.620\nThe great thing is you're gonna\nalleviate all of that stress and\n\n233\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.810\nyou can offload all of that\nagain to the provider.\n\n234\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.420\nYou can probably start to see that,\nhey, Cloud is here.\n\n235\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.590\nIt's gonna be around for a while.\n\n236\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.990\nIt's only getting bigger, if you will.\n\n237\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.950\nSo definitely be aware of those.\n\n238\n00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.890\nAll right, so next thing that we got\nto talk about is the delivery models.\n\n239\n00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.360\nWhen we talk about cloud delivery models\nthere are really three types that they\n\n240\n00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.760\ncall out, all right?\n\n241\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.870\nOne of them is public.\n\n242\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.840\nNow public cloud offering is\nwhere you have something like\n\n243\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.800\nMicrosoft's Azure, right?\n\n244\n00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.270\nYou have Amazon's AWS as an example,\nright?\n\n245\n00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:55.920\nWhere everybody has access to those\nplatforms and those services.\n\n246\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.130\nHence the term why they\ncall it the public cloud.\n\n247\n00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.270\nBut then you also have a private cloud,\nall right?\n\n248\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.000\nAnd a private cloud might be something\nI'll give you an example here, right?\n\n249\n00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.170\nWhere maybe you've got a company and\n\n250\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.310\nthe company has two local area networks,\nright?\n\n251\n00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.100\nAnd they have a few servers,\nmaybe a few databases, and\n\n252\n00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.190\nthey maintain all of their data.\n\n253\n00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.790\nThey let their if you will users and\n\n254\n00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.120\nthe development team, if you will,\nall access their internal resources.\n\n255\n00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.786\nNow, this is called a private cloud,\nbecause if this was my company,\n\n256\n00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:35.070\nright, and I owned it,\nI'm gonna maintain all the equipment.\n\n257\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.123\nSo you can consider for instance these\nhuge data centers that some companies own\n\n258\n00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:43.500\ninternally to themselves could be\nconsidered a private cloud, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.800\nNow you also have what's\nknown as the hybrid cloud.\n\n260\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:51.420\nAnd the hybrid cloud is another common\none where maybe you have a private cloud,\n\n261\n00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.035\nbut for certain things maybe you need\nto access the public cloud as well,\n\n262\n00:13:57.035 --> 00:13:59.045\nand, again,\nthat's why it's called the hybrid, right?\n\n263\n00:13:59.045 --> 00:14:03.175\nIs the fact that you're using\nsome private cloud technologies,\n\n264\n00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:05.405\nwhich is all the regular\ncloud technologies.\n\n265\n00:14:05.405 --> 00:14:06.985\nIt's just not accessible by anybody.\n\n266\n00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:09.400\nJust maintained internally by the company.\n\n267\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.070\nBut at the same time, maybe the company\nhas also figured out that hey,\n\n268\n00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.110\nthey could use some software as a service,\nright?\n\n269\n00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.240\nMaybe they don't wanna spend the time that\nit takes to deploy, maintain, and update.\n\n270\n00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.680\nYou mentioned updates there like\na productivity application.\n\n271\n00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.352\nSo we go ahead and we deploy it through\nsoftware as a service, we still get our\n\n272\n00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:34.316\nprivate cloud information and stuff\nthat's gonna be maintained internally and\n\n273\n00:14:34.316 --> 00:14:39.134\nonly accessible by us, but then we also\nget the public offering as well where we\n\n274\n00:14:39.134 --> 00:14:42.426\ncan go to something like Office 365,\nif you will.\n\n275\n00:14:42.426 --> 00:14:44.523\nGoogle Docs if you will as well.\n\n276\n00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:49.620\nAnd then we have portions of the public\ncloud that we're also accessing as well.\n\n277\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, Wes,\nwould you say that a hybrid cloud,\n\n278\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.390\nlike if I had an internal, on-prem,\nkind of everything set up, but\n\n279\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.460\nthen my backups are actually\npersisted to some cloud technology.\n\n280\n00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.780\nWould that be considered a hybrid\nkinda deployment process?\n\n281\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.767\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely and\nit's a great example.\n\n282\n00:15:05.767 --> 00:15:12.517\nAnd if you are maintaining, again,\nyour internal cloud service.\n\n283\n00:15:12.517 --> 00:15:17.157\nAnd it's not accessible by anybody else,\nand you're just taking those backups for\n\n284\n00:15:17.157 --> 00:15:21.861\ngood disaster recovery plan, right, and\nsomebody else is maintaining and managing\n\n285\n00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:26.082\nthose, then you could consider that\na form of a hybrid type delivery model.\n\n286\n00:15:26.082 --> 00:15:28.320\nAny time you mix private and\n\n287\n00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.575\npublic cloud together, you end up\ngetting what they call the hybrid.\n\n288\n00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:34.095\nNow with connectivity methods,\n\n289\n00:15:34.095 --> 00:15:37.045\nthere's a few different\nconnectivity methods that you have.\n\n290\n00:15:37.045 --> 00:15:39.845\nA couple of the common ones,\none of them I kind of had in the diagram\n\n291\n00:15:39.845 --> 00:15:42.375\nwhere it's a VPN communication\nthat you set up.\n\n292\n00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.588\nSo for instance,\nif it's a private cloud and\n\n293\n00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:46.745\nyou've got multiple local area networks,\n\n294\n00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:50.591\nyou've got a WAN link between them,\nyou could set up a VPN communication, and\n\n295\n00:15:50.591 --> 00:15:54.697\nthen you can encrypt all the information\nthat goes through the VPN communication.\n\n296\n00:15:54.697 --> 00:15:59.324\nYou could go to, like for instance,\nan internet backbone provider.\n\n297\n00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:00.728\nKind of like an ISP, but\n\n298\n00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:04.673\nthink about it as being- Way up\nthere on the totem pole when we say.\n\n299\n00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:09.840\nAnd they call them Internet backbone\nproviders, IBPs not ISPs, right?\n\n300\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.897\nAnd you, for instance,\ngo into level three, right?\n\n301\n00:16:11.897 --> 00:16:16.672\nAnd then you get that high-speed, quite\nliterally high-speed network backbone\n\n302\n00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:21.280\nthat you're on that gives you fast\naccess to the cloud-based technologies.\n\n303\n00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.940\nOr it could be like we\ndo here in Gainesville.\n\n304\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.820\nIt could be just a normal internet service\nprovider or a telecommunications company.\n\n305\n00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.800\nAnd you're just basically doing no\ndifferent than you would in a residential\n\n306\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.202\nneighborhood, right?\n\n307\n00:16:33.202 --> 00:16:35.063\nWhere you connect to your ISP's network,\nand\n\n308\n00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:37.077\nthen from there you connect to the cloud,\nright?\n\n309\n00:16:37.077 --> 00:16:41.210\nThat would be the same type of connection\nthat you could have here, likewise.\n\n310\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.260\nNow, there are some things that\nwe have to [COUGH] Understand,\n\n311\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.570\nthe benefits of cloud technology.\n\n312\n00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.560\nSome of them we're already mentioned.\n\n313\n00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.120\nJustin's mentioned some of them when\nit comes to deployment of software.\n\n314\n00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.760\nSome of the things that you\ncan keep in mind is that you\n\n315\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.620\ndon't have to worry about\nsupporting the infrastructure.\n\n316\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.390\nThe service provider has\nthe infrastructure, and they support that\n\n317\n00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.950\ninfrastructure, as well as provide you\nthe services through that infrastructure.\n\n318\n00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.580\nYou get scalability.\n\n319\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.750\nScalability, being able to scale\nout when you need it, right?\n\n320\n00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.140\nBeing able to say hey,\nI need ten additional web servers.\n\n321\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:16.640\nWhy?\n\n322\n00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.460\nBecause we're getting\nclose to Black Friday.\n\n323\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.170\nRight now I don't need those web servers.\n\n324\n00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.930\nBut you know what?\n\n325\n00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.160\nBlack Friday comes,\nI need those web servers.\n\n326\n00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.550\nNow, does my company want to invest\nthe money that it takes to bring up\n\n327\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.600\nten additional servers that we're gonna\nuse for one day in the entire year?\n\n328\n00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.310\nWell, we can scale out, sure, but\nit also gives what's known as elasticity.\n\n329\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.500\nElasticity is the ability, think\nabout a rubber band, to scale out and\n\n330\n00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.660\nthen scale down when you need it, right?\n\n331\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.660\nOnce Black Friday's done,\nI don't need those ten additional servers.\n\n332\n00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.208\nI don't want the cost that it would take.\n\n333\n00:17:48.208 --> 00:17:52.280\nA three year ROI, I think it is,\nreturn on investment on a server?\n\n334\n00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.288\nThree years, maybe five years,\ndepending on what your model is, just for\n\n335\n00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:55.828\none server.\n\n336\n00:17:55.828 --> 00:18:00.400\nAnd you bought ten of them and\nyou only needed them for one day, right?\n\n337\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.280\nThat's another benefit of the cloud,\nright?\n\n338\n00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.310\nAs information, or excuse me,\ninfrastructure-as-a-service,\n\n339\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.090\nI could say okay.\n\n340\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:10.254\nOn Black Friday, or just prior to Black\nFriday, us kicking off our Black Friday\n\n341\n00:18:10.254 --> 00:18:13.735\nsale, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna deploy ten servers,\n\n342\n00:18:13.735 --> 00:18:16.437\nwe can spin them up really quick,\nhave them ready.\n\n343\n00:18:16.437 --> 00:18:18.352\nAgain, scalability, scale out and\n\n344\n00:18:18.352 --> 00:18:21.390\nthen reduce that down when\nBlack Friday is no longer here.\n\n345\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.310\nThat following Saturday we don't\nneed those servers anymore,\n\n346\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.750\nwe can scale back down.\n\n347\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.016\nSo you get the rapid scalability,\nelasticity,\n\n348\n00:18:29.016 --> 00:18:31.730\nyou get the always-on too, all right?\n\n349\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.399\nOne of the things that you'll find out is\nthat with the majority of these platforms,\n\n350\n00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:40.640\nnow, they might not have the crazy\nfive nine high availability.\n\n351\n00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.650\nBut they will get a few nines\nin there [LAUGH], right?\n\n352\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.740\nAnd it's according to your SLA,\nyour service level agreement.\n\n353\n00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.140\nSo you also get high availability, right?\n\n354\n00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.980\nYou get redundancy and recovery.\n\n355\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.900\nThings like, for instance, Amazon's\nplatform they have geographical areas that\n\n356\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.350\nare set up like huge grids that you\ndon't even know that there's a failure.\n\n357\n00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.850\nYou can look at a service health report.\n\n358\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.780\nYou can find, I think there was an outage.\n\n359\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.350\nBut you might not be aware.\n\n360\n00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.830\nYou could be, but\nyou might not be aware of it.\n\n361\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.367\nScheduled updates and maintenance,\nwe've kind of already talked about.\n\n362\n00:19:13.367 --> 00:19:15.580\nExpense allocation, all right?\n\n363\n00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:20.500\nThis is a great way to say hey,\nI needed ten servers for whatever,\n\n364\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.630\n24 hours, and\nthen we scale it back down, all right?\n\n365\n00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.700\nThen we can do charge back, and\nwe know we could do metering,\n\n366\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.320\nif you will, charge metering a lot easier.\n\n367\n00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:34.170\nAnd then, last but not least is,\nwell, environmental impact, right?\n\n368\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.660\nThink about the extra power it takes to\nmaintain those servers in a server closet,\n\n369\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.890\nthat you would have on constantly, right?\n\n370\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.180\nSo if that's something that you're into,\n\n371\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.230\nyou can think about reducing your\noverall carbon footprint, too.\n\n372\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.060\nNow, there are some security\nimplementations, or\n\n373\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.792\nimplications I should say,\nthings that you have to consider.\n\n374\n00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.920\nAny time you're using\na public cloud solution,\n\n375\n00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.010\nyou have what's known as multitenancy.\n\n376\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.560\nMultitenancy just means that you know\nthat you have more than one company\n\n377\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.310\nthat is going to use that provider, right?\n\n378\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.907\nI couldn't tell you how many,\nas big as Amazon or AWS is,\n\n379\n00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:11.861\nI couldn't tell you how many thousands and\nthousands if not hundreds of thousands, or\n\n380\n00:20:11.861 --> 00:20:13.595\nmillions of customers they have, but\n\n381\n00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:17.577\nthere are multiple customers within a\nsingle platform, it's called multitenancy.\n\n382\n00:20:17.577 --> 00:20:22.390\nSo you have to pay attention to\nhow they handle that, right?\n\n383\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.470\nBecause you don't have to worry\nabout virtual environment\n\n384\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.320\nescaping techniques, right?\n\n385\n00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.650\nSo there are security concerns\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n386\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.640\nPrivacy, right?\n\n387\n00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.040\nYou have to pay attention to the privacy\nin the service level agreements, right?\n\n388\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.020\nData location could be another thing\nthat might be important to you as well.\n\n389\n00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.930\nEspecially if you're talking\nabout data standards, right?\n\n390\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.752\nWhat is customer data versus\nthe company data, PII,\n\n391\n00:20:45.752 --> 00:20:48.660\nif we have personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n392\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.830\nIf we're worried about things like PCI,\nDSS, or\n\n393\n00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.220\nthe payment card information,\ndata security standards, right?\n\n394\n00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.940\nDo we have to follow under\nthings like HIPAA compliance?\n\n395\n00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.030\nWell then, we have to look, and\nwe have to read those laws.\n\n396\n00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:02.510\nWe have to be aware of the information\nsecurity standards and\n\n397\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.080\nmake sure that if you\nare using a cloud provider,\n\n398\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.470\nand you used the example of backing\nthat information up to the cloud.\n\n399\n00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.630\nWhere is it stored?\n\n400\n00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.090\nIs it stored in a secure location?\n\n401\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.610\nWho has access to it?\n\n402\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.660\nYou don't know.\n\n403\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.030\nThat's things that you need find out.\n\n404\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.261\nAnd that's also things that you need to\nsecure before you decide what you're gonna\n\n405\n00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:23.472\nstore in the cloud and what you're\nnot gonna store in the cloud, right?\n\n406\n00:21:23.472 --> 00:21:26.436\nIf they're local resources, they're\non-prem, you mentioned that term, on-prem,\n\n407\n00:21:26.436 --> 00:21:28.667\non premise, that means you're managing,\nyou're maintaining.\n\n408\n00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:31.767\nI mean you can secure them a little bit\nbetter when you move them up to the cloud\n\n409\n00:21:31.767 --> 00:21:33.522\nand they become a cloud-based resource.\n\n410\n00:21:33.522 --> 00:21:36.734\nIt's up to you to read the documentation,\nto make sure that\n\n411\n00:21:36.734 --> 00:21:41.540\nthe data that you put up in the cloud\ndoes maintain its level of security.\n\n412\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.470\nThese are just a few of\nthe topics when it comes, and\n\n413\n00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.260\nwe really just scratched\nthe surface with the cloud.\n\n414\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.638\nKeep in mind that they are adding all\ndifferent types of as a services,\n\n415\n00:21:50.638 --> 00:21:53.760\nstorage-as-a-service,\nsecurity-as-a-service, right?\n\n416\n00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.105\nMany more database-as-a-service.\n\n417\n00:21:55.105 --> 00:21:58.811\nSo these are just three of\nthe most common ones that\n\n418\n00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:03.790\nwe want you to be aware of on\nthe Network+ exam and so does CompTIA.\n\n419\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.960\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, you've definitely\nilluminated some of the things that\n\n420\n00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.760\nwe need to consider when using cloud-based\ntechnology, so thank you so much for that.\n\n421\n00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.140\nNow before we depart from this episode,\n\n422\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.110\nare there any final parting\nwords of wisdom from you?\n\n423\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just get the jargon,\nI think that's the big thing.\n\n424\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.270\nIs just get the jargon under your belt\nwhen it comes to taking this exam or\n\n425\n00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.880\nwhen you prepare for this exam.\n\n426\n00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.685\nAnd just be aware of some scenarios\nthat they might ask you and\n\n427\n00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:31.830\nask you which services is this,\nall right?.\n\n428\n00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.940\nIf company A can access\nthat information but\n\n429\n00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.910\nno other company can\naccess the information,\n\n430\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.160\nis this an example of a private cloud,\nor a public cloud, or a hybrid cloud?\n\n431\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.660\nBe able to know these different models,\nthese different services, so\n\n432\n00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.950\nthat next time,\nwhen you sit that Net+ exam and\n\n433\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.020\nthey come up with a question,\nyou'll be able to answer every one.\n\n434\n00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, thank you for illuminating\nthose wonderful words of wisdom,\n\n435\n00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.290\nthose little nuggets that we can take\naway as we prepare for ComptTIA Network+.\n\n436\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.690\nBut we're continuing on,\nso definitely stay tuned.\n\n437\n00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.000\nBut for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n438\n00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.980\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Justin Dennison.\n\n439\n00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.548\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n440\n00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:07.892\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n441\n00:23:07.892 --> 00:23:10.364\n[MUSIC]\n\n442\n00:23:10.364 --> 00:23:15.255\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:11.871\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:15.890\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for choosing ITPRO\nTV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.090\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.760\nAnd this is network service functions,\ngreat title for an episode.\n\n8\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.770\nThere should be some DNS in our future,\nI think.\n\n9\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.020\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to help us out\nwith all the information we need.\n\n10\n00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.740\nWes, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.369\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, it's great to be here Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.924\nThat's right, when they talk about\nnetwork service functions, well,\n\n13\n00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.171\nwe technically got a lot\nof network services.\n\n14\n00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:42.025\nBut Zach already kinda let\nthe cat out of the bag.\n\n15\n00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:44.800\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; Because there are two services that we\n\n16\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.650\nneed to worry about.\n\n17\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.050\nAnd two services, really,\nthat make up really important protocols.\n\n18\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.330\nIt's what allows us to either obtain IP\naddresses or to find computers out there,\n\n19\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.862\nwhether in our local networks or\nacross the Internet.\n\n20\n00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:03.746\nAnd they really are, when it comes to\nnetwork services, two services that you\n\n21\n00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:08.271\nreally should know, not only from\na certification, exam standpoint.\n\n22\n00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:12.102\nObviously, that's one of the reasons you\nwanna know it because you might be going\n\n23\n00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:16.154\ninto the Network+ exam and, boy, wouldn't\nit be nice just to have these questions or\n\n24\n00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:18.400\nanswers ready to go when\nthe ask you scenarios?\n\n25\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.275\nBut even more so, because they're so\nimportant to your networking career,\n\n26\n00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:25.688\nhere at the Network+ level,\nit's good to get a solid foundation.\n\n27\n00:01:25.688 --> 00:01:29.930\nBecause you're gonna be dealing with\nthese almost sometimes on a daily basis.\n\n28\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.990\nAnd they really form a lot\nof the major foundation\n\n29\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.200\ncommunications that we have\non the network, in general.\n\n30\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.603\n&gt;&gt; So, Wes, could you tell us\na little bit about the DNS service?\n\n31\n00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:43.078\n&gt;&gt; Yes, great question.\n\n32\n00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:45.540\nWe talk about the DNS service in general,\nright.\n\n33\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.840\nWhat is it responsible for?\n\n34\n00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.900\nI want you to think about how we\ntalked about how routers communicate\n\n35\n00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.430\nwith other computers across the Internet.\n\n36\n00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.790\nCuz essentially when you visit a website,\nyou're asking a server for a webpage,\n\n37\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.690\nlike we talked about those protocols.\n\n38\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.220\nSo I have to know where\nto find that web server.\n\n39\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.610\nWell, remember that when we talked about\nrouters, for instance, in our OSI models,\n\n40\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410\nwe said that the routers allow us to\ncommunicate via IP address, right.\n\n41\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.520\nThey look at routing tables.\n\n42\n00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.044\nThey look at the network.\n\n43\n00:02:13.044 --> 00:02:16.580\nThey break down the network ID to try\nto find out where the network is.\n\n44\n00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.830\nAnd, if not, they pass it on based on\nthe destination IP address, right.\n\n45\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.102\nSo in our layer three data packet, right,\nwe have a destination IP address and\n\n46\n00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.281\na source IP address.\n\n47\n00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.440\nAnd that's how the routers\nmake their decisions, right.\n\n48\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.820\nWhat we don't have are things like names,\nright.\n\n49\n00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.960\nAnd if you think about it,\nDomain Name System,\n\n50\n00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.050\nthere has to be names involved cuz\nit's right there in the name, right.\n\n51\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.624\nThat's good for routers,\nthat's great for computers, right.\n\n52\n00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:41.708\nBut it's not so good for us humans, right.\n\n53\n00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:43.980\nI don't know about you, Zach,\nbut I can't remember yesterday.\n\n54\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.960\nSometimes I wouldn't even remember my head\nif it wasn't attached at the neck, right.\n\n55\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.014\nSo I want you to think about every website\nthat you were gonna visit out there.\n\n56\n00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:53.330\nDo you know its IP address?\n\n57\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.170\nDid you wake up when you went to Facebook\nthis morning, maybe on your computer, and\n\n58\n00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.790\ntype the IP address of one of the Facebook\nservers, one of the Google servers?\n\n59\n00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.608\nDid you go out there to\nMicrosoft's website?\n\n60\n00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:06.615\nThose of you that are maybe studying\nsome Microsoft exams, and you went up to\n\n61\n00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:12.240\nTechNet, did you type in the web browser\nthe IP address of the TechNet web server?\n\n62\n00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.530\nNo, you didn't, right, you typed a name.\n\n63\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.032\nAnd a lot of times, what we do is\nwe type a name in a search engine.\n\n64\n00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:19.418\nThat's why I always say search\nengine is first, right.\n\n65\n00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:23.559\nBut, still, when you go to a search\nengine, you're going to a server, and\n\n66\n00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.850\nyou're saying I need to find something.\n\n67\n00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.795\nAnd you type in and\nyou interact with that search engine.\n\n68\n00:03:28.795 --> 00:03:31.470\nBut your computer found\nit on an IP address.\n\n69\n00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.600\nBut when you typed it in, you typed\nit in by name, right, www.google.com.\n\n70\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.870\nOr if you're using Microsoft,\nwww.bing.com, right.\n\n71\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.760\nThose are names, they're not IP addresses.\n\n72\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.760\nSo if computers use IP addresses, and\nit's easier for us to remember names,\n\n73\n00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.230\nthen how is that working in\nthe background where I type a name, and\n\n74\n00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.613\nin the background it\nconnects to the IP address?\n\n75\n00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:56.550\nMagic, [LAUGH] not really.\n\n76\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where the DNS service comes in.\n\n77\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.420\nSee, the DNS service is responsible.\n\n78\n00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.008\nWhen my computer and the programs or\nthe applications, if you will, need to\n\n79\n00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:11.110\ncommunicate across the network, right,\nthey need to communicate via IP address.\n\n80\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.087\nBut when my computer doesn't\nknow what the IP address is,\n\n81\n00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:19.970\nand all I have is a name, we go through\na process using that DNS service.\n\n82\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.149\nAnd that DNS service, with some\ncomponents that we're gonna show you,\n\n83\n00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:27.027\nis going to go out there,\nsearch some databases,\n\n84\n00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:30.110\ntake that name,\nassociate it with an IP address, and\n\n85\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.454\nreturn back to your computer the actual\nIP address so that you can connect.\n\n86\n00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:39.691\nAnd making it easier for\nus humans, we can remember names,\n\n87\n00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:45.660\nwhich can be a lot more user friendly,\nthen a four octet IP address,\n\n88\n00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.621\nor even more so,\nan eight block IPv6 address, right.\n\n89\n00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:53.100\nAnd that's a beauty of\nthe Domain Name System.\n\n90\n00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.530\nDomain Name System says\nwhen I type in something,\n\n91\n00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.898\nlike www.google.com, or www.itpro.tv,\n\n92\n00:05:01.898 --> 00:05:07.400\nright, www.practice-labs.com,\nand it associates,\n\n93\n00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.080\ngoes out there, goes through the process,\ntakes that IP address, maps it to it,\n\n94\n00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.300\nreturns the answer back to my computer,\nmy computer says, now I can connect.\n\n95\n00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.530\nI don't know what this name is,\nbut now I have an IP address, and\n\n96\n00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.370\nI can get there, all right.\n\n97\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.490\nBut it is a hierarchy.\n\n98\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.082\nDNS works through this hierarchy,\n\n99\n00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:24.425\nand we have to know a little\nbit about the hierarchy.\n\n100\n00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:26.670\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at the DNS hierarchy.\n\n101\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.801\nAnd understand that hierarchy,\nyou gotta kinda understand the make up,\n\n102\n00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:33.341\nthe DNA if you will,\nof the name, all right.\n\n103\n00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:38.073\nThe name that we resolve is what's known\nas a fully qualified domain name, right.\n\n104\n00:05:38.073 --> 00:05:42.920\nDNS, Domain Name System,\nworks on fully qualified domain names.\n\n105\n00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.637\nSo what is a fully qualified domain name?\n\n106\n00:05:44.637 --> 00:05:47.045\nAll right, well,\nI've got an example of one right here.\n\n107\n00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:49.340\nThey're called FQDNs for short.\n\n108\n00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.265\nBut let's go ahead and\ndefine the acronym [LAUGH].\n\n109\n00:05:51.265 --> 00:05:52.179\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You ladies and\n\n110\n00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.814\ngentlemen have enough acronyms\nout there under your belt.\n\n111\n00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:57.911\nI'll throw another one here at you.\n\n112\n00:05:57.911 --> 00:05:59.310\n&gt;&gt; FYI.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n113\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.850\nSo when we're talking about\nfully qualified domain names,\n\n114\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.130\nthat consists of what's\nknown as a hostname.\n\n115\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.680\nIt's a single label name, all right.\n\n116\n00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.210\nAnd sometimes in the Microsoft world,\n\n117\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.540\nthey call it a computer name, as well,\nall right, as well as a domain name.\n\n118\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.350\nSee, a host name, let's say, for instance,\n\n119\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.300\nserver 01, let's say it's computer name,\nit's host name, is SRV01.\n\n120\n00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.064\nWell, when we attach that to the end\nof a domain name like demo.itpro.tv,\n\n121\n00:06:29.064 --> 00:06:34.320\nthe whole thing together becomes what's\nknown as the fully qualified domain name.\n\n122\n00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.890\nSo remember that, that that is\nhostname plus domain name equals FQDN.\n\n123\n00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.720\nNow that sounds like a lot of algebra.\n\n124\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.840\nWhen you start putting letters in math,\nI mean, I'm out, all right.\n\n125\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.700\nBut it is important to understand this\nname and how the resolution process works.\n\n126\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.070\nWe call it resolving the name.\n\n127\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.380\nResolution, resolving the name, all right,\n\n128\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.790\nBecause well here in\nthe states we read what?\n\n129\n00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.670\nLeft to right.\n\n130\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.420\nNow I know that we've\ngot viewers all around.\n\n131\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.990\nThe world right.\n\n132\n00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.160\nAnd some languages, obviously,\ndon't read that way.\n\n133\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.040\nThey read right to left, right.\n\n134\n00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.750\nBut when we're reading here, here in\nthe States, right, we read left to right.\n\n135\n00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.770\nAnd you would think that we would start on\nthis side of the tracks to resolve a name.\n\n136\n00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.030\nBut DNS doesn't work that way.\n\n137\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.970\nDNS actually works from the right,\nand resolves back to the left.\n\n138\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.561\nSee, a hierarchical name space is one\nthat's broken up into different levels.\n\n139\n00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:37.466\nAnd the levels are distinguished, if you\nwill, by the little punctuation mark,\n\n140\n00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:39.010\nthe dot, as we call it.\n\n141\n00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.900\nPeriod, if you will, but dot, all right.\n\n142\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.060\nNow, I want you to notice something.\n\n143\n00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.520\nYou might look at this fully\nqualified domain name, and\n\n144\n00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.940\nsay it's fully qualified to be wrong.\n\n145\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.670\nWhy?\n\n146\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.167\nNotice there's an extra dot at the end.\n\n147\n00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:57.177\nThere's a dot just past tv,\nall right, what is that?\n\n148\n00:07:57.177 --> 00:08:00.889\nWell, that's what's known as root.\n\n149\n00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:04.761\nAll right,\nwe don't technically type in the dot.\n\n150\n00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:10.970\nWhen I type in www.google.com,\nyou can technically put a dot after that.\n\n151\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.530\nOur web browsers do that in\nthe background for us, why?\n\n152\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.335\nBecause the dot is actually\nthe highest part of the DNS hierarchy,\n\n153\n00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:20.838\nit's called root.\n\n154\n00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:24.240\nMm-hm, root hints if you will, all right.\n\n155\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.840\nAnd then from right to left we have\nwhat's known as a top level domain,\n\n156\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.480\nthen the second portion of this is going\nto be what's known as a second level\n\n157\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.350\ndomain, and you can have third level\ndomains, and then finally after, in\n\n158\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.670\nthis case this whole portion makes up the\ndomain name we, have the computer name.\n\n159\n00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.620\nAnd when I need to resolve, or\n\n160\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.305\nmy computer needs to resolve a name,\nit needs to go through this process.\n\n161\n00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:57.528\nWell I don't know where\nsrv01.demo.itpro.tv exists.\n\n162\n00:08:57.528 --> 00:09:01.797\nSo what I have to do,is I have to talk\nto the first part of the heirarchy,\n\n163\n00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:06.510\nand that's why it's important to\nunderstand a fully qualified domain name.\n\n164\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.692\nNow, I put .tv in here, I could just as\neasy put something like, I don't know,\n\n165\n00:09:10.692 --> 00:09:12.249\n.com, right?\n\n166\n00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:13.765\n.tv is another one,\n\n167\n00:09:13.765 --> 00:09:18.576\nbut you guys you probably recognize\nsomething like .com, right?\n\n168\n00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.960\nMore than you do .tv, and I'll show why\nhere in a second but understand .tv.\n\n169\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.170\nis a fully qualified domain name.\n\n170\n00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.340\nAnd when we look at the hierarchy,\nthe hierarchy starts with just that dot.\n\n171\n00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.870\nThat dot that you don't typically see.\n\n172\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.682\nThat we typically don't put\nin our web browsers, but\n\n173\n00:09:37.682 --> 00:09:41.072\nthe web browsers finish it in\nthe background for us, all right?\n\n174\n00:09:41.072 --> 00:09:47.940\nAnd the root server, it's responsible for\nwhat's known as top level domains.\n\n175\n00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.670\nSee the root,\nit doesn't do name resolution,\n\n176\n00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.030\nit says it looks at the request and\nsays okay.\n\n177\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.220\nI don't know who this,\nand I'll tell you what,\n\n178\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.890\nI'm gonna use a name that you\nguys are familiar with, right?\n\n179\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:06.920\nSo we'll do something like this,\nwe'll do www.google.com, all right?\n\n180\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.370\nAnd again remember, the dot,\nthat last dot is implied, all right?\n\n181\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:18.410\nSo my DNS server that's gonna respond and\nhopefully give me the IP address says,\n\n182\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.890\nI don't know, I'm not responsible for\nGoogle's web server.\n\n183\n00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.110\nI don't own Google's web server, but\nI'm gonna go ask somebody that can help.\n\n184\n00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.400\nAnd the first thing it does is it asks\nthe root hit server, the root server dot,\n\n185\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.115\nif you will.\n\n186\n00:10:31.115 --> 00:10:37.088\nAnd says,\ndo you know what www.google.com is?\n\n187\n00:10:37.088 --> 00:10:39.040\nA route server says,\nwell I look at the request,\n\n188\n00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.520\nI don't know who this www you speak\nof is and I don't know who Google is,\n\n189\n00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.800\nbut I am responsible for .com.\n\n190\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.040\nYou can go, go talk to .com, and\n\n191\n00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.120\nit returns .com's IP\naddress to the DNS server.\n\n192\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.120\nSo what does the DNS server do?\n\n193\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.890\nWell the DNS server turns around and\nsays, okay I'll go talk to .com.\n\n194\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.130\nAnd if we can look here again, so\n\n195\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.569\nthe next part of this would be, all\nright let me go ahead and talk to .com.\n\n196\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.321\nAnd .com, and the question's asked, .com,\n\n197\n00:11:14.321 --> 00:11:18.258\nDNS Server, do you what www.google.com is?\n\n198\n00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:21.800\n.com looks at its database and\nlittle file, text file,\n\n199\n00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.300\nso it looks at its database and says I\ndon't know who this www is you speak of,\n\n200\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.220\nthat's completely foreign to me.\n\n201\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.400\nBut I'm in charge of Google,\nI know who Google is.\n\n202\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.060\nThat's a second level domain and I'm the\nauthority over Google's domain namespace,\n\n203\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.910\nthat part of the hierarchy.\n\n204\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.850\nHere's the IP address to my DNS server,\n\n205\n00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.820\nhere's the IP address of .com, or\nexcuse me, Google's DNS server.\n\n206\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:47.660\nGo talk to Google.\n\n207\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.150\nAnd then my DNS Server says, well,\nI don't know if it says, thanks, but\n\n208\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.845\nwe'll say it's a nice server,\nit says thanks.\n\n209\n00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:56.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'll go talk to Google's DNS server.\n\n210\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.120\nAnd at this point,\nwhen we talk to Google's DNS Server,\n\n211\n00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:07.460\nyou ask Google's DNS Server,\ndo you know who www.google.com is?\n\n212\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.070\nGoogle says, yeah, I'm in charge of www,\nhere's the IP address,\n\n213\n00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.700\nyou can find it here.\n\n214\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.250\nMy DNS Server does a couple of things.\n\n215\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.800\nIt caches that response.\n\n216\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.420\nRemember, I told you, we go through\nthis name resolution process but\n\n217\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.680\nthere is a little caveat to it.\n\n218\n00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.204\nCaches that response, and then it\nsends the response, the IP address,\n\n219\n00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:31.183\nthe name and\nthe IP address back to my computer.\n\n220\n00:12:31.183 --> 00:12:33.532\nMy computer says, now,I got a name,\nI got an IP address,\n\n221\n00:12:33.532 --> 00:12:35.900\nlet's connect to the web page,\nthe search engine opens up.\n\n222\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.150\nIt's name resolution.\n\n223\n00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.360\nNow I want to just real quick mention that\ncaveat that I keep kind of stalling on.\n\n224\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.050\nBecause DNS, just like any other service\nif I can cache the answer locally,\n\n225\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.190\nonce I've got the answer,\nin fact my computer will do that,\n\n226\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:56.200\nonce it's got the answer, and I type\nwww.google.com to make it more efficient.\n\n227\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.720\nI've already got my answer, why do I\nneed to go back to the DNS Server?\n\n228\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.010\nSo your computer, and\nthe DNS Server, looks for\n\n229\n00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.210\nthe answer stored locally in RAM.\n\n230\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.450\nSo my computer next time I go to Google,\nis going to say do I, got it,\n\n231\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.740\nit's right here.\n\n232\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.250\nIt's loaded in Random Access Memory,\nI've already got the answer.\n\n233\n00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.470\nIt's in what's known as\nthe local resolver cache.\n\n234\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.470\nBut let's say for instance,\nI just turned my computer on.\n\n235\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.070\nWell it can also ask my\nDNS Server that I'm using.\n\n236\n00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.790\nConfigured in the TCIP properties\nin the network adapter.\n\n237\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.200\nAnd my DNS Server can say, yeah,\nsomebody asked me for this earlier and\n\n238\n00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.540\nI went through that whole\nhierarchical process.\n\n239\n00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.200\nGoogle returned me the IP address at www,\nhere's your answer.\n\n240\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.990\nWe get a faster name resolution.\n\n241\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.740\nSo I do want you to know about the local\nresolver of caches, that is important.\n\n242\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.892\nAll right, and\nwe've got this hierarchy, right?\n\n243\n00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:49.766\nSo if we continue on down\nthe path that leads to hierarchy,\n\n244\n00:13:49.766 --> 00:13:52.410\nwe also have second level\ndomains that I mention.\n\n245\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.900\nAnd to kind of give you an idea, right, we\ncan see that we've got Microsoft, Google,\n\n246\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.130\nand Facebook.\n\n247\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.821\nEveryone of you, or most of you,\nare probably familiar with it, right?\n\n248\n00:14:01.821 --> 00:14:02.775\n.com, right?\n\n249\n00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:06.421\nmicrosoft.com, google.com, facebook.com.\n\n250\n00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:09.089\nAnd you guys can go, if you wanna take\nthe time, and you wanna look these up,\n\n251\n00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:09.941\nby all means please do.\n\n252\n00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:14.160\n.net, Verizon.net, speedtest.net,\nearthlink.net, right?\n\n253\n00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.100\nAll these second level domains\nare under .net that is the authority\n\n254\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.400\nover those domain names basis.\n\n255\n00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.544\nSo if I'm looking for\nVerizon and my computers,\n\n256\n00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:26.161\nI type in my computers web\nbrowser www.verizon.net.\n\n257\n00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.880\nWell guess what, name resolution\nprocess is going to go just the same.\n\n258\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.760\nMy ISP, I keep saying ISP and you'll\nsee why I'm getting there in a second.\n\n259\n00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.640\nMy DNS Server that I 'm\nusing is going to say,\n\n260\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.583\nwell let me go talk to root,\nif I don't have it locally.\n\n261\n00:14:37.583 --> 00:14:38.162\nLet me go talk to root,\n\n262\n00:14:38.162 --> 00:14:41.670\nroots gonna point me over to net because\nit's in charge of that name space.\n\n263\n00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.920\n.net's gonna say, no I don't know who\nwww is but I do know who Verizon is.\n\n264\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.840\nI'm in charge of that name space.\n\n265\n00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.550\nSo why don't you go ahead and\ntalk to Verizon.\n\n266\n00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.340\nAnd the same thing with .org, right?\n\n267\n00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.775\nAnd other top level domain, right?\n\n268\n00:14:55.775 --> 00:14:58.012\nwordpress.org, probably\nheard of it before.\n\n269\n00:14:58.012 --> 00:15:01.837\nI'm sure you've probably heard\nof wikipedia.org, right?\n\n270\n00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:05.369\n.org, the organizational,\ntop level domain, right?\n\n271\n00:15:05.369 --> 00:15:08.490\nIt is responsible for\nWikipedia's namespace.\n\n272\n00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.345\nSame thing with Mozilla,\nthose of you out there that like Firefox.\n\n273\n00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:13.574\n.edu, right?\n\n274\n00:15:13.574 --> 00:15:16.050\nEducational or academics, right?\n\n275\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.140\nHarvard, MIT, Berkley,\nthey all use the .edu.\n\n276\n00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.840\nWe got the .mil for the military, right?\n\n277\n00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.705\nThe branches of our armed forces\nhere in the United States,\n\n278\n00:15:25.705 --> 00:15:27.552\n.mil's military top level domain.\n\n279\n00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:34.450\n.gov, there's some that we haven't put\nin here yet, .gov, government, right?\n\n280\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:39.330\nNow let's go ahead and let's kinda focus\nin on some of the second level domains and\n\n281\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.450\nkinda understand what's going on here,\nall right?\n\n282\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.330\nWhen we look at some of\nthe second level domain,\n\n283\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.190\nlet's say that we were going to Microsoft,\nall right?\n\n284\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.964\nMaybe Microsoft has got a SMTP server\nthat we've got to send some email.\n\n285\n00:15:50.964 --> 00:15:53.119\nDoubt it, but maybe they do, right?\n\n286\n00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:57.970\nWell I need to know,\nmy email system needs to know Where's\n\n287\n00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.535\nthe IP address of smtp.microsoft.com?\n\n288\n00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:05.116\nI'm making the host names up I don't know,\nyou shouldn't know that you shouldn't be\n\n289\n00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:08.190\ninside of there it's somebody's network,\nright?\n\n290\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.740\nI don't have to know that, right?\n\n291\n00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:16.530\nSo my computer says, well actually it\ncould even be the email server, says hey,\n\n292\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.990\nlet me go rely on DNS, DNS go through this\nprocess and process starts over again.\n\n293\n00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:27.932\nDot, dot says go talk to .com,\n.com says, I don't know who smtp is,\n\n294\n00:16:27.932 --> 00:16:32.230\nbut I do know Microsoft is,\nyou go talk to Microsoft.\n\n295\n00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.315\nAnd then Microsoft DNS server\nlooks at it's database says,\n\n296\n00:16:36.315 --> 00:16:38.647\nyeah, I know who the host smtp is.\n\n297\n00:16:38.647 --> 00:16:41.631\nAnd you can find it at this IP address,\nand\n\n298\n00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:45.980\nthat answer comes back to my computer or\nmy email client, and\n\n299\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:52.075\nthe communication happens all based on,\nthe name resolution process, all right?\n\n300\n00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:56.495\nSo that is a little bit about\nour hierarchical fashion, right?\n\n301\n00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:59.295\nIt's what they call a logical\ntree topology, right?\n\n302\n00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:01.811\nMaybe we talked about topology\nin other episodes and\n\n303\n00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:05.601\none of the things that they don't call\nout anymore is a tree topology, right?\n\n304\n00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:10.156\nAnd that's where you have a root node,\nand then you have second level nodes,\n\n305\n00:17:10.156 --> 00:17:12.765\nthird level, fourth level nodes, right?\n\n306\n00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.980\nWell, they kinda took\nthat one out of there,\n\n307\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.290\nbecause it's not really,\nI don't know how common it is.\n\n308\n00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.190\nBut logically, DNS is a treetopology.\n\n309\n00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.620\nIt's a hierarchical fashion\nthat starts at the root and\n\n310\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.620\nbranches down to lower level\ndomains leading back to the hosts.\n\n311\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.320\nAnd it is important.\n\n312\n00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.938\nNow, I will tell you that when it\ncomes to the hierarchy, know it.\n\n313\n00:17:37.938 --> 00:17:41.275\nKnow what a top level domain is,\nknow what that root is,\n\n314\n00:17:41.275 --> 00:17:44.620\nknow what a fully qualified\ndomain name is, all right?\n\n315\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.175\nAnd when we talk about a fully qualified\ndomain name, I want you to remember,\n\n316\n00:17:48.175 --> 00:17:48.730\nall right?\n\n317\n00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:53.020\nLike on my computer here,\nif they show you a name and\n\n318\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.360\nit looks like this that is not\na fully qualified domain name, right?\n\n319\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.711\nThat's just the host name,\n\n320\n00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.653\nthat is an hierarchical in fashion because\nhow many computers out of the millions of\n\n321\n00:18:02.653 --> 00:18:05.657\nbillions of computers that are out\nthere across the Internet.\n\n322\n00:18:05.657 --> 00:18:10.763\nDo you think there's one anyway\nwhere we might have srv01 and\n\n323\n00:18:10.763 --> 00:18:16.390\nanother srv01, how many John's\ndo you think or John Smiths?\n\n324\n00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.730\nHow many people out there do you\nthink have the name Bill, Bob, or\n\n325\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.780\nSally, or Sarah?\n\n326\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.770\nRight, it's not unique enough.\n\n327\n00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.800\nAnd sometimes even the last name is unique\nenough, cuz you have multiples of that.\n\n328\n00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.420\nSo we use the hierarchical nature of DNS,\nbecause\n\n329\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.681\nthen it becomes a unique naming convention\nacross the entirely data world, all right?\n\n330\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.493\nNow, you might still say, well, srv01.\n\n331\n00:18:43.493 --> 00:18:46.450\nThere's one in company a and company b.\n\n332\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:46.950\nThat's right.\n\n333\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:55.080\nBut with their unique domain names,\ncompany1.com, company2.com.\n\n334\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.210\nSrv01 in each domain,\n\n335\n00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.770\nnow become unique because the fully\nqualified domain name and it's\n\n336\n00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.570\nhierarchical fashion means those two names\nare not the same even if the host name is.\n\n337\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:13.280\nJust like if they say, is this an example\nof a fully qualified domain name.\n\n338\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.860\nNo it's not.\n\n339\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.110\nIt's a host name.\n\n340\n00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.460\nAnd you have to have both, right?\n\n341\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.310\nYou can't have one without the other.\n\n342\n00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:21.420\nAnd that is a little bit\nabout your DNS hierarchy.\n\n343\n00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.200\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\nAnd Wes wonderful, I understand.\n\n344\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.070\nAnd I am always happy when I understand.\n\n345\n00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.850\nI wanted to ask you about this though.\n\n346\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.080\nDNS servers where are they located?\n\n347\n00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.190\nYou mentioned internal external,\nwhere are they at?\n\n348\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.892\n&gt;&gt; They are located\neverywhere [LAUGH] all right?\n\n349\n00:19:35.892 --> 00:19:37.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I knew that was coming\n\n350\n00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.372\n&gt;&gt; Everywhere,\n\n351\n00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:42.281\nbut which one you use is really\non how properties of your network\n\n352\n00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.680\nadapter is set up, all right?\n\n353\n00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.010\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n354\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.060\nAll right, so I've got internal\nversus external, all right?\n\n355\n00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.095\nNow when we talk about internal\nDNS servers, all right?\n\n356\n00:19:52.095 --> 00:19:56.287\nI want you to know that an internal DNS\nserver is one that's within your local\n\n357\n00:19:56.287 --> 00:19:57.270\narea network.\n\n358\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.650\nThat's an internal DNS server,\nit's internal to your network.\n\n359\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.336\nAll right, so for instance,\n\n360\n00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:06.858\nif I have a domain controller within my\nnetwork that relies domain controller,\n\n361\n00:20:06.858 --> 00:20:11.871\nespecially Active Directory where\nheavily unDNS to find services, objects.\n\n362\n00:20:11.871 --> 00:20:15.810\nAnd map under their IP addresses\nwithin our windows domain.\n\n363\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.493\nWell, I'm also gonna need a DNS server\nto allow that directory to function so\n\n364\n00:20:20.493 --> 00:20:24.456\nI can have an internal DNS server,\nthat says when this computer,\n\n365\n00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:29.239\nlet's say just take anyone of this\ncomputers needs to find another computer.\n\n366\n00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:33.537\nWithin this network,\nvia its fully qualified domain name,\n\n367\n00:20:33.537 --> 00:20:37.890\nI sent it to the internal DNS server,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:43.320\nNow the internal DNS server, we got to be\ncareful because the internal DNS server\n\n369\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.166\nisn't the authority of anything that's\nout there across the Internet, all right?\n\n370\n00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:52.440\nWe have the Internet corporation for\nassigning names and\n\n371\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.810\nnumbers, I can't right.\n\n372\n00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.920\nThen they are responsible things\nlike the unique names out there,\n\n373\n00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.340\nI know if you will,\nthe Internet Assign Numbers Authority.\n\n374\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.620\nAll of these different standard bodies,\nand\n\n375\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.540\nthe standards bodies are the ones\nthat oversee public DNS servers.\n\n376\n00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.360\nNow a public DNS server is\nalso an external DNS server.\n\n377\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.206\nOkay so, I wanna kind of clarify,\nunderstand that,\n\n378\n00:21:15.206 --> 00:21:17.725\ncuz you'll hear different terms.\n\n379\n00:21:17.725 --> 00:21:21.650\nIs a very good job keeping\nit vendor neutral, right?\n\n380\n00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.570\nBut you could hear internal and external.\n\n381\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.090\nYou could hear private and public, right?\n\n382\n00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.845\nAnd let me tell you why.\n\n383\n00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:31.250\nCuz if Zach in no way knows nothing,\n\n384\n00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.410\ndoesn't know anything about my internal\ninfrastructure within my network.\n\n385\n00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.653\nHis DNS server is not gonna know anything\nabout the computers that are in my network\n\n386\n00:21:39.653 --> 00:21:41.299\njust like my DNS server is not gonna know.\n\n387\n00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:45.620\nAnd know how to resolve the names to IP\naddresses of the computers that are within\n\n388\n00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.403\nhis network.\n\n389\n00:21:46.403 --> 00:21:49.440\nSo they're called private,\nthey're internal servers.\n\n390\n00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.520\nThey resolve internal addresses,\nall right?\n\n391\n00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.130\nExternal DNS servers, what do they do?\n\n392\n00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.260\nSo if we could take a look here.\n\n393\n00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.350\nYou could have, and this is why\nI keep saying an ISP, all right?\n\n394\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.940\nWhen I need to resolve a name\nout there across the Internet,\n\n395\n00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:06.629\nI'm going to send that DNS\nrequest to an external server.\n\n396\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.485\nAnd what are we gonna do?\n\n397\n00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:12.065\nIn this case, probably gonna be\nyour Internet service provider.\n\n398\n00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:14.940\nAnd your Internet service provider's is\ngonna go through that process for you.\n\n399\n00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.740\nSomebody else is gonna do\nthe heavy lifting, right?\n\n400\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.510\nOr the public or\nexternal DNS servers, right?\n\n401\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.610\nNow you also have things like well,\nGoogle.\n\n402\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.710\nNow, be careful with Google because\nGoogle has their own DNS servers, right?\n\n403\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.560\nSo understand that, yes they're are top\nlevel, or second level domain, but\n\n404\n00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.030\nthey also have public DNS servers,\nexternal DNS servers that you can send\n\n405\n00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.260\ninformation or request to,\nand get responses back.\n\n406\n00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:44.590\nIP addresses just happen to be 8.8.8.8 and\n8.8.4.4.\n\n407\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.010\nAll right, level 3.\n\n408\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.970\nLevel 3, is one of what's known as\nan Internet backbone provider, all right?\n\n409\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.910\nThey have external DNS servers and\nby the way,\n\n410\n00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.570\nthey also control some of\nthe servers as well, right?\n\n411\n00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.600\nSo these are big guys, all right?\n\n412\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.460\nAnd that's the difference.\n\n413\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.900\nNow, I don't want you to think when I say\nand let me make a clarifying statement so\n\n414\n00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.260\nthere's no confusion here.\n\n415\n00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.700\nYes, my internal DNS server it\ncan resolve names that are out\n\n416\n00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.660\nthere across the Internet, but what it's\ndoing is what's known as a forward, right.\n\n417\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.620\nMy local DNS server, my internal DNS\nserver can resolve those names those fully\n\n418\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.340\nqualified domain names to IP\naddresses on my local network.\n\n419\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.730\nAnd then what we can do is,\njust like your mail forwarder,\n\n420\n00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.710\nI can forward a request for\nan external name resolution lookup,\n\n421\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.460\nmay be I'm looking for\nMicrosoft, www.microsoft.com.\n\n422\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.486\nWell, we can take a look\nat here at My Computer,\n\n423\n00:23:37.486 --> 00:23:43.027\nwe can ask that internal DNS server, hey,\ndo you know where www.microsoft.com is?\n\n424\n00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:47.267\nAnd a lot of times what the admins will do\nis, configure a forwarder that says, no,\n\n425\n00:23:47.267 --> 00:23:50.310\nI'm not the authority,\nI don't have that in my database.\n\n426\n00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:54.489\nBut I tell you what, let me go ahead and\nI'll forward that out the router.\n\n427\n00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:58.105\nAnd I'll forward that question\nover to the ISP's DNS server.\n\n428\n00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.623\nCuz guess what, the ISP's DNS server's\ngonna go through the process of\n\n429\n00:24:01.623 --> 00:24:03.758\nthe external name resolution part of that,\n\n430\n00:24:03.758 --> 00:24:07.507\ngonna return an answer through that\nprocess back to my internal DNS server and\n\n431\n00:24:07.507 --> 00:24:09.780\nguess what my internal\nDNS server is gonna do?\n\n432\n00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.820\nIt's gonna cache it.\n\n433\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.730\nSo the next time I'm looking for\nMicrosoft's website, www.Microsoft.com,\n\n434\n00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.930\nnow my internal DNS server says let\nme look at my local resolver cache.\n\n435\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.630\nOkay it's there, here's your answer.\n\n436\n00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.690\nSo part of the name resolution process,\ndo I already have the answer?\n\n437\n00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.970\nNo I don't or I do and you return it and\n\n438\n00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.840\nI don't have to go through\nthe name resolution process.\n\n439\n00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.330\nLet's say no I don't.\n\n440\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.540\nAll right, am I the authority?\n\n441\n00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.180\nThe second step, am I the authority?\n\n442\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.170\nMy internal DNS server is not the\nauthority over Microsoft's DNS servers.\n\n443\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:42.420\nNo it's not.\n\n444\n00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.000\nAll right, so I need to talk to somebody.\n\n445\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.100\nDo I have a forwarder?\n\n446\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.820\nIf I have a forwarder, just send it out\nto whatever that DNS server that is.\n\n447\n00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.145\nIf not, let me look at the IP\naddresses of the root hint server.\n\n448\n00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:54.830\nOkay I've got the IP addresses\nof the root hint server.\n\n449\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.550\nGo talk to root and\nthen that process goes.\n\n450\n00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.390\nAll right, so\ndo keep that in mind, all right.\n\n451\n00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:07.150\nNow you'll also have things like\nyour third party DNS servers and\n\n452\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.490\ncloud hosted servers, all right.\n\n453\n00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:13.363\nSo for instance,\nyou can pay somebody like GoDaddy,\n\n454\n00:25:13.363 --> 00:25:16.303\nGoDaddy is a domain registrar, right.\n\n455\n00:25:16.303 --> 00:25:19.708\nIf I want to have a domain name out there,\nand I want it to be publicly accessible,\n\n456\n00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:21.326\nI've got to go to a domain registrar.\n\n457\n00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:25.052\nAnd I've got to register with them, and\nthey're gonna be licensed bonded and\n\n458\n00:25:25.052 --> 00:25:27.660\ninsured just in case there\nis any malicious activity.\n\n459\n00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.750\nYou'll still be held accountable, but\nany time it's a publicly resolvable name,\n\n460\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.740\nthere has to be accountability.\n\n461\n00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.500\nSo I could go to somebody\nlike godaddy.com and\n\n462\n00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.650\nI could say I wanna bring up my domain and\nI want you to host the DNS records.\n\n463\n00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.560\nThird party, right?\n\n464\n00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:48.310\nNow, they are providing the name\nresolution worldwide across the worldwide\n\n465\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:53.030\nDNS system for my domain and\nI don't have to manage the DNS servers.\n\n466\n00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.640\nSo that for small businesses works.\n\n467\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.960\nThe second one that I\nmentioned is cloud hosting and\n\n468\n00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.680\nthat's what we use here by the way.\n\n469\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.888\nWe don't have internal DNS servers.\n\n470\n00:26:02.888 --> 00:26:06.140\nWe send ours either up to AWS or,\nI believe it's AWS but\n\n471\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.340\nit might be Azure or could be both.\n\n472\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.970\nI know that some of the people that are\nbehind designing our network here don't\n\n473\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.280\nput all their eggs in one basket.\n\n474\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.900\nThey might use two cloud providers\njust to provide redundancy, but\n\n475\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.130\nit's very hard to get more redundant\nthan the AWS infrastructure.\n\n476\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.090\nThey've got the biggest\ninfrastructure in the world.\n\n477\n00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.260\nBut either way,\nAmazon's managing it, right?\n\n478\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.780\nAnd they're giving us\nthe virtual DNS servers.\n\n479\n00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:33.540\nAnd they provide it per service,\nkinda like GoDaddy does, all right.\n\n480\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.660\nSo that's the difference between\na third-party and the cloud host.\n\n481\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:42.010\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, you're talking about names,\nlike me Zach you Wes, names, names.\n\n482\n00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.740\nCan you tell us a little bit\nmore what do you mean by names?\n\n483\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.090\n&gt;&gt; You know.\n&gt;&gt; Name management.\n\n484\n00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:50.920\n&gt;&gt; That's right so names are an\ninteresting thing but you know what Zach?\n\n485\n00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.450\nI think what a such a big topic like that\nwe might have to go into a part two.\n\n486\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.190\n&gt;&gt; Cliffhanger.\n\n487\n00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Cliffhanger.\n\n488\n00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.320\n&gt;&gt; Boy.\nNetwork service functions

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:11.897\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:13.998\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing IT Pro TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.610\nengaging the world through\nthe power of learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.510\nI'm your host Zack Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA and\n\n8\n00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.270\nNet+ Network Service Functions Part 2.\n\n9\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.692\nWe had a part 1,\nmake sure you see that too.\n\n10\n00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:28.010\nAnd Wes Bryan is back again\nto complete this thought.\n\n11\n00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.710\nWes, good to see you,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.885\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.817\nYeah, these network services\nthat we're be talking about over\n\n14\n00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:36.980\nthe next couple of episodes,\nthey're really, really important.\n\n15\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.120\nI mean, they really form the foundation\nfor how we communicate across a network.\n\n16\n00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.208\nRemember that in the first part\nwe basically said with DNS,\n\n17\n00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:51.595\ndomain name system, the service that is\nassociated with it, it's responsible for\n\n18\n00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:54.097\ntaking names and\nmapping them to IP addresses.\n\n19\n00:00:54.097 --> 00:00:57.475\nRemember, fully qualified domain names,\nor FQDN's, and\n\n20\n00:00:57.475 --> 00:00:59.406\nmapping them to our IP addresses.\n\n21\n00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:02.912\nAnd it's a very, very important\nservice because, yeah, I tell you,\n\n22\n00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.848\nI can't remember a single IP address.\n\n23\n00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:08.230\nIf you think about us humans, right?\n\n24\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.990\nToday a lot of us don't even\nknow telephone numbers.\n\n25\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.634\nWe associate a name and maybe even a photo\nof a friend that we've got on our contacts\n\n26\n00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:17.465\nlist, and we push that button.\n\n27\n00:01:17.465 --> 00:01:22.340\nAnd it maps it to a cell phone number and\nit contacts them, right?\n\n28\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.358\nWell, different kind of number,\ndifferent kind of name, but\n\n29\n00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:27.215\nthe theory's the same thing, right?\n\n30\n00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:29.631\nIt's easier for us to remember\nnames than it is IP addresses.\n\n31\n00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.345\nAnd DNS makes it so we can remember\nthe names and not the IP addresses.\n\n32\n00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:39.042\n&gt;&gt; And we left you with a cliffhanger,\nand that was my question of naming.\n\n33\n00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:40.750\nYou know, like I'm Zach, that's Wes.\n\n34\n00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.708\n[LAUGH] But there's names, there's all\nthese names we were talking about.\n\n35\n00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:46.660\nWhat exactly are we talking about?\n\n36\n00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.410\nWhere do we find them, where are they for?\n\n37\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.730\n&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.540\nsee if we can help you out on that one.\n\n39\n00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.708\nNow I've got a little\nbit of a diagram here.\n\n40\n00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:55.261\nWe'll go back back to that real quick and\n\n41\n00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.010\nwe'll talk about that they're what\nare known as records, all right?\n\n42\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.410\nDNS records are actually\nstored on a DNS server, right,\n\n43\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.670\non a little database, if you will.\n\n44\n00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.660\nIt's really just a text file, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.330\nAnd what you'll see here is\nthat I've got FQDN, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.285\nAnd it's mapped to an IP address.\n\n47\n00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.794\nNow the server, and in fact let me go\nahead and for the sake of consistency,\n\n48\n00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.484\nI noticed that this IP address\nis a little bit different.\n\n49\n00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:21.562\nAnd it might confuse people because I'm\ngonna use a different, private IP address,\n\n50\n00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:22.575\nall right?\n\n51\n00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.225\nNow it takes the name,\nmaps it to the IP address.\n\n52\n00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:29.646\nWell that name to IP address,\npp4 specifically,\n\n53\n00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:31.804\nis what's known as an A record.\n\n54\n00:02:31.804 --> 00:02:35.170\nAnd the A record gets stored in\nwhat's known as a DNS zone file.\n\n55\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.619\nAgain, the zone file, database, it's\nreally just a text file, it's a listing.\n\n56\n00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:42.790\nNow that is what's known as a DNS record.\n\n57\n00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.470\nBut it's only one example of a DNS record.\n\n58\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.295\nWe've got quite a few, all right?\n\n59\n00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:49.130\nAnd we've gotta talk about them,\nall right?\n\n60\n00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.180\nSo understand that these are the type of\nDNS records that we need to be aware of,\n\n61\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.952\nall right?\n\n62\n00:02:54.952 --> 00:02:58.260\nThe very first one we have is an A record,\nall right?\n\n63\n00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.733\nAn A record, sometimes called\nan address record, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:06.361\nIt takes that host name, I'm just gonna\nsay host here, but host name, and\n\n65\n00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.650\nmaps it to an IP address, all right?\n\n66\n00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.160\nNow IPv4 isn't the only internet\nprotocol we have, right?\n\n67\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.080\nIn other episodes we talk about IPv4 and\nwe also talked about IPv6, right,\n\n68\n00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.680\nthat eight-block, hexadecimal,\ncrazy long IP address.\n\n69\n00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.195\nWell those aren't A records now, right?\n\n70\n00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:28.382\nThe designers of DNS got\na little crafty here and\n\n71\n00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:33.006\nthey said since an IPv6 address\nhas four times the numbers, right,\n\n72\n00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.850\nor four times the bits,\nwe'll call it a quad-A record.\n\n73\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.360\nYou see four As, sometimes they\ncalled it quad-A record, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.875\nA quad-A record, AAAA record if you want,\nit's called quad-A,\n\n75\n00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:52.120\ntakes that name, and\nit maps it to an IPv6 address, all right?\n\n76\n00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.070\nSo we still have name\nmapped to IP address.\n\n77\n00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.960\nBut an A is an IPv4 and\na quad-A is an IPv6 address.\n\n78\n00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.550\nNow remember, DNS is not only responsible\nfor mapping just names to IP addresses.\n\n79\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.770\nThe cool thing is it can also\ntake services on your net.\n\n80\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.794\nIt is a service in and of itself.\n\n81\n00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.544\nBut it can take services\nthat are on your network so\n\n82\n00:04:15.544 --> 00:04:19.100\nyou know where to find those services and\nthe IP address.\n\n83\n00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.260\nSo, for instance, let's say in a Windows\ndomain I need to log on to the Windows\n\n84\n00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.230\ndomain, right, over the Kerberos protocol.\n\n85\n00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.990\nWell, I gotta find the domain controller.\n\n86\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.300\nMy computer has to know where's\nthe domain controller so\n\n87\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.170\nthat I can send these credentials\nover to it and talk to it.\n\n88\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.410\nSo it talks to DNS and it says,\nI need an LDAP server.\n\n89\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.920\nWhere do I find a service out there,\n\n90\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.058\na lightweight directory\naccess protocol service?\n\n91\n00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:46.516\nAnd DNS says, you can find the domain\ncontroller over here at this IP address.\n\n92\n00:04:46.516 --> 00:04:50.013\nMy computer can finish the authentication\nprocess by communicating now with\n\n93\n00:04:50.013 --> 00:04:53.900\nthe domain controller by one of\nthese records that we have here.\n\n94\n00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.950\nAnd that's the third record in our list,\nthat's an SRV record.\n\n95\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.501\nNope, that's not Stevie Ray Vaughan,\nas much as I would like it to be.\n\n96\n00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:01.035\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's how I remembered it on\n\n97\n00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:01.652\nthe exam, by the way.\n\n98\n00:05:04.168 --> 00:05:06.241\nSRV so service locator record.\n\n99\n00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:08.065\nYou might hear it called service record,\nbut\n\n100\n00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:09.899\nit's a service locator record, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.590\nYou can do this for\nthings like voice over IP phones, right?\n\n102\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.686\nI need a SIT phone.\n\n103\n00:05:16.686 --> 00:05:18.506\nWhere do I find a device out here or\n\n104\n00:05:18.506 --> 00:05:22.400\na server that's running such\nan initiation protocol?\n\n105\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.886\nReturn the answer back to the client\nfrom the DNS server, when it's asked,\n\n106\n00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:27.596\nall right?\n\n107\n00:05:27.596 --> 00:05:31.150\nNow notice we have another one here,\nwe've got what's known as an MX record.\n\n108\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.300\nThis is called a mail exchanger record,\nall right?\n\n109\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.330\nAnd what this does is essentially\nthe mail exchanger record just takes\n\n110\n00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.205\nthe name, right?\n\n111\n00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:41.630\nOr not a name.\n\n112\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.196\nIt's really the IP address\nof the mail server\n\n113\n00:05:46.196 --> 00:05:51.256\nthat's responsible for\nthe domain, all right?\n\n114\n00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.950\nSo let's take google.com, all right?\n\n115\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.200\nGoogle's got a mail server, all right?\n\n116\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.460\nI need to know where do I\nsend the email to, all right?\n\n117\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.510\nSo I need to find the computer\nwithin that domain\n\n118\n00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.468\nthat's responsible for\nemail, so I ask DNS.\n\n119\n00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.953\nThat's a mail server,\nresponsible in Google.\n\n120\n00:06:11.953 --> 00:06:13.457\nWell here's your MX record.\n\n121\n00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:15.728\nYou can go find the mail\nserver at this IP address.\n\n122\n00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.970\nGo talk to the mail server, right?\n\n123\n00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.430\nThat's an MX record,\nmail exchanger record.\n\n124\n00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.890\nNow CNAMEs, they got a couple\ndifferent names that they're called.\n\n125\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.660\nThey're called aliases.\n\n126\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.440\nThe term CNAME is just canonical name,\nbut it's an alias, all right?\n\n127\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.870\nAnd aliases, or CNAMEs, are interesting\nin the fact that they don't map\n\n128\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.970\nto IP addresses, a bit different.\n\n129\n00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.520\nThey map to a host record, all right?\n\n130\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.323\nNow let me show you a little\nbit more about that, right?\n\n131\n00:06:48.323 --> 00:06:52.275\nLets say srv01.demo.itpro.tv\nis my web server.\n\n132\n00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:56.365\nWould you like to have to put that in\na search engine every time single time\n\n133\n00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.054\nyou wanna come to itpro.tv?\n\n134\n00:06:58.054 --> 00:06:59.295\nWell we wouldn't want you to have to.\n\n135\n00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:00.650\nThat'd be a nightmare, right?\n\n136\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.532\nSo what I need is I need some kinda\nalias that everybody recognizes,\n\n137\n00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:10.640\nbut still maps to this host\nthat's running my web server.\n\n138\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.506\nSo what I do is I say, you know what?\n\n139\n00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:17.910\nLet me go ahead and what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna create an alias for this server.\n\n140\n00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.294\nAnd we're just gonna call www, so\n\n141\n00:07:21.294 --> 00:07:26.196\nthat when your web browser or\nyour computer says,\n\n142\n00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:31.226\nI need to find www.itpro.tv,\nwhere do I find it?\n\n143\n00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:32.563\nAsk DNS.\n\n144\n00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:37.912\nSame thing with google, www.google.com,\nsame thing with www.microsoft.com.\n\n145\n00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:41.766\nIt says, okay, well I'll look for www.\n\n146\n00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:46.034\nAnd the domain name server,\nDNS server if you will,\n\n147\n00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:49.927\nlooks at it's database and\nsays, I see www.\n\n148\n00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:56.573\nwww is alias of C_name and\nit maps to srv01.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n149\n00:07:56.573 --> 00:08:00.731\nAnd that can be found at this\nIP address Here's your answer.\n\n150\n00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:09.820\nAnd now you, as a human, don't have to\ntype in this long, crazy, crazy name.\n\n151\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.810\nAll you have to know is www,\nand I could type in\n\n152\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.420\nwww.google.com, www.facebook.com,\nright, and it makes it a lot easier.\n\n153\n00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.830\nAnd that's essentially what an alias is,\na CNAME if you will, right?\n\n154\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.700\nIt's an alias or canonical name.\n\n155\n00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.970\nNow sometimes, and\nthis is where it gets a little tricky, so\n\n156\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:39.140\nup until this point I said name to\nIP address, service to IP address.\n\n157\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.480\nSometimes applications,\nthey're a little backwards.\n\n158\n00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.160\nThey're like, I've got an IP address,\nI need a name.\n\n159\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.220\nBoy you just threw a rock in\nthe pond on that one here.\n\n160\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.515\nWait a second, you've been telling\nme names to IP addresses and\n\n161\n00:08:53.515 --> 00:08:54.669\nnow you say what are we gonna do?\n\n162\n00:08:54.669 --> 00:08:56.480\nWe've got an IP address and\nwe need a name?\n\n163\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.602\nWe gotta reinvent the wheel and\nget another protocol, maybe DNS too.\n\n164\n00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:06.270\nNo, that's whats known\nas a reverse lookup.\n\n165\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.940\nAll right, we talk about forward lookups.\n\n166\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.360\nWe talk about reverse lookups.\n\n167\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.724\nAnd we'll get a little\nmore into that in a bit.\n\n168\n00:09:11.724 --> 00:09:14.889\nBut when I got an IP address,\nand sometimes applications say,\n\n169\n00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.722\nI've got an IP address,\nI need to know what its name is.\n\n170\n00:09:17.722 --> 00:09:21.763\nIts gonna talk to DNS, and we can go back\nto my slide here, and it's gonna look for\n\n171\n00:09:21.763 --> 00:09:25.648\nwhat's known as a pointer record,\nPTR record as they're called for short.\n\n172\n00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:31.180\nPTR records again are pointer\nrecords that map IP address to host.\n\n173\n00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.300\nSo I want you to think\nof flipping it around.\n\n174\n00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.440\nI've got an IP address and\nI map it to a name.\n\n175\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.400\nNow one of the last ones that they\nwant you to be aware of is what's\n\n176\n00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.840\nknown as a dot txt record.\n\n177\n00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.790\nAnd it sounds, for those of you coming\nover from A+, the extension that\n\n178\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.710\nyou had to remember, txt, text document,\nthat's essentially what a txt file is.\n\n179\n00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.140\nIt's nothing more than a text document,\nand\n\n180\n00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.110\nit holds text information in it,\nall right.\n\n181\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.229\nAnd we use this for things like\nsender policy frameworks, SPF files,\n\n182\n00:10:01.229 --> 00:10:07.460\nall right, and also DomainKeys\nidentified mail, DKIM files, all right.\n\n183\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:15.570\nAnd this were clever ways that they\nwould try to stop spoofing, all right?\n\n184\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:20.930\nAnd what I mean by that is imagine,\nI ask an answer.\n\n185\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.460\nAnd Zach, you're gonna have\nto help me out here, right?\n\n186\n00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.250\nGo down, the land of make believe,\nright, Zach is a DNS server.\n\n187\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:36.230\nAnd I wanna know Zach, I need you email\nserver, where's your email server?\n\n188\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.000\nWell, I need to know that who\nI'm asking is authoritative for\n\n189\n00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.740\nthat domain name space.\n\n190\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.840\nSo it's interesting that DomainKeys,\nif you will, identified mail says well,\n\n191\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.270\nyou know how you got the from field,\nright?\n\n192\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.070\nWhen somebody gives you an email,\n\n193\n00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.250\nwell how do I know that that\nemail came from the right person?\n\n194\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.150\nWell, if I implement things\nlike private key encryption,\n\n195\n00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.960\npublic key cryptology if you will.\n\n196\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.064\nAnd we take a private key and\nwe sign the response,\n\n197\n00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:11.505\ncreate a digital signature, all right.\n\n198\n00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:16.040\nAnd Zach gives me that response back,\nI can take or even the email in this case,\n\n199\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.891\nI can take the digital signature\non that with Zach's public key and\n\n200\n00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:21.090\nI could decrypt it.\n\n201\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.460\nAnd if I can decrypt it, I can say,\n\n202\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.760\nyou know what, that certainly did\ncome from Zach, I could tell that.\n\n203\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.740\nSo it's a way these txt records again just\nassociated with some kind of text in them,\n\n204\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.930\nthey're used for sender policy frameworks.\n\n205\n00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.330\nSometimes we use this to verify\nthat the DNS server that you're\n\n206\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.940\nasking the question that you\nare the authoritative DNS server.\n\n207\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.490\nYou'll see this sometimes when you're\nsetting up those hosted DNS services,\n\n208\n00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.330\nwhere some of it's on premise,\nsome of it's in the cloud.\n\n209\n00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.080\nWhat we need to know\nthat you as a cloud host,\n\n210\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.380\na cloud provider, I need to know\nthat you are responsible for\n\n211\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.780\nyour DNS, that domain name, that you\nare the administrator, because if not,\n\n212\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.510\npeople can hijack you,\ndomain hijacking, right?\n\n213\n00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:16.270\nI say, Zach yeah, you can take care\nof this domain namespace for me.\n\n214\n00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.114\nYou can trust me.\n\n215\n00:12:17.114 --> 00:12:19.349\nWell, how does he know?\n\n216\n00:12:19.349 --> 00:12:21.440\nHow does he know that I'm not a hacker?\n\n217\n00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.880\nWell, if I put a txt record inside of my\nzone file, which as an administrator,\n\n218\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.030\nonly I should have access to, and\nhe tells me the exact information to put\n\n219\n00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:36.090\nin the txt file and then he queries\nmy DNS server for that information.\n\n220\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.082\nIf I truly am the administrator of\nthat domain, that when he asks for\n\n221\n00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:45.812\nthat txt record, he finds\nthe information that he gave only me,\n\n222\n00:12:45.812 --> 00:12:50.304\nhe can verify that the response\nis coming from my DNS server.\n\n223\n00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:53.431\nAnd because we set it up on the back end,\nthat I am the administrator and\n\n224\n00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:55.130\nI have the authority over the domain.\n\n225\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.861\nNow the DomainKeys get a little bit,\n\n226\n00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:00.680\nDomainKeys are where\ndigital signatures come in.\n\n227\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.280\nThat's where you can use public key\ncryptology to verify through a digital\n\n228\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.550\nsignature that Zach, let's say Zach sends\nme information from his email server,\n\n229\n00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.210\nright, I can trust the email because\nI have to check that digital secret.\n\n230\n00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:17.490\nThat little electronic,\ntamper-resistant watermark, if you will.\n\n231\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.850\nAll right, so great things to understand.\n\n232\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.060\nNow one of the last things that I\nwant to talk about is what's known as\n\n233\n00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.980\na forward and\nreverse lookup zone, all right?\n\n234\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.380\nWhen we talk about forward and\nreverse lookup zones, all right,\n\n235\n00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.720\nnotice that our,\nif we can go back to my slide here.\n\n236\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.120\nNotice that I said that we have\nhost addresses to IPv4 addresses,\n\n237\n00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.325\nhost names to IPv6 addresses,\nservices to IP, mail exchanger, all right.\n\n238\n00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:50.791\nA record is again who is\nthe responsible email server for\n\n239\n00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:54.118\nthis domain name space and\nwhat's it's IP address.\n\n240\n00:13:54.118 --> 00:13:57.323\nAnd then we got to the pointer record and\nI said it's an IP to host and\n\n241\n00:13:57.323 --> 00:14:00.740\nI sad that's a reverse lookup,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n242\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:07.050\nWell, you have what are known as\nzones inside of your DNS databases,\n\n243\n00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.740\ntwo zone types.\n\n244\n00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.820\nYou have what are known as\nforward lookup zones and\n\n245\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.050\nyou have what's known as\nreverse lookup zones.\n\n246\n00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.355\nLet's talk about forward lookup zones.\n\n247\n00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:17.520\nForward lookup zone, name to IP address.\n\n248\n00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.580\nNow let's make it easy,\nlet’s take all the technical jargon,\n\n249\n00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.130\njust throw all the acronyms away,\nall right.\n\n250\n00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:31.050\nForward lookup, name, service, alias,\nmail exchanger to an IP address.\n\n251\n00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.576\nWhen the IP Address is the last part,\n\n252\n00:14:33.576 --> 00:14:37.986\nthat's what you're trying to map to,\nit's a forward lookup.\n\n253\n00:14:37.986 --> 00:14:42.070\nWe switch it around,\nthe reason I said we reverse the order.\n\n254\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.122\nNow we're taking an IP address and\nwe're mapping it to a name.\n\n255\n00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:53.460\nYour PTR records are the only ones\nthat sit in the reverse lookup zone.\n\n256\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:00.894\nAll these other record types sit\nin that forward lookup zone file.\n\n257\n00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:04.221\nThe reverse lookup zones have\ntheir own file as well and\n\n258\n00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:09.570\nguess what, the only record there is\nthe PTR record or the pointer record.\n\n259\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.920\nAnd that maps the IP address to the name.\n\n260\n00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.340\nSo know those zone types.\n\n261\n00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.520\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, can we see a little bit\nmore about how all this works?\n\n262\n00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, let's go ahead and\nlet's do that.\n\n263\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.560\nAll right, let me go ahead and\ndive into my Windows Server here.\n\n264\n00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.210\nAnd it looks like it timed out on me.\n\n265\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.003\nSo if I can remember my super secret\npassword here, we'll go ahead and\n\n266\n00:15:29.003 --> 00:15:30.120\nlogin, all right.\n\n267\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.075\nSo I'm on a Windows Server here,\nall right, and if I go up to Tools,\n\n268\n00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:39.180\nright, and we scroll down, you're gonna\nsee that we've got a console here and\n\n269\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.560\nyou can see that DNS is in the name,\nall right.\n\n270\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.669\nAnd this is our DNS manager.\n\n271\n00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:46.820\nNow when we look at our DNS manager,\n\n272\n00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.911\none of the things that you're gonna\nnotice is here's our server and\n\n273\n00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:54.746\nwe got forward lookup zones, and\nwe got reverse lookup zones.\n\n274\n00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:58.452\nNow by default You don't have\nanything in the Reserve Lookup Zone,\n\n275\n00:15:58.452 --> 00:16:00.869\nyou have to create\nthe Reverse Lookup Zone.\n\n276\n00:16:00.869 --> 00:16:04.614\nDon't worry about that for the exam but\nwe are trying to show you, like Zach said,\n\n277\n00:16:04.614 --> 00:16:06.370\na little bit of hands on here, right?\n\n278\n00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:11.430\nBut I do have, if I expand out, I have\nwhat's known as a Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n279\n00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.484\nRemember, we have been\nusing demo.itpro.tv?\n\n280\n00:16:14.484 --> 00:16:15.971\nThere is my Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n281\n00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:18.720\nAnd if I select my Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n282\n00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.090\nI'm gonna notice that we have\nsome records here, all right.\n\n283\n00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:27.730\nNotice, I have an A record and\nit maps to this IP address, right.\n\n284\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.500\nSo name Client01.\n\n285\n00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:37.020\nIn fact, let's go ahead and let's look at\nhe properties of this record, all right.\n\n286\n00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.242\nThis is why I said, host the IP address.\n\n287\n00:16:39.242 --> 00:16:42.090\nAgain, you'll look at some of the verbage,\nwell, differ.\n\n288\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.900\nIt's a host name, host.\n\n289\n00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.020\nSo here's the host name, right.\n\n290\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.000\nOr a computer name, if you will.\n\n291\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.605\nAnd I can show you that here if and\nit's an IP address.\n\n292\n00:16:50.605 --> 00:16:53.930\nLet me go ahead and just finish my train\nof though here before I jump ship here.\n\n293\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.290\nNotice that I have an IP address, so\n\n294\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.970\nit takes it's name,\nmaps it to an IP address, all right?\n\n295\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.230\nAnd its fully qualified domain\nname becomes a combination\n\n296\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:12.260\nof the host name and\nthen the domain name, all right.\n\n297\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.950\nAnd that's important to understand.\n\n298\n00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.050\nNow, we could also jump over\nhere to my Windows 10 machine.\n\n299\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.952\nWe get logged in here real quick and\nI can show you that if I right\n\n300\n00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:26.931\nclick on the Windows charm,\nand I choose system.\n\n301\n00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:33.170\nAnd lets say I just go ahead and\nget some system info here.\n\n302\n00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.403\nI can see, looks all of\nthe screen refreshed there, and\n\n303\n00:17:38.403 --> 00:17:41.282\nit's also a computer name, all right.\n\n304\n00:17:41.282 --> 00:17:45.444\nSo host name all of that confusion to\nWindows, where all host name and computer\n\n305\n00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:50.100\nare the same thing, and then I can also\nsee the domain that I'm attached to.\n\n306\n00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.470\nSo again, computer name or\nhost name plus the domain name equal and\n\n307\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:59.370\nit says full computer name, again,\njust more verbiage, that's your FQDN.\n\n308\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.411\nAnd you can see that that\nrecord resides here in\n\n309\n00:18:03.411 --> 00:18:08.188\nthe Forward Lookup Zone in this database,\nall right.\n\n310\n00:18:08.188 --> 00:18:10.190\nNow, we have other records here too.\n\n311\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.300\nAll right, but if I wanted to,\nyou can see I can right click, and\n\n312\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.910\nI can create additional record, right.\n\n313\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.240\nHere's my exchanger record if I\nneeded to map to an email server\n\n314\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.470\nthat's responsible for this domain\nname space, I could create one here.\n\n315\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.700\nI could also create the AAAA which\nis the IPV6 address if I wanted.\n\n316\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.618\nOr I can do a canonical name,\nan alias, all right.\n\n317\n00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:37.197\nSo again, let's do a little make\nbelieve here, right, Win81a.\n\n318\n00:18:37.197 --> 00:18:40.070\nLet's just say that that's my web server.\n\n319\n00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.250\nI don't want anyone to have to type or\ntry to remember Win81a.\n\n320\n00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.590\nSo what I can do here is I can right\nclick and say, hey, lets make an alias.\n\n321\n00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.632\nAnd I want you to notice something\nabout the canonical name.\n\n322\n00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:58.560\nAll right, when I type www that instantly\nbecomes a fully qualified domain name.\n\n323\n00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.410\nAnd notice the trailing dot there.\n\n324\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.214\nZach, you see that?\n\n325\n00:19:01.214 --> 00:19:02.318\n&gt;&gt; I see what we did there.\n&gt;&gt; That's the root.\n\n326\n00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:03.062\n&gt;&gt; That's your root.\n\n327\n00:19:03.062 --> 00:19:04.046\n&gt;&gt; Right, so it's there.\n\n328\n00:19:04.046 --> 00:19:05.840\nThe DNS server is using it.\n\n329\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.260\nYour web browsers are using it.\n\n330\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.450\nWe don't use it as humans, right.\n\n331\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.670\nBut it is implied, all right.\n\n332\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.210\nNotice, it's not asking for an IP address.\n\n333\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.480\nRemember, I told you the aliases\ndon't map to IP addresses,\n\n334\n00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.200\nthey map to FQDNs, or the hosts that\nthey're associated with, right.\n\n335\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.280\nSo if I browse,\nI could browse the DNS data base, and\n\n336\n00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.100\nI can look up in the Forward Lookup Zone.\n\n337\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:37.427\nAnd I can find the host that I want,\nin this case it's Win81, all right.\n\n338\n00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:42.317\nOr if I wanted to and\nI was like going for punishment,\n\n339\n00:19:42.317 --> 00:19:48.208\nI was gonna check my typing skills,\nI can do a Win81a.demo,\n\n340\n00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:54.460\nlike I said, challenging my\ntyping abilities, dot, all right.\n\n341\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.160\nAnd I can't remember if you need to,\nyou don't need to, I don't think so but\n\n342\n00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.940\nI think you can put in\nthe implied dot as well.\n\n343\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.470\nSo what's gonna happen now, is when\nsomebody goes to try to resolve www,\n\n344\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:13.210\nthe DNS database is gonna look and\nit's gonna say, www, can I see that?\n\n345\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:18.764\nI see I've got an FQDN\ncalled www.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n346\n00:20:18.764 --> 00:20:22.800\nAnd it maps to this host.\n\n347\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.990\nThis fully qualified domain name, and then\nit goes a step farther and it says okay,\n\n348\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.050\nso let me look at this\nfully qualified domain name\n\n349\n00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.530\nof that host that we just talked about.\n\n350\n00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.110\nAnd here's its IP address.\n\n351\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.494\nAnd it returns that answer\nto a local computer.\n\n352\n00:20:36.494 --> 00:20:40.260\nNow let's see, let's jump over\nto our Windows 10 machine here.\n\n353\n00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.465\nAnd let's bring up the properties of\nthe network adaptor by right clicking on\n\n354\n00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:44.560\nthe little monitor icon.\n\n355\n00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.970\nMy head is kinda covering it up, but right\nclicking on the little monitor icon and\n\n356\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.470\nchoosing Open Network and Sharing Center.\n\n357\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.248\nWe'll go ahead and choose Change\nadapter settings, select Ethernet 01,\n\n358\n00:20:56.248 --> 00:20:57.660\nright-click on it.\n\n359\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.140\nAnd we're gonna choose Status.\n\n360\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.420\nFrom the Status dialog box, we're gonna\ngo ahead and choose Details, all right.\n\n361\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.820\nNow remember what I said,\nthat your TCP/IP properties of\n\n362\n00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.610\nyour network adapter will dictate which\nof these, what DNS server you use.\n\n363\n00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.090\nNow, I have put in the DNS server,\n\n364\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.110\nbasically the IP address of the DNS\nserver that we were just looking at.\n\n365\n00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.330\nSo when I tried to do name resolution,\n\n366\n00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.660\nit should look to that DNS server and\nask a question.\n\n367\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.730\nLet's see if it does, all right.\n\n368\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.230\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's use a name resolution command and\n\n369\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.970\nwe will test this out.\n\n370\n00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.657\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe'll open PowerShell.\n\n371\n00:21:41.657 --> 00:21:43.730\nYou can also do the command prompt,\nif you would like.\n\n372\n00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.200\nAnd let's go ahead and\nclear the screen off.\n\n373\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.110\nGive ourselves a little\nmore real stay here.\n\n374\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.590\nAnd we're gonna type nslookup which\nis short for name server lookup.\n\n375\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.260\nIf you are in the UNIX world,\nLinux world, and\n\n376\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.900\neven on Mac,\nyou can use what's known as domain name,\n\n377\n00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.770\ndomain internet groper,\nall right, the dig command.\n\n378\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.810\nThat's what they use to\ntest name resolution.\n\n379\n00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:13.180\nNow, nslookup is in those systems too,\nbut it's kinda outdated.\n\n380\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.090\nMicrosoft keeps it around in their\nsystems for DNS name resolution testing.\n\n381\n00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.720\nSo we're gonna go ahead and what we're\ngonna do, remember we had that record,\n\n382\n00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.310\nthat canonical record?\n\n383\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.556\nI am gonna look for it,\nI'm gonna do nslookup space, and\n\n384\n00:22:25.556 --> 00:22:27.800\nthen the fully qualified domain name.\n\n385\n00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:35.390\nAnd I am going to type www.demo,\nmaybe, .itpro.tv.\n\n386\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.450\nWe are gonna see if it will\nresolve the name, all right.\n\n387\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.820\nNow we are getting a little\ntime out here and that's fine.\n\n388\n00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.665\nBut what we should see is that it\nasks the DNS server, all right.\n\n389\n00:22:49.665 --> 00:22:57.150\nWhere's www.itpro.tv or www.demo.itpro.tv?\n\n390\n00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:01.260\nAnd the DNS server just looked and\nsaid, yeah I know where www is.\n\n391\n00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.550\nAnd it looked and it said,\nits this host and\n\n392\n00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.390\nthen it looks at that host, it looks\nat the FQDN and then it just says,\n\n393\n00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.230\nlet me see that fqdn and\nwhat the IP address is that it mapped to.\n\n394\n00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.930\nAnd it returns me the IP address, right.\n\n395\n00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.270\nSo if I switch back over,\nremember we said,\n\n396\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:22.140\nhere is the host that it was looking for\nand it's IP address?\n\n397\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.028\nAnd that's what it did.\n\n398\n00:23:23.028 --> 00:23:27.570\nIt said yeah, I see www, let me go ahead,\nlet me look at the properties of www.\n\n399\n00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.587\nI see that maps to this fully\nqualified domain name and\n\n400\n00:23:31.587 --> 00:23:37.840\nthat fully qualified domain name as\nan alias for this host, or this FQDN.\n\n401\n00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.564\nNow that I know that, let me go ahead and\n\n402\n00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:45.437\nI'll look at the properties of that\nFQDN and yes, I'll see its name or\n\n403\n00:23:45.437 --> 00:23:49.921\nits FQDN is mapped to this IP address and\nit returns that answer.\n\n404\n00:23:49.921 --> 00:23:53.286\nEssentially back to my computer.\n\n405\n00:23:53.286 --> 00:23:54.880\nPut that back on the screen there.\n\n406\n00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.478\nSo that's your name resolution, right?\n\n407\n00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.340\nNot really too difficult.\n\n408\n00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:05.750\nIt is important to understand that DNS is\nreally one of the most important services.\n\n409\n00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:13.540\nNow, I'll also let you know too that you\ncan use a couple of other commands too.\n\n410\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.200\nLike for instance,\n\n411\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.202\nInternet protocol configuration,\nipconfig, we can use that as well.\n\n412\n00:24:18.202 --> 00:24:22.750\nAnd ipconfig, it really does a lot\nof things to the properties,\n\n413\n00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.740\nthe IP properties of your network adapter,\nall right?\n\n414\n00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.826\nOne of the things it can do is\ndisplay that resolver cache.\n\n415\n00:24:28.826 --> 00:24:37.199\nSo if I did an ipconfig /displaydns.\n\n416\n00:24:40.056 --> 00:24:42.768\nWell, didn't we just ask for a dc?\n\n417\n00:24:42.768 --> 00:24:43.990\nA domain name?\n\n418\n00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.300\nRemember I told you my computer\nhas to find the domain controller.\n\n419\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.250\nI don't know where the domain\ncontroller is, right?\n\n420\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.256\nSo DNS is yeah, here's your domain name\ncontroller, you can find it right here.\n\n421\n00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:58.437\nYou can find it at this IP address,\nall right?\n\n422\n00:24:58.437 --> 00:25:03.091\nNow, it's interesting that it didn't\ncache the www, but lets go ahead and\n\n423\n00:25:03.091 --> 00:25:04.410\nI'll tell you what.\n\n424\n00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:09.400\nAnd you know what, if I would have tried\nto browse the www via the web browser it\n\n425\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.040\nwould have cached this response.\n\n426\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.710\nWhen you use nslookup to test\nwhether name resolution's happening,\n\n427\n00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.890\nyou're not looking here, all right?\n\n428\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.268\nYou're not looking at the local\nresolver cache, all right?\n\n429\n00:25:22.268 --> 00:25:26.220\nSo just to understand, and I can actually\nif I wanted to, I could switch over to my,\n\n430\n00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:30.670\nremember I told you DNS servers\neven have a local resolver cache?\n\n431\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.260\nLet's go ahead and,\nlet me adjust this font size a little bit.\n\n432\n00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.360\nThat is definitely really small here,\na little hard to see there, all right?\n\n433\n00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.080\nAnd let's go ahead, again,\nlet's give some space here.\n\n434\n00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:52.980\nAnd if I do an ipconfig space /displaydns\nI've got a few here, all right?\n\n435\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:59.579\nAnd I can see that there are some\nanswers here inside as well.\n\n436\n00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:05.920\nNotice your CNAME Record here is likewise,\nall right?\n\n437\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.220\nNow there's also a TTL.\n\n438\n00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.300\nI'm just gonna mention the TTL here too.\n\n439\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.408\nThe TTL is time to live, all right?\n\n440\n00:26:11.408 --> 00:26:19.832\nAnd you might not want these\nrecords staying valid forever.\n\n441\n00:26:19.832 --> 00:26:22.728\nBecause notice my local resolver cache,\nmy local resolver cache.\n\n442\n00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:26.914\nRemember I said, if I've got the answer\nlocally then I'm never gonna ask a DNS\n\n443\n00:26:26.914 --> 00:26:30.165\nserver the question,\nit's important to understand that.\n\n444\n00:26:30.165 --> 00:26:35.547\nAgain, we have services, if we look we can\nactually see the DNS client service here.\n\n445\n00:26:35.547 --> 00:26:38.810\nAnd we'll go ahead and\ndo filter this down by name.\n\n446\n00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.950\nThere's my DNS client, all right?\n\n447\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.280\nAnd that DNS client service has to run,\nall right?\n\n448\n00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.648\nFor you to cache, right?\n\n449\n00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:51.900\nNotice it says that if you turn this off,\nthe results of DNS name queries will not\n\n450\n00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.910\nbe cached and the computer's\nname will not be registered.\n\n451\n00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.880\nRegistering DNS is when my computer\nsays to the DNS server hey, I'm here,\n\n452\n00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.610\nI'm a part of your domain.\n\n453\n00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.790\nAnd guess what happens?\n\n454\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.910\nYour computer dynamically registers\nthat IP address, all right?\n\n455\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.310\nWell, I want you to go back\nto the cache for a second,\n\n456\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.930\nas it relates to TTL, all right?\n\n457\n00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.120\nWhat happens if an IP address changes,\nall right?\n\n458\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.388\nWell, if an IP address\nof a host changes and\n\n459\n00:27:17.388 --> 00:27:19.659\nit doesn't map what you have in the cache?\n\n460\n00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:22.092\nRemember, you're not gonna\nask the DNS server anything.\n\n461\n00:27:22.092 --> 00:27:25.230\nYou've got the answer,\nwhether it's right or wrong.\n\n462\n00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.460\nSo we put TTLs on these records and\nsay okay, use that record for\n\n463\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.590\nthis amount of time.\n\n464\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.130\nAfter this amount of time I\nwant you to just purge it.\n\n465\n00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.782\nFlush it right out of the cache\nlike it doesn't exist anymore.\n\n466\n00:27:34.782 --> 00:27:37.778\nAnd then ask the DNS\nserver a question again.\n\n467\n00:27:37.778 --> 00:27:43.092\nSome, and you'll learn this as you\ngo on into more advanced training,\n\n468\n00:27:43.092 --> 00:27:47.004\nsome records you want to cache for\na very short time.\n\n469\n00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:49.527\nYou don't want them cached too long,\nright?\n\n470\n00:27:49.527 --> 00:27:52.580\nOther ones, where you know the IP\naddress isn't gonna change?\n\n471\n00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.110\nSure, you can leave it 24 hours,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n472\n00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.920\nBut there are certain records\nthat you will want to change and\n\n473\n00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.555\nyou want them to purge out of\nthe cache and not stay there forever.\n\n474\n00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:04.014\nCuz let's face it, if you're one of\nthose ones, I'm raising my hand here,\n\n475\n00:28:04.014 --> 00:28:05.678\nthat never turns your computer off?\n\n476\n00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:13.014\nYou might have a DNS record that's been\nin the cache of your RAM now for a month?\n\n477\n00:28:13.014 --> 00:28:14.802\nAnd things do change, right?\n\n478\n00:28:14.802 --> 00:28:17.430\nAnd so you do have to understand that,\nthat things do change.\n\n479\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.170\nNow I will tell you one last\nthing about record creation.\n\n480\n00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.130\nI know we're running out of time in\nthis episode, but I do wanna mention.\n\n481\n00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.270\nIs that records can be static or\nthey can be dynamic, all right?\n\n482\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:34.380\nHere, when we talk about dynamic\nrecords here in the Windows world or\n\n483\n00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.950\nthe Microsoft land.\n\n484\n00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.210\nYou can typically tell the difference,\nright?\n\n485\n00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.595\nStatic, kinda obvious on that one, right?\n\n486\n00:28:40.595 --> 00:28:43.264\nAnd what that means is it's\nbeen manually created.\n\n487\n00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:46.678\nNow, I didn't create one for the dc, okay?\n\n488\n00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:51.317\nBecause this domain name system is\nintegrated into Active Directory.\n\n489\n00:28:51.317 --> 00:28:54.873\nA couple of these were created\nautomatically before I did anything,\n\n490\n00:28:54.873 --> 00:28:55.493\nall right?\n\n491\n00:28:55.493 --> 00:28:58.160\nBut if I say,\nI've got a host out there, right?\n\n492\n00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:02.945\nAnd it's gonna be client03, all right?\n\n493\n00:29:02.945 --> 00:29:07.726\nAnd its IP address is gonna be 192.168.1.\n\n494\n00:29:07.726 --> 00:29:10.127\nI don't know, 11.\n\n495\n00:29:10.127 --> 00:29:13.912\nNow, let's do this in tens, right?\n\n496\n00:29:13.912 --> 00:29:14.754\nAdd Host.\n\n497\n00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:25.030\nAll right, notice that I have created\nthis record myself, all right?\n\n498\n00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.410\nAnd now that's a manual creation,\nall right?\n\n499\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.970\nNow you can also see the TTLs.\n\n500\n00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.650\nNow by default,\nif I right-click on this and\n\n501\n00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.320\nI choose Properties,\nyou don't see the time to live at all.\n\n502\n00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.600\nThat's actually an advanced feature.\n\n503\n00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.560\nSo if I go up there, if you're ever\nworking with our practice labs,\n\n504\n00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.050\nif you're following along at home, right?\n\n505\n00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.930\nYou go up to your DNS manager console and\nyou choose advanced?\n\n506\n00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.870\nYou'll get a lot of extra records\nthere that you can learn on in some of\n\n507\n00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.540\nthe course that we have\nthat are more advanced.\n\n508\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.610\nBut now if I right-click and\nI choose Properties?\n\n509\n00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.800\nNotice what I have here, a TTL all right?\n\n510\n00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.583\nAnd the TTL,\n\n511\n00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:04.135\nyou can also do record stamp that says\nDelete this record when it becomes stale.\n\n512\n00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:10.017\nAgain, if the record no longer, it's gone\npast its TTL, it becomes a stale record.\n\n513\n00:30:10.017 --> 00:30:13.978\nAnd it will basically be flushed\nout of the cache, all right?\n\n514\n00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:18.160\nNow, that was a manual creation,\nall right?\n\n515\n00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.350\nLet me go ahead real quick and\nlet me delete client 02.\n\n516\n00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.410\nThis computer that we've been\ndealing with is client 02.\n\n517\n00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.078\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna delete that record.\n\n518\n00:30:27.078 --> 00:30:31.890\nAnd we're gonna switch back over\nto our Windows 10 machine here and\n\n519\n00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.410\nI'm going to bring up the properties\nagain of its network adapter.\n\n520\n00:30:36.148 --> 00:30:39.400\nAnd we're gonna look at in this\ncase Internet Protocol Version 4,\n\n521\n00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.220\nchoose Properties and\nnotice that I have a static IP address.\n\n522\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.210\nAnd I have statically mapped,\n\n523\n00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:52.170\nif you will, a DNS server, all right?\n\n524\n00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.946\nI can change this to DNS or DHCP.\n\n525\n00:30:56.946 --> 00:31:01.322\nAnd depending on how I\nhave my domain set up,\n\n526\n00:31:01.322 --> 00:31:08.870\nwhen I obtain a DHCP assigned address\nI can also dynamically tell DNS.\n\n527\n00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.240\nHey, DNS?\n\n528\n00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.980\nI just got a brand new IP address.\n\n529\n00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.010\nI need you to update your records.\n\n530\n00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.020\nAnd it reaches out to that DNS server,\n\n531\n00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.890\nprovided you have the authority to do\nthat, you have to be a domain member,\n\n532\n00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.625\nthere's a couple of stipulations on that,\nnot just anybody can do that.\n\n533\n00:31:22.625 --> 00:31:24.920\nThat computer has to be\njoined to the domain.\n\n534\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.440\nIt can say new IP address\nfrom the DHCP server?\n\n535\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.320\nAll right, records don't match,\nlet's go ahead and update it.\n\n536\n00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.400\nAnd it dynamically either registers it for\nthe first time or it updates to match and\n\n537\n00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.330\nreflect the new DHCP address,\nvery cool things.\n\n538\n00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:47.076\nWhich leads us into our next service,\nDHCP, which also runs us out of time.\n\n539\n00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:49.118\n&gt;&gt; A ha, another cliffhanger.\n\n540\n00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:51.560\n[LAUGH] Network service\nfunctions part two,\n\n541\n00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.660\nthere will be a Network Service\nFunctions Part 3, where we look at DHCP.\n\n542\n00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.246\nSo you don't wanna miss that and\n\n543\n00:31:57.246 --> 00:32:00.260\nyou don't wanna miss anything\nin the CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n544\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.440\nWes is doing a wonderful job,\nhe always does.\n\n545\n00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.555\nAnd in fact,\ncheck out the rest of the course library.\n\n546\n00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:07.810\nThere's so many videos and\nthey're all there to do one thing.\n\n547\n00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.310\nHelp you go further.\n\n548\n00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.937\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n549\n00:32:10.937 --> 00:32:12.198\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n550\n00:32:12.198 --> 00:32:13.650\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

00:00:08.297\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.925\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.063\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:15.760\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.890\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\n\n8\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.700\nas we continue on with\nCompTIA Net+ Network Service Functions,\n\n9\n00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.480\nthis is part three.\n\n10\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.650\nAnd that's right, and in fact,\nwe left off with DHCP.\n\n11\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.040\nBut before we get there I have to\nintroduce this fellow right here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.390\nThis is Wes Bryan, he knows everything.\n\n13\n00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.383\nWes, thanks for being here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:33.375\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hey, it's good.\n\n15\n00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:34.960\nBoy, you set that bar high.\n\n16\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.043\nHopefully you're gonna-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:37.474\n&gt;&gt; Stick around and help me hold that bar.\n\n18\n00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:40.020\nBut that's right,\nI don't know a little bit.\n\n19\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.690\nWhat we wanna show you is enough,\nhopefully, and hopefully so\n\n20\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.780\nthat you'll pass that Net+ exam.\n\n21\n00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.428\nKeep in mind that we try to give\na good comprehensive overview of some\n\n22\n00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:51.739\nof the objectives that you're gonna see.\n\n23\n00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.670\nBut you can always learn more and\nyou can always study, study, study.\n\n24\n00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.750\nSo let's go ahead.\n\n25\n00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.900\nWe're gonna look at DHCP\ninside of this episode.\n\n26\n00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.747\n&gt;&gt; And I was just gonna ask you that maybe\ngive us a recap, too, where we've been and\n\n27\n00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:06.920\nwhere we're going, but DHCP, certainly.\n\n28\n00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in the first couple of parts,\nwe'll start with the recap.\n\n29\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.649\nRemember in the first couple of\nparts we talked about a very,\n\n30\n00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.438\nvery important service that's out there.\n\n31\n00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:17.915\nAnd it really revolves around\nname resolution, right?\n\n32\n00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:21.407\nAgain, it is mapping names to\nIP Addresses, if you will, so\n\n33\n00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:23.880\nthat we could find things like computers.\n\n34\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.300\nWe can find services,\nwe can find an email server for a domain.\n\n35\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.918\nAnd you know what's kinda interesting?\n\n36\n00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:33.070\nOne of the things, Zach, that I didn't\nmention in there that I do have to.\n\n37\n00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.848\nWe talked about in other episodes,\nwe mentioned the record types, right?\n\n38\n00:01:36.848 --> 00:01:40.568\nAnd we went through all the various\nrecords, A records, quad A records,\n\n39\n00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:45.110\nMX records, PTI records, canonical\nnames or C_Names, aliases, if you will.\n\n40\n00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.313\nOne of the ones that I didn't mention,\nand I wanna go ahead and\n\n41\n00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:52.210\nmention now is an NS record because we\nwanna be complete to the objectives.\n\n42\n00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.904\nAnd the NS record is essentially\nnothing more than a Name Server record.\n\n43\n00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:06.900\nIf you want a DNS Server basically\nto know where a Name Server is for\n\n44\n00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.270\nanother domain, what you can do is you\ncan put NS record up in the DNS server.\n\n45\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.450\nAnd what that will do is\nwhen you are looking for\n\n46\n00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.690\na name that correlates with this name\nserver's domain name space, if you will.\n\n47\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.090\nBasically DNS can say, hey, well,\nlet me return you the IP address of\n\n48\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.180\nthe name server, and then you can go just\ntalk directly to that DNS server and\n\n49\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.160\nyou can get your resolution there.\n\n50\n00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.040\nSo that was one of the records that I\ndidn't mention when it comes to DNS.\n\n51\n00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.875\nSo if you're not aware of some of\nthe records that we're talking about, or\n\n52\n00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.862\nthat doesn't make sense to you, please\ngo back and watch the first two parts.\n\n53\n00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:41.239\n&gt;&gt; Please do.\n\n54\n00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.587\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move on into part three,\ntalking about the DHCP service.\n\n55\n00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:52.690\nIn other episodes, we talked\nabout how we obtain IP addresses.\n\n56\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.663\nWe talked about things like static IP\naddressing where we have to manually\n\n57\n00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:59.300\nconfigure IP addresses\non all of our computers.\n\n58\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.790\nAnd that does run the risk for not only\nbeing an administrative complexity,\n\n59\n00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.660\nthe fact that you have to\ndo this multiple times.\n\n60\n00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.280\nIf you have 1,000\ncomputers in your network,\n\n61\n00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.860\nif you're doing everything statically,\nyeah, you got to do this 1,000 times.\n\n62\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.190\nYou have to configure things like\nsubnet mask, default gateways,\n\n63\n00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.350\nthe DNS servers and\nthat also leads to configuration errors.\n\n64\n00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250\nRemember that one of things that we\ncan do is that we can set that DHCP\n\n65\n00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.100\nserver out on our network.\n\n66\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.640\nAnd we can set our clients up to use DHCP.\n\n67\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.790\nAnd they call out to the network when\nthey need an IP address and say,\n\n68\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.290\nhey, anybody out there got an IP address.\n\n69\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.120\nI could really use one.\n\n70\n00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.641\nAnd the DHCP service, if it's configured\nto respond will respond with an offer and\n\n71\n00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:36.590\nsome additional configurations.\n\n72\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.360\nWe're going to look a little bit more\nat the DHCP server side of it itself.\n\n73\n00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.000\nIf you're not aware of what the DHCP or\nthe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n74\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.400\nI hate doing that, especially to\nour CompTIA viewers down there.\n\n75\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.120\nI've said an acronym four or\nfive terms and\n\n76\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.170\nI haven't once mentioned\nwhat that acronym is.\n\n77\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.140\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol,\nright?\n\n78\n00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.439\nWe're gonna look a little bit,\n\n79\n00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.270\nmore at the service than some of\nthe components inside of the service.\n\n80\n00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.850\nSo I tell you what, without further ado,\nlet's just go ahead and\n\n81\n00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.240\nrather than just speak about\neverything that we have to talk about,\n\n82\n00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.850\nlet's go ahead and\ndo both at the same time.\n\n83\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.140\nWe'll kinda show you, and talk about\nsome of the things that we're saying.\n\n84\n00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.190\nSo I'm back on the same Windows Server\nhere that we had in the last episode.\n\n85\n00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.590\nYou might remember that we looked at\nTools and we went to the Roles, and\n\n86\n00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.190\nif you remember,\nwe pulled up the DNS console, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.010\nWell, I've got DHCP here too.\n\n88\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.570\nNow this role, I've installed it.\n\n89\n00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.490\nBut I haven't done any configurations\non it because the great thing about\n\n90\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.030\nconfiguring it is the wizard that I\nreally like that Microsoft has here kind\n\n91\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.690\nof points you through some of the topics\nthat we need to look at for the exam here.\n\n92\n00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.860\nSo what a great way, if you haven't\nseen bringing a DHCP server online and\n\n93\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.100\nconfiguring it for the first time to\nstart handing out IP addresses and\n\n94\n00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.640\nsome of the components that make up\nthe DHCP service that can also help\n\n95\n00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.730\nto assist the computers\nthat are on your network.\n\n96\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.330\nSo you'll see here if I go up to\nthe little action event flag here.\n\n97\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.000\nNotice it does say we need\na post-deployment configuration here for\n\n98\n00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000\nme and what that means is that I need\nto complete the DHCP configuration.\n\n99\n00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.710\nNow I will tell you, when I click this\nlink, there's one thing that I'm going to\n\n100\n00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.178\nhave to do here that is really kind of\nunique, if you will, to the Windows world.\n\n101\n00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:23.770\nI understand that this is not on the exam,\nbut\n\n102\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.070\nI just don't want you\nguys to be confused here.\n\n103\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.142\nWhat this is gonna do is this is gonna\ncreate the computers, the security groups,\n\n104\n00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:37.894\ninside of our Active Directory so\nthat they can not only use, but\n\n105\n00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:42.300\nalso configure DHCP, and\nthen authorize the DHCP server.\n\n106\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.020\nBecause it says, if domain joined, this\nDHCP server, this is domain joined and\n\n107\n00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.250\nauthorizing that server just means it's\nallowed to hand out IP addresses on\n\n108\n00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.180\nour network.\n\n109\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.487\nUnderstand that's a Microsoft,\nthat's a Windows Domain thing.\n\n110\n00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.780\nThat's a Windows DHCP server.\n\n111\n00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.220\nThat's not something that's\ngonna be on the exam objectives,\n\n112\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.850\nbut we have to do it to go ahead and\nstart.\n\n113\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.650\nSo I'll go ahead, commit this,\nwe'll bring this server online basically\n\n114\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.870\ncreating the security groups and\nauthorizing the DHCP server and\n\n115\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.425\nActive Directory so\nthat we can hand out IP addresses.\n\n116\n00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:13.060\nLet me make sure that I close that.\n\n117\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.710\nAnd now that that's done,\nwe can launch our DHCP console.\n\n118\n00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.069\nNow DHCP console looks a lot like our\nDNS manager, management consoles.\n\n119\n00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.580\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look much different, right?\n\n120\n00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.760\nAnd we can see that this is our, this\njust happens to be our DHCP server here.\n\n121\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.340\nAnd if I expand this out, I'll see that we\nhave two protocols, because remember like\n\n122\n00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.090\nwe talked about, IP addresses in other\nepisodes, the DHCP service, remember that?\n\n123\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.048\nNot only can we hand out IPv4 addresses,\nwe can also hand out IPv6 addresses,\n\n124\n00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:41.793\nall right?\n\n125\n00:06:41.793 --> 00:06:46.218\nSo what we're gonna focus on right now, is\nwe're just kind of drill down into IPv4,\n\n126\n00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:46.850\nall right?\n\n127\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.675\nNow IPv4, to get this up and running,\nright, so that we can start handing\n\n128\n00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:53.852\nout IP addresses,\nwe need to create what's known as a scope.\n\n129\n00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:56.300\nAll right, now scope, we're not\ntalking about mouthwash here, right?\n\n130\n00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.136\nBut what we're talking about here when\nwe say scope is a range of addresses\n\n131\n00:07:01.136 --> 00:07:05.582\nthat we wanna hand out to clients\nwhen they call out to the network and\n\n132\n00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:08.873\nthey say, I need an IP address,\nanybody got one?\n\n133\n00:07:08.873 --> 00:07:13.899\nWell, for us to offer an IP address,\nwe have to have a scope.\n\n134\n00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:15.227\nThat's where it starts.\n\n135\n00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:20.711\nSo let's go ahead and\nwhat we'll do is we'll right-click\n\n136\n00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:25.769\non our IPv4 here, and\nwe're gonna choose New Scope.\n\n137\n00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:27.100\nSo that's the very first part.\n\n138\n00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.841\nWe'll choose New Scope, and\n\n139\n00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:32.676\nthis will bring us in to our New Scope\nwizard which is what we want.\n\n140\n00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:35.000\nI love these wizards\ncuz they're very easy.\n\n141\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.100\nThey kinda walk you through\neverything that you need to know.\n\n142\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.100\nAnd you can name the scope,\nthe name is arbitrary.\n\n143\n00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.281\nIt's for identification\npurposes on your side, right?\n\n144\n00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.075\nSo I might just say,\nI don't know, clients maybe.\n\n145\n00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:48.750\nMaybe I just wanna say\nthis is the client scope.\n\n146\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.100\nAgain, this is up to you.\n\n147\n00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.786\nIt's all up to how you do\nthe architecture in your network.\n\n148\n00:07:55.786 --> 00:08:00.071\nAll right, now the next thing\nthat we need to do is we need to\n\n149\n00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:02.702\nconfigure a range of IP addresses.\n\n150\n00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:09.552\nSo I'm gonna give out this from\nthis IP address to this IP address.\n\n151\n00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:12.803\nNow when doing that,\nwhat that's gonna do is it's gonna give us\n\n152\n00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:15.770\na certain amount of IP addresses\nthat we have to lease out.\n\n153\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.802\nSo let's go ahead and let's say,\nI'm gonna do 192.168.\n\n154\n00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:21.277\nWe're doing private IP addresses here.\n\n155\n00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:26.506\nAnd instead of doing 1.1,\nI'm not going to do 1.1 all right.\n\n156\n00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:30.229\nWhy, well, a lot of times and\nit doesn't have to be, but\n\n157\n00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:35.582\nyour very first address within a network\nrange a lot of times it's not reserved but\n\n158\n00:08:35.582 --> 00:08:39.088\nadmins like to reserve it for\ntheir default gateway.\n\n159\n00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:43.587\nSo the router, so now everybody\nknows that 1.1 the very first\n\n160\n00:08:43.587 --> 00:08:48.100\nnetwork address within that network\nrange is gonna be a router.\n\n161\n00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.040\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nwhat we're not gonna do is 1.1.\n\n162\n00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.380\nWe're actually gonna start\nhere from 192.168.1.2.\n\n163\n00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.578\nAnd then from here,\n\n164\n00:08:57.578 --> 00:09:01.960\nwe'll say what's the last address in\nthis range that we want to give out?\n\n165\n00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.460\nHow many addresses are we gonna have?\n\n166\n00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.853\nWhat I'm gonna do here other than 1.1,\n\n167\n00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:11.254\nI'm gonna do the entire\nclass C network of 192.1.0.\n\n168\n00:09:11.254 --> 00:09:16.102\nWe'll do the entire network range,\nso what we're gonna\n\n169\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:21.080\ndo here is we're gonna do 192.168.1.254.\n\n170\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.421\nRemember, those of you have looked\nat some of our other episodes,\n\n171\n00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:25.741\nI can't give out 255.\n\n172\n00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:26.914\nThat's the broadcast address.\n\n173\n00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:30.810\nAll computers use that to receive\nbroadcast communications.\n\n174\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.239\nThat's why it's not 255, but it's 254.\n\n175\n00:09:32.239 --> 00:09:37.000\nThat's the last usable IP address\nessentially within this network.\n\n176\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.232\nNow the next thing that we do is we\nconfigure things like the subnet mask.\n\n177\n00:09:42.232 --> 00:09:43.830\nAnd I can modify this.\n\n178\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.484\nI can do this couple of different ways.\n\n179\n00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:47.808\nI can decide [INAUDIBLE] if we happen\nto be doing class listener domain\n\n180\n00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:48.754\nrouting, right.\n\n181\n00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.820\nAnd I can do a variable link subnet mask,\nVLSM.\n\n182\n00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.004\nBut I'm gonna ahead and\nI'll just leave it classful.\n\n183\n00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:01.573\nSo we're gonna use a /24,\n24 bit subnet mask, or\n\n184\n00:10:01.573 --> 00:10:05.310\na 255.255.255.0 and we'll choose Next.\n\n185\n00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.872\nNow, we also have what\nare known as exclusions.\n\n186\n00:10:08.872 --> 00:10:11.220\nI'm gonna come back to exclusions here,\n\n187\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.780\ncuz I want to show you\nsetting up exclusions.\n\n188\n00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.610\nBut, it's going to give you\nwhat the definitions are.\n\n189\n00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.246\nAn exclusion says if you've got within\nthis range that you just created,\n\n190\n00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:25.848\nif we go back to My Computer\nwithin this range right here.\n\n191\n00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:29.544\nYou've got a certain set\nof addresses that you\n\n192\n00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:33.130\ndon't want this DHCP server to hand out.\n\n193\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.838\nMaybe you got things like\nvoice over IP phones.\n\n194\n00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:38.355\nThey're statically mapped.\n\n195\n00:10:38.355 --> 00:10:41.524\nThey’re not changing,\nthey don't rely on a dynamic address.\n\n196\n00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:42.669\nYou statically map those.\n\n197\n00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:47.546\nWell, if I want, I could put a range.\n\n198\n00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:51.190\nI could do let's say maybe 192.168.1.\n\n199\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.749\nAnd I don't know,\nmaybe I've got a few addresses,\n\n200\n00:10:55.749 --> 00:10:59.076\n150, and I can do 192, maybe.\n\n201\n00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:02.100\nNo, 192.168.1 and I can do maybe 200.\n\n202\n00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.855\nAnd I say that, it's kind of hard for\nme to type apparently.\n\n203\n00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:10.167\nAnd then what I could do,\nis I could add that, and that says those,\n\n204\n00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:13.550\n50 address will not be\nhanded out to anybody.\n\n205\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.838\nI don't care, if you call out on\nthe network and say hey got an IP address,\n\n206\n00:11:16.838 --> 00:11:18.600\nyour not going to get these addresses.\n\n207\n00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.995\nAnd then if we had 50 voice over IP phones\nthat were statically mapped, guess what?\n\n208\n00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:25.160\nThey're excluded from that entire range\nand they are not going to be handed out.\n\n209\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.859\nNow I'm not going to do that\ncuz I would also you know what\n\n210\n00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:30.860\nto show you that you can\ndo this after the fact.\n\n211\n00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.414\nKeep in mind that what I'm doing here\ndoesn't mean that you have to keep it that\n\n212\n00:11:35.414 --> 00:11:39.350\nway, or doesn't mean that you can't\nchange it later or add later.\n\n213\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.250\nWe'll go ahead and\nwe'll choose Next, another one too.\n\n214\n00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.380\nLet me go ahead and also tell you another\nthing that might happen, all right.\n\n215\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.197\nIf you've got a statistically mapped\nprinter out there a network printer and\n\n216\n00:11:51.197 --> 00:11:54.910\nit's not using DHCP in any fashion,\nwell then guess what?\n\n217\n00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.798\nYou can also set maybe a network printer,\nor maybe you've got a series of statically\n\n218\n00:11:58.798 --> 00:12:02.471\nmapped IP addresses for the different\nnetwork printers within your building,\n\n219\n00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:05.100\nand you don't want those IP\naddresses handed out to other\n\n220\n00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.103\nmachines because it would cause\nsome kind of IP conflict right.\n\n221\n00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:09.930\nWell, I can put that range in there.\n\n222\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:15.950\nNo different, but\nthe purpose is the same with an exclusion.\n\n223\n00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:20.350\nNow we'll go ahead and we'll choose, we're\nnot gonna add that, we'll choose Next.\n\n224\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.060\nAnd the next thing is what's known\nas a lease duration all right.\n\n225\n00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:28.080\nRemember when we talked about obtaining\na dynamic IP address in another episode.\n\n226\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.696\nLet's just really quick recap that,\nall right.\n\n227\n00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:34.950\nRemember when you receive an IP address,\nfrom a DHCP server.\n\n228\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.972\nIt's not yours to use\nindefinitely all right.\n\n229\n00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:38.828\nIt's kinda like a rental car, all right.\n\n230\n00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:42.385\nYou’re gonna use it for\na certain period of time.\n\n231\n00:12:42.385 --> 00:12:45.880\nAt a certain point when that period\nof time, you've got an option.\n\n232\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.880\nTo try to communicate with the DHCP server\nand you can say hey, I'm still here.\n\n233\n00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.404\nI'm still using an IP address.\n\n234\n00:12:51.404 --> 00:12:55.723\nDepending on how the administrator has\nit configure, a lot of times they say\n\n235\n00:12:55.723 --> 00:12:59.990\nokay we'll just renew the lease and\nwe'll make it for this amount of time.\n\n236\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.175\nOr if there is no response, hey I'm here,\n\n237\n00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:08.140\nI'm still using that IP address and\nthere's crickets out there.\n\n238\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.557\nAnd the DHCP server isn't responding for\nwhatever reason, or\n\n239\n00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:14.534\nthe admin decides it doesn't\nwant to renew the lease.\n\n240\n00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:19.830\nWell when that hits the end of that\nlease period, the IP address is flushed.\n\n241\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.560\nIt's no longer useful.\n\n242\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.580\nThat's up to you.\n\n243\n00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.144\nNow I will tell you that if we look for\nthings like wired networks.\n\n244\n00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:28.480\nA lot of times is what you'll do\nis you'll have an eight day lease.\n\n245\n00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.860\nBy default, you have an eight day lease.\n\n246\n00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.830\nYou might see things like mobile devices.\n\n247\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.079\nMaybe you have mobile devices that come\nonto a network by wireless network.\n\n248\n00:13:35.079 --> 00:13:39.054\nIt’s a mobile device, picks up a WiFi.\n\n249\n00:13:39.054 --> 00:13:41.770\nIP address over the WiFi network.\n\n250\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.450\nMobile devices sometimes are only\non your network maybe an hour.\n\n251\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.150\nSo I might shorten that lease\ntime maybe to 24 hours.\n\n252\n00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.060\nIt could be two hours just for mobile\ndevices because what's gonna happen?\n\n253\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.639\nIf it discards the IP address\nbecause the lease is expired and\n\n254\n00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:57.760\nit's still set to use the DHCP,\nit's no big deal.\n\n255\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.195\nThe DHCP server is still online,\nit's just gonna say okay,\n\n256\n00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:03.420\nI need an IP address out there or it'll\ncommunicate with it and it'll renew it.\n\n257\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.463\nSo by default here in Windows,\nit is oops and\n\n258\n00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:09.850\nI changed it from the default,\nit is eight days.\n\n259\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.378\nAnd we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll leave that normal.\n\n260\n00:14:13.378 --> 00:14:17.530\nOr the default, nothing normal you can\nconfigure it any way you want, all right.\n\n261\n00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.055\nI'm also gonna come back to\nthe DHCP options here in a second\n\n262\n00:14:21.055 --> 00:14:24.594\nbecause I wanna show you how we\ncan apply those to the scope.\n\n263\n00:14:24.594 --> 00:14:27.012\nAgain, I'm gonna just talk about it here,\nbut\n\n264\n00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:31.098\nthen I'll also show you a little\nbit of how to configure them too.\n\n265\n00:14:31.098 --> 00:14:32.332\nScope, all right,\n\n266\n00:14:32.332 --> 00:14:36.839\nthe scope is gonna be all those IP\naddresses that are in that address pool.\n\n267\n00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.969\nThat pool is the available\naddresses within that range, so\n\n268\n00:14:39.969 --> 00:14:42.420\nif I have 200 addresses\nthat I can hand out.\n\n269\n00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.440\nIn this case, I have 253 addresses\nthat I can hand out within the scope.\n\n270\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.730\nThat's the pool, that range.\n\n271\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.756\nWell you can also,\nif you think about the names,\n\n272\n00:14:52.756 --> 00:14:54.492\nI always like to break down the acronyms.\n\n273\n00:14:54.492 --> 00:14:57.413\nCuz the acronyms really help\nyou understand what's going on\n\n274\n00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.370\nsometimes behind this protocol.\n\n275\n00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.760\nDynamic, means it can change.\n\n276\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.480\nWe got a lease duration, it could change.\n\n277\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.725\nYou can get another IP address.\n\n278\n00:15:05.725 --> 00:15:09.959\nHost configuration,\nwhen I hand you an IP address,\n\n279\n00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:14.387\nand the DHCP server hands\na DHCP client the IP address,\n\n280\n00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:19.045\nit configures its network\nadaptor with that IP address.\n\n281\n00:15:19.045 --> 00:15:20.190\nIt's a host configuration protocol.\n\n282\n00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.002\nBut that's not the only thing.\n\n283\n00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:25.213\nRemember like we talked about,\nthe difference between static and\n\n284\n00:15:25.213 --> 00:15:26.426\ndynamic IP addressing.\n\n285\n00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:30.104\nOne of the great things about DHCP\nis I can tell you exactly what\n\n286\n00:15:30.104 --> 00:15:35.090\nyour subnet mask is, which is also defined\nby the scope when we just set that up.\n\n287\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.597\nBut I can tell you what\nyour default gateway is.\n\n288\n00:15:36.597 --> 00:15:41.050\nI can tell you, hey, you're gonna\nuse this router right, and more.\n\n289\n00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.170\nYou're gonna use this DNS server.\n\n290\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.236\nWe got an internal DNS server and I want\nyou to use that but you know what, I'll go\n\n291\n00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:50.322\nahead and I'll configure a secondary DNS\nserver for public addresses as well.\n\n292\n00:15:50.322 --> 00:15:55.917\nSo that I can hand out options,\nadditional host configurations not\n\n293\n00:15:55.917 --> 00:16:01.326\njust IP address and subnet mask\nIf I apply the option to the scope.\n\n294\n00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:04.533\nAll right, now we're gonna go ahead and\nsay no cause I do want to show you inside\n\n295\n00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:07.370\nof your DH it becomes so where you\ncould do that, we'll choose Next.\n\n296\n00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.602\nAll right, now when we look at this,\n\n297\n00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:13.390\npay attention to your review summaries,\nall right.\n\n298\n00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:17.510\nBecause in certain a lot of configurations\nthat you do, you can reverse,\n\n299\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.710\nthere are a few that are inside like your\nwindow servers that you really it'd be\n\n300\n00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.220\nproblematic to go back and try to change.\n\n301\n00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.600\nJust use your reviews,\nright, review and make sure\n\n302\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.150\nthat there's not any important information\nthat you have missed, all right?\n\n303\n00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:38.560\nNow I want you to notice notice that we\nhave IPV4 and we go a little down here or\n\n304\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.300\nhere, it's telling me here that\nI got an issue, all right.\n\n305\n00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.200\nNow what I’ve got here is I have\nto actually activate this Scope so\n\n306\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.390\nthat it could start\nhanding out IP addresses.\n\n307\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.075\nI have inactivated it yet, and\nwhy doesn’t it go active right away?\n\n308\n00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:54.705\nI might have some additional\nconfigurations that I need to do to it\n\n309\n00:16:54.705 --> 00:16:57.190\nbefore I start handing out IP addresses.\n\n310\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.110\nLike those options that we\nwere talking about, all right?\n\n311\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.330\nSo, I might want to do that so, let’s go\nahead, and notice that I have under Scope.\n\n312\n00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.420\nNow be careful because you can\nhave multiple scopes, all right?\n\n313\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.010\nYou can have a DHCP server that\nis sending out a certain range or\n\n314\n00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.810\npool of addresses and also handing out\nanother pool of addresses, all right?\n\n315\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.730\nAnd each individual Scope\ncan have Scope Options,\n\n316\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.600\nthat means it adjust applies to the Scope.\n\n317\n00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.725\nSo when I configure options here,\nit only applies to the 192.168.1.0 Scope.\n\n318\n00:17:28.725 --> 00:17:33.546\nI could have one here if I\nhave two networks here, right,\n\n319\n00:17:33.546 --> 00:17:36.490\n192.168.2.0 Scope.\n\n320\n00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:41.600\nAnd if I configure Scope Options here,\nit applies to just that Scope.\n\n321\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.990\nBut there's also\nServer Options all right and\n\n322\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.930\nServer Options say I don't care\nwhat scopes you have, I want you to\n\n323\n00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.410\napply these options to every scope that\nthis server is currently managing.\n\n324\n00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.480\nYou don't have to worry about those\nright now I just want you to know that\n\n325\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.220\nthey're there so if there are any\nquestions, hey what's the difference?\n\n326\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.520\nServer level options apply to all scopes,\nscope level options only affect the scope\n\n327\n00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.020\nthat they are applied to,\nthat's important.\n\n328\n00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.650\nAll right, so\nlet's go ahead and let's look.\n\n329\n00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:10.820\nWhat options do we have?\n\n330\n00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.868\nDo we have options on the table?\n\n331\n00:18:11.868 --> 00:18:14.400\nWell, we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nright click on our Scope Options and\n\n332\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.860\nyou're gonna see that we have\nthe option to Configure Options.\n\n333\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.808\nBoy, that's redundant right?\n\n334\n00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:22.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go ahead and select that.\n\n335\n00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.080\nAnd here are some of the general options\nthat we have, like I said default gateway.\n\n336\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.600\nBy the way, they also have numbers,\nI would pay attention to these numbers.\n\n337\n00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.730\nAnd there are a bunch of them.\n\n338\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.992\nAnd I mean when I scroll through here\nZach you can see there are tonnes of\n\n339\n00:18:34.992 --> 00:18:35.719\nthem, right?\n\n340\n00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:37.902\n&gt;&gt; And you need to memorize all\nof those for the exam, right?\n\n341\n00:18:37.902 --> 00:18:38.402\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:18:38.402 --> 00:18:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely not, because if they did,\n\n343\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.350\nthis exam would take a very long\ntime to get it under belt but.\n\n344\n00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.729\nI'm glad you asked for the list,\n\n345\n00:18:46.729 --> 00:18:49.004\njoking aside there are a couple\nthat I would remember.\n\n346\n00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:54.026\nAnd one is that 003,\nthat is your Router that is\n\n347\n00:18:54.026 --> 00:19:00.612\nessentially the IP address of\nyour default gateway, all right.\n\n348\n00:19:00.612 --> 00:19:06.474\nAnd I could do something\nlike 192.168.1.1 and\n\n349\n00:19:06.474 --> 00:19:10.020\nI could add this, all right?\n\n350\n00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.050\nSo now it says,\n\n351\n00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.580\nwhen you get an IP address,\nlet's say I'm looking over here at Zach.\n\n352\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.670\nLet's say Zach's computer comes online and\nsays I need an IP address, right?\n\n353\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.310\nWell, Zach,\nyou're going to get this IP address.\n\n354\n00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.480\nWe already defined the subnet mask inside\nof the scope when we created it, so\n\n355\n00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.728\nyou're already gonna get this subnet mask.\n\n356\n00:19:23.728 --> 00:19:24.758\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; You're also gonna\n\n357\n00:19:24.758 --> 00:19:27.650\nget the IP of the router\nthat I want you to have.\n\n358\n00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.280\nSo you'll be able to talk and\ncommunicate off your local network so,\n\n359\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.160\nthat's a great thing, right?\n\n360\n00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.647\nNow the next one that we have here that I\nwant you to worry about, if we scroll down\n\n361\n00:19:35.647 --> 00:19:39.107\njust a little bit more, there's a 006,\nthat's our DNS servers, right.\n\n362\n00:19:39.107 --> 00:19:46.000\nYou can see it gives you DNS servers,\nwhat DNS servers do you wanna use.\n\n363\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.466\nNow I could use the name here like for\ninstance I could do dc01.demo.itpro.tv.\n\n364\n00:19:51.466 --> 00:19:56.550\nWell, I could use the name and\nI could say, you know what?\n\n365\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.290\nJust go ahead DNS, do me a favor,\nwe talked about DNS, right?\n\n366\n00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.730\nAnd I could say, just resolve that for\n\n367\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.210\nme, I don't wanna resolve it,\nI can't remember what the IP address is.\n\n368\n00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.440\nRemember I told you there are services\nthat rely on DNS, well, look here.\n\n369\n00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.240\nI put in the name and\nit resolved it to the IP address.\n\n370\n00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.294\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n371\n00:20:15.294 --> 00:20:20.260\nlike I said applications rely on dns for\nname resolution right.\n\n372\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:26.658\nNow there are other one's too you can see\nyou know 0015 I believe is another one,\n\n373\n00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:32.426\nDNS domain name so I can say, okay,\nits demo here's your DNS domain name and\n\n374\n00:20:32.426 --> 00:20:37.870\nit's demo.itpro.tv, all right,\nthat becomes your DNS suffix.\n\n375\n00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.560\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and,\nI think that's all,\n\n376\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.930\nthere's other ones out\nthere that you could do.\n\n377\n00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.420\nBut those are three of\nthe ones that I would know.\n\n378\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.715\nAll right, now let me check\nout the Properties of that,\n\n379\n00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:50.350\nI don't think I added it.\n\n380\n00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.960\nOkay, so let me do this one more time.\n\n381\n00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.794\nI'm glad [LAUGH] I showed you, I resolved\nthe name and I got so happy that the name\n\n382\n00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:00.992\nresolved that I forgot to add it,\nso again you, again press Apply.\n\n383\n00:21:00.992 --> 00:21:07.014\ndcO1.demo.itpro.tv and\nagain all I'm gonna say is hey,\n\n384\n00:21:07.014 --> 00:21:12.104\nDNS and you are not gonna I\nhave no clue what that is but\n\n385\n00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.794\nthat is not gonna resolve.\n\n386\n00:21:14.794 --> 00:21:20.350\nYou got to spell the name right Wes so,\ndemo.itpro.tv, we can say Resolve.\n\n387\n00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.570\nHere's the IP address and\nhere's the important part.\n\n388\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.480\nGotta choose Add, all right, now what\nit's gonna do is, it's validating,\n\n389\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.440\nit says, is our DNS server\neven running on that machine?\n\n390\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.270\nAnd it checks, and it queries it.\n\n391\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.710\nIt says, hey, DNS, are you out there?\n\n392\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.000\nI need to talk to you for a second.\n\n393\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.420\nCuz somebody's about to add you to\nthe DHCP options, so I gotta verify and\n\n394\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.300\nvalidate that you even exist.\n\n395\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.880\nAnd it did so the communication\nlittle handshake happens.\n\n396\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.510\nIt says, yeah ,it's okay, we're good,\nwe're validated, and now we can choose OK.\n\n397\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.160\nAnd that's why it's important, the value\n\n398\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.136\nhere when we got to the DNS server you\ndon't wanna see that when it says None.\n\n399\n00:21:55.136 --> 00:21:58.370\n[LAUGH] It's not gonna help\nname resolution if you\n\n400\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.620\ndon't have a DNS server to look to.\n\n401\n00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.380\nAll right, so now what happens with these\nscope options is this lets me know that\n\n402\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.440\nhey, we are going to have this Router,\nthis DNS Server.\n\n403\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.980\nAnd this is gonna be our Domain Name,\nall right?\n\n404\n00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.046\nNow we have other things, remember they\ntalked about, I mentioned a pool, right.\n\n405\n00:22:16.046 --> 00:22:19.500\nIf I look at the Pool,\nthat's that range, right?\n\n406\n00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:25.120\nAgain, just intermixing terminology,\nsynonymous with each other right?\n\n407\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.630\nIt just remember the range, right?\n\n408\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.450\nSo it says Address range for distribution\nand I can see that right there.\n\n409\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:37.400\nOkay, Address Leases,\nif a computer has a lease I can see that.\n\n410\n00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.460\nLet's go a head and\nlet's activate this scope.\n\n411\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.850\nI got some Scope Options,\nI got a pool set up,\n\n412\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.390\nlet me go ahead, right click,\nand we'll choose Activate.\n\n413\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.249\nNotice that the little down arrow and\nthat red arrow have disappeared and\n\n414\n00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:56.191\nwe've got green lights all the way.\n\n415\n00:22:56.191 --> 00:23:00.190\nLet's me know that this now\nan active DHCP server, all right.\n\n416\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.310\nWe're gonna switch back\nover our Windows client.\n\n417\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.690\nLet's see what that looks like\non the client side, all right?\n\n418\n00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.720\nNow my hand's kinda covering this up,\nbut if I go down to\n\n419\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.840\nthe little monitor icon with the little\nnetwork cable in front of it.\n\n420\n00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.130\nThat'll bring, and right click on it\nchoose Network and Sharing Center.\n\n421\n00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.530\nBrings up the Network and Sharing Center\nand I want to go to the adapter settings.\n\n422\n00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.939\nNow from the adapter settings I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna select the Properties\n\n423\n00:23:23.939 --> 00:23:27.172\nof the Network adapter by selecting\nthe network adapter, right clicking on it.\n\n424\n00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:33.580\nAnd then choose Status, and\nthen choose Details, all right?\n\n425\n00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:37.390\nNow, notice that I don't\nhave a default gateway,\n\n426\n00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.010\nor why don't I have a default gateway?\n\n427\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.850\nAnd I point this out because on the exam\nthey might give you an exhibit this way\n\n428\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:46.310\nand say,\nwhy don't you have a default gateway,\n\n429\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.471\nyou've configured the DHCP server to hand\nout the router that you just seen us do?\n\n430\n00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:53.618\nWell, I want you to pay attention\nto that line, right there.\n\n431\n00:23:53.618 --> 00:23:56.342\nDHCP Enabled, No.\n\n432\n00:23:56.342 --> 00:24:00.334\nThat should be your telltale sign also in\nthe context of another question that you\n\n433\n00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:02.870\nget is whether this is dynamic or\na static address.\n\n434\n00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.760\nIt's static.\n\n435\n00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.530\nI've manually set it because\nwe aren't using DHCP.\n\n436\n00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.510\nAnd those are the only two options,\nessentially, that we have here.\n\n437\n00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.440\nWe'll go ahead and choose close.\n\n438\n00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.560\nWe're gonna go to the Properties\nof the network adapter this time.\n\n439\n00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.830\nAnd here, we're gonna choose\nInternet Protocol Version 4.\n\n440\n00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.810\nAnd then we'll go down here and\nwe will choose Properties, right?\n\n441\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.060\nAnd then from Properties,\nyou can see use the following.\n\n442\n00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.440\nAnytime I say use the following\nthat definitely means\n\n443\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.790\nI have configured this, right?\n\n444\n00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.502\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nwe don't have a default gateway.\n\n445\n00:24:32.502 --> 00:24:35.570\nWes the keyboard, or took a holiday and\n\n446\n00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.530\ndidn't decide to actually put\na default gateway in there.\n\n447\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.095\nBut if I change to Obtain\nan IP address automatically,\n\n448\n00:24:44.095 --> 00:24:47.272\nnow I'm gonna be using DHCP, right?\n\n449\n00:24:47.272 --> 00:24:49.780\nAnd I'm also gonna go ahead and\nsay, you know what,\n\n450\n00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.371\nsince it's host configuration protocol,\nwhy don't you just go ahead and\n\n451\n00:24:53.371 --> 00:24:56.690\nobtain the DHCP server address\nautomatically as well?\n\n452\n00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.790\nAnd we'll go ahead and choose OK.\n\n453\n00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.050\nNow, when I choose OK here,\nit takes a second sometimes.\n\n454\n00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.660\nIf you're in a lab environment,\nlike practice labs has their lab\n\n455\n00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.960\nenvironment if you following along,\nsometimes you'll see it lock up.\n\n456\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.640\nAnd if you get Jimminy Click-its click\nhappy, you'll see not responding.\n\n457\n00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.590\nJust give it a second.\n\n458\n00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.692\nBecause like we've talked about in our\nearlier episodes as part of the DHCP IP\n\n459\n00:25:16.692 --> 00:25:23.015\naddress process, lease process,\nit's gonna go through the door process,\n\n460\n00:25:23.015 --> 00:25:26.795\nthat discover, offer, request,\nacknowledge the moment I hit OK.\n\n461\n00:25:26.795 --> 00:25:29.180\nOr OK and then Close, excuse me.\n\n462\n00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.100\nThere's two levels here.\n\n463\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.350\nClose.\n\n464\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.182\nAll right, and you might notice just for\na second that I got that little\n\n465\n00:25:34.182 --> 00:25:37.250\nspinning wheel there, and\nit said, Identifying, right?\n\n466\n00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.830\nSo it was going through that process,\n\n467\n00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:45.150\nsaying hey, anybody out there got an IP\naddress that I can have, all right?\n\n468\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.160\nNow, notice that it says,\nand this is unauthenticated,\n\n469\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.520\nmy computer, we'll worry about\nthe domain part of it here in a second.\n\n470\n00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.620\nI'm not exactly sure why\nit's unauthenticated,\n\n471\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.860\nbut we'll switch back\nover here real quick.\n\n472\n00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.890\nAnd notice that, Zach,\nI still don't see a leaks.\n\n473\n00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.580\nWell maybe it didn't work?\n\n474\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.570\nNo, unfortunately, the DHCP console\nlike the DNS console sometimes, well,\n\n475\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.010\njust about all the time,\nit needs refreshed.\n\n476\n00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.170\nIt's not dynamic.\n\n477\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:16.110\nAs much as the DHCP service is dynamic,\nunfortunately this console does not.\n\n478\n00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.650\nSo we'll go ahead and right-click on it,\nwe'll choose Refresh.\n\n479\n00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.540\nLook at that.\n\n480\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.910\nWe've got a lease available.\n\n481\n00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:22.440\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n482\n00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.700\nAnd that's what I want to see.\n\n483\n00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.940\nIf I right-click on this, actually I'm not\ngoing to, there's nothing really that we\n\n484\n00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.965\nhave to do here other than see that\nI've got an expiration time, right?\n\n485\n00:26:31.965 --> 00:26:36.475\nIt lets me know that if this computer,\nand actually, when I say if this computer\n\n486\n00:26:36.475 --> 00:26:40.695\ndoesn't call in by the expiration time\nit's gonna release this IP address?\n\n487\n00:26:40.695 --> 00:26:42.025\nLet's clarify that a little bit more.\n\n488\n00:26:42.025 --> 00:26:46.775\nActually, 50% of the lease goes\nby halfway through that eight day\n\n489\n00:26:46.775 --> 00:26:49.925\ncycle that you've seen us configure this,\nour computer is gonna say hey,\n\n490\n00:26:49.925 --> 00:26:55.150\nI'm still out here, DHCP server, I'm still\nout here, I'm still using this IP address.\n\n491\n00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:59.020\nAnd if the admin hasn't configured\nanything different, what's gonna happen is\n\n492\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.900\nthe DHCP server is gonna say, okay,\nno problem, just renew the lease.\n\n493\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.420\nIt's like calling in\nthe rental car company and\n\n494\n00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.000\nsay I was only supposed\nto be in town a week,\n\n495\n00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.360\nbut unfortunately we're\ngonna be here another week.\n\n496\n00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.280\nCan I extend the lease that\nI have on the rental car?\n\n497\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.320\nAnd if they don't need to use the car,\nthey say sure.\n\n498\n00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.510\nI mean, you'll pay the money.\n\n499\n00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.740\nBut we'll go ahead and extend the time\nthat you have the car, right?\n\n500\n00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.990\nNo different.\n\n501\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.610\nNow, if we want to see that lease,\n\n502\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.120\nwe can actually jump over to\nour Windows 10 machine here.\n\n503\n00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.680\nAnd if we look in a Windows 10 machine,\nif I right-click on my Windows icon and\n\n504\n00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.460\nI choose PowerShell, let me give us\na little more real estate here and\n\n505\n00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.670\nclear the screen out.\n\n506\n00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.400\nI can do an IP config\nspace forward slash all.\n\n507\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.070\nAnd let’s see if we’ve got some of\nthat information that we’ve configured\n\n508\n00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.740\non the DHCP side, right?\n\n509\n00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.180\nI know that I can see the IP\naddress that was handed.\n\n510\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.173\nNotice it's the first one in the pool,\nright after the router there, all right?\n\n511\n00:27:48.173 --> 00:27:52.095\nNotice that it tells me when\nthe lease it was obtained, right?\n\n512\n00:27:52.095 --> 00:27:53.684\nAnd I have that information right here.\n\n513\n00:27:53.684 --> 00:27:55.901\nWe've seen when it expires, right?\n\n514\n00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:59.932\nThat's the information that correlates\nwith what we've just seen over there in\n\n515\n00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:03.207\nthe properties of the lease on\nthe DHCP side server side, right?\n\n516\n00:28:03.207 --> 00:28:05.090\nRemember what we configured\nour default gateway?\n\n517\n00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.090\n1.1, well, there it is.\n\n518\n00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.450\nRemember our DHCP server is\nwho we're talking to now.\n\n519\n00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:12.030\nNotice our DNS server?\n\n520\n00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.870\nWe said I want you to use this DNS server.\n\n521\n00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.170\nAnd we put in the IP address,\nwe resolved it, verified,\n\n522\n00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.580\nit communicated,\nvalidated that we were talking.\n\n523\n00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.130\nWell, guess what?\n\n524\n00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:22.150\nIt's right there.\n\n525\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:26.475\nRemember when we said domain name,\nyou're gonna use this domain name?\n\n526\n00:28:26.475 --> 00:28:31.150\nI want you to look at the connection\nspecific DNS service, or suffix.\n\n527\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.265\nI want you to look at the DNS search list.\n\n528\n00:28:33.265 --> 00:28:34.545\nLook, there's our domain name.\n\n529\n00:28:34.545 --> 00:28:38.840\nWe've applied it to this machine in\nthe IP properties of the network adapter.\n\n530\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.230\nThe operating system already knows\nthat it's a domain computer.\n\n531\n00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:45.450\nWe've seen that earlier when we talked\nabout fully qualified domain names.\n\n532\n00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.480\nBut now, according to the IP\nproperties of the network adapter,\n\n533\n00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.120\nit's going to apply that\ndomain name to itself, right?\n\n534\n00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.900\nSo, we can see that right here.\n\n535\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.440\nNow, the other thing that we want\nto talk about real quick is,\n\n536\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.380\nI'm going to go ahead and I'm going to\nswitch back over to our server here.\n\n537\n00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:07.745\nRemember that I told you that we can also,\nthat we can set up exclusions, right?\n\n538\n00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.840\nAn exclusions is noting more,\n\n539\n00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.640\nif you will, than saying exclude\nthis from that pool, right?\n\n540\n00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:17.330\nSo if I say, if I right-click, right?\n\n541\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.750\nOn the address pool.\n\n542\n00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:23.010\nRemember I told you, you can always\ncome back to this and do that, right?\n\n543\n00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.400\nI can set that range here after the fact,\nright?\n\n544\n00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.820\nThat's no different, all right?\n\n545\n00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.170\nI can set that exclusion range.\n\n546\n00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.640\nBut what if I want to\nmanage the IP address\n\n547\n00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.310\nof a device dynamically, but at the same\ntime I wanna make sure that it has\n\n548\n00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.835\nthe same IP address every time\nit calls out to the network?\n\n549\n00:29:40.835 --> 00:29:46.641\nWell, that's where something known as\na reservation comes in hand, all right?\n\n550\n00:29:46.641 --> 00:29:50.606\nLet's say, just hypothetically, all right?\n\n551\n00:29:50.606 --> 00:29:52.957\nI've got a web server.\n\n552\n00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:55.505\nI don't want its IP address to change.\n\n553\n00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:56.290\nDon't want it to change.\n\n554\n00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.720\nNow, I could statically set it up,\nand that would be good, too.\n\n555\n00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.250\nBut I can also control,\nalmost like a static nature, and\n\n556\n00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.660\nthe fact that I could come in here, right?\n\n557\n00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.700\nAnd if I do this,\nI'll tell you what, we'll set up,\n\n558\n00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.280\nI'm gonna work a little crazy here, right?\n\n559\n00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.180\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; In fact, let me go ahead, and\n\n560\n00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.810\nlet me configure the properties of\nthe network adapter one more time.\n\n561\n00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.822\nAnd what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna set this back.\n\n562\n00:30:18.822 --> 00:30:21.060\nI'm gonna set this back\nto a static IP Address.\n\n563\n00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.960\nWe're gonna take DHCP\nout of the list here.\n\n564\n00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.590\nSo I'm going to show you something cool.\n\n565\n00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.786\nWe'll do 192.168, and I'll tell you what,\n\n566\n00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:33.135\nI'll put that right back to where it was,\n.1.10.\n\n567\n00:30:33.135 --> 00:30:40.230\nWe use the same subnet mask, and\nI will manually set the DNS server.\n\n568\n00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.006\nAll right, so went back.\n\n569\n00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:47.338\nAll right, if I choose right-click and\nchoose Status &gt; Details, you should see,\n\n570\n00:30:47.338 --> 00:30:52.154\nladies and gentlemen, that we are right\nback where we started off, right?\n\n571\n00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:53.630\nNo DHCP.\n\n572\n00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.520\nNow, I want that computer,\nlet's say that computer is my web server.\n\n573\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.070\nI always want it to have\nthe same IP address.\n\n574\n00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:04.230\nBut I wanna go ahead and just kinda\nmanage the other options to DHCP.\n\n575\n00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.350\nThis is where the exclusion\ncomes in handy, all right?\n\n576\n00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:12.050\nSo what I can do is I can right-click and\nI can choose New Reservation.\n\n577\n00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:16.290\nNow, I want you to understand that in\nyour objectives it says MAC Reservation.\n\n578\n00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.960\nSometimes you just see Reservation.\n\n579\n00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.757\nAnd that's,\n\n580\n00:31:19.757 --> 00:31:24.630\nthe reason being is because DHCP calls\nout with a broadcast communication.\n\n581\n00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.910\nSo there is a MAC address\nthat is also associated.\n\n582\n00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.980\nWe can say when you get that\nbroadcast communication, and\n\n583\n00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.592\nit's a computer with this MAC address,\n\n584\n00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:39.990\nyou will apply this IP address to it\nevery time it asks for an IP address.\n\n585\n00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.750\nSo that's what I need.\n\n586\n00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.790\nIt's one of the criteria what I need for\na MAC reservation, if you will.\n\n587\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.600\nI have to come over here.\n\n588\n00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.590\nAnd I've gotta get that MAC address.\n\n589\n00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.841\nThere's a easy to do this.\n\n590\n00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:53.842\nI could just copy it right there, or\nI could open up, let's say, PowerShell.\n\n591\n00:31:53.842 --> 00:31:59.050\nAnd I could do a getmac.\n\n592\n00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.137\nNow, if you've got more than one MAC\naddress, like I happen to have here,\n\n593\n00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:04.300\nit might a little confusing\nas to which one is which.\n\n594\n00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.490\nThank goodness for\nme the other one is disconnected, so\n\n595\n00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.484\nI know, chances are,\nprocess of elimination.\n\n596\n00:32:10.484 --> 00:32:11.595\nHere's my detective skills, right?\n\n597\n00:32:11.595 --> 00:32:13.200\nIt's why I don't make a good detective.\n\n598\n00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.450\nIt's disconnected, so chances are that\none is not gonna work, right?\n\n599\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.950\nAnd now that I've got that copied,\nI'll call this, maybe I'll call this\n\n600\n00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.990\nweb server for whatever reason,\njust so I can identify it, right?\n\n601\n00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:33.330\nAnd I want it to have, let's say,\nI don't know 250, all right?\n\n602\n00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.070\nAnd I'll put in its MAC address, right?\n\n603\n00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.010\nAnd what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna choose Add.\n\n604\n00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.860\nAnd then choose Close.\n\n605\n00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:45.020\nNow, if it calls out with a broadcast\ntrying to look at that MAC address,\n\n606\n00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.380\nit will fail if it doesn't find it,\nall right?\n\n607\n00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.170\nIn this case, it did find it, all right?\n\n608\n00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.770\nAnd I go in, and if I expand out,\nI now have a reservation, all right?\n\n609\n00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.600\nAnd I can look at the properties\nof the reservation.\n\n610\n00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.460\nAnd I can also go a little bit further,\nright?\n\n611\n00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.824\nIf I want, cuz we have those TTLs\nthat we've talked about in the DNS,\n\n612\n00:33:03.824 --> 00:33:04.528\nTime To Live.\n\n613\n00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:08.900\nAnd it's gonna basically throw\nout a record after awhile.\n\n614\n00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.950\nWell, I can actually do a dynamic record,\na dynamic update.\n\n615\n00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:12.750\nAnd this is really cool.\n\n616\n00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.265\nWhen DHCP says you get this IP address,\nI'll go ahead and\n\n617\n00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:19.644\ncommunicate with DNS for\nyou, update the DNS record.\n\n618\n00:33:19.644 --> 00:33:22.960\nSo again, we don't have to worry about\nthose stale records according to the TTLs\n\n619\n00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.060\ngetting in the way.\n\n620\n00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.910\nIt'll update it automatically and\nsay you just got a new IP address,\n\n621\n00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.820\nlet me go ahead and\nupdate the DNS database so\n\n622\n00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.390\nwe're both in agreement that we\nhave the current information.\n\n623\n00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.660\nThat's a great thing to have, too.\n\n624\n00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.000\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and just\ngonna leave all of that at the default.\n\n625\n00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.350\nI'll choose OK.\n\n626\n00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.220\nAnd now, what we're gonna do, all right?\n\n627\n00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.520\nI'm gonna come back here, and\nI want you to see something here.\n\n628\n00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.630\nNotice that we still have\nan IP address for Client02,\n\n629\n00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.120\nthe one that just called\nout to the network.\n\n630\n00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.110\nSo what happened?\n\n631\n00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.330\nWhy has it still got this IP address?\n\n632\n00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.840\nIt's a lease.\n\n633\n00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:59.130\nAccording to the DHCP server,\nit's not going to talk to this computer.\n\n634\n00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.180\nSo according to the DHCP server,\nit's still using that IP address.\n\n635\n00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.200\nAnd notice the reservation is inactive?\n\n636\n00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.101\nWell, I know as the administrator\nthat I just cleared that IP address.\n\n637\n00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:15.490\nSo I can also right-click and I could\nchoose Delete to the Obtained IP address.\n\n638\n00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:16.453\nAnd it's gone.\n\n639\n00:34:16.453 --> 00:34:19.690\nAnd now what we have to do is we'll\nswitch back over to our other computer.\n\n640\n00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.180\nWe'll bring back up the properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n641\n00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.260\nLet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n642\n00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.840\nChoose Properties here.\n\n643\n00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.000\nAnd we'll go to\nInternet Protocol Version 4 Properties.\n\n644\n00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.300\nAnd yes,\nwe are going to switch that back over to\n\n645\n00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.103\nObtain an IP address Automatically,\nand a DNS server automatically.\n\n646\n00:34:35.103 --> 00:34:36.713\nWe'll choose OK.\n\n647\n00:34:36.713 --> 00:34:38.670\nWe'll choose Close.\n\n648\n00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.260\nShould see a little spinning\ncheerio here jut for a second.\n\n649\n00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.220\nDid you catch that?\n\n650\n00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.244\nThat's the door process.\n\n651\n00:34:44.244 --> 00:34:44.970\nGotta look quick.\n\n652\n00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:47.892\nSometimes it takes a bit,\nother times it's really fast.\n\n653\n00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:52.580\nAll right, and if I do an IP\nconfig space forward slash all.\n\n654\n00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.640\nAll right, and you know what?\n\n655\n00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.150\nIt's got an IPV address.\n\n656\n00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.109\nLet's find out why that is.\n\n657\n00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:04.050\nSometimes when you get, and\napparently it's active.\n\n658\n00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.810\nNotice this here.\n\n659\n00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.770\n192.168.1.250.\n\n660\n00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.190\nAll right, so l have a active reservation\nthat this computer is now utilizing.\n\n661\n00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.455\nLet me see, l might have just\njumped the gun on that too fast.\n\n662\n00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:18.850\nLet me try that one more time.\n\n663\n00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.670\nAnd it did finally, it did.\n\n664\n00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.605\nI was a little bit\nfaster than the refresh.\n\n665\n00:35:22.605 --> 00:35:26.439\n[LAUGH] And that doesn't easily happen,\nusually I'm two steps behind.\n\n666\n00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:28.251\nBut now you notice here, right?\n\n667\n00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:34.550\n192.168.1.250, there is the reservation,\nall right?\n\n668\n00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.030\nAnd that means every time this computer,\nif it looks and\n\n669\n00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.360\nit's got a lease that's expired, and\nit calls back out to the network and\n\n670\n00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.180\nsays DCHP I need an IP address,\nit's gonna get that same one every time.\n\n671\n00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.310\nThat's what's known as a MAC reservation,\nor a reservation, if you will.\n\n672\n00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.170\nNow, I mentioned a couple of concepts,\n\n673\n00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:55.350\nlast thing I know I'm\nrunning way late on this one.\n\n674\n00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.971\nZach's letting me know we\ngotta wrap this one up.\n\n675\n00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:57.734\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n676\n00:35:57.734 --> 00:36:01.370\nthere are just a couple more things\nthat I wanna put into this episode,\n\n677\n00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.760\nespecially because two\nof them relate to DHCP.\n\n678\n00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.440\nOne of them also relates to DNS.\n\n679\n00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.325\nAnd that is something known as\na DHCP relay agent or an IP helper.\n\n680\n00:36:11.325 --> 00:36:13.132\nNow, IP helper is essentially,\n\n681\n00:36:13.132 --> 00:36:16.748\nyou gotta understand that broadcast\ncommunications, routers do\n\n682\n00:36:16.748 --> 00:36:20.958\nnot allow broadcast communications\nto traverse their interfaces, right?\n\n683\n00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:26.260\nSo if a router receives a broadcast\ncommunication on one network adapter,\n\n684\n00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:30.479\nit's not gonna pass that over\nto the next network, right?\n\n685\n00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:32.538\nIt filters that and throws it away.\n\n686\n00:36:32.538 --> 00:36:36.168\nBut sometimes you'll have a DHCP\nserver that's on one network, and\n\n687\n00:36:36.168 --> 00:36:40.050\nyou'll have a client that's on\na completely different subnet.\n\n688\n00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.515\nAnd you want it to be able to communicate\nwith the DHCP server by broadcasting,\n\n689\n00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:46.590\nright, the door process discovery.\n\n690\n00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.290\nBut how do I do that?\n\n691\n00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.950\nIf the discovery packet's a broadcast,\nhow do I get that across the router's\n\n692\n00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.450\ninterface when it's being picky and\nit's discarding broadcast?\n\n693\n00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.500\nWell, that's where the DHCP\nrelay agent comes in.\n\n694\n00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:04.500\nThe router will see this\nUDP Broadcast DHCP request, and it'll\n\n695\n00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:10.250\nwrap it a unicast transmission, it'll\nconvert it into a unicast transmission.\n\n696\n00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:15.050\nAnd it'll send it directly to the other\nnetwork, directly to the DHCP server.\n\n697\n00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:17.550\nThat will pass the router's interface.\n\n698\n00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:22.142\nBecause then after that process, it's a\nunicast address, and now the communication\n\n699\n00:37:22.142 --> 00:37:28.245\nwith a DHCP relay agent, it can relay\nthat information in between, all right?\n\n700\n00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:31.700\nNow, doesn't necessary mean\nthat it has to be a router.\n\n701\n00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:38.030\nYou can have, where the client is, you can\nconfigure it to use the DHCP relay agent.\n\n702\n00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:42.990\nThe DHCP relay agent can wrap in\na unicast, send it directly to the router,\n\n703\n00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.620\nand the router passes unicast anyways.\n\n704\n00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.460\nSo to the router it would be\ntransparent at that point.\n\n705\n00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:54.680\nIP helper, that just means when you\nhave some kind of UDP broadcast service\n\n706\n00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.750\nrequest like that, the router's gonna drop\nit cuz it's a broadcast communication.\n\n707\n00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.510\nSo what does an IP helper do?\n\n708\n00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.510\nIt just takes that broadcast\ncommunication, wraps it into a unicast,\n\n709\n00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.690\nand directs it over to\nwhere the service is.\n\n710\n00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.750\nAnd they're kinda using these\ntogether because that's exact\n\n711\n00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.340\nwhat a DHCP relay agent does.\n\n712\n00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.790\nIt takes that broadcast communication,\nwraps it into a unicast, and\n\n713\n00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.770\nsends it directly to the DHCP server so\nthat it can finish the door process.\n\n714\n00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:27.370\nNow, I showed you one example of where DNS\nand DHCP can kind of communicate together,\n\n715\n00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.800\nand they could make each other aware,\nright, through dynamic registration.\n\n716\n00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.570\nThat's okay.\n\n717\n00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.940\nWhat if you have 5, 000 computers\nacross all these different subnets?\n\n718\n00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.930\nDifferent DNS servers.\n\n719\n00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:42.300\nAnd you want to be able to allow\nthe coordination between DHCP and DNS?\n\n720\n00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.730\nWell, that's where the Internet Protocol\nAddress Management technology comes in.\n\n721\n00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:47.640\nIPAM as they call it.\n\n722\n00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.355\nIt allows you to coordinate on a large\nscale, too, up to a large scale.\n\n723\n00:38:52.355 --> 00:38:58.310\nThe communication between DHCP and\nDNS so that we agree.\n\n724\n00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:00.320\nLast but\nnot least is network time protocol.\n\n725\n00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.290\nI'm not going to go into that one\ntoo much because, Zach, you and\n\n726\n00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.150\nI talked about that in\nthe protocol episodes.\n\n727\n00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.780\nRemember, synchronization is important.\n\n728\n00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.500\nTime is important.\n\n729\n00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.035\nEspecially on a Windows domain.\n\n730\n00:39:09.035 --> 00:39:12.990\nSo, NTP is a service that, hey,\nI need time synchronization.\n\n731\n00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.080\nWhat do I do?\n\n732\n00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.570\nI send a request to update my time clock.\n\n733\n00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.370\nIn a Windows domain,\n\n734\n00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.360\nit just happens to be the master time\nclock's whats known as the PDC emulator.\n\n735\n00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.420\nOne of the domain controllers,\ndepending on how you've got it set up.\n\n736\n00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.840\nI need to synchronize my time clock.\n\n737\n00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.980\nWell, I'm gonna use NTP to do that.\n\n738\n00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:35.325\nSo these are some very, very important\nnetwork services and how they function.\n\n739\n00:39:35.325 --> 00:39:40.345\nKnow DNS, know DHCP, be aware of it for\nthe exam because they're gonna put\n\n740\n00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:44.715\nyou potentially into multiple scenarios,\nand you might know A plus B equals C.\n\n741\n00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:48.889\nBut what if I take out B?\n\n742\n00:39:48.889 --> 00:39:50.123\nDo you know how we got C?\n\n743\n00:39:50.123 --> 00:39:52.025\nSo you're gonna have to\nknow all the pieces so\n\n744\n00:39:52.025 --> 00:39:55.356\nthat you can know what the answer is the\nnext time they ask you on the Net + exam.\n\n745\n00:39:55.356 --> 00:39:56.674\n&gt;&gt; And fortunately, Wes,\n\n746\n00:39:56.674 --> 00:40:00.831\nyou do provide us all the pieces This is\nNetwork Service Functions part three.\n\n747\n00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:02.712\nMake sure you see parts one and two.\n\n748\n00:40:02.712 --> 00:40:05.861\nAnd make sure you see everything\nin the COMPTIA Net + series.\n\n749\n00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:09.401\nWhile you're at it, check out the other\nvideos in the course library,\n\n750\n00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:10.352\nhundreds of them.\n\n751\n00:40:10.352 --> 00:40:12.107\nAll designed to take your further.\n\n752\n00:40:12.107 --> 00:40:15.410\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPRO.TV, they'll be very glad you did.\n\n753\n00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.165\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n754\n00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:17.886\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n755\n00:40:17.886 --> 00:40:20.211\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.890\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n4\n00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.310\nI'm Zach Memos, your host for\nthis episode of Net Plus.\n\n5\n00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.530\nAnd we're gonna be looking at the TCP/IP\nmodel with the one and only, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.110\nWes, glad to have you here, thanks.\n\n7\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.613\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, Zach,\nthanks for having me here.\n\n8\n00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:31.565\nThat's right, we were going through the\nobjectives and we like to be thorough, and\n\n9\n00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.681\nI just happened to look\ninto the objectives,\n\n10\n00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.865\nand see in the OSI model, right?\n\n11\n00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:37.285\nAnd we've talked about in other episode,\n\n12\n00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.865\nwe've talked about the Open\nSystems Interconnection model that\n\n13\n00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:41.605\nreally goes back to.\n\n14\n00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:44.725\nThey say the 80's is when they\nstarted standardizing this, but\n\n15\n00:00:44.725 --> 00:00:48.825\nI believe the model actually goes back\na little further like 1977 or so, right?\n\n16\n00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:53.084\nSo, we've talked about that model,\nand we had mentioned,\n\n17\n00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:56.508\nwell I should say I've mentioned,\nin passing,\n\n18\n00:00:56.508 --> 00:01:00.704\nI've mentioned TCP/IP through\nthe whole entire course.\n\n19\n00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:03.754\nBut we haven't really defined\nwhat TCP/IP is, right?\n\n20\n00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:04.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.190\n&gt;&gt; So, even though it's not actually\n\n22\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.996\ncalled out by the exam objectives,\nyou better believe you're gonna see stuff\n\n23\n00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.760\nabout TCP/IP on the exam, and it is one\nof those things that kind of implied.\n\n24\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.610\nSo, in this episode what we'd like to do,\n\n25\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.235\nsince we've already\nrecorded out OSI model,\n\n26\n00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:22.715\nif you're not familiar with that, by all\nmeans, go back and check it out, right?\n\n27\n00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.255\nWatch the OSI model there for\nmore in depth on the OSI itself.\n\n28\n00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:31.985\nIn this episode, we're gonna talk about\nthe Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n29\n00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.510\nInternet Protocol suite, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.030\nThe protocol stack or\n\n31\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.590\nthe abstract model that really is\nthe most common model that's used today.\n\n32\n00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.590\nAnd then at the end what we'd like to do,\nin this episode,\n\n33\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.940\nwe'd like to kind of come back and\ntie it all together, right?\n\n34\n00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.300\nLook at the OSI model,\nand then look at TCP/IP,\n\n35\n00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.500\nkinda put them side-by-side, and,\nlet's see what they're doing, right?\n\n36\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.830\nDo they agree on certain things?\n\n37\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.490\nDo they disagree on other things?\n\n38\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.410\nSo that you can have a little bit\nmore thorough understanding of\n\n39\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.660\nwhy do we say layer one?\n\n40\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.200\nAnd that means the physical layer and\nthen other terminology, layer one actually\n\n41\n00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.290\ndefines the characteristics of let's say\nMac addressing and the physical media.\n\n42\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.070\nWell, wait a second, what's going on here?\n\n43\n00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.380\nSo, that's one of the things that we're\ngonna do right here in this episode.\n\n44\n00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.510\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n\n45\n00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go ahead,\nTCP/IP basics, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.271\nTransmission Control Protocol,\nInternet Protocol suite,\n\n47\n00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:29.889\neven though they are two\nprotocols in the name, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:35.561\nIt's actually a family of technology,\nan entire suite of technologies here,\n\n49\n00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:41.249\nthat also are formed kinda like OSI,\nin an abstract layered model, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:46.048\nAnd in fact, let's go ahead and look at,\nI've got a little diagram here, and\n\n51\n00:02:46.048 --> 00:02:48.973\nthese are the layers\nwithin the TCP/IP model.\n\n52\n00:02:48.973 --> 00:02:54.200\nNow, this goes way back to the 60s when\nthe United States Department of Defense,\n\n53\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.906\nand more specifically DARPA,\nDefense Advance Research Project Agency,\n\n54\n00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:04.528\nwas developing communication protocols for\nwhat was back then called ARPANET, right?\n\n55\n00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:07.540\nWe've kinda mentioned that,\nthat was the predecessor to our Internet.\n\n56\n00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.540\nAnd then at a certain point\nARPANET kinda split if you will,\n\n57\n00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.180\nwhile the military went to MILNET and\nthat's their lockdown military network.\n\n58\n00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.190\nAnd ARPANET was released into the public\ndomain, would later become the Internet.\n\n59\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.130\nWell, this protocol stack, this actually\ngoes back to those earliest days when\n\n60\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.513\nthey were trying to route\ntraffic across the ARPANET.\n\n61\n00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:31.754\nAnd the one big thing that\nthey wanted to do is,\n\n62\n00:03:31.754 --> 00:03:35.913\nthey wanted to be able to route\ntraffic across ARPANET, and\n\n63\n00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:40.424\nthe individual local area\nnetworks connection technologies.\n\n64\n00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:43.560\nTCB/IP would be independent of that,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.050\nSo it's been around for a very long time.\n\n66\n00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.740\nIt is the most common network\ncommunication implementation\n\n67\n00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.760\nused by the internet today, right?\n\n68\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.710\nWhen we say internet, right?\n\n69\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.180\nI want you to think of IP,\nInternet Protocol.\n\n70\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.178\nThat's the most common addressing\nprotocol out there today.\n\n71\n00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.270\nNow, by all means,\nit's not the only one, right?\n\n72\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.060\nWe've had others as well.\n\n73\n00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.877\nWe've had things like Novell,\n\n74\n00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:10.020\nhad the IPX/SPX the Inter Packet\nExchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange.\n\n75\n00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.560\nAnd it's not as common,\nit kinda went by the wayside.\n\n76\n00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.320\nProprietary, and for\nwhatever reason it never took off.\n\n77\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.416\nApple was another player,\na big competitor in technologies,\n\n78\n00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:24.828\nthey had Appletalk, right?\n\n79\n00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.205\nAppletalk was another protocol out there.\n\n80\n00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:30.265\nBut again ultimately what it came\ndown to is the most commonly\n\n81\n00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:33.465\nvendor distributed protocol\nsuite would be TCP/IP.\n\n82\n00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:36.275\nAnd it would become\nlater on what we use and\n\n83\n00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:39.755\nwhat we use today for\ninternet communications.\n\n84\n00:04:39.755 --> 00:04:40.865\nNow it has other names.\n\n85\n00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:44.555\nYou might hear it referred to\nas not as common as TCP/IP,\n\n86\n00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:48.590\nthat is by far what everybody\nrecognizes once in that working, right?\n\n87\n00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.710\nBut it has other names, too.\n\n88\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.230\nLike for instance,\nit was called the DARPA model,\n\n89\n00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.370\nhence because DARPA was the one\nthat invented it, right?\n\n90\n00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.619\nImagine that, or sometimes you might even\nhear it called the DoD model, right?\n\n91\n00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:00.841\nThe Department of Defense model, too.\n\n92\n00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:06.509\nAll right, so we do have to be aware\nof Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n93\n00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.200\nInternet Protocol suite.\n\n94\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.180\nAgain, the two protocols that perform\na lot of the major functions are TCP/IP,\n\n95\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.390\nhence why it's in the name,\nbut it's not the only one.\n\n96\n00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.970\nSo, let's go ahead and\nlet's look at our slide here, and\n\n97\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.190\nlet's talk about some of\nthe services that we can see.\n\n98\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.035\nAnd then what we'll also do is go a little\nbit in to some of the protocols that you\n\n99\n00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.215\ncan see in each of these layers,\nall right?\n\n100\n00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:30.765\nWhen we look at the application layer,\nall right?\n\n101\n00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:35.370\nThe application layer, it provides things\nlike network resource access, right?\n\n102\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.240\nIf we've got an application\nthat we need to exchange data,\n\n103\n00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.810\nsome kinda application data exchange,\nwell, guess what?\n\n104\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.330\nThe application layer is the one\nthat gives network services to those\n\n105\n00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.170\napplications, right?\n\n106\n00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.602\nIt provides those resources.\n\n107\n00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:51.658\nProvides things like name resolution,\nright?\n\n108\n00:05:51.658 --> 00:05:52.911\nWhen we need to take those names and\n\n109\n00:05:52.911 --> 00:05:55.260\nresolve them to the lower level\nIP addresses, well guess what?\n\n110\n00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.272\nThe application layer is the one\nthat provides that functionality and\n\n111\n00:05:59.272 --> 00:06:00.498\nthat service for us.\n\n112\n00:06:00.498 --> 00:06:02.585\nIt also does things like data encoding,\nall right?\n\n113\n00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:03.770\nYou say encoding, decoding, all right?\n\n114\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.550\nThink about just formatting or syntaxed.\n\n115\n00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.510\nNow, it also has the syntax functionality\ninside of the application layer as well.\n\n116\n00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.682\nIt provides things like, for instance,\nencryption and compression, all right?\n\n117\n00:06:16.682 --> 00:06:19.178\nThat all happens right here\nat the application layer 1,\n\n118\n00:06:19.178 --> 00:06:21.367\nas well as things like network management,\ntoo.\n\n119\n00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.598\nAnd we'll come back and\nwe'll look at some of the protocols, too.\n\n120\n00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:27.814\nSo this'll make it hopefully a little bit\nmore added sense to some of the services\n\n121\n00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:29.000\nthat it'll provide.\n\n122\n00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.813\nAnd if those of you who have\nalready been studying OSI model,\n\n123\n00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:34.580\nwhen I start saying things\nlike name recognition.\n\n124\n00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.866\nYou probably got in the back of your\nhead maybe one of the protocols that I'm\n\n125\n00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:38.606\ntalking about.\n\n126\n00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.768\nBut I'll leave a cliffhanger here,\nwe'll come back to that in a bit, right?\n\n127\n00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:44.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It'll be a little test before the test,\n\n128\n00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:45.048\nall right?\n\n129\n00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:46.441\nIf we move down the layers, right?\n\n130\n00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:49.001\nIf you've ever heard, just like we\nmentioned in the OSI model we say, hey,\n\n131\n00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:50.861\nmoving down the protocol stack or\nmoving up the stack.\n\n132\n00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:53.390\nWe're looking at the four layers here,\nthat's the stack, right?\n\n133\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.993\nAnd if you're moving down the stack,\n\n134\n00:06:54.993 --> 00:06:57.659\nnow we're going from the application\nof the transport layer.\n\n135\n00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:58.818\nWell the transport layer, what does it do?\n\n136\n00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.585\nIt provides things like connection\noriented services if you will,\n\n137\n00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:05.502\nprovides things like\nsequencing In segmentation.\n\n138\n00:07:05.502 --> 00:07:09.689\nWhich I'm gonna come back to cuz\nit's kinda specific here with\n\n139\n00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.069\nTCP/IP versus like the OSI model.\n\n140\n00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.685\nBecause there are some differences,\nand we definitely wanna look at that.\n\n141\n00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:23.651\nOne other things to keep in mind is\nthat TCP/IP is highly optimized for\n\n142\n00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:29.334\nnetwork, or\ninternet communications, right?\n\n143\n00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:33.565\nThe OSI model, it's rigid, right?\n\n144\n00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:35.382\nThings aren't always as clearly defined.\n\n145\n00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:38.777\nThe OSI model has what I\ncall grey protocols, right?.\n\n146\n00:07:38.777 --> 00:07:41.012\nAnd what do we mean by grey protocols?\n\n147\n00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:42.650\nWell, you've heard it's either black or\nwhite, right?\n\n148\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.428\nSo you're either colored black or\nthe color is white, and\n\n149\n00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:47.820\nsome people will say but\nthere's shades of grey.\n\n150\n00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.869\nIt didn't fall into this category, well,\nit kinda fell into that category, right?\n\n151\n00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:54.759\nThat's why I call them grey protocols.\n\n152\n00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.520\nLike for instance, let's take a network\ninterface, network adapter, right?\n\n153\n00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.990\nThe network adapter,\nif you will, it's Ethernet.\n\n154\n00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.730\nLet's say an Ethernet adapter, right?\n\n155\n00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.230\nWell that defines things that\nsit at the Data Link Layer,\n\n156\n00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.990\nlike the Media Access Control Layer,\n\n157\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.360\nif you will,\nas well as the Physical Layer, right?\n\n158\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.820\nThe Ethernet twisted pair implementations,\nthat's the Physical Layer, right?\n\n159\n00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.600\nSo that's like a OSI gray protocol, right?\n\n160\n00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.270\nKinda sitting in between.\n\n161\n00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.520\nWe don't have that problem with\nTransmission Control Protocol.\n\n162\n00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.080\nAll of those functionalities sit at\na well-defined single layer, right?\n\n163\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.596\nSo again, very, very specific, right?\n\n164\n00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:34.626\nNot a lot of room or tolerance for\nthese gray level protocols,\n\n165\n00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:38.468\neverything is clearly\ndefined at the levels.\n\n166\n00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:42.250\nAll right, and so with that being said,\nwe move down to the Transport Layer,\n\n167\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.300\ncontinuing on.\n\n168\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.050\nI want you to keep in mind we get\nconnection oriented services.\n\n169\n00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.407\nThose of you that have already\nlooked at the OSI model and\n\n170\n00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:51.819\nmaybe seen some of our other episodes in\nthe Net+ course should probably know one\n\n171\n00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:53.750\nof those protocols that I'm talking about.\n\n172\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.984\nAs well as providing things like\nacknowledgment services, right?\n\n173\n00:08:56.984 --> 00:08:59.796\nIf a packet needs to be re-transmitted,\nright?\n\n174\n00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:03.898\nAt that transport layer it's gonna\ncall back across that wire and\n\n175\n00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:07.552\nit's gonna say hey,\nI just lost sequence, or packet, or\n\n176\n00:09:07.552 --> 00:09:10.924\ndatagram if you will,\nsegment, more importantly.\n\n177\n00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:13.794\nI just lost segment whatever,\nI need you to send it so\n\n178\n00:09:13.794 --> 00:09:17.724\nthat I can reassemble that PDU so\nthat we have the information, right?\n\n179\n00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.594\nSo acknowledgement services,\n\n180\n00:09:19.594 --> 00:09:23.690\nas well as the part of that also being\nthings like packet recovery too.\n\n181\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.535\nNow when we look at the Internet Layer,\nright, the Internet Layer's important.\n\n182\n00:09:27.535 --> 00:09:31.480\nAnd I want you to think about the name\nInternet Layer coming up again,\n\n183\n00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.680\nas we move through it, right?\n\n184\n00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.324\nThe Internet Layer provides things like\nour addressing, things like routing,\n\n185\n00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:39.450\npacketization of our data, right?\n\n186\n00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.270\nSo packaging, if you will,\nturning it into a packet.\n\n187\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.840\nThings like, for instance,\nthe IP to the Link Layer, right?\n\n188\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.737\nThe Link Layer address resolution.\n\n189\n00:09:49.737 --> 00:09:54.361\nAnd when I say Link Layer, we'll come\nback to what I mean by that, right?\n\n190\n00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:57.335\nAnd it also provides things like\nmulticast communications, right?\n\n191\n00:09:57.335 --> 00:10:00.135\nWhen we need to route multicast\ncommunications to those specific\n\n192\n00:10:00.135 --> 00:10:02.110\nfew within that group, guess what?\n\n193\n00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.235\nIt's happening here at\nthe Internet Layer too.\n\n194\n00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:08.410\nBut it also does things like, for\ninstance, controlling congestion.\n\n195\n00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.000\nWe can do diagnostics if you will,\nand flow control.\n\n196\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.030\nFor instance that squelch\nmessage that says hey, you're\n\n197\n00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.250\nsending too much information into the\nnetwork adapter, you need to slow down.\n\n198\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.110\nBack off a little bit or\nI'm gonna start dropping packets.\n\n199\n00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.768\nOr you're talking too slow.\n\n200\n00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:25.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on, speed it up, right?\n\n201\n00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.100\nSo it does things like\nflow control as well,\n\n202\n00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.370\nthat all happens there at\nthe Internet Layer too.\n\n203\n00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.950\nNow the Network Interface Layer\nis interesting, all right?\n\n204\n00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.050\nSometimes called a Link Layer too,\n\n205\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.110\nbut don't get it confused with the Data\nLink Layer in the OSI model, right?\n\n206\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.352\nThey're not one and the same, right?\n\n207\n00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:44.316\nBut the Network Interface Layer,\nright, what does it do?\n\n208\n00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:46.483\nIt provides access to your medium,\nall right?\n\n209\n00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:50.850\nWhether it be a wireless medium,\nor unmounted, radiated energy, or\n\n210\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.069\nwhether it be bounded media,\nthere's some kind of fiber-optic or\n\n211\n00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:57.526\nwired copper communication, right?\n\n212\n00:10:57.526 --> 00:11:01.510\nReceiving and placing that data,\nso receiving it off the medium,\n\n213\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.086\nplacing it on the medium.\n\n214\n00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:06.332\nSo not only giving you access, but\nactually performing the function of\n\n215\n00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:10.490\nputting that information on the medium,\nand taking it off the medium.\n\n216\n00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.670\nOne of the great things about\nthe Network Interface Layer there Zach,\n\n217\n00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.940\nis the fact that it is\nframe format independent.\n\n218\n00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.502\nIt doesn't matter what the frame size is.\n\n219\n00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:22.857\nThe Transmission Control Protocol says,\nI don't care about that.\n\n220\n00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:27.084\nLAN communications, LAN technologies,\nyou take care of that.\n\n221\n00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:28.600\nI'm not gonna worry about it,\nI'm outta here.\n\n222\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.385\nNo, not really.\n\n223\n00:11:29.385 --> 00:11:33.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's access method independent.\n\n224\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.230\nIt doesn't matter if it's using CSMA,\nor CD, or CMSA/CA, doesn't care.\n\n225\n00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.653\nIt's independent of that, right?\n\n226\n00:11:40.653 --> 00:11:41.586\nAnd that's one of the great things.\n\n227\n00:11:41.586 --> 00:11:46.009\nIt's why the Department of Defense wanted\nit so good, because they said hey,\n\n228\n00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:50.243\nwe wanna be able to route traffic\nacross these different vendor networks.\n\n229\n00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:53.210\nAnd we don't wanna get vendor locked,\nright.\n\n230\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.603\nAgain, at the Network Interface Layer,\nTransmission Control Protocol turns\n\n231\n00:11:57.603 --> 00:12:01.545\na blind eye to whatever the media\naccess method is, your frame format.\n\n232\n00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:04.960\nAnd again, the mediums itself,\nit doesn't matter either.\n\n233\n00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.231\n&gt;&gt; Hey Wes,\nnow is the exclusively using MILNET, or\n\n234\n00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:10.400\ndo they also use regular Internet?\n\n235\n00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.820\n&gt;&gt; There are some in the public domain,\nand that's one of the reasons we have one\n\n236\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.050\nof the TLDs, the top level domains is\nactually M-I-L, and it is military.\n\n237\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.580\nSo they use public networks too,\nbut anything that is-\n\n238\n00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.125\n&gt;&gt; Top secret.\n\n239\n00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:24.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well definitely top secret, but\n\n240\n00:12:24.685 --> 00:12:27.862\nthey also have their\nisolated military network.\n\n241\n00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:29.017\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And again,\n\n242\n00:12:29.017 --> 00:12:31.454\nit's fairly air-gapped as far as I know.\n\n243\n00:12:31.454 --> 00:12:32.438\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n\n244\n00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:37.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see, the other thing too\nabout the Network Interface Layer here.\n\n245\n00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.739\nThe other thing that is great\nis the fact that it assumes\n\n246\n00:12:41.739 --> 00:12:45.800\nan unreliable medium, an unreliable link.\n\n247\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.277\nAnd that's one of the interesting things.\n\n248\n00:12:48.277 --> 00:12:53.579\nAnd when we come back to our\ncomparison over TCP/IP model,\n\n249\n00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:56.239\nwe'll see why that matters.\n\n250\n00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:00.050\nWhat are the comparison,\nwhat's different here, right?\n\n251\n00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.180\nJust remember that the Network Interface\nLayer doesn't provide acknowledgments,\n\n252\n00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.260\nit doesn't provide sequencing.\n\n253\n00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.274\nIf you need reliable delivery,\n\n254\n00:13:07.274 --> 00:13:10.940\nthat's gonna have to be provided\nby the Transport Layer.\n\n255\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.029\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n256\n00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:15.141\n&gt;&gt; And if you are using\nunreliable connection services at\n\n257\n00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:19.642\nthe Transport Layer, don't expect\nthe Network Interface Layer to do it.\n\n258\n00:13:19.642 --> 00:13:22.925\nThat's gonna be required up\nthere at the Application Layer.\n\n259\n00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:26.622\nThe upper layer protocols\nare gonna have to support that.\n\n260\n00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:28.262\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; More specifically at\n\n261\n00:13:28.262 --> 00:13:29.485\nthe Transport Layer.\n\n262\n00:13:29.485 --> 00:13:36.431\nAll right, so that is a little bit\nabout our TCP/IP model, all right?\n\n263\n00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:41.230\nLet's talk about some of the other\nthings that we can see here, right?\n\n264\n00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.500\nSo I've got another little slide here.\n\n265\n00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.960\nWhen we talk about the application, right,\nit provides application services and\n\n266\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.690\ndata exchange.\n\n267\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.130\nSome of the protocols that we see here,\nyou will see we have things like HTTP, or\n\n268\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.540\nwhether it's secure HTTPS, right?\n\n269\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.942\nCuz remember, encryption's also\nhandled by this Application Layer.\n\n270\n00:13:59.942 --> 00:14:01.298\nThings like data exchange,\n\n271\n00:14:01.298 --> 00:14:04.692\nmore specifically things like your\nfile transfer protocols, right?\n\n272\n00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:09.850\nNFS, Network File System, what else?\n\n273\n00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.368\nFTP, AFP, Apple Filing Protocol.\n\n274\n00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:14.820\nAll of these different file access and\n\n275\n00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.730\ntransferring programs are there\nat the Application Layer.\n\n276\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:24.062\nYour email protocols, right, SMTP,\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n277\n00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:26.232\nPOP3, Post Office Protocol version 3.\n\n278\n00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:29.310\nIMAP, your\nInternet Message Access Protocol, right?\n\n279\n00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.790\nDNS, TELNET, Terminal Emulation Software,\nall of these are at the Application Layer.\n\n280\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.180\nThese are examples of\nApplication Layer protocols.\n\n281\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.150\nSo some of you are probably saying is\nthat why he said the Application Layer's\n\n282\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.560\nproviding name resolution services?\n\n283\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.480\nAha, that's right, exactly.\n\n284\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.270\nThat's where DNS, DNS sits there\nat the Application Layer, right?\n\n285\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.510\nNow the Transport Layer is also sometimes\nknown as a host-to-host layer cuz\n\n286\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.860\nit provides the host-to-host\ncommunications.\n\n287\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.332\nAnd that's important to understand,\nbecause guess what?\n\n288\n00:14:57.332 --> 00:15:00.823\nTransmission Control Protocol sits here,\nand we know what TCP does, right?\n\n289\n00:15:00.823 --> 00:15:04.621\nTransmission Control Protocol,\nremember I said earlier\n\n290\n00:15:04.621 --> 00:15:09.201\nthat Transport Layer provides those\nconnection oriented services.\n\n291\n00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:10.703\nSequencing and segmentation,\n\n292\n00:15:10.703 --> 00:15:13.984\nit's all part of the Transmission\nControl Protocol functionality,\n\n293\n00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:18.420\nwhich we've talked about already in other\nepisodes including the packet recovery.\n\n294\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.710\nNow remember, if you have applications or\n\n295\n00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.850\nupper layer protocols that\nprovide some kind of checksum.\n\n296\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.330\nAnd you don't need the overhead of\nTransmission Control Protocol, but\n\n297\n00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.790\nyou need just sheer speed, that's where,\nwell, you're gonna get UDP, right?\n\n298\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.460\nUser Data Grand Protocol.\n\n299\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:40.288\nSo the Transport Layer, again the two\nmajor transport protocols, TCP and UDP.\n\n300\n00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:42.920\nWe get back down to the Internet Layer.\n\n301\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.260\nKind of a recap,\nremember we said addressing and routing?\n\n302\n00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.770\nWell, guess what?\n\n303\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.015\nIP, the Internet Protocol,\nthat is the addressing part, right?\n\n304\n00:15:52.015 --> 00:15:56.277\nRouting protocols that we also talk\nabout as well, things like OSPF, right?\n\n305\n00:15:56.277 --> 00:16:00.865\nISIS, EIGRP Things like IGMP, right?\n\n306\n00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:05.370\nInternet Group Management Protocol,\nthat is your multi-test control protocol.\n\n307\n00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.960\nRemember we said there at the Internet\nlayer that the multi-test\n\n308\n00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.830\ncommunications are controlled\nby this layer?\n\n309\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.050\nWell, guess what, it's IGMP.\n\n310\n00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.760\nARP.\n\n311\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.900\nRemember I sent an IP to a link\nlayer address resolution?\n\n312\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.970\nThe address resolution protocol,\nwe've already talked about that remember.\n\n313\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.460\nReceiving those communications from IP and\nIP says,\n\n314\n00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.010\nwell I don't now what the MAC address is.\n\n315\n00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.600\nARP, you're sitting here with me,\nhere let me hand that over to you.\n\n316\n00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.420\nYou go take care of that and\nfind out the MAC address.\n\n317\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.130\nAnd when you've got that answer\njust return it to me, right.\n\n318\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.610\nSo all of that is happening right there\nat the Internet layer likewise, too.\n\n319\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.970\nNow the Network Interface layer,\n\n320\n00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.280\nthis is what actually places the data\non the physical medium, right?\n\n321\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.150\nEthernet, Token Ring,\nFiber Distributed Data Interface, or FDDI.\n\n322\n00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.927\nAnd again, I always have to say FDDI,\njust cuz it's fun to say.\n\n323\n00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:51.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sonnet, right?\n\n324\n00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.700\nWell, if you're here in\nthe states it's Sonnet,\n\n325\n00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.770\npart of the American national standard\nis the Synchronized Optical Networking.\n\n326\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.780\nIf you're in the UK and you're following\nthe international telecommunications unit.\n\n327\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.620\nThey're gonna call is SDH, right,\nsynchronise digital hierarchy.\n\n328\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.420\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n329\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Just a couple of different terms for\nthe same type of communications.\n\n330\n00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.040\nSo, when we talk about this.\n\n331\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.070\nWhere do we see some of these technologies\nwhen it comes to the transmission\n\n332\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.120\ncontrol protocol?\n\n333\n00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.150\nWell, we could actually see this and\nif we kind of switch the order,\n\n334\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.200\nrather than going from\nappliation Down the stack.\n\n335\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.270\nHopefully that makes sense now.\n\n336\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.790\nWe're gonna start at the bottom of\nthe stack, the network interface layer.\n\n337\n00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.370\nAnd we'll work our way back up the stack.\n\n338\n00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.290\nIn fact, network interface layer, right?\n\n339\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:31.260\nWhat does it define?\n\n340\n00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.880\nWell, let me show you\nwhat it defines here.\n\n341\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.380\nWe've actually got an example here, right?\n\n342\n00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.330\nWell am I using copper media, and in this\ncase would it be twisted pair media?\n\n343\n00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.360\nWould it be coaxial media?\n\n344\n00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.830\nI use in fiberoptics\nversus single mode fiber,\n\n345\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.080\nSMF or MMF, right?\n\n346\n00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.250\nAgain, are you using a wired connection?\n\n347\n00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.800\nIf you're using ethernet the media access\nmethod is gonna need the carrier sends\n\n348\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.110\nmultiple access with detection.\n\n349\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.620\nIf you happen to be using\na wireless access point, right?\n\n350\n00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.130\nWell wireless access points today,\nespecially the home ones.\n\n351\n00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.590\nThey had a lot of functionality\nbuilt in to them, right?\n\n352\n00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.880\nThey're doing ethernet,\nso they're doing wired.\n\n353\n00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.580\nSo they're doing a form of CSMA/CD as\n\n354\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.600\nwell as the wireless radiated\nenergy as the CSMA/CA, right?\n\n355\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.800\nThe Carrier Sense Multiple\nAccess/Collision Avoidance.\n\n356\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.520\nAre you using a CSUDSU module,\nright, in your switches?\n\n357\n00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.620\nAre you using a wireless adaptor\nversus a wired adaptor, right?\n\n358\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.100\nWell all of these information is gonna be\n\n359\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.720\nbasically what's happening at\nthe network interface layer.\n\n360\n00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.810\nAll of that is defined, right?\n\n361\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.160\nClearly defined.\n\n362\n00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.200\nThen when we get up to things like,\n\n363\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.110\nfor instance,\nalso at the interface network layer too.\n\n364\n00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.510\nLet me show you here if I can get\nlogged in on my Windows 10 machine.\n\n365\n00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.630\nWe'll just kinda drop down to\nPowerShell or a Command Prompt here and\n\n366\n00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.000\nwe look at things like for\ninstance doing ipconfig, right?\n\n367\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.070\nAnd we do a /all.\n\n368\n00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:04.660\nI can see things like, for instance,\nI can see the physical address, right?\n\n369\n00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.120\nRight there, there's the mac address.\n\n370\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.510\nSo that's all defined there\nby that network adapter,\n\n371\n00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.140\nthe network interface layer, I should say.\n\n372\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.190\nIf we look down into our adapter\nsettings and we right click and\n\n373\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.110\nwe choose the properties\nof the network adapter.\n\n374\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.460\nWell, I can hover right over\nthe physical network adapter and\n\n375\n00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.840\nsee what that mac address is, right?\n\n376\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.700\nAll of that's defined right there\nat the network interface layer.\n\n377\n00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.240\nWhat medium you're talking about?\n\n378\n00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.640\nWhat media access method\ndefining how we place the media?\n\n379\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.140\nOr the data on the media,\n\n380\n00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.160\nas well as some of those\naddressing protocols, if you will.\n\n381\n00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.520\nLike media access control address,\na mac address, right?\n\n382\n00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.835\nThen if we move up to the Internet layer,\nright?\n\n383\n00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:48.770\nGg ahead and clear the script,\nlike in SPLS we'll be doing good.\n\n384\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.030\nAnd I choose something like route, right?\n\n385\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.530\nAnd I do a route print.\n\n386\n00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.820\nWell, here now we're up to.\n\n387\n00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.870\nYou know that second layer.\n\n388\n00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.410\nAnd that's where it gets tricky, right?\n\n389\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.010\nCuz if we say layer three.\n\n390\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.010\nAnd you're talking about IP,\n\n391\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:07.020\nyou're talking the layer three of\nthe OSI model is the network layer.\n\n392\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.370\nBut if you're talking about TCP/IP,\nit's layer two.\n\n393\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.590\nSee the confusion here?\n\n394\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.490\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So what are you\n\n395\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.030\ntalking about layer three or layer two?\n\n396\n00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.890\nWell I don't know.\n\n397\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.520\nIn context I gotta figure out\nare you talking about OSI?\n\n398\n00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.620\nBusy.\nWe're talking about OSI and\n\n399\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.350\nyou're talking about IP,\nyou're talking about Layer 3.\n\n400\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.560\nBut if you're talking about talking\nabout transmission control protocol,\n\n401\n00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.370\nthat happens at the Internet Layer, too.\n\n402\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.030\nAnd that is why I wanna\nestablish what is going on here.\n\n403\n00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.780\nSo, we have our routing,\nour routing tables, our IP addresses,\n\n404\n00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.330\nwhere the routers operate.\n\n405\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.740\nThat is gonna happen\nat the Internet Layer.\n\n406\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.190\nAnd I want you to think about that.\n\n407\n00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.740\nInternet layer,\nwhy do they call it the Internet layer?\n\n408\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.190\nBecause the network\ninterface layer just defines\n\n409\n00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.340\nmore like the local area\nnetwork communications.\n\n410\n00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.090\nEven though it's vendor independent,\n\n411\n00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.190\nit doesn't matter what the protocol is,\nthat's really your LAN communications.\n\n412\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.800\nThen once we want to hop out of our\nnetworks and go across networks,\n\n413\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.860\nhence the Internet with\nthe Internet protocol.\n\n414\n00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.700\nKeep saying Internet so\nit'll sink in what that layer is, right?\n\n415\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.830\nJust don't practice it\ntill you get it right.\n\n416\n00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.540\nDo like my favorite guitarist said,\nBuddy Guy,\n\n417\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.100\npractice it til you can't get it wrong.\n\n418\n00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.840\nAnd then you know it's gonna be right.\n\n419\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.810\nSo just keep going over these things,\nright?\n\n420\n00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.910\nSo you have for instance here,\nthe Internet layer.\n\n421\n00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.790\nBut then we can see other information,\ntoo, right.\n\n422\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.740\nWe can see the information of\nthe transport in that application layer.\n\n423\n00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:24.280\nBut what we're gonna do here is we'll\nshow you some of those protocols.\n\n424\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.350\nI'm gonna go ahead and,\nlet me fire up Wire Shark here, and\n\n425\n00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.700\nwe'll do a packet capture.\n\n426\n00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.200\nAnd we'll kind of look at some\nof this information here.\n\n427\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.770\nAnd let me go ahead and\nput this filter in here real quick And\n\n428\n00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:39.020\nI'm gonna connect over\nthe network back to my server.\n\n429\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.890\nI'm gonna connect to its\nadministrative share.\n\n430\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.570\nNow remember that I told you that\nat the application layer we had,\n\n431\n00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.420\nwhat did we have?\n\n432\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:54.070\nWe had file transfer protocols,\nfile access protocols, file access at all.\n\n433\n00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.140\nWell, SMB is server message block,\nthat is also up there.\n\n434\n00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.840\nNow, I didn't mention it, but SMB, Samba,\n\n435\n00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.225\nthis is all all part of\nthe application layer as well.\n\n436\n00:22:03.225 --> 00:22:07.755\nNow that I've actually connected to a\nWindows shared resource across the network\n\n437\n00:22:07.755 --> 00:22:08.965\nwith this.\n\n438\n00:22:08.965 --> 00:22:13.165\nI should see server message block has\nkicked in at the application layer.\n\n439\n00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:17.565\nAnd said hey, let me negotiate the\ncommunications between file explorer here\n\n440\n00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:18.945\nand that server you're connecting.\n\n441\n00:22:18.945 --> 00:22:21.635\nTo viewing its files and\nfolders over the network.\n\n442\n00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.240\nSo now that we've done that we'll go\nahead and we'll just kind of stop this.\n\n443\n00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.170\nAnd I'll stop the packet capture\nright here, and I see well.\n\n444\n00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.540\nI see things like DNS right.\n\n445\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.800\nAnd in wire shark I definitely\nrecommend getting wire shark so\n\n446\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.450\nyou can kind of see what's going on here.\n\n447\n00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.640\nBut notice that we have we've\ngot domain name system right.\n\n448\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.290\nThat's your application layer.\n\n449\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.900\nWe have right here,\nwe have the transport layer right.\n\n450\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.160\nNow we're moving down that protocol stack.\n\n451\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.040\nSo application is DNS.\n\n452\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.770\nThe transport layer,\nwe're using connectionless.\n\n453\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:00.160\nThis was a connectionless, is a UDP DNS\nquery, so it's connectionless.\n\n454\n00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.850\nWe can see the destination port.\n\n455\n00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:05.670\nSo we can see the port information there,\nport 53.\n\n456\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.630\nRight.\nAnd\n\n457\n00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.800\nthat's another thing to keep in\nmind that's kind of interesting.\n\n458\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.060\nInside of the application layer in TCP IP.\n\n459\n00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:16.080\nIt performs some of the same functions\nthat the session layer does over there at\n\n460\n00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.770\nthe OSI model, right?\n\n461\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.420\nAnd that's why we can see things like\nhere in the transport layer, right?\n\n462\n00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.480\nWe can see things like, for\ninstance, the ports here.\n\n463\n00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.390\nI can see DNS and we'll see a little bit\nof this coming up where you can actually\n\n464\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.490\nsee some of the session\nlayer information layer.\n\n465\n00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.830\nThat's kinda built right into\nthe application layer the TCPIP model.\n\n466\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.650\nLet me kinda scroll down here.\n\n467\n00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.720\nHere is one, right?\n\n468\n00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.800\nSo what do I have right here?\n\n469\n00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.900\nRemember we said the transmission\ncontrol protocol,\n\n470\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.950\nTCP is a connection oriented service.\n\n471\n00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.980\nHow does it happen?\n\n472\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:47.521\nRight?\nWell,\n\n473\n00:23:47.521 --> 00:23:51.340\nit happens through what's known as\na TCP three-way handshake, all right?\n\n474\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.678\nHey, I need something.\n\n475\n00:23:52.678 --> 00:23:55.989\nOkay, I acknowledge the other side,\nI acknowledge that you need something.\n\n476\n00:23:55.989 --> 00:23:59.535\nHey, Now we're connected and\nwe can set up a communication.\n\n477\n00:23:59.535 --> 00:24:00.585\nThree-way handshake.\n\n478\n00:24:00.585 --> 00:24:04.090\nWhat we have is a syncronization\nrequest packet.\n\n479\n00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.550\nThis is kinda cool when you get\ndown into the protocol analyze.\n\n480\n00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:09.480\nYou're like wow that's the protocol\ndoing what it's supposed to be doing.\n\n481\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.640\nIt's setting up that\nconnection oriented session.\n\n482\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.820\nIt's saying hey I need\nto syncronize with you.\n\n483\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.885\nAnd then the end party.\n\n484\n00:24:16.885 --> 00:24:19.316\nThe other system calls back and\nsays okay, I acknowledge it.\n\n485\n00:24:19.316 --> 00:24:21.780\nIt's called a SynAck,\nsynchronization acknowledgement packet.\n\n486\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.740\nI acknowledge that you\nwant to synchronize.\n\n487\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.550\nAnd then finally to set\nup that connection.\n\n488\n00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.212\nIt sends back the acknowledgement, right?\n\n489\n00:24:30.212 --> 00:24:31.195\nSo that's the last one.\n\n490\n00:24:31.195 --> 00:24:33.720\nSo you have the TCP three\nway handshake going on here.\n\n491\n00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.790\nAnd we could see that information Right\nhere in the protocol stack, right?\n\n492\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.020\nAnd let me go ahead and select this one.\n\n493\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.590\nNow, here's another thing to keep in mind.\n\n494\n00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.840\nSome people believe that in every\nsingle communication you do.\n\n495\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.724\nYou're gonna work down the application\nto the network interface.\n\n496\n00:24:48.724 --> 00:24:51.330\nBack up the network interface\nall the way to the application.\n\n497\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.730\nThat isn't necessarily true, all right?\n\n498\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.040\nBecause sometimes transmission control\nprotocol is just communicating, right?\n\n499\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.000\nHey Hold on application, you need to stop.\n\n500\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.490\nDon't send me your information yet.\n\n501\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.253\nYou need a connection oriented service,\nright.\n\n502\n00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:05.677\nThat's what you're telling me?\n\n503\n00:25:05.677 --> 00:25:07.240\nHold the horses.\n\n504\n00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.840\nLet me go ahead and set that up with\nthe TCP three way handshake, right?\n\n505\n00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.830\nThat's why we don't that many\napplication layer data, right?\n\n506\n00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.070\nThis is the very first\nacknowledgement going out.\n\n507\n00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.180\nSo transmission control protocol says,\nwait a second.\n\n508\n00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.510\nI see you're trying to give me this SDU,\nthis service data unit.\n\n509\n00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.870\nHold on, just hold onto it.\n\n510\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.400\nLet me go ahead and\npick up the phone call and\n\n511\n00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.460\nI'll get that phone call started for\nyou and everything.\n\n512\n00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.890\nAnd then you can pull\nyour information down.\n\n513\n00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.210\nWhat we see after that,\nnotice that we've got,\n\n514\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.060\nwe don't have any application\nlayer data coming out here.\n\n515\n00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.380\nThese three packets that I've captured\nare all Transmission Control Protocol.\n\n516\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.170\nBut notice what happens\nwhen we hit the first.\n\n517\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.950\nRemember I said SMB?\n\n518\n00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:51.280\nWe hit the first SMB, and\nnow I have application layer.\n\n519\n00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.921\nAnd in between the application layer\nwe have some kind of session layer.\n\n520\n00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:57.540\nLike I said,\nkind of related to the OSI model.\n\n521\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.291\nBut at the application layer it\nbundles in those functionalities.\n\n522\n00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:03.970\nAnd we're gonna see that coming up\nprobably in a part two here coming up.\n\n523\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.998\nBut you can see that there it is.\n\n524\n00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:09.673\nThere is SMB sitting right\non that transport Protocol,\n\n525\n00:26:09.673 --> 00:26:12.026\nwhich is sitting right on top of IP.\n\n526\n00:26:12.026 --> 00:26:15.030\nWhich is then finally encapsulated\nin an Ethernet Frame.\n\n527\n00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.420\nAnd then,\nit's turned into an electrical current and\n\n528\n00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.200\nit's sent across the wire\nbetween your endpoints.\n\n529\n00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.960\nSo those are some of the things that you\ncan see in transmission control protocol,\n\n530\n00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.990\ninternet protocol or the TCPIP model.\n\n531\n00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.780\nHowever, we've got a couple more\nthings that we need to round off,\n\n532\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.590\ncuz I want to jump back and talk\na little bit more about the protocols.\n\n533\n00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.670\nSome of things that you\ncan also see in here.\n\n534\n00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.130\nAnd the rounded up with\na comparison of the OSI and\n\n535\n00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.350\ntransmission control protocol internet\nprotocol model or TCPIP model.\n\n536\n00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:48.910\nSo if they ask you any questions on the\nexam, you'll be able to get them right.\n\n537\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.520\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job, Wes.\n\n538\n00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.245\nThanks very much.\n\n539\n00:26:51.245 --> 00:26:54.640\nTCP/IP model part one,\nthere will be a part two.\n\n540\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.910\nSo make sure you see both parts,\nvery important stuff.\n\n541\n00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.340\nAnd make sure you watch\neverything in the NET+\n\n542\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.280\nseries that Wes has put together for you.\n\n543\n00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.920\nBecause he's done a great job.\n\n544\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.020\nAnd you can use this information now and\nin the future.\n\n545\n00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.810\nAnd while you're in the course library,\nthere's thousands of other videos.\n\n546\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.700\nAnd they're there to help you go further,\nso check them out, too.\n\n547\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:13.490\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nand ITProTV is bingeworthy.\n\n548\n00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.000\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n549\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:15.710\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n550\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.943\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n551\n00:27:17.943 --> 00:27:23.933\n[MUSIC]\n\n552\n00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:28.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.409\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:13.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000\nwatching ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.686\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, for\nthis episode of Net+ TCP/IP model part 2,\n\n7\n00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.520\nhopefully you saw part 1.\n\n8\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.250\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to take us through\nit, Wes good to see you again sir.\n\n9\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.217\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back,\n\n10\n00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:29.742\nthat's right,\ntalked a lot in that first part.\n\n11\n00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:33.152\nWe could have probably made it a really\nlong episode, but we decided, hey,\n\n12\n00:00:33.152 --> 00:00:35.086\nwhy don't we just go ahead and\nbreak it up.\n\n13\n00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:36.212\nAnd we'll come back and\n\n14\n00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:39.319\nkinda show you a short episode here\nto just tie off the loose ends.\n\n15\n00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:43.983\nBecause in the first part,\nwe really just described a lot about\n\n16\n00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:48.569\ntransmission control protocol,\nInternet protocol suite.\n\n17\n00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.909\nAnd I know I keep saying that, but\nagain the more you hear that acronym,\n\n18\n00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.340\nhopefully the more it'll sit in,\nbut that's the TCPIP model, right.\n\n19\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.700\nAnd we talked about\nthe different layers and\n\n20\n00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.450\nwhat you could see on\nthe different layers, right.\n\n21\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.753\nWe talked about things like well,\nhey network interface layer, right.\n\n22\n00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:08.057\nIt defines am I using copper media or\nI guess am I using fiber optic media or\n\n23\n00:01:08.057 --> 00:01:08.985\ncopper media.\n\n24\n00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.057\nZach's over here saying you got it\n\n25\n00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:12.063\nbackwards man.\n\n26\n00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:13.461\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thanks, man, I appreciate it.\n\n27\n00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.360\n[LAUGH] What is the media\nthat we're using,\n\n28\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.290\nright, or\nwhat is the medium we're using, right.\n\n29\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.713\nAnd if we're using wired networks, right,\n\n30\n00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:22.469\nwe're gonna be using some kind of switch,\nright.\n\n31\n00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.700\nIt's gonna use that carrier sense,\nmultiple access, collision detection.\n\n32\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.150\nIf we happen to be using one of these guys\nhere, right, via wireless access point.\n\n33\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.900\nThen we're gonna be using\n802.11 standards, right,\n\n34\n00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.530\nversus to the 802.3 standards.\n\n35\n00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.190\nAll of this information and\neven the media access methods,\n\n36\n00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.270\nright, here in wireless, right?\n\n37\n00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.330\nCarrier sends multiple\naccess collision avoidance.\n\n38\n00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.690\nAll of that is defined in\nthat network interface layer.\n\n39\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.610\nRemember, we also started to\nmove up the stack, in fact,\n\n40\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.280\nlet's go back to our Wireshark\npacket capture that we did.\n\n41\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.080\nThis is where we left\noff in the last episode.\n\n42\n00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.370\n&gt;&gt; Love Wireshark.\n\n43\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.280\n&gt;&gt; We talk about that frame information\n\n44\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.820\ndown there at the network interface layer.\n\n45\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.020\nNotice you don't see the physical bytes,\nright?\n\n46\n00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.400\nThat's in the network interface layer, but\nthat's the actual electrical currents that\n\n47\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.600\nare leaving and\ncoming into the network adapter.\n\n48\n00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.870\nBut, again,\n\n49\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.140\nit doesn't matter what frame type it is,\nTCP/IP is just independent of that, right?\n\n50\n00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.320\nSo you could see our information here,\nright?\n\n51\n00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.750\nWe could see things like\ntiming information, right?\n\n52\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.390\nWhat time the frame arrived,\nand if we move up the stack,\n\n53\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.460\nwe could see that it's ether Ethernet too,\nright,and a part of that network interface\n\n54\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.718\nlayer is things like our MAC addresses,\nright.\n\n55\n00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:35.447\nWe could see the source MAC address versus\nthe, actually destination MAC address,\n\n56\n00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:40.222\nand in this case it's my computer\nversus where it is going to, right.\n\n57\n00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:45.569\nSo we can see that source and destination\nMAC address here too and inside of that\n\n58\n00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.592\nframe, just like in any encapsulation,\nif we dig down into this packet,\n\n59\n00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:55.540\nwe should be able to see some of\nthe upper layer protocols, right?\n\n60\n00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.710\nCuz in the encapsulation, right, we've\ngot all of those upper layer protocols up\n\n61\n00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.130\nthe protocol stack,\nthat have been handed down.\n\n62\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.530\nAnd we now have a frame,\n\n63\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.760\nwhich is our network interface\nlayer's protocol data unit, PDU.\n\n64\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.120\nAnd it says that, hey, this is IP,\nit's using Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n65\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.930\nand it's using NetBIOS here if you will,\nand\n\n66\n00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.020\nthen also that application\nlayer protocol being SMB.\n\n67\n00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.050\nSo we can see that\nencapsulation right there.\n\n68\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.470\nAll of that information is\nright there in the frame.\n\n69\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.680\nAnd then again moving up the frame or,\nexcuse me, up the stack, right?\n\n70\n00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.910\nWe get Ethernet and that's where our\nsource and destination MAC addresses are.\n\n71\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.190\nAnd it tells us what the type\nof protocol is that we're\n\n72\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.840\nmoving down that stack, if you will.\n\n73\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.550\nI know it kinda looks like up in\nrelationship to the way we're working here\n\n74\n00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.720\nin Wireshark.\n\n75\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.305\nWe can see an Internet Protocol Version 4,\nright,\n\n76\n00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:48.654\nthis was where we talked about routing and\naddressing, right, and\n\n77\n00:03:48.654 --> 00:03:51.023\naddressing being more specific to IP,\nright?\n\n78\n00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:54.218\nAnd that's where we get things like,\nfor instance,\n\n79\n00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:57.630\nlike quality of service type information,\nright?\n\n80\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.592\nOur DS, what is it, DSCP,\nDifferentiated Service Code Point, right?\n\n81\n00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:04.224\nWe could see that information in there,\nas well as moving up the stack again and\n\n82\n00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:05.150\nthen we get to the transport layer, right?\n\n83\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.089\nAnd we see transmission control protocol,\n\n84\n00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:14.020\nwe could also see some of\nthose session ports, right.\n\n85\n00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.780\nPort identifiers including\nsome of the session level\n\n86\n00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.040\nservices that we would typically see on\nwhat we call the OSI model are all bundled\n\n87\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.650\nhere in the last layer, the topmost\nlayer of the TCP/IP model here.\n\n88\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.063\nWe've got also Server Message Block and,\nagain,\n\n89\n00:04:29.063 --> 00:04:31.090\nNegotiation Protocol Rrequest, right?\n\n90\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.250\nSo this application,\nthis is a file access protocol at that\n\n91\n00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.250\napplication layer like we were talking\nabout, that's gonna allow me to see,\n\n92\n00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.800\nview and exchange potentially\ndata over the wire, right?\n\n93\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.630\nSo, essentially, what I'm doing here is,\nI launched up our file explorer.\n\n94\n00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.220\nFile explorer is your Windows network or\nfile and\n\n95\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.150\nphoto graphical user interface software,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.491\nAnd it's an application, and it allows\nme to connect to another computer,\n\n97\n00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:07.170\nright, as well, so it also has to\nbe a network aware application.\n\n98\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.190\nSo you can see that file explorer is\nusing an application layer protocol.\n\n99\n00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.220\nLet me go ahead and\nclose some of these layers here,\n\n100\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.960\nand kinda collapse them\ndown on themselves.\n\n101\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.816\nBasically my file explorer needs\nto connect to another computer.\n\n102\n00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:24.950\nIt's saying okay, well I need a protocol\nthat's gonna allow me access to\n\n103\n00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.340\nthe services within\nthe network while it uses SMB.\n\n104\n00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.080\nSMB piggybacks on top of NetBIOS\ndoing a little bit of name\n\n105\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.650\nresolution if you were\na session message here too.\n\n106\n00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.840\nAnd that is all in that application layer,\nagain Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n107\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.410\nInternet Protocol, and\nthe network interface.\n\n108\n00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.530\nSo you can see all of that\ngood information inside of\n\n109\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.020\nsomething like a protocol analyzer.\n\n110\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.600\nWhich is why if you are studying for\n\n111\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.420\nyour Net+ exam, look at some\nbasics on how to use Wireshark.\n\n112\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.220\nWireshark is a very, very complex,\nthey got an entire university dedicated.\n\n113\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.580\nEntire courses dedicated to just\nthis one piece of software,\n\n114\n00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.575\nbut you don't have to be\nthat type of expert, right?\n\n115\n00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:06.470\nWe even got some Wireshark episodes in\nour course library, jump over there and\n\n116\n00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.550\nyou can see just the basics in\nhow to launch it up, right?\n\n117\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.070\nAnd then start a capture so that you can\nactually see, hey what's going on here,\n\n118\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.850\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.865\nWe could see the number of frames\nthat are caught or captured, right?\n\n120\n00:06:18.865 --> 00:06:20.330\nAnd with the protocol,\n\n121\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.960\nanalyze our technologies, we can\nactually see what is going on here, so.\n\n122\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.630\nGreat thing to have and\nhopefully it helps out,\n\n123\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.190\nespecially when we talk\nabout the TCP/IP model.\n\n124\n00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.100\nNow we've been talking heavily about\nTCP/IP model, right, in the first part of\n\n125\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.580\nthis episode, and I guess in\nthe beginning of the second part here.\n\n126\n00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.120\nWe've also talked and go a whole entire\nepisode that's dedicated to OSI.\n\n127\n00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.192\nLet's go ahead and do something\nthat we were told never to do,\n\n128\n00:06:43.192 --> 00:06:43.750\nright.\n&gt;&gt; Compare.\n\n129\n00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's cross the streams,\n\n130\n00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.860\nright, let's go ahead and compare the two,\n\n131\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.560\nthat's right, Zach.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n132\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.010\n&gt;&gt; So, I wanna go ahead and\n\n133\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.830\nI wanna jump down to just a small\nlittle diagram that I have.\n\n134\n00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.793\nAnd I know my head's probably gonna cover\nup some of this, but for the most part,\n\n135\n00:06:56.793 --> 00:06:58.160\nyou should see everything, right.\n\n136\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.230\nWe have our layered model,\ntwo models, right?\n\n137\n00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.433\nOn the left hand side of your screen,\nyou have OSI,\n\n138\n00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:08.076\non the right hand side of your screen, you\nhave the transmission control protocol,\n\n139\n00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:10.510\nInternet protocol, or TCP/IP model, right?\n\n140\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.770\nWell, what are some of the differences?\n\n141\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.660\nWell, one of the biggest things that\nyou're gonna notice right away here\n\n142\n00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.610\nis that, we have what?\n\n143\n00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:24.566\nWe have what's known as a seven layer\nmodel over here on the OSI side, right.\n\n144\n00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:29.803\nSo if we just count them off, we've got 7,\n6, right, from top to bottom,\n\n145\n00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:33.752\nwe've got 5, and\nyou probably know where this is going,\n\n146\n00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:34.779\nright?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:35.637\n&gt;&gt; All the way down\n\n148\n00:07:35.637 --> 00:07:39.138\nto the physical layer here,\nwhich would be layer one, right?\n\n149\n00:07:39.138 --> 00:07:43.834\nAnd it is important to know OSI, but\nit's also important to know, and\n\n150\n00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:48.846\none of the reasons I wanna take a second\nhere and just kind of number them as we\n\n151\n00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:54.017\ntalk about them is because you might be\non an exam purpose, or an exam question\n\n152\n00:07:54.017 --> 00:07:59.297\nwhere they're trying to ask you what\nlayer you're communicating on or with.\n\n153\n00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:03.338\nAnd I will tell you that it is very,\nvery important, right,\n\n154\n00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:05.970\nto know the different layers, right?\n\n155\n00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.110\nAnd now you could see compared to OSI or\n\n156\n00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.300\nthe TCP/IP model,\nwell we only have four layers, right?\n\n157\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.940\nAnd again, well that's because\nthere are clear definitions of what\n\n158\n00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.710\nis going on in transmission control\nprotocol where OSI model again,\n\n159\n00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.430\nis a little bit more loosely defined,\nright?\n\n160\n00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:29.030\nAnd when I say that, keep in mind, because\nthere are certain protocols that we talk\n\n161\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.940\nabout that kinda operate\non different levels.\n\n162\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.772\nA portion of it could be this level and\na portion of it could be this level,\n\n163\n00:08:35.772 --> 00:08:37.380\nin between, if you will.\n\n164\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.330\nReally, it's clearly defined here inside\nof transmission control protocol.\n\n165\n00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:49.108\nAll right, now so notice we have a 7\nlayer model and we have a 4 layer model.\n\n166\n00:08:49.108 --> 00:08:52.069\nWhat are some other things\nthat we have to keep in mind?\n\n167\n00:08:52.069 --> 00:08:54.739\nWell, keep in mind some of the things\nthat we've already talked about\n\n168\n00:08:54.739 --> 00:08:55.960\nthese two models.\n\n169\n00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.300\nThey were not jointly developed, but\nthey were developed kind of in parallel,\n\n170\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.400\nbut between two completely\ndifferent organizations, right.\n\n171\n00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.823\nOne was a worldwide organization, right,\n\n172\n00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:09.434\nthe International Organization\nof Standardization, the ISO.\n\n173\n00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:13.905\nAnd another committee, and I cannot think\nof the name, it's more common than we just\n\n174\n00:09:13.905 --> 00:09:17.960\nsay ISO, but there was another European\ncommittee that was part of this too.\n\n175\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.829\nSo it was still a global effort,\nit was a worldwide effort.\n\n176\n00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:23.805\nInternational Standards of Organization\nhas 126 countries in it, right.\n\n177\n00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:27.839\nSo, that's a little bit different that\nTransmission Control Protocol because how\n\n178\n00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:29.440\nmany countries were in TCP/IP?\n\n179\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.010\nOne, the United States, right,\ndid you get that one there Zach?\n\n180\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.488\nI was gonna throw him a curve ball,\nthat's right, just one, right,\n\n181\n00:09:36.488 --> 00:09:37.760\nwe got the United States.\n\n182\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.902\nAnd again it was developed by our military\ngoing back to the 60s when they were\n\n183\n00:09:41.902 --> 00:09:44.490\nheavily focused on ARPANET\nin those days right?\n\n184\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.123\nSo again, even though they're\nlayered systems, right,\n\n185\n00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:51.830\nand even though they do define\nhow communications are done,\n\n186\n00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.120\nOSI model is not as optimized as TCP/IP,\nall right?\n\n187\n00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.978\nTCP/IP was made to route traffic\nacross our major network today\n\n188\n00:09:59.978 --> 00:10:03.735\nthat we call the Internet, all right,\nagain, earlier days it was called ARPANET.\n\n189\n00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:04.976\nNow, let's go ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:08.656\ntalk about the functionality when we\ncompare these two models together.\n\n191\n00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:12.557\nBecause I do want you to understand\nthat we still have a lot of the same\n\n192\n00:10:12.557 --> 00:10:16.635\nfunctionality, but it's built\ninto different locations, right.\n\n193\n00:10:16.635 --> 00:10:18.035\nLet's go back to our slide here, and\n\n194\n00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:21.310\nI've kinda got this color coded\nin a way that you can see.\n\n195\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.840\nIf we look at the OSI model,\nright, on the left hand side,\n\n196\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.860\nnotice the color coordination here.\n\n197\n00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.317\nYou can see where the functionality\nis kinda drawn in, or\n\n198\n00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:36.219\nintegrated into Transmission Control\nProtocol, Internet Protocol Suite, or\n\n199\n00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:37.960\nTCP/IP Suite, all right?\n\n200\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.100\nApplication layer, right,\n\n201\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.520\nwe say the OSI model application layer\ngives us access to the network services.\n\n202\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.950\nWell so does the application\nlayer of the TCP/IP model.\n\n203\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.495\nPresentation layer, sometimes called\nthe syntax layer that's where\n\n204\n00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:52.360\nformatting comes,\nthat's where encoding happens, right,\n\n205\n00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.590\nformats our data in a way that\nthe network doesn't have to do that.\n\n206\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.450\nWell guess what?\n\n207\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.770\nThat functionality is also built into\nthe application layer of the TCP/IP model.\n\n208\n00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:02.390\nSession layer,\n\n209\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.740\nwe talk about the portions of TCP\nsit right here at this layer, right.\n\n210\n00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.890\nAnd what do they do?\n\n211\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.730\nWell they help us to establish\nthose connection oriented services.\n\n212\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:17.390\nWell that session layer is actually built\nin to the application layer, all right?\n\n213\n00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.300\nAnd I want you to understand that certain\npieces of functionality of the session\n\n214\n00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.148\nlayer are also basically performed by\nthe application layer of the TCP/IP model.\n\n215\n00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:28.570\nNow one of the great things here,\n\n216\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.100\non the next two layers they're\ndoing the identical things.\n\n217\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.390\nTheir names are different, but again,\nthey're doing pretty much the same thing.\n\n218\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.830\nTransport layer OSI model,\ntransport layer of the TCP/IP model.\n\n219\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.310\nAnd I love when you can\nremember one thing for\n\n220\n00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.930\ntwo completely different subjects, right?\n\n221\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.390\nMakes it a little bit easier, a little bit\nless of that memorization heavy lifting,\n\n222\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.340\nif you will, that you have to do.\n\n223\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.440\nNetwork layer, OSI, Internet layer,\nif you will over there on TCP/IP.\n\n224\n00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.060\nAnd this is where I wanna\ncall back to your attention,\n\n225\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.920\nremember I said Internet layer?\n\n226\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.160\nThink about why they would call\nit the Internet layer, all right?\n\n227\n00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.696\nIf we aren't talking about routing traffic\nacross dissimilar local area networks,\n\n228\n00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:12.730\nwe don't need the Internet layer,\nwe don't really need routers, right?\n\n229\n00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.554\nIf we're all on one massive network,\nright, we would just need the network\n\n230\n00:12:16.554 --> 00:12:20.318\ninterface or in this case OSI model we\nwould just need the data link layer and\n\n231\n00:12:20.318 --> 00:12:21.840\nthe physical layer, right?\n\n232\n00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.541\nBut that's not the way it is, right,\nwe need to route traffic between\n\n233\n00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:30.190\ndifferent networks and the way that\nhappens is over the Internet, right?\n\n234\n00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.580\nWell, routing can happen internally across\nyour networks, too, but this is for\n\n235\n00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.600\nmore memorization techniques, right?\n\n236\n00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.900\nThe Internet layer in the TCP/IP model is\nwhat gives you access to the Internet.\n\n237\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.770\nIt allows you to route traffic\nacross networks, right?\n\n238\n00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.652\nIt's called the network layer inside of\nthe OSI model, but functionality wise,\n\n239\n00:12:45.652 --> 00:12:47.745\nthey're doing pretty much the same thing.\n\n240\n00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:51.341\nNow here's where it gets a little tricky,\n[LAUGH] all right,\n\n241\n00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:54.030\nyou see the craziness\non the OSI model right?\n\n242\n00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.151\nWe're going crazy here,\ngot a data link layer,\n\n243\n00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.644\ndata link layer is actually\nbroke up into two sub layers.\n\n244\n00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.319\nOne called 802.2,\nthe logical link control,\n\n245\n00:13:01.319 --> 00:13:05.283\nthe other one is called the media access\ncontrol, and we got physical layer.\n\n246\n00:13:05.283 --> 00:13:06.380\nAnd we take a breath, right?\n\n247\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.940\nNow, what do we have\n[LAUGH] on the TCP/IP side?\n\n248\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.340\nWe've got the network interface layer.\n\n249\n00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.500\nMy head is kinda covering it up here, but\nwe got the network interface layer, right?\n\n250\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.130\nAnd one of the great things is, like I\nsaid, like Ethernet, well OSI model,\n\n251\n00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.360\nyou have to remember, Ethernet sits\nin portions of the data Link layer as\n\n252\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.000\nwell as portions of the physical layer.\n\n253\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.554\nWhy?\nWell we use MAC addresses.\n\n254\n00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:28.676\nEthernet uses MAC addresses, that is a\ndata link layer switching technology, but\n\n255\n00:13:28.676 --> 00:13:30.507\nit also defines the electrical\ncapabilities and\n\n256\n00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:33.340\ncharacteristics of the medium\nat the physical layer.\n\n257\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.400\nHow about we just take all of that and\n\n258\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.460\ndump right into the network interface\nlayer and it sits on a single layer.\n\n259\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.728\nAnd that's what I mean by I say optimize,\nright,\n\n260\n00:13:39.728 --> 00:13:41.510\nthere's not a lot of room right there.\n\n261\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.471\nThis is where you sit, right, you know\nexactly where your seat in class is,\n\n262\n00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:47.080\nright?\n\n263\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.840\nThere's not really\na grey area on that one.\n\n264\n00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.310\nSo definitely know those two, all right?\n\n265\n00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:59.030\nSo that is a little bit about some\nof the comparisons between the two.\n\n266\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.210\nAll right, if they ask you about\nthe layers, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.790\nmove back one slide here, because I do\nwant you to keep in mind, all right.\n\n268\n00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.670\nI've done this myself when I was\ncommunicating with somebody else and\n\n269\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.680\nthey were asking me about, they said\nlayer two, I need to route the traffic.\n\n270\n00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.070\nYou can't route traffic with layer two.\n\n271\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.240\nYes, you can, no, you can't, and\nthen we found out we were both right.\n\n272\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.220\nI was talking about OSI and\nhe was talking about the TCP/IP model.\n\n273\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.332\nWe were both right.\n\n274\n00:14:28.332 --> 00:14:29.872\nWhen he said layer two,\n\n275\n00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:34.600\nwhat he was talking about was that\nInternet layer where IP sits, right?\n\n276\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.754\nVersus the network layer which is what I\nwas talking about, which I'm also right.\n\n277\n00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.570\n[LAUGH] So we were both right, all right?\n\n278\n00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.660\nI want you to keep that\nin mind on an exam.\n\n279\n00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.020\nWhat layer of the such and\nsuch model does a switch operate at?\n\n280\n00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.000\nWell, layer 1 or layer 2?\n\n281\n00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.650\nWell, there again, depends on\nwhat model you're talking about.\n\n282\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.110\nIf you're talking OSI model,\nswitching happens at layer 2.\n\n283\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.164\nIf you're talking about TCP/IP model,\nit happens at layer 1.\n\n284\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.220\nIt can get a little confusing.\n\n285\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.860\nSo know your numbers,\nthat is an important thing.\n\n286\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.580\nKnow the comparisons, know where some of\nthe protocols sit and also always, always,\n\n287\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.950\nalways, always, pay attention to keywords.\n\n288\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.980\nBecause if you miss a keyword, just like\nI did, had I been listening to a friend\n\n289\n00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:22.630\nof mine that we were discussing\nswitching or it was routing, right?\n\n290\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:26.545\nHad I listened to the keywords I would've\nheard that maybe he was talking about\n\n291\n00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:27.600\nTCP/IP.\n\n292\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.103\nOr maybe if he had listened to me,\nI was talking about OSI model.\n\n293\n00:15:31.103 --> 00:15:34.456\nBut since we both thought\nwe knew we were both right,\n\n294\n00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.754\nwhich technically we kind of were.\n\n295\n00:15:36.754 --> 00:15:39.800\nWe didn't even agree to disagree,\nI guess, right?\n\n296\n00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.600\nThat little miss,\n\n297\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.640\nright, not only does it happen within\njust communicating amongst people.\n\n298\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.650\nIt could also happen if you don't\nread the question thoroughly,\n\n299\n00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.930\nread that question thoroughly.\n\n300\n00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.660\nPay attention to what model they're\ntalking about, know both of the models.\n\n301\n00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.340\nKnow the OSI model, know the TCP/IP model,\nknow the comparisons between the two.\n\n302\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.319\nSo just in case, all right,\nthey ask you on the exam.\n\n303\n00:16:07.319 --> 00:16:11.982\nBut you also need to know this too\nbecause as you go on to more higher level\n\n304\n00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:15.963\nnetworking certifications,\nOSI model's gonna be there.\n\n305\n00:16:15.963 --> 00:16:20.206\nBut you can believe the Transmission\nControl Protocol Internet, Protocol Model,\n\n306\n00:16:20.206 --> 00:16:22.130\nTCP/IP model, is going to be there.\n\n307\n00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:26.927\nBecause it is the most common technology\nthat we use to route traffic across\n\n308\n00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:30.176\nthe Internet today.\n&gt;&gt; Well said Wes, very well done and\n\n309\n00:16:30.176 --> 00:16:33.044\nTCP/IP model Part 2,\nmake sure you see part 1 and\n\n310\n00:16:33.044 --> 00:16:35.790\nsee everything inside\nthe Net+ series as well.\n\n311\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.569\nBecause Wes has done a great job\nputting that all together for you and\n\n312\n00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:41.712\nyou're in the course library so\nthere's thousands of other videos there.\n\n313\n00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:45.104\nTake a look at them, they're great for\nyou, and they'll help you move forward,\n\n314\n00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.984\nand tell everyone you know about ITPro.TV.\n\n315\n00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:50.100\nITPro.TV is bingeworthy, thanks for\nwatching I'm Zach

00:00:12.190\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.040\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.970\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.690\nMy name is Zach Memos, and I'm your host\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net +,\n\n7\n00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.800\ncabling solutions copper.\n\n8\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.468\nThat's the name of this episode and\n\n9\n00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:28.795\nWes Bryan is just the fellow we need\nto tell us, what we need to know.\n\n10\n00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.764\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right and-\n\n11\n00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:30.317\n&gt;&gt; He's the guy.\n\n12\n00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:34.186\n&gt;&gt; It's interesting Zach, when we\ntalked about copper it's like well,\n\n13\n00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:36.904\nare they just gonna be\ntalking about colors here.\n\n14\n00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.140\nBut no we're talking about copper media,\nright.\n\n15\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.297\nWhen we talk about cabling solutions,\nwe have two,\n\n16\n00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:46.820\nit really boils down to two\nmajor cabling solutions.\n\n17\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.230\nWe've got copper, and in another\nepisode we're gonna talk about fiber.\n\n18\n00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.600\nCopper is one of the most prevalent cable\nsolutions that we have in our local area\n\n19\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.970\nnetworks today.\n\n20\n00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.840\nThat's what we're gonna be taking\na look at here in this episode.\n\n21\n00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.555\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, right off the bat,\nand obvious question,\n\n22\n00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:04.905\nwhat are some copper media types?\n\n23\n00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:06.455\n&gt;&gt; There's two major ones, and\n\n24\n00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:10.245\none has kinda gone by the wayside when\nit comes to more data communications.\n\n25\n00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:15.325\nAnd then one literally is the most popular\nlocal area network implementation.\n\n26\n00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.950\nAnd what I'm talking about is twisted\npair implementation and coaxial.\n\n27\n00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.763\nNow twisted pair implementations\nare how we deploy things like Ethernet.\n\n28\n00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:26.843\nEthernet uses twisted pair\nimplementations, and there's a couple of\n\n29\n00:01:26.843 --> 00:01:30.400\nvarieties that we have to look out when\nit comes to twisted pair implementations.\n\n30\n00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840\nNow the next one, coaxial, we have\nto be careful with that one because\n\n31\n00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.780\nit really form the basis for\nour very early networks, right.\n\n32\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.930\nThe networks in the mid 80s,\n\n33\n00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.185\nwe talk about things like our very first\nEthernet deployments in other episodes.\n\n34\n00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:49.640\nZach, you and I we've talked about\nbus based networks, right, and\n\n35\n00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.820\nthose earlier bus based networks\nhad a backbone cable, right.\n\n36\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.030\nJust a single centralized backbone cable\nthat all the nodes were attached to.\n\n37\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.110\nWell that would have been coaxial\nimplementations, those were the ten based\n\n38\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.070\nfive and ten based two in those days,\nit would've been thick net and Ethernet.\n\n39\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.660\nThick net used to have the name of well\nthe frozen yellow garden hose is what\n\n40\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.140\nit was called, because it was a big\nyellow cable and it was really,\n\n41\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.700\nreally hard to work with.\n\n42\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.598\nAnd then the other one thin net or\n\n43\n00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.911\nthin wire Ethernet as it might\nhave been called as well.\n\n44\n00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.758\nIt was about half the diameter\nof the earlier one, so\n\n45\n00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:31.790\nthose have really gone,\nthose are legacy technologies today.\n\n46\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.520\nAnd I'm really too sure that I don't\nknow if you will see them on the exam,\n\n47\n00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.270\nwe'll kinda mention them\na little bit briefly here.\n\n48\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.006\nBut we will talk about the coaxial\nstandards that they do require you to\n\n49\n00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.502\nknow, because even though coaxial isn't\nreally used too much in our Ethernet based\n\n50\n00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:51.268\nimplementation as a copper media\nsolution it's still heavily used.\n\n51\n00:02:51.268 --> 00:02:52.376\nIt's used in audio and\n\n52\n00:02:52.376 --> 00:02:55.930\nvideo communications, in fact some\nof the directors here that we have,\n\n53\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.487\nthe director that's behind the scenes\nright now helping us produce this\n\n54\n00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:03.128\nepisode's probably seen more coaxial\ncables in her life than she wants.\n\n55\n00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:07.823\nWe got boxes of coaxial cables back there,\nand what we use them for is audio and\n\n56\n00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:12.030\nvisual, or video, excuse me,\naudio and video equipment, right.\n\n57\n00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.626\nVery prevalent in using coaxial media.\n\n58\n00:03:14.626 --> 00:03:17.295\nSo, understand that coaxial\nis heavily used, but\n\n59\n00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:20.088\nwhen it comes to your\ninternal land communications,\n\n60\n00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:23.513\nthe most common one is gonna be\nthe twisted pair implementation.\n\n61\n00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:26.460\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more\nabout twisted pair coming up.\n\n62\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.120\nNow when we do mention twisted pair,\nall right,\n\n63\n00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.010\nwell they really boil down to a couple\ndifferent types that we need to look at.\n\n64\n00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.100\nBut let's go ahead and just take\na basic look at what twisted pair and\n\n65\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.950\ncoaxial look, at least from the outside.\n\n66\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.880\nSee, these are two types, right, and they\ndon't real look like anything special.\n\n67\n00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.193\nIn fact, this side here we've what's\nknown as twisted pair implementation, and\n\n68\n00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.610\nwe've got here what's\nknown as the coaxial.\n\n69\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.641\nAnd again, from the outside,\nother than the connectors looking\n\n70\n00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.452\na little bit different,\nif I was to cover up the connectors,\n\n71\n00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:59.060\nthe cables don't really\nlook much different, right.\n\n72\n00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.140\nSo we gotta kinda understand,\nkinda looking at the anatomy\n\n73\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.810\nof the cable to really understand what\nis the difference between these two.\n\n74\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.952\nSo what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna pull the coaxial cable, and\n\n75\n00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:12.928\nwe'll kinda set that to the side for now.\n\n76\n00:04:12.928 --> 00:04:16.318\nAnd we're gonna focus in on\nthe characteristics of a twisted pair\n\n77\n00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:19.831\nimplementation first, and\nthen we'll pull coaxial back there and\n\n78\n00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.640\nwe won't make coaxial so lonely.\n\n79\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.600\nNow if I was to cut these connectors, and\n\n80\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.550\nwe're gonna talk more about\nthe connectors coming up.\n\n81\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.176\nBut if I was to cut the connectors off,\nand\n\n82\n00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:33.978\nI was to pull the ends of the cable off\nand just kinda pull the outside sheath,\n\n83\n00:04:33.978 --> 00:04:39.331\nprotective coating off, you'd see here's\nwhy they call it twisted pair, right.\n\n84\n00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:44.261\nNow don't worry about this plastic piece\nthat's right here, that plastic piece is\n\n85\n00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:49.070\na separator piece and these actually sit\ndown in almost like a cross hair, right.\n\n86\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.030\nThey sit in the four positions right here,\nso we really don't need that right now cuz\n\n87\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.480\nnot all of these cables\nnecessary are gonna have that.\n\n88\n00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.105\nBut what all twisted pair implementations\nhave are twisted pairs, right.\n\n89\n00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:02.175\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If they didn't I guess we would\n\n90\n00:05:02.175 --> 00:05:07.150\njust call them cables [LAUGH] but notice\nthat we four twisted pairs, all right.\n\n91\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.390\nInside of a twisted pair you have eight\ncopper conductors twisted into four pairs.\n\n92\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.810\nBe very, very careful on\nthe exam with your wording.\n\n93\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.522\nI will tell you guys and\ngals out there that wording, keywords,\n\n94\n00:05:20.522 --> 00:05:21.911\nkeywords, keywords.\n\n95\n00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:27.727\nAnd here's what I mean, all right,\non the exam they might say,\n\n96\n00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.839\nhow many copper conductors\nare in the cable.\n\n97\n00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.809\nAnd you're gonna have to\nknow that it's eight, but\n\n98\n00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.606\nthey might say, how may copper\npairs are inside of this cable.\n\n99\n00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:42.980\nAnd then at that point,\nyou're gonna have to know that it's four.\n\n100\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.080\nSo just pay attention to your keyword,\nvery easy questions to come across.\n\n101\n00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.210\nEasy to get right,\n\n102\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.570\nalso easy to kinda over look if\nyou're not paying attention, right.\n\n103\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.340\nSo if we were to take these and\nuntwist these, and\n\n104\n00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.020\nI can tell you that sometimes is a bear.\n\n105\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.850\nSo I went ahead and\ndid that before hand here.\n\n106\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.405\nIf we look at untwisting these,\nyou can now see that we have well,\n\n107\n00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:07.537\nwe have the eight copper pairs, or I'm\nsorry the eight copper conductors here.\n\n108\n00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:09.270\nI gotta be careful with\nmy verbage as well.\n\n109\n00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.395\n[LAUGH] But you notice if we look across,\nand they're all color coded and\n\n110\n00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:16.162\nwe'll come back to why\nthat is here in a second.\n\n111\n00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:20.565\nBut you'll notice we got one, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, eight, right.\n\n112\n00:06:20.565 --> 00:06:24.335\nSo that is your twisted\npair implementation.\n\n113\n00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.696\nNow these twist within the cable,\n\n114\n00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:32.571\nwhat they do is they help to increase its\nimmunity to electromagnetic interference.\n\n115\n00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:38.080\nNow, the better quality of the cable,\nand also the faster the speed\n\n116\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.924\nrequirements, the more twists\nhave to be in these cables.\n\n117\n00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:46.300\nAnd again we'll come back to some\nof those concepts coming up.\n\n118\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.490\nSo that is your twisted\npair implementation,\n\n119\n00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.950\nnow there are also a couple of different\n\n120\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.900\nmedia types that we need to worry about\nwhen it comes to the twisted pair.\n\n121\n00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.697\nNow the twisted pair implementations,\nplease understand ladies and gentlemen,\n\n122\n00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:06.287\nthat yeah, the twisted pairs, the more\ntwists that are in them help to increase\n\n123\n00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:09.806\nit's immunity to electromagnetic\ninterference, right.\n\n124\n00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:13.074\nBut we can also go a little\nbit further than that,\n\n125\n00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:17.505\nwhat you see right here is what is\nknown as a UTP cable, excuse me.\n\n126\n00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:24.680\nA UTP cable is an unshielded twisted pair\nright, and this one doesn't have a shield.\n\n127\n00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.210\nAnd really what do I mean by that?\n\n128\n00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.844\nWell let's go ahead,\n\n129\n00:07:27.844 --> 00:07:33.524\nI've got here I'll pull out here from\nthe side I'll have a STP cable, right.\n\n130\n00:07:33.524 --> 00:07:36.523\nNow we're not talking about a motor oil\nhere, right, [LAUGH] we're not talking\n\n131\n00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:39.182\nabout a company that old Richard Petty\nused to drive for, for a while.\n\n132\n00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:40.220\n&gt;&gt; An additive for my oil.\n\n133\n00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.781\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's exactly it, but\n\n134\n00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:45.330\nwhen you look on the outside they\nreally don't look much different.\n\n135\n00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.720\nNow one of the telltale signs you can tell\nthat this one is a shielded twisted pair\n\n136\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.510\nis because, Zach can you see\nthe difference between those connectors?\n\n137\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.878\nEspecially this one here that\nI'm kinda moving in the light?\n\n138\n00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:58.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the shielded looks like it's\ngot a metal finish or some metal to it.\n\n139\n00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.231\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly it, that's exactly it,\nand what this does is the shielding.\n\n140\n00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:07.426\nHelps to further increase its immunity\nto electromagnetic interference.\n\n141\n00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:11.200\nSo that's one of the telltale signs\nthat this is a shielded twisted pair.\n\n142\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.112\nHowever, again, if we were to strip off\nthe outside insulating jacket here,\n\n143\n00:08:17.112 --> 00:08:22.053\none of the things that we would notice,\nif I could peel this back.\n\n144\n00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:25.960\nI kinda don't wanna break it,\nI want you guys to be able to see it.\n\n145\n00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.730\nLook at the foil, right?\n\n146\n00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.690\n&gt;&gt; Metal foil shielding.\n\n147\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.255\n&gt;&gt; And that is exactly it,\nnail right on the head there, Zach,\n\n148\n00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:34.232\nthat is a foil shielding.\n\n149\n00:08:34.232 --> 00:08:39.995\nAnd what it does is it wraps around\nthese conductors here to increase,\n\n150\n00:08:39.995 --> 00:08:45.210\nto further increase its immunity to\nelectromagnetic interference, right?\n\n151\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.217\nSo that is the difference between\nwhat's known as a UTP cable, right?\n\n152\n00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:54.830\nAn unshielded twisted pair and\na STP cable.\n\n153\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.850\nAgain, now if I was to pull\nthis shield off, right?\n\n154\n00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.440\nAnd you can see there's\nquite a bit of coating here.\n\n155\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.730\nYou can see that there's actually\nthose twisted pairs in here.\n\n156\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.850\nAnd again, they wrap these up pretty\ngood because you pay a good cost, right?\n\n157\n00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.455\nShielded twisted pair's more expensive,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n158\n00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Than unshielded twisted pair.\n\n159\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.410\nUnshielded twisted pair is really,\nreally one of the most common.\n\n160\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.510\nBut there are some times when you\nneed to increase the resistance, or\n\n161\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.900\nthe immunity, I should say,\nto electromagnetic interference.\n\n162\n00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.525\nSo for instance,\nSTP is gonna be run in areas where\n\n163\n00:09:29.525 --> 00:09:32.722\nmaybe your running HVAC systems,\n\n164\n00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:37.917\nyou're running your copper\nmedia next to an elevator.\n\n165\n00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:42.730\nThey give off a lot of electromagnetic\ninterference, water fountains do this.\n\n166\n00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.825\nI mentioned heating, ventilation, and AC.\n\n167\n00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:49.530\nHigh-intensity discharge lamps,\nHID lamps, will also do this.\n\n168\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:55.130\nSo you might need to, again, increase it's\nimmunity to electromagnetic interference.\n\n169\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.461\nSo you might be asking yourself,\nwell, why would I wanna do that?\n\n170\n00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.179\nWell, understand,\nthere is an electric energy\n\n171\n00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:05.340\nthat's your data signal that's coming down\nthis cable from source to destination.\n\n172\n00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.230\nAnd if that interference\ngets into this cable,\n\n173\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.767\nthen it hampers, it hinders the signal.\n\n174\n00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:14.520\nIt damages, can corrupt the signal,\ncause re-transmissions.\n\n175\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.530\nAnd just otherwise, it will degrade\nthe performance of the cable, in general.\n\n176\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.590\nSo that's our twisted\npair implementations.\n\n177\n00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.360\nI know our poor coaxial out here\nis feeling left in the dark.\n\n178\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.559\nWell, you said I was old,\nnow you just get rid of me?\n\n179\n00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.792\n&gt;&gt; Not obsolete.\n\n180\n00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:35.361\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah,\nolder, but not obsolete, so\n\n181\n00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.310\nthis is your coaxial cable here.\n\n182\n00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.716\nAnd again, what you'll see is that, yeah,\nthe connectors are a little bit different.\n\n183\n00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:42.990\nUh-oh, actually, well,\nkinda a lot a bit different here.\n\n184\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.640\nThere again, it just looks like a regular\ncable until we kinda pull the outer\n\n185\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.490\ninsulating jacket off of this.\n\n186\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.550\nAnd you're gonna notice something,\n\n187\n00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.120\nthat this also has a shielding\non the outside of it.\n\n188\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.370\nNow this isn't necessarily a foil.\n\n189\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.861\nThis is what's called braided shielding,\nall right?\n\n190\n00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:02.607\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] yes.\n\n191\n00:11:02.607 --> 00:11:06.945\n&gt;&gt; And I do want you to understand that,\neven in your twisted pair implementations\n\n192\n00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:11.364\nand coaxial, notice that in coaxial,\nthey call it co-ax, co-axis, right?\n\n193\n00:11:11.364 --> 00:11:12.201\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:15.000\n&gt;&gt; We have a single copper conductor.\n\n195\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.570\nAnd then under this braided shielding,\nthere's another layer of foil here, too.\n\n196\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.015\nBut there's also a plastic piece, that\nlittle white piece right there, right?\n\n197\n00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:27.118\nThat is, essentially,\na dielectric coating that goes around and\n\n198\n00:11:27.118 --> 00:11:30.330\nprotects the internal\ncopper conductor here.\n\n199\n00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.570\nBut notice how it's\na solid copper conductor?\n\n200\n00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.290\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\n\n201\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.207\nthis thing's like a needle.\n\n202\n00:11:34.207 --> 00:11:38.055\nWell, I want you to know that there's two\nvariants, of both of these cables, really,\n\n203\n00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:39.700\neven the twisted pair cable.\n\n204\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.036\nThey have what's known as\nstranded twisted pair.\n\n205\n00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd it's not, don't think,\nstranded twisted pair's STP,\n\n206\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.735\njust a form of twisted pair.\n\n207\n00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:50.862\nIt could be stranded or\nit could be a solid conductor.\n\n208\n00:11:50.862 --> 00:11:54.840\nWell, the same thing can happen, too,\nwith your coaxial implementations.\n\n209\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.300\nThis can be a solid conductor or\nit can be a stranded.\n\n210\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.407\nConsider it like braided,\nalmost really fine, kinda like this.\n\n211\n00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:04.943\nIf we were to turn around, and take this\nshielding, and we were to kinda spin it up\n\n212\n00:12:04.943 --> 00:12:08.145\na little bit, it almost looks like\na central copper conductor, right?\n\n213\n00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:12.786\nBut again, that would be the braided or\nstranded copper conductor.\n\n214\n00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:16.856\nAnd again, the shielding on the outside\nof the coaxial cable, what it does is\n\n215\n00:12:16.856 --> 00:12:20.815\nit allows it to, again, protect it\nfrom electromagnetic interference.\n\n216\n00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:24.873\nAnd that's not so much, like I said,\nin your networking applications today.\n\n217\n00:12:24.873 --> 00:12:29.475\nBut definitely when you have things\nlike balanced audio and stuff,\n\n218\n00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:33.592\nyou don't want any extra signal\nbleeding into whatever your\n\n219\n00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:38.420\ncommunications are that are going\ndown the coaxial cable.\n\n220\n00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:45.890\nAll right, so that is a little bit\nabout the two major media types, right?\n\n221\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.530\nNow in your objectives,\n\n222\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.350\none of the things that you might notice is\nthat they say there's three cables, right?\n\n223\n00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.012\nThere's UTP, STP, and coaxial.\n\n224\n00:12:54.012 --> 00:12:56.530\nLet's just go ahead and\nmake it a little bit easier.\n\n225\n00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:01.930\nIf you see the letters, the T and the P,\nthat essentially just means twisted pair.\n\n226\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.580\nAnd what they're telling you is that\nthere's unshielded twisted pair,\n\n227\n00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.130\nshielded twisted pair, and coaxial.\n\n228\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.953\nI try to make it a little bit easier\nespecially cuz here on the Network+ we got\n\n229\n00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:13.180\nso many things that we've gotta memorize.\n\n230\n00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.880\nTry to simplify it a little bit.\n\n231\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.165\nAnd if you know that it's twisted pair and\ncoaxial, once you know the characteristics\n\n232\n00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.580\nof twisted pair, that's ultimately\nwhat it's gonna boil down to.\n\n233\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.690\nNow that brings me to my next concept.\n\n234\n00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.490\nMy next concept is what is known\nas PVC and plenum, all right?\n\n235\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.560\nAnd you might be asking yourself, well,\nespecially if you're maybe a plumber doing\n\n236\n00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.320\na career change and you coming over to IT,\nwell, I know what PVC is, right?\n\n237\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.840\nAnd if you don't, it's polyvinyl chloride.\n\n238\n00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.230\nNow they don't expect you to be\na chemist to go in and pass this exam,\n\n239\n00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.940\nplease understand.\n\n240\n00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.910\nBut what they do want you to know is the\ndifference between a PVC-grade cable and\n\n241\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.510\na plenum-grade cable, all right?\n\n242\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.200\nSo what is a plenum, all right?\n\n243\n00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.680\nDon't worry about the term,\nplenum-grade cable, what is a plenum?\n\n244\n00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.850\nWell, a plenum is like a duct, an air\nduct, it's an air handling space, right?\n\n245\n00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.170\nAnd there are two different kinds.\n\n246\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:09.140\nThere are kinds that you can run in\nthose air handling spaces and risers,\n\n247\n00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.840\nif you will, between floors.\n\n248\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.550\nAnd there are some cables\nthat are PVC which\n\n249\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.810\nare not rated to be allowed\nto be put in those air ducts,\n\n250\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.200\nin those air handling systems and\nthen go between floors.\n\n251\n00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.130\nThey can only be used for general\nwiring purposes, and that's the PVC.\n\n252\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.800\nWell, why is that?\n\n253\n00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.047\nWhy would we use PVC for\ngeneral building purposes, but\n\n254\n00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:32.890\nwe're gonna use plenum\nin air handling spaces?\n\n255\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.646\nAnd this is what boils down to fire,\nall right?\n\n256\n00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:43.820\nNow what I mean fire is, for PVC, PVC,\nit gives off a toxic gas when it's burned.\n\n257\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.450\nThe other thing, too, is PVC-grade\ncabling, that outer jacket that we were\n\n258\n00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.973\ntalking about, if we can go back\nto the sky cam for a second.\n\n259\n00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:55.620\nWhat we're really talking about\nis the jacketing, itself, Zach.\n\n260\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.014\nWe're not talking about\nthe conductors inside.\n\n261\n00:14:58.014 --> 00:14:59.378\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We're not even talking about if\n\n262\n00:14:59.378 --> 00:15:00.679\nyou happen to have one of these spacers.\n\n263\n00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:03.454\nBut we're talking about the jacketing,\nitself, all right?\n\n264\n00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:06.131\nAnd when you have non,\nyou can almost see it there.\n\n265\n00:15:06.131 --> 00:15:07.734\nSee that little space right there, right?\n\n266\n00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:08.474\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n267\n00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:12.650\n&gt;&gt; You can see, when you have\na non-plenum-grade cable, right?\n\n268\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.997\nWhen you have what's known as PVC,\n\n269\n00:15:15.997 --> 00:15:20.468\nwell, when it burns,\nit gives off a toxic gas.\n\n270\n00:15:20.468 --> 00:15:26.350\nAnd it also allows fire to travel through\nthat little air space that's there.\n\n271\n00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.070\nSo we wouldn't wanna run this in\na location on the interior portions of\n\n272\n00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.330\nour building, right, from an architectural\nlevel, across firebreak walls.\n\n273\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.900\nNot firewalls, but\nfirebreak walls, all right?\n\n274\n00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.960\nThe other thing that we wouldn't wanna do\nis we wouldn't wanna have these in any\n\n275\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.755\nof those air handling spaces.\n\n276\n00:15:45.755 --> 00:15:47.030\n&gt;&gt; Hm.\n&gt;&gt; Why?\n\n277\n00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.280\nBecause PVC, when burned,\nas a recap, gives off a toxic gas.\n\n278\n00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.280\nSo if it's burned, it's gonna start\npoisoning people that are in the building.\n\n279\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.217\nLet alone the people that are coming\nto get you out of the building,\n\n280\n00:15:58.217 --> 00:16:00.969\nour fire rescuers out there, firefighters.\n\n281\n00:16:00.969 --> 00:16:03.724\nAnd allowing that fire to\ntravel throughout the cable,\n\n282\n00:16:03.724 --> 00:16:05.430\nit's almost like a wick.\n\n283\n00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.431\nReally is what it comes down to.\n\n284\n00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:07.316\n&gt;&gt; That's what it sounds like.\n\n285\n00:16:07.316 --> 00:16:12.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's why you\nuse plenum grade, all right.\n\n286\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.410\nPlenum grade cabling, plenum.\n\n287\n00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.295\nIt just means, if you understand,\nthat's an air-handling space.\n\n288\n00:16:18.295 --> 00:16:20.836\nIf they say plenum grade cabling,\n\n289\n00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:26.179\nthe plenum grade cabling they do\na really good job of, as they design it,\n\n290\n00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:30.907\nas they engineer it,\nthey engineer that coding to be very very,\n\n291\n00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:34.560\nwell, fire proof or\nvery very fire resistant.\n\n292\n00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.360\n&gt;&gt; Fire retardant.\n\n293\n00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah exactly, absolutely, and also very\nlow toxins, right, very very low toxins.\n\n294\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.390\nSo it doesn't give off a toxic\ngas if it happens to be burnt.\n\n295\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:49.660\nSo according to your building code your\nfire marshal might come through as part of\n\n296\n00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.090\nyour building inspection if\nyou're running cables and say,\n\n297\n00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.630\nokay, I noticed that you've got a heating\nand ventilation duct that's going here.\n\n298\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.440\nI notice that you've got this fire break\nwall that doesn't allow fire to pass\n\n299\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.870\nthrough between building spaces.\n\n300\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.960\nAnd according to the fire code,\nyou have to run plenum grade cable there.\n\n301\n00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.486\nNow if you're watching at home or\nif you're watching at work there and\n\n302\n00:17:10.486 --> 00:17:11.859\nyou look over at the wall and\n\n303\n00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:16.160\nyou see the little cable that's coming out\nof the wall, out of the little port there,\n\n304\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.374\nlittle jack on the wall coming in\nthe back of your work station.\n\n305\n00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:23.870\nThat is a PVC based cable, right,\ncuz we're not worried about that.\n\n306\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.510\nIf you have a cable that essentially\nis coming out of the wall and\n\n307\n00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.419\ngoing under cubicles, right, and running\ninto the back of your computers in your\n\n308\n00:17:31.419 --> 00:17:34.240\nlittle cubicles, now that's gonna\nbe a PVC grade cable, right.\n\n309\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.900\nIt's not in plenums.\n\n310\n00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.540\nIt's not in those ducts, so\nwe don't have to worry about that.\n\n311\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.200\nBut however, when you do have that,\nyou have to run those.\n\n312\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.536\nNow the question is with all of this\ninformation, right, yes, you need to\n\n313\n00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:54.900\nknow it for the exam, but how are we gonna\nknow what we have and what we don't have?\n\n314\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.460\nWell thank goodness the vendors make it\na little bit easier for us to understand\n\n315\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.830\nwhat we are buying when we buy it\nby doing a little bit of labeling\n\n316\n00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.300\non the outside of the boxes that when\nthey distribute, if you will, the wires.\n\n317\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.540\nSo let's go ahead and let's see that looks\nlike, and we'll take a look at that next.\n\n318\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.610\nSo we've got an example of\na couple different vendors,\n\n319\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.430\nright, you can see Monoprice and\nyou can see Mohawk here as well.\n\n320\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.490\nJust to kinda show you\na couple of vendors.\n\n321\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.220\nAgain, we're not certifying any\none vendor over the other, but\n\n322\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.890\nagain, we use quite a few\ndifferent vendors here at ITProTV.\n\n323\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.680\nSo these are cables that we actually have\nrunning right now in this building, right.\n\n324\n00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.800\nI mean, we've made these cables here.\n\n325\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.230\nAnd if you'll right here,\n\n326\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.570\nZach, in fact you've pointed this out\noff camera when we were talking and\n\n327\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.290\nit was right there in front of my face\naand I don't know why I didn't notice it.\n\n328\n00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:46.120\nZach and I were talking and he goes,\nwell Wes, UTP is right there at the top.\n\n329\n00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.420\nAnd I'm looking down here at this\nlittle check mark, right, and\n\n330\n00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.540\nyeah, it was right there.\n\n331\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.880\nI'm glad it wasn't a rattlesnake,\nI would've been dead.\n\n332\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.050\n&gt;&gt; Unshielded twisted pair.\n\n333\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nnotice that we've got some markings here.\n\n334\n00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.360\nSometimes you'll have a marking,\nright, you'll see UTP STP.\n\n335\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.150\nSo guess what?\n\n336\n00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.760\nThere's our whether it's\nunshielded twisted pair,\n\n337\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.400\nlike Zach just mentioned, or STP,\nagain, shielded twisted pair.\n\n338\n00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.675\nThis is a special one and I don't want you\nguys to worry about this one for the exam.\n\n339\n00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.145\nFTP, we're not talking about\nfile transfer protocol, but\n\n340\n00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:20.755\nthis is actually something that goes\neven farther than STP, all right.\n\n341\n00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:23.845\nWhen we talked about the other one,\nwhen we talked about STP, notice one of\n\n342\n00:19:23.845 --> 00:19:30.200\nthe things that we mentioned was that it\nshields the outside of the twisted pairs.\n\n343\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.750\nWhen you actually have what's\nknown as screen foil twisted pair,\n\n344\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.640\nI've seen shielded foil twisted pair.\n\n345\n00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.290\nAnd however they label it, what this does\nis this goes a step further by not only\n\n346\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.490\nputting a shield around all the twisted\npairs but each one of the individual four\n\n347\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.660\npairs, if I got them out, they each\nhave shields around each one of them.\n\n348\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.095\nAnd then they wrap everything like\nthe shielded twisted pairs, so\n\n349\n00:19:55.095 --> 00:19:56.777\nit goes even farther than that.\n\n350\n00:19:56.777 --> 00:19:59.320\nAnd that's a very,\nvery expensive cable and\n\n351\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.380\nI've actually talked to some network\ntechs who were basically architects,\n\n352\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.260\nthey build the network\nliterally from the ground up.\n\n353\n00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.129\nAnd they said at this point when you have\nthat much concern about electromagnetic\n\n354\n00:20:12.129 --> 00:20:16.854\ninterference, you might actually save\nmoney, or maybe not even save money,\n\n355\n00:20:16.854 --> 00:20:21.222\nbut it might be more beneficial to\nactually get away from copper media and\n\n356\n00:20:21.222 --> 00:20:22.684\nlay fiber optic cable.\n\n357\n00:20:22.684 --> 00:20:23.650\n&gt;&gt; Fiber optic, yeah.\n\n358\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.370\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you're kind of immune to\nelectromagnetic interference cuz we're\n\n359\n00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.820\nusing an optical light source,\nbut don't worry about that one.\n\n360\n00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.150\nBut we won't leave you hanging,\nWe'll tell you what that FTP is.\n\n361\n00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.608\nIt doesn't mean file transfer protocol.\n\n362\n00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.260\nAll right Zach, so\none of the things that I see,\n\n363\n00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.530\nI see all of the things that\nwe've talked about, right.\n\n364\n00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.720\nI see UTP, right, and\nhere's the solid versus stranded.\n\n365\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.080\nNotice it says the conductor type here,\nsolid versus stranded.\n\n366\n00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.350\nWell that's something that's very,\n\n367\n00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.120\nvery important to us in\ncertain applications as well.\n\n368\n00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.140\nBut there's one thing that I\ndon't see up here, all right.\n\n369\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.090\nOne thing that I don't see is,\nwell where do they mention PVC, all right?\n\n370\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.680\nWell they don't, all right.\n\n371\n00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.580\nAnd that's one of the things that I want\nyou to know is a little bit different\n\n372\n00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.320\nbetween a certification exam and what you\nmight see in the real world, all right.\n\n373\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.030\nNotice non plenum, right.\n\n374\n00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.833\nIt is telling us that, yeah exactly, we\ncould put a sticker right over this that\n\n375\n00:21:14.833 --> 00:21:18.145\nsays PVC essentially and\nit would mean the same thing.\n\n376\n00:21:18.145 --> 00:21:21.600\nWhen you're buying these they don't say\npolyvinyl chloride on the side of them,\n\n377\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.510\nthey say non plenum.\n\n378\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.200\nAnd what they're letting you know is that\nyou don't run this in plenums, right,\n\n379\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.490\nit's important.\n\n380\n00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.810\nVery very important.\n\n381\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.650\nNow you can go a little bit farther,\nnot something at all that's gonna\n\n382\n00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.610\nbe on the exam, but you can go a little\nbit further here with the type.\n\n383\n00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.640\nWe've got a few different types here.\n\n384\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.284\nYou'll see CM, CMR, CMP, and then the CMX.\n\n385\n00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:51.373\nAnd honestly I'm not really sure, I can't\nremember what the CMX actually stands for.\n\n386\n00:21:51.373 --> 00:21:54.660\nBut what these stand for,\nthey're actually NEC,\n\n387\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.020\nNational Electronic Code or\nelectrical code specifications, and\n\n388\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.600\nthey're published by\nthe National Fire Protection Agency.\n\n389\n00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.710\nAnd they're the ones that certify these.\n\n390\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.120\nHey, if it's plenum grade then\nit can be used in plenum.\n\n391\n00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.612\nObviously if it's not\nit's not it's non plenum.\n\n392\n00:22:11.612 --> 00:22:17.265\nBut most of them will have some kind\nof basic UL listing even if it's basic,\n\n393\n00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:21.342\nand you can see there's\na UL listing right here.\n\n394\n00:22:21.342 --> 00:22:26.220\nBut CM if you will,\nthese are the cables that are used for\n\n395\n00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.340\ngeneral wiring purposes, all right.\n\n396\n00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.256\nThese are used basically connecting and\n\n397\n00:22:31.256 --> 00:22:35.969\nrunning through your drop ceilings\nif you will on a single floor,\n\n398\n00:22:35.969 --> 00:22:41.554\nthey're used essentially in area other\nthan plenum and risers, all right.\n\n399\n00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:42.313\nNow the CMR,\n\n400\n00:22:42.313 --> 00:22:46.540\nlet's just focus on the single letters\nhere that are different from CM.\n\n401\n00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.140\nR means riser, all right,\n\n402\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.280\nwhen we say riser I want you to\nthink floor to floor, all right.\n\n403\n00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.737\nSo if I've got a multi-floor building,\n\n404\n00:22:54.737 --> 00:22:59.790\nwell I can't use the CM to run\nvertical runs between floors.\n\n405\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:05.150\nI have to use a CMR, or\nCM riser grade cable,\n\n406\n00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:11.100\nbecause what it does is it's engineered to\nprevent floor to floor fire spread, right.\n\n407\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.707\nAnd that's what that is, they're used\nbasically in vertical shaft applications.\n\n408\n00:23:14.707 --> 00:23:16.740\n&gt;&gt; So does CMR then mean that it's plenum?\n\n409\n00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.526\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's not plenum, but\n\n410\n00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.403\nit does share some of-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n411\n00:23:20.403 --> 00:23:22.390\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, Zach.\n\n412\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.410\nIt's not plenum,\nwhich is a little confusing, but it does\n\n413\n00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:31.073\nhave fire resistant properties, right,\nso it can be used in vertical shafts.\n\n414\n00:23:31.073 --> 00:23:37.250\nNow, all right, let's go ahead kinda put\nthe cart in front of the horse there.\n\n415\n00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.430\nGuess what the next one is?\n\n416\n00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.903\nSo if CMR stands for riser,\nwhat do you think the CMP stands for?\n\n417\n00:23:44.903 --> 00:23:45.899\n&gt;&gt; Plenum!\n\n418\n00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:47.578\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and that's what that is.\n\n419\n00:23:47.578 --> 00:23:49.390\nThe P stands for plenum.\n\n420\n00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.989\nSo if this would have a mark right here it\nwould let me know that that actually is,\n\n421\n00:23:52.989 --> 00:23:56.882\neven though it doesn't say plenum on it,\nthat it's a plenum grade cabling, right.\n\n422\n00:23:56.882 --> 00:24:00.232\nAnd these cables essentially\nare engineered for fire resistant,\n\n423\n00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:02.120\nlow smoke, if you will.\n\n424\n00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.082\nToxin producing character.\n\n425\n00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:08.330\nYou know, again, low smoke,\nlow toxin, producing characteristics.\n\n426\n00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.180\nAnd they're used for\n\n427\n00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.100\nduct work, plenum applications without\nthe use of any kind of conduit.\n\n428\n00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.480\nSo that would be another way but\nwe can see a plenum grade cable being\n\n429\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.330\nmarked right there and honestly I\ncan't remember for the life of me.\n\n430\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.320\nThese aren't gonna be on the exam but\nat least you kinda have an idea.\n\n431\n00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.310\nIf you are taking this exam and\n\n432\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:29.520\nturn around maybe you're\ngonna be a cable layer right?\n\n433\n00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.010\nMaybe you need to know\nthis is part of your job.\n\n434\n00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.100\nIt's definitely going to help you\nout in the real world as well.\n\n435\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.130\nNow the AWG, you might see that a lot,\n\n436\n00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.880\nin fact you will see that a lot, that's\nwhat's known, it's another standard.\n\n437\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.600\nIt's called American Wire Gauge and 23.\n\n438\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.280\nSo the number the numerical\nvalue that's before it\n\n439\n00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.960\nthey start all the way from like\ntriple lot zero to a four zeros.\n\n440\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.630\nThe three zeros we've got any of you\nout there that in the body piercing.\n\n441\n00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.328\nIt's interesting [LAUGH] that the body\npiercing gauges also follow the American\n\n442\n00:25:05.328 --> 00:25:07.480\nwire gauge standard, right?\n\n443\n00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.220\nSo the higher the gauge, and I probably\njust catered to an audience that now knows\n\n444\n00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.080\nright away if I've got\na 23 gauge ear piercing,\n\n445\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.030\nthat's gonna be a smaller diameter\nthan a ten gauge piercing.\n\n446\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.020\n[LAUGH] So another way that you can\nlook at it, the higher the number\n\n447\n00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.140\nbasically saying, you know, it denotes\na decrease in the wire gauge side.\n\n448\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.300\nSo that's a little bit about\nthe twisted pair implementations and\n\n449\n00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.570\nit is important to know\nsome of these standards.\n\n450\n00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:40.320\nYou know, it comes down to what our\nstandards are very very important.\n\n451\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.490\nWe've got to know what's\ngoing on with these Cables.\n\n452\n00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:46.150\nThe last one that I might\njust kind of throw in here.\n\n453\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:50.400\nWell you will see here kind of\nmoving in the background here.\n\n454\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.910\nWhat we've got,\nthis is co-axial cable right?\n\n455\n00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.610\nAnd it's just coming in on a spool and\nit's kind of hard to see.\n\n456\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.910\nAnd I'm not going to try to\nmake you guys blind out there.\n\n457\n00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.870\nBut what you could see on the side\nhere is it tells you about the cable,\n\n458\n00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.970\nit tells you what the cable is and we're\ngonna get into that a little bit more.\n\n459\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.420\nBut this is, essentially, the spool and\nthey all differ a little bit, right?\n\n460\n00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.300\nI've got another coaxial cable spool\n\n461\n00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.130\nnext to our server closet that's\nactually blue and it's coaxial.\n\n462\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.540\nAnd it has another set of stickers\nthat it's on top of it and\n\n463\n00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.240\nit lets you know what the cable types are.\n\n464\n00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:33.270\nSo very, very good way that we\nneed to know what the cable is.\n\n465\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.490\nWell you can look on the side f the box,\nso you know what choices to make, and\n\n466\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.090\nagain, you can see here that this is\nbasically marked, its another way.\n\n467\n00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.780\nIt doesn't say CMR, but\nyou see that it says riser, so\n\n468\n00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.100\nI know that it is a CMR grade cable, and\nagain it is used for vertical shaft,\n\n469\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.170\nbasically floor to floor structured\ncabling, so very easy way to\n\n470\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:27:01.920\ntell what it is that you have when you\nhave to follow your building codes.\n\n471\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.665\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, as we move on here,\nI have one question.\n\n472\n00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:05.925\nPVC vs plenum.\n\n473\n00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:10.185\nIs it plenum cable stiffer,\nmaybe harder to work with?\n\n474\n00:27:10.185 --> 00:27:11.005\nAm I wrong?\n\n475\n00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:13.805\n&gt;&gt; No you are absolutely right and\nI'm glad you mentioned it cuz I would\n\n476\n00:27:13.805 --> 00:27:17.025\nhave forgot because when we were comparing\nPVC to plenum one of the things that I\n\n477\n00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:19.582\nsaid is that\n&gt;&gt; with that PVC cable I could\n\n478\n00:27:19.582 --> 00:27:20.912\nhave bent the cable to the side and\n\n479\n00:27:20.912 --> 00:27:23.092\nI showed you there was a little\nbit of an opening there.\n\n480\n00:27:23.092 --> 00:27:29.992\nWell not only does the Plenum grade\ncable produce no toxins at all and\n\n481\n00:27:29.992 --> 00:27:35.530\nlow low smoke,\nthe other thing too is that outer jacket\n\n482\n00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.430\nTightly conformed tightly wraps around\nthose central copper conductors so\n\n483\n00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.370\nit doesn't air to pass through,\nit doesn't allow air to travel through it.\n\n484\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.120\nWhich prevents or\nincreases the fire resistance right?\n\n485\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.700\nLike you said fire retarding if you will.\n\n486\n00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.840\nDecreases its ability to allow fire\nto propagate through the cable.\n\n487\n00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Like the PVC ones will as well.\n\n488\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.680\nNow we've just scratched the surface\nwith the copper types right?\n\n489\n00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.160\nBut I'm looking at the clock there and\n\n490\n00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.970\nI can see Zack saying at the side we might\nhave to put a comma in this episode.\n\n491\n00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.980\n&gt;&gt; We're going to have to\nput a comma in this episode.\n\n492\n00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.960\nTabling solutions copper\npart two coming your way.\n\n493\n00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.990\nPart one was awesome.\n\n494\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.680\nWonderful job.\n\n495\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.520\nWe're gonna cover things like cabling\ncopper connectors, things like that, and\n\n496\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.730\nso much more.\n\n497\n00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.110\nMake sure you check that out.\n\n498\n00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.350\nAnd see every episode of\nthe CompTIA Net series.\n\n499\n00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.560\nWe'll be very happy about that.\n\n500\n00:28:30.560 -->

watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:13.577\n&gt;&gt; Hello, you're watching ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:16.440\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.066\nI'm your host, Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net+ and\n\n7\n00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.200\nthis is Cabling Solutions-Copper Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.240\nAnd the person bringing us the information\nwe need is the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.290\nWes good to see you again sir,\nI applaud you already.\n\n10\n00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for\nhaving me back Zach that's right we've got\n\n11\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.260\nmore to talk about when it\ncomes to cabling solutions.\n\n12\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900\nBecause as you've seen well,\n\n13\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.800\nwe did pretty much a part one on just\na couple of different types of cables.\n\n14\n00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.100\nSo in the last episode we looked at\nthings like the unshielded twisted pair,\n\n15\n00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.400\nshielded twist pair,\ntalked a little bit about coaxial and\n\n16\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.870\nalso talked about\nthe difference between PVC and.\n\n17\n00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.960\nSo if you're not aware of\nthose standards go back and\n\n18\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.820\ncheck them and then come back to part two.\n\n19\n00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.520\n&gt;&gt; So now that we've talked about some\nof the copper media types what about\n\n20\n00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.164\ncopper media connectors for\nthe copper media types.\n\n21\n00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:02.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Perfect right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.190\nWe've got the cables.\n\n23\n00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.700\nNow we gotta have something\nto connect to those cables.\n\n24\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.450\nWe have to make connections.\n\n25\n00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.360\nCause, think about it,\n\n26\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.000\nwe don't just have loose cables,\nwe're gonna plug them in something.\n\n27\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.680\nWell, the connectors are those plugs\nthat we plug into ports and they\n\n28\n00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.110\ndefinitely have some different types that\nthey want you to be aware of on the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.300\nSo over here we have on the desk we've\nactually got three of them already ready\n\n30\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.020\nand I know it doesn't really look\nlike there's three of them here.\n\n31\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.330\nBut we've got one of\nthe ones that they call out.\n\n32\n00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.170\nSo if we can kinda zoom in\njust a little bit to this one,\n\n33\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.220\nthis is what's known as a BNC connector.\n\n34\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.840\nNow the BNC connector goes into\nthe back of the coaxial cable.\n\n35\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.480\nAnd I'm not sure because it's\na little dark down in there,\n\n36\n00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.570\nbut you'll see that there's\na center post right here.\n\n37\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.375\nYou know that center post actually what's\ngoing to happen is your coaxial cable\n\n38\n00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.004\nslides into the back of that and\nyou'll crimp it down.\n\n39\n00:01:53.004 --> 00:02:00.170\nAnd the copper conductor will make\na connection into this center post here.\n\n40\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.930\nNow, this is what's known as a twist to\nlock connector, now it's just gonna keep\n\n41\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.080\non twisting here because it's\nnot ready to be used yet.\n\n42\n00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.430\nBut it twists and it locks into place.\n\n43\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.040\nSo we make a connection,\nwe twist it and it locks.\n\n44\n00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.168\nSo it's a pretty connectory,\nit will hold up.\n\n45\n00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:24.643\nThis is definitely a good things like\nwhen we need coaxial implementations and\n\n46\n00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:29.117\nyou don't want them vibrating out of\nthrough vibration, you don't want them\n\n47\n00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:33.155\nwalking out and kind of creeping\nright out of their connection point.\n\n48\n00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:37.388\nSo that's one of the the coaxial\nconnectors that we want you to be aware\n\n49\n00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:38.820\nof for the exam.\n\n50\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.620\nNow, the other one that we have\nis what is known as an RJ45 jack.\n\n51\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.050\nThe RJ45 jack, also called two zag,\nis kinda interesting.\n\n52\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.720\nIt's also called an 8P8C connector and\nthat's because inside of\n\n53\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.970\nthe twisted pair implementation\nwe have eight copper conductors.\n\n54\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Pins right?\n\n55\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.720\n&gt;&gt; And then on this you can see that and\n\n56\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.950\nif you were to count these you could see\nthat there were eight copper pins here.\n\n57\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.715\nSo eight conductors eight pins, 8P8C.\n\n58\n00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:12.685\nSo this is the registered jack 45,\nas it's called.\n\n59\n00:03:12.685 --> 00:03:15.155\nAnd registered jack is\nactually a standard.\n\n60\n00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:20.415\nAnd then the numerical\ndesignation kinda tells you\n\n61\n00:03:20.415 --> 00:03:25.572\nwhat the rectangular pattern is\ngoing to be on these connectors.\n\n62\n00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:31.052\nNow this is actually connected, this\ntype of cable is actually one of those\n\n63\n00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:36.022\ninteroperability, it's one of those cables\nthat connects you to legacy devices.\n\n64\n00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:40.782\nBecause one of the connector types\nthat they talk about on the exam is,\n\n65\n00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:44.190\nwell, it's what's known\nas a DB-9 connector.\n\n66\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.310\nAnd if I keep that just there, you can\nsee that there's actually nine pins.\n\n67\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.315\nWell DB-9 sub miniature,\nI've heard it called two 9 or\n\n68\n00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.460\nI've heard it even called 9 pin connector.\n\n69\n00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.985\nThis is actually goes back\nto our serial connections.\n\n70\n00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.335\nOur serial ports.\n\n71\n00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:01.555\nAnd this is the nine pin side.\n\n72\n00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:03.475\nI'll show you the other\none coming up here.\n\n73\n00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:06.205\nBut this is actually a console cable.\n\n74\n00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:10.695\nThis is really,\nwhen you look at the DB-9, and the DB-25.\n\n75\n00:04:10.695 --> 00:04:14.262\nThis would be things like, what is it?\n\n76\n00:04:14.262 --> 00:04:19.531\nThe RS-232 null modem cables.\n\n77\n00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:23.778\nAnd these were for making point-to-point\nconnections when you weren't actually\n\n78\n00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:25.760\nconnecting to a connectivity device.\n\n79\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.100\nI know it's a little redundant.\n\n80\n00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.983\nWhen you needed to do a point-to-point\nconnection, what you would do is\n\n81\n00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:36.963\nyou plug the DB-9, for instance would\ngo into the back of your computer.\n\n82\n00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:42.610\nAnd then the other 25 pin would\nplug in to like say the switch.\n\n83\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.873\nAnd then you could configure it and\nyou'd make a point-to-point connection.\n\n84\n00:04:46.873 --> 00:04:51.546\nLike I said this is actually a connection\ntype that would plug into the back of one\n\n85\n00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:55.939\nof those older laptops if it had a serial\nport on it you don't really see that\n\n86\n00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.084\ntoo much anymore.\n\n87\n00:04:57.084 --> 00:05:00.162\nSo I've actually seen this\nwhere this would be an adaptor,\n\n88\n00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:03.670\nthere'd be an adaptor put on here and\nit'd run to USB.\n\n89\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.170\nAnd the you plug the USB in and then you\nplug the Ethernet port into the switch.\n\n90\n00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.790\nAnd the earlier days,\nwhat they would have though,\n\n91\n00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.220\nthese doesn't have the Ethernet port on.\n\n92\n00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.260\nWhat they actually have is a 25\npin connector on the other side.\n\n93\n00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.820\n&gt;&gt; And the 25 pin connector, yeah.\n\n94\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.670\n&gt;&gt; Right and in fact, you know, I don't\nhave anything to really show you but as\n\n95\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.200\nfar as we wanna give you as much tangible\nstuff that you can kinda see here.\n\n96\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.290\nUnfortunately because it is\nkind of a legacy connector,\n\n97\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.210\nI don't really have any of these cables.\n\n98\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.720\nI think one of the oldest cable I've got\naround here is one of the old printer\n\n99\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.700\nparallel old Centronix connector.\n\n100\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.790\nBut I've actually got a picture\non my computer here and\n\n101\n00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.260\nI'll show you the 25 pin side of this and\nthis is.\n\n102\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.520\n&gt;&gt; Back in the old days.\n\n103\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah absolutely and\n\n104\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.690\nwhat this would do is this would connect\ninto the back of your device there.\n\n105\n00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.420\nSo you'd have the DB-9 like we've\nalready showed you on the one side, and\n\n106\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.920\nthen that would run around\ninto a 25 pin connector.\n\n107\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.470\nYou can see these for old console\nconnectors connecting into a switch.\n\n108\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.900\nRS-232 null modem cable.\n\n109\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.720\nAgain, when you needed to make\na point-to-point connection between\n\n110\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.180\ntwo endpoints and you didn't want\nto connect into like a modem.\n\n111\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.230\nIt's called a null modem cable because it\nsimulates the presence of a modem without\n\n112\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.180\nthe modem actually being there.\n\n113\n00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.830\nThat isn't all that they call out that's\nkind of and some of it's a legacy,\n\n114\n00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.020\nsome of it's is just the fact that\nI don't have it laying around.\n\n115\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.100\nAnd the other one is what is\nknown as an F-type connector.\n\n116\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.541\nAnd this goes to BMC.\n\n117\n00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:31.147\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n118\n00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:32.380\nyou can see that straight post there.\n\n119\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.970\nSome of you, well I'll say most of you but\na lot of you out there are probably\n\n120\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.770\nmaybe even viewing us through your\ninternet table, right, cable internet.\n\n121\n00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.890\nYou got your cable television,\nmaybe your phone if you will,\n\n122\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.650\nthen you've got your cable internet.\n\n123\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.280\nWell if you got high speed cable internet\nthen you probably have a cable modem.\n\n124\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.986\nSomewhere in your house and what you'll\nsee is you'll see a coaxial cable\n\n125\n00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:59.171\ncoming out of the wall and then it'll have\nthe threaded F-type connector that just\n\n126\n00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:01.230\nscrews right into the back of the modem.\n\n127\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.210\nAnd that's really\nthe difference between the BNC,\n\n128\n00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.380\nthe BNC has got different\nnames that they call it.\n\n129\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.410\nBayonet Neill-Concelman connector\nis one of the more common ones.\n\n130\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.450\nBritish naval connector,\nI've heard it called as well.\n\n131\n00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.618\nThere's debate out there\nof which one is which.\n\n132\n00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:17.130\nBut Bayonet Neill-Concelman\nif I'm saying that last one,\n\n133\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.580\nI don't know if it's conculment or\nconculment.\n\n134\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.710\nBut bayonet, right?\n\n135\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.530\nWhat's a bayonet?\n\n136\n00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.068\nStraight post, single post, and\nthat's where it gets it's name.\n\n137\n00:07:26.068 --> 00:07:29.880\nAgain, the F-type connector that\nwe see here, this is just a screw\n\n138\n00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.640\non connector that would go into the back\nof things like your cable modems.\n\n139\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.840\nNow the other one that I don't\nhave on me is because well,\n\n140\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.380\nI'm fresh out of dial-up machines\nthat are running around here.\n\n141\n00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.260\n&gt;&gt; You got mail.\n\n142\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n143\n00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.360\nThe old AOL,\n[LAUGH] when we have dial-up connection,\n\n144\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.850\nwe use what's known as a RJ,\nregistered jack, just like the RJ45.\n\n145\n00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.180\nBut we use a smaller one.\n\n146\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.713\nIt's actually called a 4P4C connector.\n\n147\n00:07:57.713 --> 00:08:01.194\nAnd its called a 4P4C because guess what,\nit's four conductors,\n\n148\n00:08:01.194 --> 00:08:03.784\nyou probably already guessed and\nit's four pins.\n\n149\n00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:06.736\nIn fact,\nI got an example of one right here And\n\n150\n00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:11.030\nit's interesting because this\nis actually a 6P6C connector.\n\n151\n00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.606\nBut if you'll notice on\nthis other side here,\n\n152\n00:08:13.606 --> 00:08:18.180\nthere's only four of the pins that\nare actually being used, right.\n\n153\n00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.586\nAnd that would be your\ntraditional modem cables, right.\n\n154\n00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.910\nAnd some of you've probably\nhave used dial-up.\n\n155\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.690\nMaybe some of you are still using dial-up,\nright.\n\n156\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.110\nI know some people I've had ask me,\nthey say, Wes,\n\n157\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.400\nreally you've got such a legacy\ntechnology on the exam.\n\n158\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.710\nThere's nothing legacy about dial-up.\n\n159\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.570\nEspecially in disaster recovery sites\nwhere you have things like natural\n\n160\n00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.940\ndisasters, hurricanes.\n\n161\n00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.441\nAnd I certainly don't want to\ntouch on a sore subject right now.\n\n162\n00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:49.866\nLiving here in Florida, we're in 2017.\n\n163\n00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:54.183\nAnd we've had a couple of pretty bad\nhurricanes that have hit the islands and\n\n164\n00:08:54.183 --> 00:08:59.150\nsome of the countries, if you will,\njust, what would it be, southeast of us.\n\n165\n00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.788\nAnd these people are in bad\nshape right now, right.\n\n166\n00:09:01.788 --> 00:09:03.923\nWell, what typically exists, right?\n\n167\n00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:07.771\nYou might have large portions\nof networks and telco providers,\n\n168\n00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.350\nlike switched networks, that will fail.\n\n169\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.880\nBut there's a lot of PSTN lines out there,\npublic switch telephone network lines,\n\n170\n00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.890\nright, because they're very prevalent,\nthey've been around since, what,\n\n171\n00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.490\nthe late 1800s.\n\n172\n00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.050\nSo they're well established.\n\n173\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.810\nSo don't think that dial-up is\nsomething that you won't see.\n\n174\n00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.616\nMaybe you don't use it.\n\n175\n00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:30.174\nBut if you're a field technician,\nor if you're working maybe for\n\n176\n00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:33.287\nan insurance company that has\nto go into these sites to do,\n\n177\n00:09:33.287 --> 00:09:37.301\ndisaster recovery sites, you might be\nthe one bringing in banks of modem.\n\n178\n00:09:37.301 --> 00:09:42.325\nSo know that dial-up [LAUGH] isn't dead,\neven though most of us wouldn't be caught\n\n179\n00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:46.947\ndead using it if we were trying to browse\nthe Internet because you remember.\n\n180\n00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:48.551\nYou load up a webpage.\n\n181\n00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:50.036\nYou leave for a day, and come back, and\n\n182\n00:09:50.036 --> 00:09:52.017\nhalf of it's been rendered\nby the time you get back.\n\n183\n00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:56.159\nSo dial-up is something that\nwe need to be aware of, right.\n\n184\n00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:00.990\nSo we've looked at media types,\nright, we look at connector types.\n\n185\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.010\nThese are important things,\n\n186\n00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.860\nthe anatomy of the cable itself as\nwell as the connectors on the end.\n\n187\n00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.580\n&gt;&gt; So then the next question would\nbe are there industry standards for\n\n188\n00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.930\ncopper cable standards?\n\n189\n00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.433\n&gt;&gt; There are.\n\n190\n00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:17.067\nIf there weren't, like we've talked\nabout in other episodes where we were\n\n191\n00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:19.072\nmentioned in some of the theory, right.\n\n192\n00:10:19.072 --> 00:10:20.455\nWe mentioned the OSI model.\n\n193\n00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:23.104\nAnd I know it's a lot of theory,\nladies and gentlemen, out there.\n\n194\n00:10:23.104 --> 00:10:26.756\nBut keep in mind that one of the reasons\nwe want standardization is so\n\n195\n00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:29.142\nthat we get things like interoperability.\n\n196\n00:10:29.142 --> 00:10:32.805\nOne of the reasons the OSI model came\nout by the International Organization of\n\n197\n00:10:32.805 --> 00:10:36.016\nStandardization back in 84 was because,\nin those earlier days,\n\n198\n00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:38.520\neverybody had the latest and\ngreatest technology.\n\n199\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.826\nEverybody was using a little bit of this,\na little bit of that.\n\n200\n00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:45.339\nAnd the problem was if you were\nusing a certain networking type,\n\n201\n00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:47.300\nyou'd get vendor locked, right.\n\n202\n00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.204\nSo the IEEE sits down, and they say,\nhey, we're gonna standardize or\n\n203\n00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:55.903\nprovide some kind of abstract model for\nnetworking.\n\n204\n00:10:55.903 --> 00:10:56.860\nWell, guess what?\n\n205\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.860\nWe also have copper standards out there.\n\n206\n00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.630\nThe copper standards\nbasically do the same thing.\n\n207\n00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.550\nThey ensure that if you've got\nthe standard, vendors follow the standard,\n\n208\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.220\nthen it doesn't matter what.\n\n209\n00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.990\nIf I buy a cable, all I really do,\nhave to do, is just pick which\n\n210\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:14.410\nvendor makes maybe a better cable or\nmaybe gives me a better price, right.\n\n211\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.950\nBut we essentially don't get the Wild West\nmentality with everybody just doing\n\n212\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.530\neverything a little bit different.\n\n213\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.480\nThere's no interoperability, and\nwe don't have communications.\n\n214\n00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.930\nSo let's go ahead and look at some of the\ncopper standards that we need to be aware\n\n215\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.130\nof, the copper cable\nstandards more specifically.\n\n216\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.010\nAnd what we have here are some Cat cables.\n\n217\n00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.610\nI'm sure some of you probably\nhave heard this term.\n\n218\n00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.490\nIf you haven't, well,\nthat's why you're here.\n\n219\n00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.605\nSo what is a category?\n\n220\n00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:43.570\nAnd that's what Cat, by the way,\nis short for, category.\n\n221\n00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.550\nWell, category defines things like\nits transmission speed, right,\n\n222\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.880\nthe quality of the cable.\n\n223\n00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.840\nAnd this is actually defined and\nstandardized by what's known as TIA/EIA.\n\n224\n00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.990\nSee, here in the States, we have\nthe American National Standards Institute.\n\n225\n00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.403\nAnd I believe in Europe,\n\n226\n00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:03.050\nI know they have the International\nTelecommunications Union.\n\n227\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.934\nThey have the European,\nI can't remember, it's CEPT, and\n\n228\n00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.159\nI can't remember what\nthe acronym stands for.\n\n229\n00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.385\nBut I know the ITU is also\nin the European nation's\n\n230\n00:12:10.385 --> 00:12:12.400\nInternational Telecommunications Union.\n\n231\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.082\nWell, here in the States, ANSI,\nAmerican National Standards Institute,\n\n232\n00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:20.899\npromoted another organization\ncalled TIA/EIA, all right,\n\n233\n00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:26.029\nTelecommunication Industry Association\nElectronic Industry Alliance, right.\n\n234\n00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:31.362\nAnd TIA/EIA is the one that they\npromote telecommunication standards.\n\n235\n00:12:31.362 --> 00:12:36.340\nAnd they're the ones that basically\nstandardize the different levels,\n\n236\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.490\nif you will, of quality of the cable and\nthese Cat types, all right.\n\n237\n00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.970\nNow, you might also be asking yourself,\nwell,\n\n238\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.680\nwait a second,\nwhat happened to Cat 1 and 2?\n\n239\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.240\n[LAUGH] Well, unofficially there was\nsomething called Cat 1 and Cat 2.\n\n240\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.800\nBut that was by Nixter, and\nthat was Nixter cables if you will, and\n\n241\n00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.130\nthose weren't data grade cables.\n\n242\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.780\nThose were your earlier phone line cables.\n\n243\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:02.830\nSo TIA/EIA doesn't formally endorse or\nstandardize anything below three.\n\n244\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.730\nThree is where it starts, so\nthat's why we started with three.\n\n245\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.530\nI don't want you guys and gals out there\nto think, you forgot a couple, Wes, right.\n\n246\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.560\nI know how to count, and\nwe don't start counting at three.\n\n247\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.558\nIt'd be nice if our work\nweek would start that way.\n\n248\n00:13:14.558 --> 00:13:16.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But not counting, okay,\n\n249\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.530\nso [LAUGH], and I digress.\n\n250\n00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:21.760\nLet's talk a little bit about Cat 3,\nall right, we'll start there.\n\n251\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.120\nAll right, there are some things,\nattributes of these cables,\n\n252\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.662\nthat I want you to be aware for the exam.\n\n253\n00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:28.360\nAll right, get them under your belt.\n\n254\n00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.440\nI know it's memorization.\n\n255\n00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.730\nThe great thing is it's really not theory.\n\n256\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.010\nYou can actually look at the cable.\n\n257\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:33.660\nYou can see it.\n\n258\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.310\nYou can test it.\n\n259\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.450\nYou can see what's going on.\n\n260\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:42.560\nAnd you can actually find out a little\nbit more about these cables, as well.\n\n261\n00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.908\nSo Cat 3 cable, what is it?\n\n262\n00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:49.820\nCat 3 cable was the very first twisted\npair implementation that would be utilized\n\n263\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.180\nin Ethernet, all right.\n\n264\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.380\nEthernet, up until these points, would be\nusing your coaxial cables, right, on thin\n\n265\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.350\nwire or thin net, as it was called, thick\nnet or thick wire Ethernet in those days.\n\n266\n00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.500\nBut when we moved into\nthe twisted pair implementations,\n\n267\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.840\nwhich would basically just throw\nthose other two by the wayside and\n\n268\n00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.850\nleave them in the dark, right,\nthat's what we use today.\n\n269\n00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.500\nIt was the very first standard\nthat was using twisted pair.\n\n270\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.300\nSo we call it Ethernet, all right.\n\n271\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.230\nNow, this cable has a transmission\nspeed that I want you to be aware of,\n\n272\n00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.710\n10 megabits.\n\n273\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.650\nAll right, it's a 10 megabit standard.\n\n274\n00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.643\nSo if you have a Cat 3 cable, and\nit's verified TIA/EIA compliant,\n\n275\n00:14:30.643 --> 00:14:35.160\nthen that means it has to\nsupport 10 meg speeds.\n\n276\n00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.260\nNow, you also have to worry about\ntransmission distance, okay.\n\n277\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.590\nThere's a reason they set standards as\nwell on the distance of different cables.\n\n278\n00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.430\nI don't care what cable\nyou're talking about,\n\n279\n00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.500\nthis isn't something\nthat's specific to copper.\n\n280\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.790\nIt applies to coaxial implementations.\n\n281\n00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.410\nAll we gotta do is go back there and\nask some of our directors and\n\n282\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.985\nour production staff that are behind\nthe scenes about how long\n\n283\n00:14:57.985 --> 00:15:01.670\na cable could be run for video, and\nwhat kind of a cable do you need?\n\n284\n00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.430\nEvery cable has a maximum\ntransmission distance.\n\n285\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:09.790\nAnd what the maximum transmission\ndistance, if you follow it, does, it tries\n\n286\n00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:15.990\nto ensure that you don't get corruption\nof a signal or signal attenuation, right.\n\n287\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.530\nAttenuation, it sounds technical.\n\n288\n00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.360\nAll it just means is I send a signal.\n\n289\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.410\nAnd the farther that signal travels\ndown that media, gets farther and\n\n290\n00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.130\nfarther away from its source,\nit starts to degrade, it starts to weaken.\n\n291\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.650\nThat's signal attenuation.\n\n292\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.320\nThere are transmission distances\nset by the standard so\n\n293\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.350\nthat you know if you follow the standard,\nback to why we have the standards,\n\n294\n00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:43.280\nthat you're going to get the performance\nof that cable out to its maximum distance.\n\n295\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.730\nAnything beyond that, you run the risk\nof corruption, damage of the signal,\n\n296\n00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.570\nsignal attenuation.\n\n297\n00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.250\nSo Cat cables.\n\n298\n00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.060\nIf we look at the list here,\nwe've got what?\n\n299\n00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.950\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, right,\nsix Cat cables that are in this list.\n\n300\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.103\nMake it easy.\n\n301\n00:15:58.103 --> 00:16:03.292\nEvery one of these cables has a maximum\ntransmission distance of 100 meters or\n\n302\n00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:04.216\n328 feet.\n\n303\n00:16:04.216 --> 00:16:06.691\nI don't know which one they're\ngonna show you on the exam.\n\n304\n00:16:06.691 --> 00:16:10.829\nDon't think up in my brain here that I\ncan convert that fast between metric and\n\n305\n00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:12.050\nthe imperial system.\n\n306\n00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.000\nIt's just there's a commonality\nthat you kind of find.\n\n307\n00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.860\nYou find one meter, ten meter,\na hundred meter, right?\n\n308\n00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.630\nI don't know why, but in networking\nyou find a lot of that, right?\n\n309\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.620\nSo one meter's gonna be 3.28 feet.\n\n310\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.390\nWe're moving the decimal point.\n\n311\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.240\nTen meters, 32.8 feet and\nfinally 100 meters is 328 feet.\n\n312\n00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.470\nI'm telling you both.\n\n313\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.390\nSo if they ask you how\nmany feed on the exam,\n\n314\n00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.610\nwhatever's closest to 128's gonna win out.\n\n315\n00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.630\nAnother little exam tip, there.\n\n316\n00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.630\nEvery one of these is 100 meters\nwhen it comes to the Cat cables.\n\n317\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.730\nNow let's move down in to Cat 5.\n\n318\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.230\nSo the next one on the list,\nCat 5 here, Cat 5 comes down and\n\n319\n00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.230\nthis is what's known as fast ethernet.\n\n320\n00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.460\nNow maybe not fast by today's standards,\nbut fast ethernet, if you will,\n\n321\n00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.630\nis going to be 100 megabit\ntransmission speed.\n\n322\n00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.470\nWhen we talk about 100\nmegabit transmission speeds,\n\n323\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.840\nyou have to know that for\nthe exam, know the names too.\n\n324\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.180\nCat 3 is ethernet, Cat 5 fast ethernet.\n\n325\n00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.150\nNow moving down on the list,\nyou are going to see now we have Cat 5e.\n\n326\n00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.110\nWhat does the E mean?\n\n327\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.670\nThe E actually stands for enhanced.\n\n328\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.715\nWhat happens here is now\nwe are moving to where 100\n\n329\n00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:23.940\nmegabits wasn't latest and\ngreatest ethernet technology.\n\n330\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.810\nAs the technology progresses, we get 1,000\nmegabits or what's gigabit ethernet right?\n\n331\n00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.840\n1 gig, 1,000 megs right, same thing?\n\n332\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.850\nSo when the exam asks you about\n\n333\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:41.640\nthe Cat 5 enhanced I want you to know\nthat it's called gigabit ethernet.\n\n334\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.990\nNow there is some speculation\non it because I heard\n\n335\n00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.830\nthat it's certified for 350 meg transfer\nspeed, but I just wanted you to know for\n\n336\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.910\nthe exam, you might see anywhere\nfrom 350 megs to a gigabit.\n\n337\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:58.120\nIf they are to ask you about a gigabit,\nyou know, they say which one of these\n\n338\n00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.560\nis a gigabit, choose two, well it's going\nto be Cat 5e and it's going to be Cat 6\n\n339\n00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.070\nwhich we'll talk about as well\ncoming up but it is gigabit speed.\n\n340\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.710\nGuess what?\n\n341\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.370\nZach, help be out.\n\n342\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.100\nWhat do you think\nthe transmission distance is?\n\n343\n00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.031\n&gt;&gt; It's 100 meters.\n\n344\n00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:12.825\n&gt;&gt; Very good right.\n\n345\n00:18:12.825 --> 00:18:14.460\n&gt;&gt; Or 328 feet.\n\n346\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.150\n&gt;&gt; Very good and that's one of the things\nthat we try to say it over and over, so\n\n347\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:19.750\nyou'll remember it.\n\n348\n00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.310\nRemember what one of my\nfavorite blues guitarists said.\n\n349\n00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.780\nDon't practice it until you get it right.\n\n350\n00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.795\nYou practice it until you can't get it\nwrong, then you know it's always right.\n\n351\n00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:29.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, Cat 5e is the next one, right?\n\n352\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.070\nSo, we move down our list here and\nwe're just kinda moving on down here.\n\n353\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.720\nNow we have Cat 6, all right?\n\n354\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.480\nAnd we also have Cat 6a, right?\n\n355\n00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.290\nSo if we look at Cat 6, yeah and\nthe a does matter here,\n\n356\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.180\nCat 6 now is where we get\nto true gigabit speeds.\n\n357\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.120\nThis is gigabit ethernet, all right?\n\n358\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.140\nAnd it goes a little bit\nfurther beyond that and\n\n359\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.070\nI'll mention a little bit\nabout that here coming up.\n\n360\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.110\nAll right, so CAT 6 is gigabit speeds.\n\n361\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.650\nAnd again, maximum transmission distance\nis going to be a hundred meters.\n\n362\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.640\nSo CAT 5E and CAT 6,\nknow them as gigabit ethernet.\n\n363\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.970\nWell then what is the CAT 6A?\n\n364\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:13.930\nWell notice that we're moving along,\ngetting closer and closer to present day.\n\n365\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.459\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we're moving\n\n366\n00:19:15.459 --> 00:19:17.768\nalong in our delorean,\nnear 88.5 miles an hour.\n\n367\n00:19:17.768 --> 00:19:19.773\nWe're going forward in time, right?\n\n368\n00:19:19.773 --> 00:19:20.422\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n369\n00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:24.920\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nwe went from 10 to 100 to gigabit.\n\n370\n00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.100\nWell guess what modern Ethernet based\nnetworks also have 10 gigabits speeds.\n\n371\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.430\nAnd that's where the CAT 6A comes in.\n\n372\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.460\nCAT 6A is actually it's augmented,\nCAT 6 augmented.\n\n373\n00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.310\nAnd what this does is this,\nis gigabit ethernet,\n\n374\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:44.480\nbut it also support speeds up\nto 10 gigabits per second.\n\n375\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.520\nAll right.\n\n376\n00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.250\nNow, I wanna take a second here Zack and\nI'm actually gonna kinda,\n\n377\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.620\nwe're gonna reverse a little bit, right?\n\n378\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.380\nYeah, we're gonna go back to CAT6.\n\n379\n00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:59.040\nCAT6 can also support 10\ngigs speeds as well, it can.\n\n380\n00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.160\nBut depending on you how you implement it,\nit's gonna be between either 37 meters or\n\n381\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.420\n55 meters, but not out to the full\ndistance of a 100 meters.\n\n382\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.300\nAnd that's where Cat 6A starts to shine.\n\n383\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.330\nWhen you need to support a cat or\na 10 gig network and\n\n384\n00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.850\nwell beyond in data centers today, you're\nhave to go with the cat 6A, all right?\n\n385\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.510\nNow, there's also some megahertz,\n\n386\n00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.970\nbandwidth ratings that I want\nyou to be aware of for the exam.\n\n387\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.630\nI don't know again, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n388\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.690\nI can't tell you exactly\nwhat's gonna be on the exam.\n\n389\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.420\nAll I can do is try to give you\nas much information as we can.\n\n390\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.710\nSo Cat 5E is 100 megahertz bandwidth.\n\n391\n00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.900\nCat 6 is 250, and then double that for\nCat 6A, we are talking 500 megahertz.\n\n392\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.290\nAgain, I'm not sure if they're\ngonna get you on that.\n\n393\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:53.010\nBut it's also gigabit ethernet supports\n100 meter transmission distance,\n\n394\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:56.520\nbut the CAT-6A will give you 10\ngig speeds at 100 meters, so\n\n395\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.700\nit's a pretty fascinating cable and\nvery expensive by the way too.\n\n396\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.498\nThe other thing that I want to take one\nsecond on before we get into the last\n\n397\n00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:10.376\nCAT cable is mention that one of\nthe things that influences your Cat cables\n\n398\n00:21:10.376 --> 00:21:14.250\nare the twist,\nwe mentioned the twists per inch.\n\n399\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:19.140\nWell when you look at a Cat 3 and\nthen you look at a Cat 6, a Cat 6 and\n\n400\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.960\na Cat 3, when you pull the outer\njacket off of a Cat 3 cable,\n\n401\n00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.916\nit almost looks like\nthe twists just fall out.\n\n402\n00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:31.110\nIn a Cat 6 cable they're\nreally tightly together.\n\n403\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.120\nThey increase the amount of twist\nper inch in the cable, helping to\n\n404\n00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.590\nincrease it's immunity to electromagnetic\ninterference in a 10 gig network.\n\n405\n00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:46.074\nYou can't tolerate emi, there's no\ntolerance for it, you will not get 10\n\n406\n00:21:46.074 --> 00:21:50.840\ngig performance if you have, even just the\nslightest electro magnetic interference.\n\n407\n00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:56.270\nSo that Cat 6 augmented cable is\nstructurally engineered with a twist so\n\n408\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:01.430\ntight that if you're terminating them,\n\n409\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:07.120\nif you're putting the RJ-45 on them,\nit doesn't tolerate barely\n\n410\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.790\nany undoing of the twists\nto the connector.\n\n411\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.760\nIn fact Cat 6, I think it's 13mm,\nagain don't quote me on that half inch or\n\n412\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.820\n13 mm is all you can undo the twist\nfrom the point of the connector back.\n\n413\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.170\nBecause again, when you undo those twist\n\n414\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.950\nyou can introduce what is\nknown as near end crosstalk.\n\n415\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.320\nI think is called NEXT,\nnear end crosstalk.\n\n416\n00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.990\nIt means as that signal\ntravels down that cable,\n\n417\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.540\nit can bleed out, or\nat the end of the cable, you can get\n\n418\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.790\nelectromagnetic interference that\nactually makes its way into the cable.\n\n419\n00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.400\nWe don't want unwanted, that's what\nelectromagnetic interference is.\n\n420\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.790\nYou want to make it easy?\n\n421\n00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.840\nEMI is nothing more than anything\nother than your data signal.\n\n422\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.510\nIf anything other than your data\nsignal makes its way into that line,\n\n423\n00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.580\nyou've got interference and\nyou've got issues, right?\n\n424\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.300\nNow the last one I want to mention is\nthe Cat 7 cable as far as the Cat cables.\n\n425\n00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.800\nWe've got a couple more here to go,\nbut the Cat 7 cable.\n\n426\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.825\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that mythical?\n\n427\n00:23:05.825 --> 00:23:08.990\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is a very mythical thing\n\n428\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.930\nall right and you might be asking\nZach have you lost your mind?\n\n429\n00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.050\nNo he hasn't.\n\n430\n00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:14.660\nHe's absolutely right.\n\n431\n00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.940\nThat is not [LAUGH].\n\n432\n00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.410\nThat it's not supported by TIA, okay?\n\n433\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.990\nThis is an unofficial\nvendor marketing term.\n\n434\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.980\nTIA doesn't see Cat 7.\n\n435\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.690\nEven if you go out there and\nyou look for Cat 7, you're going to see\n\n436\n00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.350\nat best unofficial terms and you're\ngoing to see it more by the vendors and\n\n437\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.700\nyou're not going to see it on any\nTIA standard sheet all right?\n\n438\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.498\nCat 7, being an unofficial standard,\nit's also gigabit.\n\n439\n00:23:41.498 --> 00:23:46.218\nBut Cat 7, I've also seen them where\nthey're screened, foiled, twisted pair,\n\n440\n00:23:46.218 --> 00:23:48.877\nwhich just means we're putting so\nmuch foil and\n\n441\n00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:52.949\nshielding in that, we don't want\nany electromagnetic interference.\n\n442\n00:23:52.949 --> 00:23:57.955\nAnd like I've told you in earlier episodes\nwhen we were mentioning FTP and we looked\n\n443\n00:23:57.955 --> 00:24:02.964\ninside of those boxes, at that point it's\nso expensive to implement an unofficial\n\n444\n00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:07.783\nstandard that could change later you might\nas well Switch over to fiber optics.\n\n445\n00:24:07.783 --> 00:24:08.289\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n446\n00:24:08.289 --> 00:24:11.015\n&gt;&gt; And you're immune to\nelectromagnetic interference, but\n\n447\n00:24:11.015 --> 00:24:12.921\nthen when you switch to the fiber optics,\n\n448\n00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:16.860\nyou're under an official standard that all\nyour devices out there support, right.\n\n449\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.574\nYou don't want to spend\n[LAUGH] the money and\n\n450\n00:24:18.574 --> 00:24:21.143\nI actually got this from somebody\nthat worked in a data center and\n\n451\n00:24:21.143 --> 00:24:23.538\nhad to do a lot of the architectural\nconsiderations there.\n\n452\n00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:28.329\nSays, I'm not going to put an unofficial\nstandard throughout my entire building,\n\n453\n00:24:28.329 --> 00:24:31.770\nonly to find out two days from then,\nthey standardized it and\n\n454\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.430\neverything I have in my data\ncenter is unofficially supported.\n\n455\n00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.905\n[LAUGH] So, that's what I wanna say.\n\n456\n00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:42.380\nCAT 7, you can call it CAT 7,\nyou can call it gigabit ethernet.\n\n457\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.572\nIt might show up on the exam but\nI want you to know in the real world it is\n\n458\n00:24:45.572 --> 00:24:48.602\nnot supported, it isn't supported so\nnone of it is [CROSSTALK].\n\n459\n00:24:48.602 --> 00:24:51.610\nThat's right, yeah TEA does not see that.\n\n460\n00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.459\nNow, we got two more on the list,\nall right.\n\n461\n00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:54.667\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n462\n00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:58.905\n&gt;&gt; The last two,\nif you would take a look at this,\n\n463\n00:24:58.905 --> 00:25:04.254\nwe have what's known as RG-59 and\nRG-6, all right.\n\n464\n00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:08.219\nWell we actually have a couple of those\ncables here, so what we're gonna do is\n\n465\n00:25:08.219 --> 00:25:13.220\nwe'll take a second here, we'll bring\nout the sky cam and we'll look at those.\n\n466\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.413\nYeah Zach, and these are them.\n\n467\n00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:22.967\nThis is the RG-59, and I wanna make\na little correction here in this episode.\n\n468\n00:25:22.967 --> 00:25:25.699\nI was confusing the RG-59 and I said, hey,\n\n469\n00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:28.580\nthat was used in the earlier\nethernet networks.\n\n470\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.580\nAnd I couldn't be farthest from the truth.\n\n471\n00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.420\nActually, that was the RG-58 connector,\nthat was used in ethernet and\n\n472\n00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.662\nit had a 50 ohm resistor\nthat you would apply to it.\n\n473\n00:25:38.662 --> 00:25:42.147\nThe RG-59 was the old standard for\n\n474\n00:25:42.147 --> 00:25:47.443\ncable television and\nit uses a 75 ohm resistor right?\n\n475\n00:25:47.443 --> 00:25:50.630\nThe terminator like the bus based\nnetworks that we were talking about.\n\n476\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.370\nThe great thing is you\ndon't have to do it.\n\n477\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.200\nMost of the devices like the modems and\n\n478\n00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.260\nstuff like that,\nthey would do the termination.\n\n479\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.370\nSo remember that it's a 75 ohm\n\n480\n00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.980\ntermination that it needs,\nbut you don't usually do it.\n\n481\n00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.810\nYou don't do that anymore like you would\ndo in the earlier bus based networks.\n\n482\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.260\nSo I just wanted to make that correction.\n\n483\n00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.410\nAnd this is an RG-59,\nthat RG like RJ stands for\n\n484\n00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:22.250\nregister jack for ethernet connections and\ntelephone or the RJ11 connectors.\n\n485\n00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.660\nRG is radio grade, it actually goes\nto an old military standard that\n\n486\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.930\nthe telecommunications\nindustry adopted But\n\n487\n00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:34.190\nwe really don't use the military\nversion of that anymore.\n\n488\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.750\nNow the next one that we\nhave is an RG-6 connector.\n\n489\n00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.910\nWhat can you tell right away from those,\nyou actually mentioned this.\n\n490\n00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.214\n&gt;&gt; Well certainly, I mean the RG.\n\n491\n00:26:44.214 --> 00:26:46.710\n&gt;&gt; This is the 6 here and the 59 is here.\n\n492\n00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.927\n&gt;&gt; The 6 is much thicker.\n\n493\n00:26:47.927 --> 00:26:52.969\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and that's one of\nthe easier ways to tell it today is that\n\n494\n00:26:52.969 --> 00:26:58.704\nthis is the current standard for things\nlike CCTV, closed caption TV, right?\n\n495\n00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:02.332\nCATV or cable television,\nas well as your cable Internet.\n\n496\n00:27:02.332 --> 00:27:06.460\nAnd like I said, this is an actual,\nthis is one of our production cables.\n\n497\n00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.099\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it's capable of\ntransferring more information.\n\n498\n00:27:09.099 --> 00:27:10.516\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it might be.\n\n499\n00:27:10.516 --> 00:27:14.202\nI know electrically, the characteristics\nare different and again,\n\n500\n00:27:14.202 --> 00:27:16.710\nthey're used in different implementations.\n\n501\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.920\nI know that they use this for\nour video equipment back here.\n\n502\n00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.100\nI actually took this, don't tell them even\nthough they're watching us on camera.\n\n503\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.324\n&gt;&gt; Is that why the TV isn't working?\n\n504\n00:27:24.324 --> 00:27:24.955\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n505\n00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:25.528\n&gt;&gt; That's why the TV in\n\n506\n00:27:25.528 --> 00:27:26.411\nthe break room is not working.\n\n507\n00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:27.515\nI stole [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n508\n00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:29.980\n&gt;&gt; I stole our directors' cables out here.\n\n509\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.360\nAnd you can see they've got the BMC\nconnector on in here as well.\n\n510\n00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.600\nNow they're B and C connector too.\n\n511\n00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.448\nBut, so again as our quick recap,\nthis is an RG-6, this is\n\n512\n00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:44.050\nthe more current version for things\nlike your cable television audio and\n\n513\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.782\nvisual or, I keep saying visual, video.\n\n514\n00:27:46.782 --> 00:27:49.350\nThis was an older standard,\nthis is the RG-59.\n\n515\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:54.910\nAgain, coaxial media if you will and\ndefinitely know those standards.\n\n516\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.520\nBe aware of those standards and\nknow the 75 ohm resistor.\n\n517\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.653\nAgain, ladies and gentlemen you don't,\ntoday a lot of times even put\n\n518\n00:28:03.653 --> 00:28:08.699\nthe terminators, the termination,\nthe resistors on there like you\n\n519\n00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:13.754\ndid in the earlier days with\nthe RG-58 cable and the RG-8 cable.\n\n520\n00:28:13.754 --> 00:28:17.606\nActually what you would do is you would\nput what's known as a T connector and\n\n521\n00:28:17.606 --> 00:28:21.332\nyou would put the B and C lot connector\non the end of it and you basically put\n\n522\n00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:25.271\nthe terminator what also had it's just\na little, looks like a little plug.\n\n523\n00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:28.620\nAnd it's got a B and C connector and\nyou would terminate the end of it.\n\n524\n00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.010\nYou don't really have to do that.\n\n525\n00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.100\nBut I would know the electrical\ncharacteristics of the cable for\n\n526\n00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.700\nthe exam so that if they ask you\nabout some of these copper cabling\n\n527\n00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.390\nstandards on your next Net+ exam, we don't\nwant you to just get them right, but\n\n528\n00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.410\nwe want you to knock them\nout of the ball park.\n\n529\n00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:46.411\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, awesome, awesome episode.\n\n530\n00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:50.500\nThis is cable solutions copper part two.\n\n531\n00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.960\nI'm thinking there might be\na part three in our future.\n\n532\n00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.681\nWhat's some nice words before we move on?\n\n533\n00:28:54.681 --> 00:28:55.720\n&gt;&gt; No, that's it.\n\n534\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.990\nI do got a few more, so\nwe can't fit it all in this one or\n\n535\n00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.850\nthis would be a very long episode.\n\n536\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.311\nSo what we'll probably have to do is\nwe'll come back and we'll wrap it up.\n\n537\n00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:06.479\nWe'll tie up a few of the loose ends\nin the copper solutions here so\n\n538\n00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:08.273\nthat you will be ready for that exam.\n\n539\n00:29:08.273 --> 00:29:09.525\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, and\nthat's really what it's all about.\n\n540\n00:29:09.525 --> 00:29:11.904\nCabling solution copper\npart three coming your way.\n\n541\n00:29:11.904 --> 00:29:13.680\nWatch all of those.\n\n542\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.494\nWatch everything Net+ series, and\n\n543\n00:29:15.494 --> 00:29:17.710\ncheck out all the other\nvideos in the course

00:00:08.384\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.180\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.261\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:16.625\nHelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.653\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA NET +.\n\n8\n00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.955\nThis is cabling solutions\ncopper part three.\n\n9\n00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.835\nThis is the final part, so\nyou really wanna pay attention here.\n\n10\n00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:28.395\nIn fact, you should pay\nattention to all three parts.\n\n11\n00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.212\nAnyway, Wes Bryan is here to give us\nthe information that we're looking for.\n\n12\n00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:32.724\nWes, good to see you again,\nthanks for all.\n\n13\n00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.531\n&gt;&gt; Hey, glad to be back Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:35.460\nThanks for having me here.\n\n15\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.713\nThat's right, hopefully,\n\n16\n00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:39.918\nhopefully this will be the final parter\nZach might have just threw a hex on our\n\n17\n00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:42.790\nwhole mission, we'll be back with Part 10,\nno, just kidding.\n\n18\n00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.910\nWe've got a couple of things, a couple of\nloose ends that we kinda gotta tie off.\n\n19\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.630\nIn the first couple of episodes here,\n\n20\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.140\nwe've been talking about the media types,\nright?\n\n21\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.060\nWe talked about cabling standards, and\nwe talked about connectors, so go back and\n\n22\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.070\nwatch them.\n\n23\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.760\nBut we got some,\n\n24\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.610\na little bit more, a few more topics that\nwe're gonna talk about in this episode.\n\n25\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.985\n&gt;&gt; Well Wes, now that we know about the\ncables, about the copper cable media, or\n\n26\n00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:05.740\nthe copper media types if you will.\n\n27\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.470\nNow how do we wire the connectors to them?\n\n28\n00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.090\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question.\n\n29\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.830\nAnd the great thing with co-axial is\nthere's really only one way to wire.\n\n30\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.480\nWhy is that?\n\n31\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.530\nWell there's only a single\ncentral copper conductor.\n\n32\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.849\nSo if you wire that one wrong.\n\n33\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.620\nMaybe this isn't the industry for\nyou, [LAUGH] but\n\n34\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.290\nwhat do we do with the twisted\npair implementations, right?\n\n35\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.400\nWe've kinda joked around Zach and\nI in the past couple of episodes.\n\n36\n00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.785\nWe say there's standards for a reason or\nit's gonna be the wild west.\n\n37\n00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:33.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Let me go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.500\nI'm gonna paint a picture here for you and\n\n39\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.778\nhopefully it comes out, well you don't\nwant me to paint anything for you.\n\n40\n00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:41.680\nBut I'll [LAUGH] paint a picture here for\nyou and I wanna give you kind of\n\n41\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.390\na scenario as to why we have what\nare known as termination standards, right?\n\n42\n00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.100\nNow, termination standards first of all\nthat sounds like, it's technical jargon.\n\n43\n00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.588\nDon't make it overly complex,\nit's not that complicated.\n\n44\n00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:55.450\nTermination standards just say,\n\n45\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.580\nI've got an RJ45 connection or in this\ncase, and we're not in fiber, right yet.\n\n46\n00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.130\nWe'll talk about that in another show,\n\n47\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.268\nI've got a fiber connector,\nhow do I connect it to the cable?\n\n48\n00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:06.910\nWell there's gotta be some kind\nof standardization because\n\n49\n00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.920\nif not the scenario I would paint for\n\n50\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.286\nyou is that, let's say Zach is\nan administrator, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:19.350\nAnd Zach has the favorite way he\nlikes to wire these RJ45 jacks\n\n52\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.750\nwhen he puts the cat cable in the back\nof them and crimps them down, all right?\n\n53\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.320\nMaybe he likes a certain\ncolor arrangement and\n\n54\n00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.080\nhe makes sure that that is the arrangement\nacross the entire network.\n\n55\n00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170\nWell that's just fine.\n\n56\n00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.205\nNothing wrong with that, as long as you\nwire both ends of the cable the same way,\n\n57\n00:02:38.205 --> 00:02:41.299\nyou'll be all right,\nbut here's the problem.\n\n58\n00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.038\nNow Wes comes in and now Wes,\nmaybe Zach's been promoted right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:51.630\nMaybe he's a project lead now and\nhe's been in the trenches enough right?\n\n60\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.860\nAnd now it's my turn to come in and\n\n61\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.420\nI've gotta try to figure out what is\ngoing on with the network, right?\n\n62\n00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.140\nZach didn't do good documentation, and\nI know that couldn't be further from\n\n63\n00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.330\nthe truth I have seen the man and\nhis notes and his documentation, right?\n\n64\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.420\nLet’s just say theoretically,\ndidn't do any documentation.\n\n65\n00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.740\nWell, how do I know how\nhe wired those cables up?\n\n66\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.340\nIf he doesn't follow\na termination standard.\n\n67\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.230\nAnd that's the point,\nwe get consistency, all right?\n\n68\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.170\nThe other thing too is\nif Zach tells me hey, I\n\n69\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.580\nterminated all of these cables according\nto this specific TIA/EIA standard.\n\n70\n00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.420\nWell guess what?\n\n71\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.200\nIf I know that standard,\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n72\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.400\nI can go to the end of a 300 foot cable\nthat snakes all around the building and\n\n73\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.160\nas long as I follow the TIA/EIA\nstandard that he told me he followed,\n\n74\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.260\nI know provided the cable isn't broken or\n\n75\n00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.410\ndamaged somewhere else beyond what we can\nsee, that I'm gonna have communication.\n\n76\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.740\nI'm gonna have connectivity.\n\n77\n00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.310\nAnd that's what the standards are about.\n\n78\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.500\nThat's why we wanna follow\nthose termination standards.\n\n79\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.750\nAnd that's what we're gonna talk about.\n\n80\n00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.643\nWe're gonna talk about a little\nmore about TIA/EIA standards and\n\n81\n00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:03.546\nmore specifically the 568,\nstructural building standards.\n\n82\n00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:08.456\nNow you're gonna see if you're going to\nthe exam objectives with us, that they're\n\n83\n00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:13.451\ngonna call out, 560AA and 560AB and\nmore specifically, TIA/EIA 560AA.\n\n84\n00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:14.099\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n85\n00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.600\n&gt;&gt; TIA 560AB.\n\n86\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.540\nNow, those aren't the only\ntwo 568 standards all right?\n\n87\n00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.230\nUnderstand that the 568 standard\n\n88\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.630\nreally defines all aspects of structured\nwiring within your buildings.\n\n89\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.940\nThe A and the B just happen to\nbe a portion of it that denote\n\n90\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.270\nhow you terminate an RJ45 jack.\n\n91\n00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.650\nOr, again, take the jargon out of it,\ngot an RJ45 jack?\n\n92\n00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.870\nHow do I wire those eight conductors\ninto the back of the jack before I\n\n93\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.300\ncrimp it down?\n\n94\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.680\nThat's what this is about.\n\n95\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.160\nSo let's go ahead, and\n\n96\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.730\nlet's look at a diagram that I\ngot on my computer here, right?\n\n97\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.510\n&gt;&gt; Good, I love.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n98\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.888\n&gt;&gt; Now, you're gonna see a lot\nof colors here, all right?\n\n99\n00:04:50.888 --> 00:04:54.525\nLet me explain a little bit about what's\ngoing on with these colors all right?\n\n100\n00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:58.428\nAnd I'll explain a little bit more\nabout what we mean with 568B and 568A,\n\n101\n00:04:58.428 --> 00:04:59.030\nall right?\n\n102\n00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.120\nNow I want you to know,\n\n103\n00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.850\non a network adaptor we have\neight positions, all right?\n\n104\n00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.250\nRemember why, in other episodes, we said,\n\n105\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.580\nhey you know they also call that\nRJ45 jack an 8P8C connector, right?\n\n106\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.500\nWhy do they call it that?\n\n107\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.160\n8 pins, 8 conductors.\n\n108\n00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.010\nPins, what are the pins about?\n\n109\n00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.740\nWell the pins are directly related\nto the network adaptor that you\n\n110\n00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.350\nplug the connector into, right?\n\n111\n00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.870\nAnd there are eight of them.\n\n112\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.880\nAnd you have to understand that those\neight pins that are on the connectors,\n\n113\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.910\nthey don't change in the network or\non the network adapter,\n\n114\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.720\nI should say, they don't change.\n\n115\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.340\nBut what we can change is the wiring.\n\n116\n00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.220\nHow we arrange those wires that\nconnect into the back of the RJ45\n\n117\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.000\njack which then in turn get plugged into\nthe ethernet port that make a connection,\n\n118\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.150\nto those stationary pins\nwithin that network adapter.\n\n119\n00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.450\nSo, that's why I'll go between calling\nthese pins and positions all right?\n\n120\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n121\n00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.520\n&gt;&gt; Understand that the positions or\nthe pins don't change, it's how we\n\n122\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.810\nmanipulate the wires and the conductors\nthat we can affect them we can changed.\n\n123\n00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.710\nAnd based on the standard\nthat we're following.\n\n124\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.050\nEssentially does nothing more than denotes\nthe color scheme that we're following.\n\n125\n00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.210\n&gt;&gt; And Wes,\nthe color scheme is important isn't it?\n\n126\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.210\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n127\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.340\nAnd we'll get to exactly why that's so\nimportant here in a second.\n\n128\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.070\nThat is a great question and I'm actually\ngonna go ahead and put a pause on that.\n\n129\n00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.360\nAnd I'm going to come back to that.\n\n130\n00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.560\nWhat I'd like to do is give you a Zach,\n\n131\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.390\nas an answer to that question,\nnot just a verbal answer.\n\n132\n00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.040\nI wanna give you some\nmore of a visualization.\n\n133\n00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.900\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So we can see that.\n\n134\n00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.621\nSo, we will come back to that and\nyes absolutely it does.\n\n135\n00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:37.361\nSo if we look at this diagram.\n\n136\n00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:41.284\nI don't want you to worry about\nwhat we call a straight through or\n\n137\n00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:45.716\na cross over at this point because\nunless you understand, the colors and\n\n138\n00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:49.950\nthe arrangements, those two terms\nmake no sense at all, all right?\n\n139\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.580\nSo this is actually a 568B standard\nthat I've got here right now, all right?\n\n140\n00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.800\nAnd if you'll notice,\nwe've got a few different types of colors.\n\n141\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.710\nWell we've got different colors, but\n\n142\n00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.420\nwe've got a few different\nways that they denote this.\n\n143\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.035\nNotice that I've got a broken line and\nI've got a solid line.\n\n144\n00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:08.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n145\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.450\n&gt;&gt; All right?\nWell the broken lines the way I can denote\n\n146\n00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.600\nthe fact that what you typically have and\nwe'll show you this in a second,\n\n147\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.310\nis in the eight conductors.\n\n148\n00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.450\nI almost said five conductors.\n\n149\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.300\nIn the eight conductors that we have,\nwe have a primary wire and\n\n150\n00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.350\na secondary wire in each twisted pair.\n\n151\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.950\nNot just the whole cable, but\n\n152\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.780\nin each individual twisted pair we\nhave a primary and a secondary wire.\n\n153\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.020\nThe primary wire is typically\nwhite with a stripe down it, and\n\n154\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.870\nthe stripe is the color of it's\nassociated in the pair, right?\n\n155\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.120\nThe partner, if you will in the pair.\n\n156\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.620\nSo if you'll notice that 568B,\nactually in pin or\n\n157\n00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.130\nposition 1, puts the white,\nthe primary, right?\n\n158\n00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.890\nThe white with the striped\norange in pin one, position one.\n\n159\n00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.691\nIn position two we have\na solid orange wire.\n\n160\n00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.510\nNow look at position three.\n\n161\n00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.580\nPosition three what we had is a white,\n\n162\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.410\nthe primary wire white with a green\nstripe down the middle of it.\n\n163\n00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.320\nNow look at position 4,\nposition 4, 5 are interesting and\n\n164\n00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.730\nthese are the blue conductors and they\nalways kind of throwing rock in the pond.\n\n165\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.930\nBecause what you'll notice here is\nthe first position, second position,\n\n166\n00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:31.730\nfirst position, second position,\nit always seems to go stripe, solid,\n\n167\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.480\nstripe, solid, stripe, solid, stripe,\nsolid, stripe, solid all the way down.\n\n168\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.600\nExcept for positions 4 and 5.\n\n169\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.940\nThe blue they reversed themselves right.\n\n170\n00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.165\nNotice that 4 in position or pin 4 we\nhave a solid blue, that's on purpose,\n\n171\n00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:45.160\nthat's not a typo.\n\n172\n00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.780\nThen in position 5 is where we\nget the white primary wire,\n\n173\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.670\nessentially the white with\nthe blue stripe down it.\n\n174\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.700\nAnd then in position 6,\nwe have a solid green.\n\n175\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.510\nAnd then position or pin 6 and\n7, we get back to that again,\n\n176\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.680\nprimary secondary pairing, right?\n\n177\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.970\nWe get the in positions 7,\nwe get the white stripe or\n\n178\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.030\nthe white conductor with the brown stripe.\n\n179\n00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.440\nI'll get that right eventually\nby the end of this episode.\n\n180\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.530\nAnd then in the last one,\nposition 8, we get the brown stripe.\n\n181\n00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.120\nAll right,\nnow that's enough from a diagram.\n\n182\n00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.320\nIf we can go ahead, we've actually got a\ncable here that we can take a look at and\n\n183\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.190\nI can kind of explain\nthis a little bit more.\n\n184\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:33.000\nSee it was kind of hard for me in my\ndiagram to explain a little bit about\n\n185\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.440\nthe wiring that we would see, all right?\n\n186\n00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.725\nBecause if you'll notice,\nhere are our eight conductors, right?\n\n187\n00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:43.698\nNow what I can do is I can choose,\nbased on the standard that I'm following,\n\n188\n00:09:43.698 --> 00:09:48.220\nI just happen to mention 568B,\nit's a common standard out there today.\n\n189\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.480\nBut what I can do is I\ncan wire these conductors\n\n190\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.747\ninto the back of the RJ-45 jack like this.\n\n191\n00:09:58.747 --> 00:10:03.588\nNotice that I have the primary, that white\nconductor and if we kind of zoom in there\n\n192\n00:10:03.588 --> 00:10:07.740\nwe go notice that I have a white\nconductor with an orange stripe right?\n\n193\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.560\nThat's your primary wire and then\nthe secondary wire is the solid orange.\n\n194\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.310\nNow if I keep going with a 568 b\nstandard right I'm going to do\n\n195\n00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.460\nnext I'm going to do the white\nwith the green stripe.\n\n196\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.710\nAnd here's where we've got to move this\nsolid green out of the way for a second.\n\n197\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.800\nAnd the blue is kind of\ninteresting on this one here.\n\n198\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.375\nLet me pull this the other way here.\n\n199\n00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:33.887\nIs that when you're looking\nat the blue conductor, and\n\n200\n00:10:33.887 --> 00:10:37.308\nsometimes you've got to manipulate it\na little bit to make it easier because\n\n201\n00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:40.846\nagain they are twisted all the way through\nthis and the entirety of this cable.\n\n202\n00:10:40.846 --> 00:10:45.738\nThe blue is going to, solid blue will\nbe next after that solid white with\n\n203\n00:10:45.738 --> 00:10:51.310\nthe green stripe and then we have\nthe white with the blue stripe next.\n\n204\n00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:56.270\nWell, in position six,\nthat is where we come back to\n\n205\n00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:01.040\nessentially let me see if I\ncan get that out of there.\n\n206\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.160\nLittle bit, notice in position six now or\npin six, we're gonna put the solid green,\n\n207\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.320\nthen we have white with a brown stripe and\nthen our solid brown.\n\n208\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:19.746\nAnd essentially what this does,\nis this sets us up for a 568B standard.\n\n209\n00:11:19.746 --> 00:11:22.747\nNow in order for\nthis to be in 568B on the other side,\n\n210\n00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:25.610\nwell then we'd have to do that same thing.\n\n211\n00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.500\nI would take out these pairs and\nI would do the same thing, right.\n\n212\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.010\nI would wire the orange ones,\nthen we would take and\n\n213\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.350\nwe would untwist this and we would put\nour green one, right primary white green,\n\n214\n00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.860\nthen a blue then a white blue\nthen again the solid green and\n\n215\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.230\nthen white brown and brown.\n\n216\n00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.810\nAnd if I basically arrange\nthese in that way on\n\n217\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.330\nboth sides of the cable, I end up getting\nwhat's known as a straight through cable.\n\n218\n00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.900\nAnd again, I want you to hold off,\njust bear with me on that one,\n\n219\n00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.050\nI'll come back to what that means.\n\n220\n00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.543\nNow, there's also the 568A standard,\nall right?\n\n221\n00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:10.630\nNow 568A standard is\na little bit different.\n\n222\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.870\nNotice that pins one and two or positions\none and two start with an orange.\n\n223\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.880\nPositions three and six are the green\npair, well if I take those and\n\n224\n00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.770\nI kinda switch just those two,\njust those two and nothing else.\n\n225\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.980\nIn fact I'll try to make\nsure that the blue and\n\n226\n00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.070\nthe brown stay exactly in\nthe positions that they are all right?\n\n227\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.170\nAnd what I'm gonna do is I'll\ntake that green stripe and\n\n228\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.560\nI'm gonna move that off the orange stripe\nhere just off to the side for a second,\n\n229\n00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.780\nwe'll come back to those.\n\n230\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.900\nI'm gonna move the oranges\njust out of the way.\n\n231\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.310\nAnd I'm gonna pull the solid\ngreen in position two.\n\n232\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:53.110\nSo here, notice that we've got\nstriped green, solid green,\n\n233\n00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:59.540\nthen we have striped orange and\nthen that's position three.\n\n234\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.280\nAnd then in positions four and\n\n235\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.890\nfive the blues don't change but\nthen when I get to positions six\n\n236\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.730\ninstead of being the solid green this\ntime it becomes the solid orange.\n\n237\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.616\nAnd then position seven and\neight stays the same.\n\n238\n00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:16.902\nAll right, so\nthe difference really between 568B and\n\n239\n00:13:16.902 --> 00:13:22.850\n568A is what positions am I\nputting the green twisted pair and\n\n240\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.289\nthe orange twisted pair.\n\n241\n00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:30.339\nNow in order to make this a straight\nthrough cable again, what I'd have to\n\n242\n00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:35.480\ndo is I'd have to arrange it on this\nside as well with the green pair first.\n\n243\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.150\nAnd that would be the white\nwith a green stripe first.\n\n244\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:45.200\nSolid green second, position three\nwould have the striped orange and\n\n245\n00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.040\nthen again four does four stays the same.\n\n246\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.801\nFour and five would be the blue but\nthen on position six,\n\n247\n00:13:51.801 --> 00:13:56.617\njust like we did over here we would\nput the orange in position six solid.\n\n248\n00:13:56.617 --> 00:14:01.982\nAnd then seven and eight are going to\nbe the brown pair with the stripe and\n\n249\n00:14:01.982 --> 00:14:04.950\nsolid in that arrangement.\n\n250\n00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.630\nAll right and\nthat would be the 568A standard.\n\n251\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.260\nNow I want to come back to my\ndiagram because in my diagram,\n\n252\n00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.310\none of the things that I've mentioned\nhere is that straight-through.\n\n253\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.660\nAnd here is what\na straight-through cable is.\n\n254\n00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.410\nNotice that again,\nrelative to the positions of the pins\n\n255\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.730\nthey don't change on either end.\n\n256\n00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.570\nIf I say 568B on one side and\n568B on the other side,\n\n257\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:36.310\nend to end even though they're\ntwisted all right when you get to\n\n258\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:42.440\nthe end of the cables the conductors\nare wired same positions on each side.\n\n259\n00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.460\nNow, that's important, why?\n\n260\n00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.480\nBecause when you connect into a switch,\nthe switch, if you remember\n\n261\n00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.170\nfrom our networking device episode,\nit is actually doing the forwarding.\n\n262\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.590\nWhat it will do is it receives\ncoming from let's say computer one,\n\n263\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.620\non the switch, computer one sends\na signal into the switch, all right.\n\n264\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.450\nWell if I've got a 568B standard,\n\n265\n00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:11.472\nit's going to send information into the\nswitch on positions or pins one and two.\n\n266\n00:15:11.472 --> 00:15:15.870\nThe switch is gonna inspect the mac\ntable find out where is this going.\n\n267\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.320\nWhen it, we'll keep it easy,\nport two is the computer two and\n\n268\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.300\nthat's where is supposed to go.\n\n269\n00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.650\nIt'll say okay I recognize the MAC\naddress, this is a this is a computer two\n\n270\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:29.020\nand it's on port two, let me switch this,\nswitch, hence the name.\n\n271\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.580\nLet me switch this and\nforward it out the port.\n\n272\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.520\nAnd what I'll do internally is I'll\ntake what I received on pins one and\n\n273\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.250\ntwo when I send it out port two to\ngo to the destination computer,\n\n274\n00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.150\nI'll send it out on ports three and six.\n\n275\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.450\nThe recipient pins, the received pins.\n\n276\n00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.990\nAll right and that's why they call it\na straight through cable because when you\n\n277\n00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:51.980\nwere connecting to a central connectivity\ndevice you use a straight through cable.\n\n278\n00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.152\nNow, there might be times in an Ethernet\nbased network that you need to make\n\n279\n00:15:56.152 --> 00:15:57.823\na point to point connection.\n\n280\n00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:00.818\nWhat I mean is I'm not\nconnecting to a switch.\n\n281\n00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:05.181\nI'm taking, let's say a laptop, and I'm\nplugging its network adapter into the end\n\n282\n00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:07.780\nif the IP camera that I need to configure.\n\n283\n00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.210\nSo I'm making a direct\npoint to point connection.\n\n284\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.310\nNow in the earlier days,\nthe way we would do this,\n\n285\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.850\nwe've already talked about this type\nof cable was an RS232 mil model cable.\n\n286\n00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.710\nIf I wanted a point to point connection,\nI would connect to the serial ports.\n\n287\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.300\nWe don't have serial ports anymore.\n\n288\n00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:29.940\nThe most common media, copper media in LAN\nbased environments today, is twisted pair.\n\n289\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.510\nTo make a point to point connection, since\nI don't have a device that is going to do\n\n290\n00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:40.620\nthat crossing,\nthat switching over from positions 1 and\n\n291\n00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.310\n2 to positions 3 and 6 like a switch does,\nthen I have to do that manually.\n\n292\n00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.080\nAnd how do we do that?\n\n293\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.940\nWith a crossover cable.\n\n294\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.740\nIf I wire up 568b on one side and\nI'm just throwing these out there.\n\n295\n00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.260\nI could do it alphabetically, a and b,\n\n296\n00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.632\nbut it just didn't work out that way on my\ndiagram [LAUGH] I'm a little backwards.\n\n297\n00:17:00.632 --> 00:17:05.910\nIf I wire b up on one side, notice what\nhappens if I wire a up on the other side.\n\n298\n00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.830\nNotice that we have a Ghostbusters\nwarning here, right?\n\n299\n00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.500\nWe're crossing the stream, so\nwe've got total protonic reversal.\n\n300\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.220\nBecause if I do that ,notice\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n301\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.650\nPins one and two,\nif I wire 568 on the other side,\n\n302\n00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.696\nremember they're on positions three and\nsix.\n\n303\n00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:29.729\nSo what's happening here is 3 and\n\n304\n00:17:29.729 --> 00:17:35.160\n6 on 568b is then crossed over to 1 and 2.\n\n305\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.610\nSo what's happening here?\n\n306\n00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:37.810\nWell think about it this way.\n\n307\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:42.000\nIf I was to plug into two\nnetwork adapters right,\n\n308\n00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.880\nfrom that workstation to that IP camera.\n\n309\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.290\nWhat do we have?\n\n310\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.070\nAll right.\n\n311\n00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.729\nIf we have a cross over cable\nthen I'm gonna send, and\n\n312\n00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:57.056\nlet's say our computer is over here.\n\n313\n00:17:57.056 --> 00:18:03.640\nWe'll just say our computer is over here\nand maybe over here, we'll put the IP cam.\n\n314\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.200\nSo I do not have a connectivity device,\nright?\n\n315\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.940\nI'm not going through a switch.\n\n316\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.940\nSo that means when I issue\na command to the IP camera,\n\n317\n00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.920\nit's going to send it out\nthe transmit pins on 1 and 2 and\n\n318\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.700\nas it traverses this line,\nthis twisted pair implementation,\n\n319\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.700\nit's going to crossover\nto the receive pins\n\n320\n00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:30.000\non the IP camera sides network\nadapter because it's arranged in a 568\n\n321\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.701\nA fashion, and\nthat's what's called a crossover cable.\n\n322\n00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:39.710\nA crossover cable you don't understand\nreally can't understand what a crossover\n\n323\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.360\ncable is until you kind of understand\nwhat's going on with the coloring and\n\n324\n00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.480\nthe wiring of the connectors.\n\n325\n00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.213\nAnd that's why we have a standard\nbecause the most of our connectors\n\n326\n00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:53.710\nthat we have today\nare actually running 568b.\n\n327\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.618\nI know that if we are,\n\n328\n00:18:55.618 --> 00:19:01.135\nlet's say we are running 568b\nthat if I have a connection or\n\n329\n00:19:01.135 --> 00:19:06.778\nlet's say you know a connector\non the end 300-foot cable.\n\n330\n00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:08.446\nWell if I know it's 568b,\n\n331\n00:19:08.446 --> 00:19:12.915\nI don't have to try to walk over the other\nside of the cable look at the cable say,\n\n332\n00:19:12.915 --> 00:19:16.560\nI wonder what color pattern\nthey're using here today.\n\n333\n00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.136\nNo i know it's 568 b.\n\n334\n00:19:18.136 --> 00:19:21.024\nWell you're going to use this\nscheme here you see on your screen.\n\n335\n00:19:21.024 --> 00:19:23.795\nAnd that's important again\nto understand the difference\n\n336\n00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:27.087\nbetween what the straight through\ncable is and the crossover cable.\n\n337\n00:19:27.087 --> 00:19:30.394\nIf I need to make a point to point\nconnection, because I don't have\n\n338\n00:19:30.394 --> 00:19:34.590\na connectivity device that's doing that\ncrossing over for me inside of the switch,\n\n339\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.410\nwell then I make a crossover cable,\nand I've manually done that.\n\n340\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.469\nLike I said, in the earlier days we do\nit with a 232 null modem cable, and\n\n341\n00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:44.725\nit was called a null modem cable because\nit would simulate the presence of a modem\n\n342\n00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.410\nwithout it actually being there.\n\n343\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.166\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n344\n00:19:47.166 --> 00:19:49.090\n&gt;&gt; So very, very important.\n\n345\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.638\nNow, if we could take a look at our\nnetwork adapters, I want to kind\n\n346\n00:19:53.638 --> 00:19:59.120\nof understand why I'm calling these\npositions, one through eight.\n\n347\n00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.040\nIf you look right here, right here at this\nnetwork adapter, and this is an older\n\n348\n00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.760\nnetwork adapter, and I've had people ask\nme well wow, that thing's wide open.\n\n349\n00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.260\nThere are eight electrical traces here.\n\n350\n00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.390\nAnd that doesn't change.\n\n351\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:19.770\nSo the only way I could create\na manual point to point connection is\n\n352\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.590\nbasically by how I wire the connectors\ninside of the cable in cells, right?\n\n353\n00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:30.840\nSo if I wire this to 568a like\nthis is arranged on this side.\n\n354\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.170\nBut then if we look at\nthis networking adapter,\n\n355\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.690\nit's positions don't change and\nI wired a 568b on that side,\n\n356\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.650\nthen what's happening is we get\nthat internal crossing over, right?\n\n357\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.060\nAs the electrical signal\nleaves this network adapter or\n\n358\n00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.820\nwhichever one you can take your pick\ninside of the cable it comes through and\n\n359\n00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.760\nlike the diagram it crosses\nover into the receive pins.\n\n360\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.760\nSo we can transmit on one, we have the\ncrossing over of the conductors inside of\n\n361\n00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.710\nthe cable to the receive pins on this\nside and that's what we manipulate.\n\n362\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.630\nNow you'll notice that this one's\na little bit different right?\n\n363\n00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:08.970\nThis is a newer connector.\n\n364\n00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.390\nThis is the old PCI connector.\n\n365\n00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.120\nThis is actually a PCIE connector with\na heat sync on the transceiver chip.\n\n366\n00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.130\nTransceiver chip by the way\nis a transmitter receiver.\n\n367\n00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.820\nIt's what processes your\nnetwork information.\n\n368\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.100\nBut if I take this one,\nand I turn this one over,\n\n369\n00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.150\neven though on the outside I can see those\nconductors, those connectors I mean.\n\n370\n00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.140\nNotice how Zach,\ncan you can see those eight, nine?\n\n371\n00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.020\n&gt;&gt; Eight nine pins.\n\n372\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.360\n&gt;&gt; And\nyou ask yourself well why is it enclosed?\n\n373\n00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.310\nAnd well this one isn't enclosed.\n\n374\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.320\nWell, it's kind of interesting.\n\n375\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.167\nThis is actually a gigabit adapter, and\nyou can kind of see that right here.\n\n376\n00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.607\nNotice the 10, 100 and\n\n377\n00:21:43.607 --> 00:21:46.935\n1000 megs that we've talked\nabout in our copper standards.\n\n378\n00:21:46.935 --> 00:21:47.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n379\n00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.780\n&gt;&gt; This is interesting.\n\n380\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:54.369\nThis is an old network adapter, and\nwhen I say old, we're talking 100 megs.\n\n381\n00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:56.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I thought you were\ngoing to say 100 years old.\n\n382\n00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.110\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, no, this is a Fast ethernet.\n\n383\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And it's called 100TX,\n\n384\n00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.850\nwe'll get back to what that is.\n\n385\n00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.260\nBut this is a 100 meg cable,\n\n386\n00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.910\nso they weren't concerned about\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n387\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.590\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; If you remember,\n\n388\n00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.620\non of the things that I said, when you get\ninto things like gigabit Ethernet beyond,\n\n389\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.980\nyou have to worry about\nelectromagnetic interference.\n\n390\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:22.230\nSo you'll notice that more commonly today,\nthese might even be plastic.\n\n391\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.750\nBut notice how they're\ncompletely shielded off and\n\n392\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.560\nthat's because this is\na nice network adapter.\n\n393\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.360\nIt does kinda a lot of cool things.\n\n394\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.560\nIt definitely isn't a slouch by any means.\n\n395\n00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.260\nSo that's what you're seeing there.\n\n396\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.560\nSo just keep in mind that when we talk\nabout these type of network adapters, and\n\n397\n00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.460\nthe wiring standards themselves,\nyou're gonna wanna know\n\n398\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.430\nthe difference between strapetip cable and\ncrossover cable.\n\n399\n00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:52.580\nKnow the standards and understand why\nthey're called a straight through cable.\n\n400\n00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:58.680\nIf I have 568a on one side and 568a on the\nother side, there is no changing, right?\n\n401\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.966\nThere is no reversing.\n\n402\n00:23:00.966 --> 00:23:04.815\nIt's straight map one to one\nall the way across one to one,\n\n403\n00:23:04.815 --> 00:23:07.860\ntwo to two all the way down\nto eight to eight, right?\n\n404\n00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.027\nBut in the crossover cable, if I take and\nmix and match A on one side, B on\n\n405\n00:23:12.027 --> 00:23:16.822\nthe other, or just switch it around, B on\none side, A on the other, remember that\n\n406\n00:23:16.822 --> 00:23:21.689\nthe conductors actually crossover as they\npass through the cable and that allows me\n\n407\n00:23:21.689 --> 00:23:26.560\nto make a point to point connection\nwhen I don't have connectivity device.\n\n408\n00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.300\nGreat thing to understand for\nthe exam and also memorize the colors.\n\n409\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.100\nI don't know if they're going\nto do like we've done here and\n\n410\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.380\nthey're going to give you the pins.\n\n411\n00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.377\nThey might not give you pins.\n\n412\n00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:38.750\nThey might give you colors and\nsay which of these are the standard?\n\n413\n00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.140\nAnd I don't know, they might not.\n\n414\n00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:41.870\nThey might actually give you the pins.\n\n415\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.040\nUnderstand why I have said pins and\npositions.\n\n416\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.985\nBecause relative to network adapter that\nyou connect, I can't change the position\n\n417\n00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:52.269\nof those electrical traces\non the board itself the PCB.\n\n418\n00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:54.968\nThe only thing I can\naffect as a technician\n\n419\n00:23:54.968 --> 00:24:00.090\nis how I wire the conductors that\ngo into the back of the RJ-45 jack.\n\n420\n00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.497\nThat's what I can manipulate, all right.\n\n421\n00:24:02.497 --> 00:24:04.367\nSo the next thing that we have to look at,\n\n422\n00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:07.282\none of the last things that we\nhave to kinda talk about here, and\n\n423\n00:24:07.282 --> 00:24:09.934\nI know we're kinda running\na little bit low on time here.\n\n424\n00:24:09.934 --> 00:24:13.426\nBut when it comes to copper standards,\nwe've talked about,\n\n425\n00:24:13.426 --> 00:24:15.180\nwhat did we've talked about?\n\n426\n00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.630\nWe talked about termination standards,\ncabling standards, cabling types, right.\n\n427\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.510\nAnd I keep mentioning Ethernet over,\nand over, and over, and over.\n\n428\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.790\nEthernet is a standard in and\nof itself and\n\n429\n00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:31.710\nthese different cabling standards\nare how we deploy Ethernet.\n\n430\n00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.990\nAll right, well guess what?\n\n431\n00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:38.250\nThey have Ethernet Deployment Standards,\nand you need to know those for the exam.\n\n432\n00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.570\nWe talk about\nEthernet Deployment Standards,\n\n433\n00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.930\nwe are talking about these right here.\n\n434\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.790\nThey're called base standards,\nand there's tons of them,\n\n435\n00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.370\nthese just happen to be a few of them.\n\n436\n00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.835\nWe've got a couple more that are for\na fiber Ethernet deployments, too, but\n\n437\n00:24:50.835 --> 00:24:53.160\nwe'll talk about that in our fiber-\n&gt;&gt; In the fiber episode.\n\n438\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,\nour fiber solutions.\n\n439\n00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.910\nAll right, so,\nthese are kinda easy to remember.\n\n440\n00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.380\nI wish everything would be a little\nbit easier like this is to understand,\n\n441\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.450\nbecause a base standard gives\nyou three characteristics,\n\n442\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.800\nthree attributes of the Ethernet\ndeployment standard, right.\n\n443\n00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.890\nIt's written out,\nlet say take the first one, 10BaseT.\n\n444\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.290\nAll right,\nwell what does the 10 stand for?\n\n445\n00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.840\nStands for the transmission speed,\nit's Ethernet, 10 megs,\n\n446\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.450\nbase band signaling,\nthat's what the base stands for, right.\n\n447\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.798\nAcross an Ethernet communication,\nwe only got a single communication,\n\n448\n00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:30.310\nit's base band communication.\n\n449\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.540\nWe've got a single communication type,\nit just happens to be Ethernet, right.\n\n450\n00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.640\nIn broadband, you use multiple channels,\nright, multiple frequencies, right.\n\n451\n00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.050\nWe use things like frequency divisional\nmultiplexing in order to take more than\n\n452\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.280\none signal and cross the wire, right.\n\n453\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.314\nIn Ethernet, it's baseband signaling,\n\n454\n00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:51.317\nthere's a single signal going\nacross that medium at any time.\n\n455\n00:25:51.317 --> 00:25:54.458\nAnd we use discrete time slots,\nthat's the TDMA,\n\n456\n00:25:54.458 --> 00:25:57.537\nthe time divisional multiplexing for\nEthernet.\n\n457\n00:25:57.537 --> 00:26:00.918\nNow that's the base,\nwhat's that alphabet character,\n\n458\n00:26:00.918 --> 00:26:04.250\nthat alphabetic character\nat the end right?\n\n459\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:09.970\nOr alphabetical if you will, [LAUGH] T,\nwell, it tells you what the media type is.\n\n460\n00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.190\nAnd in this case,\nT stands for twisted pair.\n\n461\n00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.060\nSo we've got transmission speed,\nsignaling type, media code.\n\n462\n00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.320\nAny time you see T, it's twisted\npair implementations, all right.\n\n463\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.535\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead, and\neven though I've got LX and\n\n464\n00:26:24.535 --> 00:26:27.490\nBaseSX here,\nwe're gonna leave those for our fiber.\n\n465\n00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.430\nWe'll come back to those, you get\na taste of them, go study, go Google it.\n\n466\n00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.053\nCome back with our fiber-\n&gt;&gt; It's a tease if you will.\n\n467\n00:26:33.053 --> 00:26:36.030\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but I only wanna\nlook at the T standards right now.\n\n468\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.948\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n469\n00:26:36.948 --> 00:26:42.103\n&gt;&gt; So 100 megabits in the 100BaseT,\nsame thing on the last part of it,\n\n470\n00:26:42.103 --> 00:26:46.464\nit's baseband signaling,\ntwisted pair implementations.\n\n471\n00:26:46.464 --> 00:26:51.917\n1000BaseT, guess what,\nit's gigabit Ethernet, 1000 megabits,\n\n472\n00:26:51.917 --> 00:26:56.475\nright, baseband signalling,\ntwisted pair implementations.\n\n473\n00:26:56.475 --> 00:27:01.240\nAnd if I remember right the TX that's\ngonna be a pair of twisted pairs\n\n474\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.592\nmore than one cable, all right.\n\n475\n00:27:03.592 --> 00:27:07.981\nThe last one that I'll talk about,\nlike I said I'll save the LX and SX,\n\n476\n00:27:07.981 --> 00:27:09.737\nthose are fiber standards,\n\n477\n00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:15.310\nwe'll come back to those in our fiber\ncabling solutions show, is 10GBaseT.\n\n478\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:21.875\nWe look at 10GBaseT, I'm also so\nused to always saying 10BaseT.\n\n479\n00:27:21.875 --> 00:27:25.925\nNow we're talking about\nas Ethernet evolves,\n\n480\n00:27:25.925 --> 00:27:28.825\nwe go to 10 gigabit Ethernet networks.\n\n481\n00:27:28.825 --> 00:27:31.401\nRight, over twisted pair,\nthat's what it means.\n\n482\n00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:38.045\n10G is a 10 gigabit speed baseband\nsignaling with Ethernet as its media type.\n\n483\n00:27:38.045 --> 00:27:41.280\nAll right, so it is important\nthat you know these standards.\n\n484\n00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.360\nNow, I've also talked about Ethernet as\nbeing 802.3 standard in other episodes and\n\n485\n00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.550\nI think I might have mentioned\nit a little bit in here.\n\n486\n00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.920\nEthernet also has an IEEE 802 standard,\nand\n\n487\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.570\nI want you to be aware of those\nassociated standards, right,\n\n488\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.390\nthe IEEE standard, and how these\nbase standards, where do they apply.\n\n489\n00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:05.085\nSo if you will remember this for\nthe exam, all right, your 100BaseT,\n\n490\n00:28:05.085 --> 00:28:10.710\nI'm gonna throw a couple extra at you,\nis actually an 802.3j Ethernet standard.\n\n491\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.628\n1000BaseT is 802.3ab,\nand then the last one,\n\n492\n00:28:15.628 --> 00:28:20.545\n10GBaseT is a newer one,\nrelatively newer one I know by\n\n493\n00:28:20.545 --> 00:28:25.720\nnow it's been around for\na bit, is 802.3an.\n\n494\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.960\nKnow these Ethernet deployments so that if\nthey ask you these questions on the exam,\n\n495\n00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.140\nyou will be able to get them right.\n\n496\n00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Wes, is there standards for\ntermination points?\n\n497\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.200\n&gt;&gt; There are and termination points\nwhen we talk about these standards,\n\n498\n00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.220\nI want you to think about,\nI have a whole bunch of copper conductors\n\n499\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:48.260\nthat I need to terminate in a small space,\nall right.\n\n500\n00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.650\nAnd that is where we get what are known\nas the different block types.\n\n501\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.702\nWhen we look at the different block types,\nI've got a few up here,\n\n502\n00:28:56.702 --> 00:28:59.441\nthe first one they call out is\nwhat's known as a 66 block.\n\n503\n00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:03.515\nYou might've seen these if you've\never been in a commercial building,\n\n504\n00:29:03.515 --> 00:29:08.060\nyou probably seen that there was a piece\nof plywood somewhere in a back room.\n\n505\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.613\nAnd then you would see all of these\ntelephone cables coming in, snaking, and\n\n506\n00:29:11.613 --> 00:29:13.210\nbeing punched down to it, right.\n\n507\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.578\nAll right, they call them punch down tool,\n\n508\n00:29:15.578 --> 00:29:19.820\na little tool that what you do is it\nstrips, embeds, and trims off the excess.\n\n509\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.490\nAnd these are called punch down blocks\nessentially, and this is a 66 block.\n\n510\n00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.770\nThere are two different kinds that\nthey ask you about on the exam,\n\n511\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.850\na 66 block and a 110 block.\n\n512\n00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.530\nPlease do not think that that has anything\nto do with how many devices can be\n\n513\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:34.700\nconnected to it, it does not.\n\n514\n00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.550\nIt has to do with the electrical\ncharacteristics of the block\n\n515\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.505\nitself, right.\n\n516\n00:29:39.505 --> 00:29:42.950\nSo even though it's called a 66 block,\ntypically used for phone cables,\n\n517\n00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:47.690\nyou can have 12 four-pair cables, or\n\n518\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.430\n50 pairs that are punched down\nto this single block, right.\n\n519\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:56.080\nSo again, don't think that it's the amount\nof devices that are connected or\n\n520\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.520\nthe amount of connection,\nit defines the electrical characteristics.\n\n521\n00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.210\nAnd it is typically mounted vertically,\n\n522\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.680\nnotice the vertical\nmounting position here.\n\n523\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:11.190\nNow the other one that they call out\nis what is known as the 110 block.\n\n524\n00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:15.640\nNow you can see that there's a lot of\ndifference here in this 110 block.\n\n525\n00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.140\nIt's mounted horizontally and\n\n526\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.820\nlook how many connections\nare being terminated here.\n\n527\n00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.320\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n528\n00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.488\n&gt;&gt; Again, mounted horizontally this one,\nif you will,\n\n529\n00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:29.576\nthe 110, has greater electrical\ncapabilities, if you will.\n\n530\n00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:32.542\nAnd this is usually to terminate\nstructured cabling, and\n\n531\n00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:34.606\nyou can see that here in the background.\n\n532\n00:30:34.606 --> 00:30:39.368\nAll of these cables that\nare coming in to it,\n\n533\n00:30:39.368 --> 00:30:43.746\nnow what we're talking about a 100,\n\n534\n00:30:43.746 --> 00:30:48.895\n200, 300 pairs right, and it could be,\n\n535\n00:30:48.895 --> 00:30:53.142\nor I'm sorry, it is 100, 200 or\n\n536\n00:30:53.142 --> 00:30:57.760\n300 with rows of 50 pairs a piece.\n\n537\n00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.250\nSee how many they are, I had to make\nsure I get my numbers right here,\n\n538\n00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.940\nand I don't know if they're gonna ask you\nabout the numbers on the exam, right.\n\n539\n00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.400\nI just want you to know that it's about\nthe electrical capabilities, right.\n\n540\n00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.950\nI can have all of those pairs 100,\n200 and 300,\n\n541\n00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:14.870\nright, total on a single 110\nblock at 50 pairs per row,\n\n542\n00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:20.210\nversus a max of about 50 pairs in\na single, one of those 66 blocks.\n\n543\n00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.795\nSo, definitely know about them.\n\n544\n00:31:22.795 --> 00:31:27.720\nBut the last things that I wanna talk\nabout is what is known as a patch panel.\n\n545\n00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.310\nNow when we look at a patch panel,\nwe've talked a lot about our cabling and\n\n546\n00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:36.720\nour termination of twisted pair\nimplementations, all right.\n\n547\n00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:41.320\nNow when all of your twisted pair\nimplementations essentially go\n\n548\n00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.950\ndown across all of the different\nconnections you have in a building.\n\n549\n00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.190\nThey come down the vertical runs and\n\n550\n00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.985\nthey come into like a telecommunications\ncloset like a server closet.\n\n551\n00:31:50.985 --> 00:31:51.980\nWell, where do they terminate at?\n\n552\n00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.570\nAnd that's where the patch panel comes up,\nand\n\n553\n00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:59.490\nI can actually show you a patch panel\nhere and let's see if we can find one.\n\n554\n00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.596\nThere we go,\nthe first one in the list there.\n\n555\n00:32:01.596 --> 00:32:07.440\nLooks like it's gonna correct me here, and\nyeah there we go Wikipedia's got one here.\n\n556\n00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.830\nMake sure that we find a good one,\nthere we go perfect.\n\n557\n00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.630\nAll right so this is a patch panel and\nwhat is happening here essentially is\n\n558\n00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.320\nall of your structured,\ntwisted pair implementations.\n\n559\n00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.407\nYou could have 500 computers,\na 1,000 computers in a building,\n\n560\n00:32:23.407 --> 00:32:25.250\nwhere do all those cables run?\n\n561\n00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.390\nWell they run vertically and\nthen horizontally through the building.\n\n562\n00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:32.040\nThey go down vertical shafts,\nusually into a telecommunications closet.\n\n563\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.764\nSometimes on the first floor,\nif you're multi high rise building,\n\n564\n00:32:36.764 --> 00:32:38.920\nit might be upper floor.\n\n565\n00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.460\nBut for the most part, what they do and\nwhat they will do is basically terminate\n\n566\n00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.150\ninto a single point, and\nthat's what the patch panel is.\n\n567\n00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.390\nOn the back of the patch panel,\n\n568\n00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:50.600\nthis is where you're going to strip\noff all the outer jackets, right.\n\n569\n00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.870\nYou're gonna spread out all the individual\nconductors and just like, one of those 66\n\n570\n00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:59.110\nblocks you're gonna punch each individual\ncable to the back of the patch panel.\n\n571\n00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.380\nAnd then what you can\ndo as an administrator,\n\n572\n00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.120\nrather than having to strip anymore\ncables, you use patch cable, all right.\n\n573\n00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.038\nAnd you connect a pair of drops by\njust moving the patch panel cables,\n\n574\n00:33:08.038 --> 00:33:09.914\nkinda like the old switchboard operators.\n\n575\n00:33:09.914 --> 00:33:10.807\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what I was thinking.\n\n576\n00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:14.136\n&gt;&gt; They didn't rewire\nthe communications closet, right.\n\n577\n00:33:14.136 --> 00:33:17.131\nWhat they would do is they would\njust move the plugs, right,\n\n578\n00:33:17.131 --> 00:33:18.490\nfrom one plug to the next.\n\n579\n00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.610\nWell, that's essentially what a patch\npanel is, a patch panel is like the old\n\n580\n00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.053\noperator switchboard for your twisted\npair, or Ethernet implementations today.\n\n581\n00:33:27.053 --> 00:33:30.813\nSo know some of these copper standards\nthat we've been talking about,\n\n582\n00:33:30.813 --> 00:33:34.071\nso that if they ask you,\nthey put you in scenarios on the exam,\n\n583\n00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:37.157\npay attention to the keywords so\nthat you can get it right.\n\n584\n00:33:37.157 --> 00:33:39.029\nSo that next time you\nset that Network + exam,\n\n585\n00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:41.205\nyou're going to get those answers right.\n\n586\n00:33:41.205 --> 00:33:46.165\n&gt;&gt; And all you have to do is pay attention\nto Wes, because he's got the answers in\n\n587\n00:33:46.165 --> 00:33:49.345\ncabling solutions-copper parts one,\ntwo, and three.\n\n588\n00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:52.195\nReview them, you'll be glad you did,\nand take a look at all the other\n\n589\n00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:56.735\nhundreds of videos available in our course\nlibrary that will all help you go further.\n\n590\n00:33:56.735 --> 00:34:00.085\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be very glad you did.\n\n591\n00:34:00.085 -->

00:00:12.088\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.236\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:16.240\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.070\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Comp TIA Net +,\n\n7\n00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.920\nthis episode is Cabling Solutions-Fiber.\n\n8\n00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600\nAnd we've asked our IT expert and\n\n9\n00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.160\nall around great guy Wes Bryan\nback to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.030\nWes, good to see you again sir thanks for\ncoming.\n\n11\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.650\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Zach thanks for having me\nback, yep, it's always fun to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.730\nThat's right we are talking,\njust like Zach said, about fiber.\n\n13\n00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.379\nKeep in mind that we've really\ntalked about a couple of different,\n\n14\n00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.650\nI would say, media types, right.\n\n15\n00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.460\nIn general when we boil it down\nwe have copper and we have fiber.\n\n16\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.560\nNow if you're not aware of all\nthe copper standards, go back and\n\n17\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.700\nwatch those episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.720\nAnd if you happen to be studying\nright now for your Net + exam, and\n\n19\n00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.940\nyou're just looking for fiber,\nwell you've come to the right place.\n\n20\n00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.900\nBecause fiber is what we're gonna be\ntalking about in this episode here.\n\n21\n00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.870\n&gt;&gt; And I just have a question\nright off the bat, Wes.\n\n22\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.410\nWhen it comes to the copper and the fiber,\nI know there's different applications.\n\n23\n00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410\nIs there any one better than\nthe other what do you think?\n\n24\n00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.238\n&gt;&gt; It really is always gonna be one\nof those ones, I'll say it depends,\n\n25\n00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.758\nwhat a great answer right.\n\n26\n00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:15.819\n[LAUGH] It doesn't really\ngive you an answer,\n\n27\n00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.532\nit's almost like answering\nan answer with a question, but\n\n28\n00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:21.424\nlet's talk about what I mean when\nI say it depends, all right.\n\n29\n00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:22.882\nSo if you have money,\n\n30\n00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:27.930\nif you are one these companies that\ncan throw money at any problem.\n\n31\n00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.635\nAnd money is not an option,\nyou really should be running fiber.\n\n32\n00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:35.550\nHands down, you should be running fiber\nagain, because if you don't have to worry\n\n33\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.470\nabout the advanced training that\nit takes on your technicians to\n\n34\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.280\nmake fiber optic cables, to terminate\nthem and stuff, then you are doing good.\n\n35\n00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.020\nHowever, copper is a little bit more\nprevalent because it's less expensive\n\n36\n00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.770\nthan fiber.\n\n37\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.420\nNow, they both have their goods and\nthey both have their bads, right.\n\n38\n00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.230\nAgain copper, one of the good things would\nbe that it's less expensive than fiber is.\n\n39\n00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.870\nHowever, it does have some\ndrawbacks because the expense\n\n40\n00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.260\ncan start to really creep up towards\nfiber if you're worried about things like\n\n41\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.308\nelectromagnetic interference,\nright, that's a big thing.\n\n42\n00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:10.451\nAnd Zach we've talked about that\npretty heavily in that other episode\n\n43\n00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:13.070\non the cabling solutions when\nit comes to copper, right.\n\n44\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.520\nBecause I have electromagnetic energy that\nis sent down copper conductors, right,\n\n45\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.609\nand if we're near things like\nhigh voltage power sources,\n\n46\n00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.220\nright, HVPs and throw a whole bunch\nof acronyms here right up front.\n\n47\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.840\nHVAC systems, heating, ventilation,\nand AC, if we're worried about things\n\n48\n00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.130\nlike plenums we talked about,\nthat could run a problem, right.\n\n49\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.514\nSo we definitely have things to consider,\nbut the main thing really boils down to\n\n50\n00:02:36.514 --> 00:02:40.322\nI would say, in my opinion, and\nyou might disagree with me out there.\n\n51\n00:02:40.322 --> 00:02:46.424\nAnd some of you probably laid cabling and\nhave seen this before, but copper again,\n\n52\n00:02:46.424 --> 00:02:51.410\nits benefit, it can be a lot less\nexpensive than fiber optic media.\n\n53\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.340\nHowever, it's typically a shorter\nrange unless you're talking\n\n54\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.680\nabout the traditional PST inlines, those\npublic switch telephone network lines.\n\n55\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.756\nBut it's susceptible to\nelectromagnetic interference, right.\n\n56\n00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:07.623\nOn the other hand fiber, fiber\nsolutions now they're more expensive,\n\n57\n00:03:07.623 --> 00:03:11.470\nright out the gate we gotta\nthrow that out there, right.\n\n58\n00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.030\nBut if again, you're one of these\ncompanies that can throw money at any\n\n59\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.429\nproblem, and that's not a problem\nthen definitely go with fiber.\n\n60\n00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:22.120\nBecause you have an immunity\nto electromagnetic interfere.\n\n61\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.136\nNow let's be careful when I say that,\n\n62\n00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.097\nyou're immune to electromagnetic\ninterference, but\n\n63\n00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:31.138\nit doesn't mean that you can just treat\nthe cables any way you want, right.\n\n64\n00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:35.080\nYou do have things that you have to worry\nabout when it comes to fiber optic cables.\n\n65\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.779\nBecause you are sending a highly\nconcentrated light source down\n\n66\n00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.570\na highly concentrated core, right.\n\n67\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.452\nThese cores are microns of an inch, and\nmillionths of a meter, all right, or\n\n68\n00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:50.005\nmicrons, millionths of a meter,\nmixed two systems there together.\n\n69\n00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:54.337\nAnd a bend in the cable could disrupt\nthe signal, right, just a bend,\n\n70\n00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:56.550\nall right, so that's a drawback.\n\n71\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.930\nHowever, speed,\n\n72\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.440\nit's pretty much the fastest\ntransmission medium we have, right.\n\n73\n00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.752\nIn fact, we've got technologies that\nreally can't saturate the full potential\n\n74\n00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:07.573\nof a fiber-optic cable, right.\n\n75\n00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:10.616\nBecause we can only flash lights on and\noff so\n\n76\n00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:14.910\nfast to really completely\nsaturate these cables.\n\n77\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.420\nThe other thing about fiber is, it's also\none of the longest transmission distances\n\n78\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.200\nwhen it comes to bounded media, right.\n\n79\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.800\nRemember when we talk to about bounded\nmedia, not to throw jargon at you,\n\n80\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.780\nif it's the first episode\nmaybe your'e watching.\n\n81\n00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.821\nBounded media, right,\n\n82\n00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:30.780\nI have a physical cable that's making\ncontact between two end points, right.\n\n83\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.040\nVersus unbounded media, which is radiated\nenergy, whether it's satellite, microwave,\n\n84\n00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.050\nRF signals, right, we don't have those\nphysical limitations, all right.\n\n85\n00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.515\nSo as far as when we talk about\nfiber optic communication it\n\n86\n00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:47.465\nquite literally is the longest bounded\ntransmission media we have on the planet.\n\n87\n00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:53.365\nIn fact, when we talk about running\nnetwork cables that connect continents\n\n88\n00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:57.875\ntogether, right, transatlantic,\nPacific, transpacific.\n\n89\n00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:02.675\nI guess you would say oceanic cabling\nsystems, that literally connect these\n\n90\n00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:06.600\ncontinents together, we're not running\ncopper, right, we're not running fiber.\n\n91\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.530\nWhat they're doing is,\nthey sent me ships out to sea and\n\n92\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.520\nthey have these huge bundles,\nthey call them trunks but\n\n93\n00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.658\nhuge bundles that have many, many,\nmany fiber optic cables in them.\n\n94\n00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:20.920\nAnd every so often, just like copper,\nwe have a maximum transmission distance\n\n95\n00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.870\nthat we can use,\nwe don't get out of the ballpark on that.\n\n96\n00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.537\nYou don't get to just alleviate that,\nor walk away from it, right.\n\n97\n00:05:26.537 --> 00:05:28.997\nWe've got a maximum transmission distance,\nso\n\n98\n00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:31.463\nwhat they do is they put\nrepeaters in that cable.\n\n99\n00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.643\nAnd they take them out there and\nthey lay them to sea and\n\n100\n00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:35.940\nthey literally connect\ncontinents together, right.\n\n101\n00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.844\nWe have some cables and some standards\nthat the one cable will go 40 kilometers,\n\n102\n00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:43.631\n40 kilometers 40,000 meters right.\n\n103\n00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.895\nAnd if you remember some of\nour copper implementations,\n\n104\n00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:49.819\nwe were talking about things like,\nfor instance,\n\n105\n00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.860\nyour twisted pair implementation 100\nmeters versus 40,000 meters, right.\n\n106\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.705\nSo again you have benefits and\nyou have drawbacks, and again if you need\n\n107\n00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:05.065\nnetwork communications inside of things\nlike a radiology department right.\n\n108\n00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:09.267\nThe expense of getting shielded\ncabling to be able to protect against\n\n109\n00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:13.831\nthe electromagnetic interference might\nnot really justify the cost, and\n\n110\n00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:16.450\nat that point you have\nto go to fiber optic.\n\n111\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.165\nSo there is a certain point where\ncopper starts coming up in price,\n\n112\n00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:22.460\nrelative to electromagnetic interference,\n\n113\n00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.790\nthat you might just be better\nrunning fiber optic communications.\n\n114\n00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.680\nThe other thing, too, you might have\nlimitations on copper media cuz I want you\n\n115\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.990\nto think of what a long copper rod is\nin the middle of a lightning storm,\n\n116\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.505\n&gt;&gt; Well wouldn't that be a lightning rod,\n\n117\n00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:36.250\nWes?\n\n118\n00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.908\n&gt;&gt; Right, 2 plus 2 on that one definitely\nequals 4, but if you think about it,\n\n119\n00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:43.430\nan example is like a school.\n\n120\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.710\nA school that has like an awning,\n\n121\n00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.380\nlike an open area where you\ndrop your kids off, right.\n\n122\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.140\nWe can't run copper cables to connect the\nnetwork across that line, that open space,\n\n123\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.330\nbecause if lightning hits it,\nwhat's gonna happen, right?\n\n124\n00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.774\nThat lightning's gonna follow that copper\nmedia, the electrical current's gonna\n\n125\n00:06:58.774 --> 00:07:01.800\nfollow that copper media and it' gonna\nfry things inside of the building.\n\n126\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.765\nSo when you have areas like that where you\nhave a large gap that it's gonna run over\n\n127\n00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:09.223\nan open space, you might be better\nusing fiber optic cables, right.\n\n128\n00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:14.047\nSo again, fiber optics,\nit has its benefits, again keep in mind,\n\n129\n00:07:14.047 --> 00:07:16.515\nthe drawback is it's expensive.\n\n130\n00:07:16.515 --> 00:07:20.612\nIt typically takes highly trained\ntechnicians in order to do things like\n\n131\n00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:22.031\nterminations, right.\n\n132\n00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.055\nWe were talking about in\nour copper series there,\n\n133\n00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:27.719\nabout the termination standards, right.\n\n134\n00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:32.048\nWe just cut the cable,\nwe arrange the copper conductors, right,\n\n135\n00:07:32.048 --> 00:07:36.858\ninto a certain pattern whichever\nTES 568 standard that we're using.\n\n136\n00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:39.890\nWe put the connector on the end of it and\nwe crimp it down we're good to go.\n\n137\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.080\nCoaxial, not much different either,\nright, it's slightly different process,\n\n138\n00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.520\nbut we're peeling the outer jacket off,\nright.\n\n139\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.606\nWe're exposing the central copper\nconductor, putting the BNC connector on\n\n140\n00:07:49.606 --> 00:07:52.370\nthe end of it, and you use a crimp and\nthe same thing applies, right.\n\n141\n00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.578\nAnd it seeps and\nputs the BNC connector together.\n\n142\n00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:59.725\nFiber optic cables They don't tolerate.\n\n143\n00:07:59.725 --> 00:08:03.080\nLike it's not so easy to terminate, right?\n\n144\n00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.360\nYou need, we're talking when you talk\nabout microns you're talking about\n\n145\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.700\nmillions of a meter and\nthere's no tolerance.\n\n146\n00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.800\nIt's not very tolerant all, all right?\n\n147\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.040\nSo, let's talk a little bit about what\nthe fiber optic cable looks like.\n\n148\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.070\nAll right, the fiber optic cable\nis a little bit different,\n\n149\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.840\nif you will,\nthen what we know is the copper media.\n\n150\n00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.354\nIt does share some of the same\ncharacteristics as far as like the outer\n\n151\n00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:26.142\njacket goes and\n\n152\n00:08:26.142 --> 00:08:29.548\nin fact I got a picture that we've\ngot up here from Wikipedia here.\n\n153\n00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:33.090\nThey got a really good one\nhere the fibre optic cable.\n\n154\n00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.412\nAnd what you have here is you\nhave these glass cords, right.\n\n155\n00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:40.480\nIt could be plastic cords, but\nyou have these glass cords right here.\n\n156\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.320\nAnd these can be anywhere from 9 microns,\n9 millionths of a meter in\n\n157\n00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.230\ndiameter, or they can 50 or 62.5 microns.\n\n158\n00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.401\nAnd again, we're talking 62.5\nmillionths of a meter, right.\n\n159\n00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:55.567\nSo very, very small, right.\n\n160\n00:08:55.567 --> 00:09:01.180\nSo, when I say highly concentrated\na light source, very concentrated, right.\n\n161\n00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.330\nAnd then what you end up having,\n\n162\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.860\nis you have what's known as\nreflective cladding, all right.\n\n163\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.510\nAnd in reflective cladding it is important\nto keep in mind that what we do is,\n\n164\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.683\nyou're really trying for what's known as\ntotal internal refraction, all right.\n\n165\n00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:17.857\nI wanna bounce the light source,\ndepending on what kind you're using,\n\n166\n00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.376\nwhich we'll get into in a second.\n\n167\n00:09:19.376 --> 00:09:22.701\nI wanna bounce the light source\noff of that reflective cladding,\n\n168\n00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:25.310\nusing refraction to keep\nit internal to the cable.\n\n169\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.020\nThat's how the signal will propagate\nitself in certain media types, right.\n\n170\n00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.970\nAnd then you have things like\nstrengthening fibers, right.\n\n171\n00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.790\nStrengthening fibers are important\njust because we have to protect\n\n172\n00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.070\nthat glass core.\n\n173\n00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.420\nOr, again,\nit could be plastic core commonly today.\n\n174\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.110\nIt's glass cores, right?\n\n175\n00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.280\nAnd then finally,\n\n176\n00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.920\nwe've go the insulating jacket that's\naround the outside, all right.\n\n177\n00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.940\nAnd one of the great things\nabout the insulating jackets is\n\n178\n00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.840\nwhen we get into some of the different\nmedia types that fiber has,\n\n179\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.580\nthe jacketing is gonna be the same size.\n\n180\n00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.420\nSo that's essentially what you have\ninside of your fiber optic cables.\n\n181\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.470\n&gt;&gt; So Wes is there different fiber types?\n\n182\n00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:08.240\nThere are and that's a, [LAUGH] we're not\nshort on standards on the fiber sides act,\n\n183\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.400\njust like we weren't on\nthe copper solutions either.\n\n184\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.900\nAnd really when we talk about media types,\n\n185\n00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.360\nit really is gonna boil down to\nwhat your implementation is.\n\n186\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.320\nYou asked about copper and fiber.\n\n187\n00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.930\nIs it contingent on\nthe application that you're using?\n\n188\n00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.700\nAnd I would say, yes,\non both counts, right.\n\n189\n00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.290\nSo, yes to the media types as well.\n\n190\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.860\nIn fact, let's go ahead and let's talk\nabout two of the media types that\n\n191\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.670\nthey want you to be aware of on the exam.\n\n192\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.880\nWe have what's known as multimode fiber,\n\n193\n00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.630\nwe also have what's known\nas singlemode fiber.\n\n194\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.600\nAll right now, when you look at multimode\nfiber, multimode fiber not called out\n\n195\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.640\non the exam which is great for\nyour memorization purposes.\n\n196\n00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.160\nBut they have an older one\nthat's called step index and\n\n197\n00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.550\nthen graded index multimode.\n\n198\n00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.880\nSo, even multimode two will kinda\nbreak down in to it's own classes.\n\n199\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.441\nBut we're just gonna talk about here,\nmultimode in general, all right.\n\n200\n00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:01.600\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n201\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.590\nSo I got a little diagram here, and\nwe kinda talk about some of the specifics\n\n202\n00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.230\nthat I want you to be aware of for\nthe Net Plus exam.\n\n203\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.313\nOne of the first things I want you\nto realise is that when we talk\n\n204\n00:11:11.313 --> 00:11:12.155\nabout multimode,\n\n205\n00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:15.538\nthey call it multimode because notice\nthat we have multiple light sources.\n\n206\n00:11:15.538 --> 00:11:18.936\nAnd that's important to understand because\nthat's gonna be a big difference from\n\n207\n00:11:18.936 --> 00:11:21.180\nthe next one that we're gonna talk about,\nall right.\n\n208\n00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.747\nMultiple light sources,\n\n209\n00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:27.386\nI've heard before it could LED a lot of\nthey can be lasers as well, all right.\n\n210\n00:11:27.386 --> 00:11:29.223\nHowever, not only that,\n\n211\n00:11:29.223 --> 00:11:34.330\nanother thing that I want you to be\naware of is the outer diameter, okay.\n\n212\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.230\nNow, it's interesting here\nbecause the outer diameter\n\n213\n00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.774\nis consistent with both types.\n\n214\n00:11:38.774 --> 00:11:40.814\nWe're gonna talk about multimode\nfirst as we're doing and\n\n215\n00:11:40.814 --> 00:11:42.993\nthen we're going to talk about\nsinglemode coming up, right.\n\n216\n00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:46.260\nThe outer diameter is\nalways a 125 microns.\n\n217\n00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:51.250\nAnd as we've been trying to tell you,\nas we go through our course here,\n\n218\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.490\nis that with the some of the things that\nyou have to memorize, make it easier.\n\n219\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.240\nIf you can remember one thing and\nit applies to different technologies,\n\n220\n00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.770\nyou kinda reduce some of the heavy lifting\nof memorization that you have to do.\n\n221\n00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.740\nI don't care if it's a multimode,\nI don't care if it's a singlemode.\n\n222\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.980\nIt's gonna be a 125 microns for\nthe outer diameter.\n\n223\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.311\nBut what,\nalso with the multiple light sources,\n\n224\n00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:18.050\nwhat really distinguish\na singlemode from multimode.\n\n225\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:22.230\nNot only of the multiple light sources but\nit's the core diameter, all right.\n\n226\n00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.690\nNow, with the core diameter,\nif I can get that in the screen and\n\n227\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.110\nstop making you guys seasick here.\n\n228\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.048\n[LAUGH] With the core diameter,\n\n229\n00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:32.500\nI also want you to be aware of\nthis little Greek letter here.\n\n230\n00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.410\nIf you're not,\nthat's the Greek letter for m.\n\n231\n00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.900\nIt's called mu all right and\nit's also the symbol for microns.\n\n232\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.155\nIf you ever see that I don't know if\nyou're gonna see it on the exam, but\n\n233\n00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:42.483\nif you ever see that, that's what it is.\n\n234\n00:12:42.483 --> 00:12:43.163\n&gt;&gt; Micron.\n\n235\n00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Yep exactly.\n\n236\n00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.580\nSo rather than writing out microns\nthey put that little mu symbol and\n\n237\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.900\nagain that's just the Greek letter for m.\n\n238\n00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.280\nBut notice that it's 50 microns and\nwe also have 62.5.\n\n239\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.860\nNow be careful.\n\n240\n00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.893\nI've been teaching Comp TIA for\nawhile now.\n\n241\n00:13:01.893 --> 00:13:05.612\nAnd I had to go back a couple of times and\nmake sure that I'm very clear on this one,\n\n242\n00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:08.952\nbecause what we're not saying,\nlet me tell you what we're not saying,\n\n243\n00:13:08.952 --> 00:13:10.781\nthen we'll get to what we're saying.\n\n244\n00:13:10.781 --> 00:13:13.998\nWhat we're not saying is\nthat the core diameter,\n\n245\n00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:19.141\nif we could take a look here on real\nquick, isn't between 50-62 microns.\n\n246\n00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:22.330\nThat's not what we're saying,\nit's either/or.\n\n247\n00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.552\nThere are two different multimode\ncable types one is 50 micron core,\n\n248\n00:13:27.552 --> 00:13:29.913\none has a 62.5 micron core.\n\n249\n00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:33.875\nAnd one of the thing is to keep in mind\nis that, the more concentrated the core,\n\n250\n00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:35.990\nthe farther the signal goes.\n\n251\n00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.310\nThe less concentrated the core,\n\n252\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.267\nthere is no chance of things\nlike signal loss, right.\n\n253\n00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.300\nSignal loss happens anyways\nin a fiber optic cable cuz\n\n254\n00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.040\nyou have imperfections in the glass.\n\n255\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.760\nIf we were to take the glass cores and\neven though they're very,\n\n256\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.680\nvery small magnify them several,\nI don't know how many thousands of times,\n\n257\n00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.460\nbut we would find things like air bubbles,\nright.\n\n258\n00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.460\nIf you've ever looked at a piece\nof glass that's been poured or\n\n259\n00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.130\nwhatever however they make it\nyou see little bubbles in it.\n\n260\n00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.710\nWell, the same thing applies\nto your glass cores, right.\n\n261\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.620\nSo the cores here we always\nget signal lost, all right?\n\n262\n00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.390\nThe less concentrated that core,\n\n263\n00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.760\nthe shorter the transmission\ndistance it's gonna be, all right?\n\n264\n00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.310\nSo do keep that in mind and\nunderstand that\n\n265\n00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.930\nwe're not saying from 50 to 62.5,\nit's either way.\n\n266\n00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.860\nThere's two varieties.\n\n267\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.590\nNow, Zach you asked a great question\nearlier in the fact that well,\n\n268\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.770\nif there are one size fits all, right.\n\n269\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.740\nAnd there's not.\n\n270\n00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.730\nAnd then you also, we were talking\nmore about copper versus fiber.\n\n271\n00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.120\nIt doesn't depend on your implementation\nof the application of the fiber that\n\n272\n00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.676\nyou're going to implement.\n\n273\n00:14:41.676 --> 00:14:46.500\nAnd with multimode fiber, multimode\nfiber operates at different distances,\n\n274\n00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.760\ndifferent ranges than singlemode.\n\n275\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.980\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind for\nthe exam is multimode operates at very,\n\n276\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.410\nvery short distances.\n\n277\n00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.689\nDid I say short distances?\n\n278\n00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:59.411\nShort compared to singlemode, which\ncan go up to 40,000 kilometers, right.\n\n279\n00:14:59.411 --> 00:15:00.590\nMultimode's not gonna do that.\n\n280\n00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:06.390\nSo, if we pay attention to the diagram\nhere, medium to short ranges, right.\n\n281\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:12.050\nSo if I need fast fiber optics inside\nof my building, perfect, right.\n\n282\n00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.430\nAverage ranges of your fiber optics,\ncable lengths,\n\n283\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.300\nwhen you're talking about multimode.\n\n284\n00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.940\nI've seen 330, we've seen 550 some of\n\n285\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.510\nthe earlier standards I seen up to 2,000\nmeters but really nothing beyond that.\n\n286\n00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.990\nCommonly you're gonna see some\nof the standards quote things,\n\n287\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.881\nlike 550 meters 330 meters, excuse me.\n\n288\n00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.180\nSo it's really medium to short ranges.\n\n289\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.040\nNow when I say short ranges,\n\n290\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.700\nit's all relative to the bag\nthey were talking fiber.\n\n291\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.170\nFiber's still a long range,\na 550 meter cable is, yeah,\n\n292\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.550\nthat's still a gigantic cable.\n\n293\n00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:49.100\nBut it's gonna be things like in your\nbuildings or if your buildings have\n\n294\n00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.710\nvery little distance,\nyou might run them between, right.\n\n295\n00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.773\nThat's the big thing\nabout multimode fiber.\n\n296\n00:15:56.773 --> 00:15:58.197\nNow that's not the only one, right.\n\n297\n00:15:58.197 --> 00:16:02.179\nSo if we have multimode I've gone and\nmentioned it, we also have singlemode.\n\n298\n00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:06.556\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind\nwith singlemode is that singlemode,\n\n299\n00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:09.444\nits light source is really different,\nright?\n\n300\n00:16:09.444 --> 00:16:10.418\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n301\n00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:16.540\nAll right, singlemode, my guess,\nit's a single light source, all right?\n\n302\n00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.595\nAnd the light source is typically\na high intensity laser.\n\n303\n00:16:20.595 --> 00:16:25.483\nAnd that laser is fired like\na rifle shot between crosshairs\n\n304\n00:16:25.483 --> 00:16:30.186\ndown the center of the core and\nultra concentrated core.\n\n305\n00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:33.574\nWhich is why single mode is the largest,\n\n306\n00:16:33.574 --> 00:16:37.669\nlongest transmission\ndistance bounded media.\n\n307\n00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:41.300\nOr the longest bounded media we\nhave on the planet, all right?\n\n308\n00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.317\nAnd when I say concentrated, I want\nyou to know, notice the core diameter.\n\n309\n00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:46.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.625\n&gt;&gt; Nine microns,\nnine millionths of a meter, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:55.423\nVery hard to tell these from\ntrying to see them, if you will,\n\n312\n00:16:55.423 --> 00:16:57.367\nas to which one's different.\n\n313\n00:16:57.367 --> 00:17:00.624\nSo you really have to go by the markings\non the side of the cable or\n\n314\n00:17:00.624 --> 00:17:02.041\nthe packages themselves.\n\n315\n00:17:02.041 --> 00:17:09.060\nNow, when it comes to your singlemode\nfiber, these are extremely long range,\n\n316\n00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.795\nand I put long range to\nextremely long range, right?\n\n317\n00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:19.097\nCuz you can see 5,000 kilometers,\n1,000 kilometers,\n\n318\n00:17:19.097 --> 00:17:25.166\n200 kilometers, depending on, again,\nwhat kind of devices you have.\n\n319\n00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:27.760\nBecause I have singlemode\ncables that we have.\n\n320\n00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.408\nAnd Zach, you could probably take a guess\nby the fact that I can even pick this up\n\n321\n00:17:31.408 --> 00:17:33.748\nthat this isn't a 40 kilometer cable,\nright?\n\n322\n00:17:33.748 --> 00:17:36.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe that's\na 40 kilometer cable, no.\n\n323\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.273\n&gt;&gt; But it is a singlemode cable,\nnonetheless, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:38.273 --> 00:17:42.769\nSo that's why I say, long ranges\nup to extremely long ranges, but\n\n325\n00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:44.470\nthey could be short too.\n\n326\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.091\nAnd it really depends on\nthe device itself, right?\n\n327\n00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:51.629\nThe communication device that you're using\nas to whether it's going to be multimode\n\n328\n00:17:51.629 --> 00:17:53.860\nor whether it's going to be singlemode.\n\n329\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.709\nNow we could take a look\nat a couple other things.\n\n330\n00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:59.590\nWe've got a couple of\nthe cable types right here.\n\n331\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.959\nAnd Zach, without looking at\nany kind of documentation,\n\n332\n00:18:02.959 --> 00:18:06.821\ncan you tell me the difference\nbetween multimode and singlemode?\n\n333\n00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:08.946\nOther than the fact that I just told you.\n\n334\n00:18:08.946 --> 00:18:11.875\n&gt;&gt; By looking at it, I, no, [LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:15.623\n&gt;&gt; No, and I'm sorry to throw you\na curveball here on camera, but\n\n336\n00:18:15.623 --> 00:18:18.469\nyou're right, that's absolutely correct.\n\n337\n00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:21.820\nI was gonna say, if I hadn't told you,\nand you had got that, I'd say, man,\n\n338\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.890\nyou need to get in the field\nout there real quick.\n\n339\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.090\nWe've got some technicians that\ncould really use your help, and\n\n340\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.363\nagain, all joking aside,\nthat's absolutely correct, right?\n\n341\n00:18:30.363 --> 00:18:32.807\nWe don't know which ones are which,\nall right?\n\n342\n00:18:32.807 --> 00:18:35.076\nAnd we'll get back to that\na little more on how you can tell.\n\n343\n00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:36.824\nBut I'd like to show you,\n\n344\n00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:41.206\nthat this is kind of how we run\na lot of fiber optic cables, right?\n\n345\n00:18:41.206 --> 00:18:44.010\nThis fiber optic cables are inside\nof your server closets,\n\n346\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.151\na lot of times they\nterminate single fibers.\n\n347\n00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:49.606\nOr two fibers if we're about talking\nabout a duplexing configuration,\n\n348\n00:18:49.606 --> 00:18:50.802\nwhich we'll come back.\n\n349\n00:18:50.802 --> 00:18:52.422\nI'm not gonna leave you guys and\n\n350\n00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:55.848\ngirls out there hanging on what I\nmean by duplexing configuration.\n\n351\n00:18:55.848 --> 00:18:58.400\nBut if you look here, we've got a cable.\n\n352\n00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.477\nAnd I don't know if this cable's got,\nyeah, it's got the marking on it,\n\n353\n00:19:02.477 --> 00:19:04.961\nif we could kind of zoom\ninto this right here.\n\n354\n00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.423\nThis is our fiber optic cable, and\n\n355\n00:19:06.423 --> 00:19:10.100\nyou can notice that we've got some of\nthe strengthening fibers over here.\n\n356\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.915\nAll right, and we'll just give that\na second there, and as it clears up,\n\n357\n00:19:14.915 --> 00:19:18.348\nnotice what we see,\nI see that this is a 50 micron.\n\n358\n00:19:18.348 --> 00:19:22.329\nI've got a 50 on one side, and then Zach,\nI don't know if you can see that,\n\n359\n00:19:22.329 --> 00:19:23.640\na forward slash 125.\n\n360\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.878\nAnd again,\nwhat we have here is a multimode cable.\n\n361\n00:19:26.878 --> 00:19:28.896\n&gt;&gt; Right, because if it's 50 micron,\nit'd be multimode.\n\n362\n00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:30.289\n&gt;&gt; You've got it, exactly.\n\n363\n00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:34.511\nNotice it doesn't say between 50 and 62.\n\n364\n00:19:34.511 --> 00:19:37.444\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, we've talked about this\n\n365\n00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:42.131\nin other, in the copper episode,\nthis is a plenum type cable, all right?\n\n366\n00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:45.253\nAnd what that means is that we can\nrun this in air handling spaces.\n\n367\n00:19:45.253 --> 00:19:48.591\nIt means that the jacket that's on\nthe outside of this, if I was to, and\n\n368\n00:19:48.591 --> 00:19:52.225\ntrust me, this is a little magic at home,\nI've already pre-spliced this.\n\n369\n00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:54.465\nSome people would be like, wow,\nyou don't even need clips, but\n\n370\n00:19:54.465 --> 00:19:56.066\nI've actually kind of\nspliced this already.\n\n371\n00:19:56.066 --> 00:19:57.018\n&gt;&gt; Strong like bull!\n\n372\n00:19:57.018 --> 00:19:58.290\n&gt;&gt; That's right, [LAUGH].\n\n373\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this jacket here is made of plenum\n\n374\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.591\ngrade cabling, which means,\nagain, it's really stiff cable.\n\n375\n00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:10.053\nIt's very hard to work with, and I don't\nwant to go into too much bending these\n\n376\n00:20:10.053 --> 00:20:12.159\ncables, and,\nwe'll tell you why in a second.\n\n377\n00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:15.280\nBut that just means that\nin a plenum grade cabling,\n\n378\n00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.723\nI don't have to worry about this when\nit's burnt giving off a toxic gas.\n\n379\n00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:23.743\nVery, very low toxins,\nand very low smoke, and\n\n380\n00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:27.285\nit doesn't allow fire to pass through it.\n\n381\n00:20:27.285 --> 00:20:31.480\nBut if I strip off the outside,\nthe outside protecting jacket, right?\n\n382\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.956\nWe'll take that off, so that's what's\n120 microns, or 125 microns, all right?\n\n383\n00:20:35.956 --> 00:20:43.175\nBut if we look here, and I take, see these\nfibers, it looks like a wig almost, right?\n\n384\n00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And you can see the little fibers that\n\n385\n00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.570\nwe have in here.\n\n386\n00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:50.562\nAnd a lot of times, when we're running\nfiber optic cable, because it's so\n\n387\n00:20:50.562 --> 00:20:51.426\nexpensive.\n\n388\n00:20:51.426 --> 00:20:55.136\nAnd, again, because your technicians are\ngoing to be highly trained to terminate\n\n389\n00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:57.840\nthese devices here,\nyou typically run more than one fiber.\n\n390\n00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.621\nAll right, so what we have here, Zach,\nis more than one fiber optic cable.\n\n391\n00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:03.521\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Even though it\n\n392\n00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:05.835\nlooks like a single\ncable from the outside.\n\n393\n00:21:05.835 --> 00:21:09.858\nThis is actually a bundle of fibers, so\nwe have multiple fiber strands here.\n\n394\n00:21:09.858 --> 00:21:14.002\nAnd I'm not even going to attempt to\ntry to strip off the cladding here so\n\n395\n00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:15.604\nthat you can see the glass.\n\n396\n00:21:15.604 --> 00:21:19.982\nBecause ultimately the glass is going\nto look quite literally like one little\n\n397\n00:21:19.982 --> 00:21:21.540\nstrand here of this fiber.\n\n398\n00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.367\nI mean, that little thing,\nthat's not a core, but essentially,\n\n399\n00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:27.209\nit's going to look no thicker than\nsome of these fibers right here.\n\n400\n00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:31.610\nSo, this is what you end up seeing inside,\nthese are the strengthening fibers, right?\n\n401\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.250\nAnd you have the protective shielding,\nthe outside casing, if you will, and\n\n402\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.865\nthat's gonna be 120, 125 microns.\n\n403\n00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:42.430\nInside these cores, and\nyou're just gonna have to take my word for\n\n404\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.540\nit, or take the vendor's word for it.\n\n405\n00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.028\nBecause I don't have something\nthat can measure a micron, right?\n\n406\n00:21:48.028 --> 00:21:51.220\nSo these are going to be 50 microns thick.\n\n407\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.330\nNow we can tell that, again, by the side\nof the cable, and that's why it's good,\n\n408\n00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.127\njust like we've showed you guys\nin our copper media, right?\n\n409\n00:22:00.127 --> 00:22:03.877\nIt lets you know what type of cable it is.\n\n410\n00:22:03.877 --> 00:22:07.218\nAnd again, if you can remember\nthat we have 50 microns here,\n\n411\n00:22:07.218 --> 00:22:09.660\nI don't even have to\nlook at anything else.\n\n412\n00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.159\nI can tell that this that this\nis gonna be a multimode cable.\n\n413\n00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:17.632\nNow, if I look at this cable, and\nI turn it on its side, notice that,\n\n414\n00:22:17.632 --> 00:22:20.810\nlet me turn it there so\nyou guys can read it there.\n\n415\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.117\nTurn it the right way,\nit might help, all right, so\n\n416\n00:22:23.117 --> 00:22:24.908\nI see that it's an optical fiber cable.\n\n417\n00:22:24.908 --> 00:22:28.851\nCorning Glass is the one that makes this,\nyou can see Corning right here, but\n\n418\n00:22:28.851 --> 00:22:29.954\nnotice that, Zach?\n\n419\n00:22:29.954 --> 00:22:31.283\nYou notice what that says right there?\n\n420\n00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:35.530\nThat says 9, 9 forward slash 125, right?\n\n421\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.576\nSo I know that at nine microns this is,\n\n422\n00:22:38.576 --> 00:22:42.303\nthis has to be a singlemode\nfiber optic cable.\n\n423\n00:22:42.303 --> 00:22:46.315\nAnd it doesn't really tell us, if we\nlook at these cables again side by side,\n\n424\n00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:47.570\nwe can't really tell.\n\n425\n00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:48.350\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n426\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.202\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's no real way to tell, so\n\n427\n00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.390\nwhat you have to do is you\nhave to pay attention.\n\n428\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.968\nAnd I'll just kind see if I can't\nshake that around a little bit there,\n\n429\n00:22:55.968 --> 00:22:58.380\nyou have to pay attention\nto things like here.\n\n430\n00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.455\nIn here, it will tell you\ntypically what the standard is.\n\n431\n00:23:01.455 --> 00:23:04.695\nIt will tell you what the cable type is,\nand\n\n432\n00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:09.828\nthe bag that this came in actually\nhad stamped right on the outside.\n\n433\n00:23:09.828 --> 00:23:14.153\nTold you what type of connector it was and\nthat it was multimode fiber, right?\n\n434\n00:23:14.153 --> 00:23:20.880\nSo we know that, but we can, for the sake\nof completeness, these are two strands.\n\n435\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.237\nIt's a, I would say, single strand,\nbut that's not technically correct,\n\n436\n00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:23.856\nit's two strands.\n\n437\n00:23:23.856 --> 00:23:26.690\nAnd like I said,\nwe'll come back to what duplexing means.\n\n438\n00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:27.691\nBut there again,\n\n439\n00:23:27.691 --> 00:23:31.170\nwe've got some information on\nthe side of this cable as well.\n\n440\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.415\nAnd I'm sure that if I go through this and\nI kind of look down,\n\n441\n00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:40.185\ndown the cable, eventually, and\nif not, it might just be marked.\n\n442\n00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:45.129\nAnd let's see, 10G, and it's telling me\nit's 300 meters, and that this is for\n\n443\n00:23:45.129 --> 00:23:49.145\n10G fiberoptics and I don't see,\nyeah, I don't see a multimode.\n\n444\n00:23:49.145 --> 00:23:51.885\nSo it's not telling me core type,\nso there again,\n\n445\n00:23:51.885 --> 00:23:54.509\nI'm kind of glad you guys\ncan see this on camera.\n\n446\n00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:57.773\nYou can't always go just\nnecessarily by the cable, and\n\n447\n00:23:57.773 --> 00:24:02.224\nthat's why I always look at the bagging\nthat it comes in, just to make sure.\n\n448\n00:24:02.224 --> 00:24:08.670\nBecause, thank goodness this one and\nthis one showed us what the microns were.\n\n449\n00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.833\nNow that's the other reason\nI want you ladies and\n\n450\n00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:12.478\ngentlemen to keep in mind out there.\n\n451\n00:24:12.478 --> 00:24:15.328\nThat when we're talking about\nsinglemode versus multimode,\n\n452\n00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:17.700\nit is important to know\nthe core diameters, right?\n\n453\n00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.306\nAnd the reason I say that is because,\nif it doesn't say multimode,\n\n454\n00:24:21.306 --> 00:24:23.280\nyou know the core diameters.\n\n455\n00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.916\nYou know that that's a multimode\ncable based on the labeling.\n\n456\n00:24:25.916 --> 00:24:30.780\nIf it doesn't say the core diameter on\nthe cabling, then check on the back or\n\n457\n00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.610\nthe side of the bag, or\nwhen you're doing the ordering.\n\n458\n00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:37.530\nAll right, so,\ndefinitely keep that in mind,\n\n459\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.261\nnow I've kinda just barely\nmentioned connectors, right?\n\n460\n00:24:41.261 --> 00:24:46.134\nWell, one of the things that I want you to\nknow is that there are certain connector\n\n461\n00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:49.200\ntypes that we need to be aware of for\nthis exam.\n\n462\n00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.678\nBut Zach over there [LAUGH] is letting\nme know that I think I've talked a lot\n\n463\n00:24:52.678 --> 00:24:55.316\non this episode, so\nwe might have to go into a part two.\n\n464\n00:24:55.316 --> 00:24:58.158\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI believe that cabling solutions part two,\n\n465\n00:24:58.158 --> 00:25:00.350\nof fiber rather, part two is in order.\n\n466\n00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.514\nAnd this has been cabling solutions fiber\npart one, make sure you see both of them.\n\n467\n00:25:03.514 --> 00:25:07.861\nAnd, in fact, see everything that\nWes is laying out for you for\n\n468\n00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:09.918\nthe CompTIA net plus series.\n\n469\n00:25:09.918 --> 00:25:13.200\nExciting, good for you,\nhelp you with the exams, of course.\n\n470\n00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.007\nAnd, by the way, there's all kinds of\nother videos in our course library,\n\n471\n00:25:17.007 --> 00:25:19.281\nthey are all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n472\n00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:21.164\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPRO.TV,\n\n473\n00:25:21.164 --> 00:25:22.617\nthey'll be very glad that you did.\n\n474\n00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:24.065\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n475\n00:25:24.065 --> 00:25:24.771\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n476\n00:25:24.771 --> 00:25:26.036\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.870\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.080\nchoosing ITProTV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.820\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net +.\n\n6\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.810\nAnd this is Cabling Solutions,\nI know I can say it,\n\n7\n00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.100\nCabling Solutions, Fiber Part Two.\n\n8\n00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.380\nAnd Wes Bryan is once again joining us,\nWes, great to have you, thanks so much.\n\n9\n00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Hey man, I'll tell you what,\nkudos to you on those intros man,\n\n10\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.400\ncuz I can't even get past half\nthe acronyms that we have to talk about.\n\n11\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.080\nHey, it's great to be here, Zach,\nthanks again as always for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.837\nThat's right,\nZach said this is the sequel, right,\n\n13\n00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:46.860\nwe're gonna go into part\ntwo of fibering solutions.\n\n14\n00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.710\nRemember in the first part,\n\n15\n00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.120\nwe really just kind of established some\nof the benefits and drawbacks, right.\n\n16\n00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.195\nCopper versus fiber,\n\n17\n00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:57.620\ncuz maybe you've seen some of our copper\ncabling solution shows that we've got.\n\n18\n00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.306\nIf not,\nyou can always check those out, and\n\n19\n00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:01.790\nthen we also talked about the types,\nright.\n\n20\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.660\nDefinitely look at those\ntypes in part one,\n\n21\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.370\nright, the difference between\nsingle-mode and multi-mode fiber.\n\n22\n00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.330\nNow I kinda left you with a little bit of\na cliffhanger in that last one, didn't I?\n\n23\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, we were talking about\nthe different types, the multi-mode,\n\n24\n00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.240\nthe single-mode, but\nwe didn't talk about connectors.\n\n25\n00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.430\nWe didn't talk about any of that, lets\ntalk about connectors, what do you think?\n\n26\n00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.994\n&gt;&gt; That's a really good thing to\nkinda discuss, and I wanna go ahead,\n\n27\n00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:31.319\nbefore we actually talk about the types\nthemselves, talk about the connectors.\n\n28\n00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.845\nAnd the fact that it's a little bit\ndifferent with fiber-optic media and\n\n29\n00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:39.940\nthe fact that what it takes to\nterminate a fiber solution, right.\n\n30\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.588\nAnd when we talk about copper media,\nas you've seen,\n\n31\n00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:45.880\nwe're dealing with some fairly\nthick copper conductors, right.\n\n32\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.560\nThey're relatively easy to see, but\n\n33\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210\nlike you might have seen in the first\nshow, we demonstrated how small.\n\n34\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.438\nEven without stripping off the cladding,\na single fiber optic core,\n\n35\n00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:02.110\nif you will, a single strand of fiber\nis right, they're very, very small.\n\n36\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.665\nWe're talking 50, 62 or\n\n37\n00:02:03.665 --> 00:02:07.860\n9 microns, especially with the signal\nmode being 9 microns, right.\n\n38\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.175\nYou can almost break it just by\npulling on that fiber strand.\n\n39\n00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:15.285\nSo when it comes to these connector types,\n\n40\n00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:17.455\nplease don't think it's just a slice and\ndice.\n\n41\n00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:20.595\n&gt;&gt; You need what's known\nas a field fusion splicer.\n\n42\n00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:23.132\nAnd a field fusion splicer,\nthey do have some rough and\n\n43\n00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:26.673\ndirty ones that'll at least give you\nthe ability to get the cable repaired.\n\n44\n00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:28.073\nBut you've gotta do polishing,\n\n45\n00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:30.425\nyou gotta make sure that\nthe ends are polished, right.\n\n46\n00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.497\nBecause any bend in the light\ncan cause signal loss and\n\n47\n00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:37.603\nyou're always getting signal\nloss in fiber optic cables.\n\n48\n00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.863\nSo, there's not a lot of tolerances there,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n49\n00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:44.263\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nsome of the things that you could see that\n\n50\n00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:47.083\nmight be problematic when it\ncomes to fiber optic solutions,\n\n51\n00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.623\nwhen we get into some of\nthe troubleshooting shows.\n\n52\n00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:49.738\nBut I want you to know,\n\n53\n00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:53.500\n[LAUGH] it typically takes\na highly trained technician.\n\n54\n00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.140\nA field technician doesn't go\nout there and gonna fix and\n\n55\n00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.900\nterminate the fiber-optic cables.\n\n56\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.920\nThey usually have fusion splicers and\nfusion splicers can get very,\n\n57\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.648\nvery expensive.\n\n58\n00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:06.110\nThey could be a few hundred dollars up to\na few hundreds of thousands of dollars\n\n59\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.550\ndepending, right, so definitely not\nsomething to take lightly for sure.\n\n60\n00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.330\nSo, now back to your question,\nthe connector types.\n\n61\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.940\nWe've got three that we really\nhave to worry about and\n\n62\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.145\nthen slight variations of those\nthree that we need to talk about.\n\n63\n00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:23.651\nAnd yes, that's right,\nback with acronyms [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.560\nas always here in anything Net + or\nwell really CompTIA exams, right.\n\n65\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.420\nThe first ones that they call out are ST,\n\n66\n00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.860\nwell actually the ones I called out,\nST, [LAUGH] SC, and LC.\n\n67\n00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.640\nAll right now [LAUGH] what do\nwe even mean by that right?\n\n68\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.958\nMake sense of that all right,\n\n69\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.606\nwell let's talk about the very\nfirst one that I mentioned.\n\n70\n00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.610\nAnd that is something\nknown as straight tip,\n\n71\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.900\nall right, ST standard tipped,\nstraight tip as you might hear it called.\n\n72\n00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.310\nThis is a slightly older fiber\noptic cable, still in use today.\n\n73\n00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.622\nNow it's not as old as things like\nthe Biconic, which is pretty much largely\n\n74\n00:03:58.622 --> 00:04:01.170\nobsolete it was on the very\nfirst fiber optic connectors.\n\n75\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.190\nAnd kinda got a picture of it, we've seen\nsomething that almost looks like this.\n\n76\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.120\nNotice the fiber connector at the end\nthere, and it's interesting Zach,\n\n77\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.570\nyou were with me in\nthe copper shows right?\n\n78\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.495\nIf you remember we talked about BNC, so\n\n79\n00:04:15.495 --> 00:04:19.405\nthis straight tip connector\nhas a BNC twist to lock.\n\n80\n00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:22.558\nSo it really looks like that Bayonet\nright Neill-Concelman connector that\n\n81\n00:04:22.558 --> 00:04:23.900\nwe're talking about.\n\n82\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.580\nAnd that's hence, the reason they\ncall it a straight tip connector.\n\n83\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.130\nBut it's not the only one that you\nneed to be aware of for the exam,\n\n84\n00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.290\nwe've got a couple more.\n\n85\n00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.900\nAnd I wanna talk about LC and\nI wanna talk about SC.\n\n86\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.160\nBut let's go ahead and\nlet's dive in to the SC connector first.\n\n87\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.340\nThis is what's known as standard\nconnector or subscriber connector.\n\n88\n00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.574\nAnd again,\ndepends on where you're looking at,\n\n89\n00:04:46.574 --> 00:04:48.977\nyou could call it subscriber connector,\nall right.\n\n90\n00:04:48.977 --> 00:04:52.675\nAnd the subscriber connector,\nthis one again, is still used today, but\n\n91\n00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:56.029\nagain it's kinda been replaced by\nthe next one we'll talk about.\n\n92\n00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:01.060\nAnd you can see that what we have is we\nhave two interlocking connectors here.\n\n93\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.840\nThey could be a single connector,\nthey could be a pair.\n\n94\n00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.231\nA lot of times what you'll find\nis these are paired together, and\n\n95\n00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.870\nthe reason they're paired together is for\nwhat's known as a duplexing configuration.\n\n96\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.977\nIn fact, I tell you what, let's talk\nabout the next one here coming up and\n\n97\n00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:18.243\nthen we'll show you.\n\n98\n00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:21.507\nRather than just show you the pictures,\nwe've actually got some of these cables\n\n99\n00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:24.620\nthat really utilizes both, and\nwe'll go to them here in a second.\n\n100\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.880\nLet's talk about the next one, and\n\n101\n00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.180\nthe next one is what is known\nas a Lucient connector.\n\n102\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.260\nAnd here's a picture of\nthe Lucent connector,\n\n103\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.670\nyou might hear it called local contact,\nI've also heard it called.\n\n104\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.890\nA characteristic of this connector\nthat I want you to remember for\n\n105\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.460\nthe exam to help you memorize it,\nmight help you, little connector.\n\n106\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.005\nThat's how I remembered it for\nthe exam because when you look at it,\n\n107\n00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:51.797\nit has most of the same characteristics,\n\n108\n00:05:51.797 --> 00:05:57.411\nreally all of the same characteristics\nof it's older and larger brother, right.\n\n109\n00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.413\nIf you'll notice that the subscriber\n\n110\n00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:04.360\nconnector has a lot of\nthe same look to it, right.\n\n111\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.530\nThis one happens to have\nthe locking connector there for\n\n112\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.670\ntwo of them to kinda pair them up.\n\n113\n00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.640\nAll right, and then you can see kinda\nlike the core is kind of exposed there.\n\n114\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.930\nSometimes you might find a little plastic\ncap on the end of them as well, and\n\n115\n00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.250\nwe'll see that coming up.\n\n116\n00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.380\nBut the local contact, or\n\n117\n00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.540\nLucent connector as it's also called,\nnotice it's pretty much the same thing.\n\n118\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.000\nIt's really close to the same thing,\nso what's the difference,\n\n119\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.680\nwhy do we have one that is a larger\nconnector versus a smaller connector?\n\n120\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.530\nAnd that really comes down to age\nof the technology, all right.\n\n121\n00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.932\nFiber optic connectors at one point, and\nstill today, are very, very expensive,\n\n122\n00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:45.483\nall right, very expensive.\n\n123\n00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:49.741\nAnd the fact that in some of the earlier\nthings like switches, right,\n\n124\n00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:52.860\nyou wouldn't have as many\nports on a switch right.\n\n125\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.240\nBe very expensive just to put a fiber\noptic blade in a switch let alone adding\n\n126\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.950\nmore and more ports, right.\n\n127\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.160\nSo, the subscriber connector is\nthe older connector, right, and\n\n128\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.690\nit didn't allow for a great port density.\n\n129\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.070\nAnd what I mean by that port density,\n\n130\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.760\nis how many ports do you have\non the switch, all right.\n\n131\n00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.380\nWell if we can cut that connector in half,\nwe get a greater port density right?\n\n132\n00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.950\nWhich means that if I have\nthe subscriber connector, and\n\n133\n00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.460\nI put them side by side with\nthe Lucent connect or the little guy.\n\n134\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.010\nI always say little connector cuz it\nhelped me remember to get it right on\n\n135\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.550\nthe exam, it's literally half the size.\n\n136\n00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.306\nSo I can get two of the LC connectors\ninto the space of a single SC connector.\n\n137\n00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:39.323\nSo from the perspective of the switch I\nget a greater port density, all right.\n\n138\n00:07:39.323 --> 00:07:43.704\nAnd again as price come down, and again\nI say down, that's relative, if you guys\n\n139\n00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:48.291\nare like us maybe watching from home, we\nlive on working men's salary here, right.\n\n140\n00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:53.768\n[LAUGH] You need greater a port density,\nright, today.\n\n141\n00:07:53.768 --> 00:07:58.628\nWe can put more of these connections\ninto a single switch if we're using\n\n142\n00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:02.190\na connector that is half the size, right.\n\n143\n00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.197\nAnd that's important to understand.\n\n144\n00:08:03.197 --> 00:08:05.332\nIn fact, we've got some examples of one.\n\n145\n00:08:05.332 --> 00:08:09.506\nIn fact, earlier when we were talking\nabout it, if we can take a look at these,\n\n146\n00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:10.962\nyou'll see that this one,\n\n147\n00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:14.530\nI like this cable because it's\nreally easy to see that it has both.\n\n148\n00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.748\nAnd if we can kind of zoom\ninto that just a little bit,\n\n149\n00:08:17.748 --> 00:08:22.229\nyou're gonna notice that they're\nreally not much different, right?\n\n150\n00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:28.000\nI mean, aesthetically on the outside, the\nplastic might look a little bit different.\n\n151\n00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.096\nBut notice, Zach,\nthe size difference, right?\n\n152\n00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.806\nSo this is two fibers, right?\n\n153\n00:08:32.806 --> 00:08:36.354\nThis is in what's known as\na duplexing configuration, right?\n\n154\n00:08:36.354 --> 00:08:41.239\nYou could, if you wanted to, you could\nfind these where they weren't paired\n\n155\n00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:45.290\nup together and it would just\nbe a single fiber strand, right?\n\n156\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.930\nBut they don't, a lot of times they do\nwhat's known as a duplexing arrangement.\n\n157\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.260\nAnd with the duplexing arrangement,\nwhat that gives us the ability to do\n\n158\n00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.550\nessentially is we can have a send\nfiber and a receive fiber.\n\n159\n00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.247\nSo we're sending and\nreceiving at the same time.\n\n160\n00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:01.954\nSo these are typically\nin a duplex arrangement.\n\n161\n00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:06.934\nAnd the communication type on\nthis would be what's known as\n\n162\n00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:12.016\na full duplex communication,\nsimultaneous communication\n\n163\n00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:15.814\nin both directions, same time, all right?\n\n164\n00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:19.030\nAnd again, you can see here that,\nsame thing, right?\n\n165\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.210\nWe have two different fiber strands here,\nand I'm be careful not to break this.\n\n166\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.300\nAnd at the same time, we've got our caps.\n\n167\n00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.420\nThis isn't the core,\n\n168\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.250\nthis is actually a cap that you can\nsee is protecting the core, right?\n\n169\n00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.980\nSo we get a greater port density, and\n\n170\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.900\nwe'll talk about what these\ndevices are here coming up.\n\n171\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.640\nBut again, if you look, this actually\ntakes two of the LC connectors, right?\n\n172\n00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.515\nI couldn't even maybe fit,\nside-by-side, maybe one, maybe,\n\n173\n00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:51.810\none of these SC connectors into\na single interface card on the switch.\n\n174\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.460\nSo again,\nyou get that greater port density, right?\n\n175\n00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.050\nSo, and these cables, honestly, this cable\nhere is for backwards compatibility.\n\n176\n00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.830\nYou might have a switch that\nhas the older connector, right,\n\n177\n00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.120\nversus the newer connector.\n\n178\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.490\nWell, this cable is interoperability,\nright?\n\n179\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:10.305\nIt allows you to use these\ninterchangeably if you have one device or\n\n180\n00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:15.050\nmodule that is using newer LC connectors\nversus the older SC connector,\n\n181\n00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.740\nyou get the transition,\nyou get that interoperability.\n\n182\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.910\nHowever, you'll see you don't get\nthat one with this multi-mode cable.\n\n183\n00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.980\nOr again, if you were paying\nattention to the first episode,\n\n184\n00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.905\nthis is a single-mode cable and\nthis is a multi-mode cable.\n\n185\n00:10:26.905 --> 00:10:30.364\nAnd notice that single-mode, multi-mode,\n\n186\n00:10:30.364 --> 00:10:34.518\nit's irrelevant to what\nthe connector type is, right?\n\n187\n00:10:34.518 --> 00:10:39.332\nBecause this has two of the LC connectors\n\n188\n00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:43.870\non each side of our fiber optic cable.\n\n189\n00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.290\nSo you can see there that we have\nsingle mode taking LC connector.\n\n190\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.190\nWe have multi-mode,\nalso taking SC connectors likewise.\n\n191\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.770\nNow, with the connectors, we do have\nto be careful with them because there\n\n192\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.900\nis another thing that you need\nto be aware of, all right?\n\n193\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.049\nBut we have, and they call it out on the\nexam objectives, what's known as UPC, and\n\n194\n00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:07.785\nwhat's known as APC, all right?\n\n195\n00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:12.768\nAnd to really understand the difference\nis to understand that we always\n\n196\n00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:16.680\nhave signal loss happening\ninside a fiber optic cable.\n\n197\n00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.910\nIt's just gonna happen, right?\n\n198\n00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.540\nEven the best manufacturers are gonna be\nimpurities, imperfections in the glass,\n\n199\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.940\nbecause were talking about\na millionth of a meter.\n\n200\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.130\nBubbles in the glass,\nthat's gonna cause signal loss.\n\n201\n00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.130\nThat's gonna end up happening.\n\n202\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:36.720\nWhen signal loss happens, we get a\ndegrading, or performance degrades, right?\n\n203\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.600\nNow, when we end up attaching\nthe connectors to the end, when we do\n\n204\n00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.620\nterminate these connectors, or terminate\nthese cables with these connector types,\n\n205\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:50.538\nthe UPC versus the APC really\ncomes down to a couple of things.\n\n206\n00:11:50.538 --> 00:11:55.270\nHow much signal loss can you tolerate,\nall right?\n\n207\n00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.430\nAnd as well is how much\nreflection is going to happen,\n\n208\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.850\nor where, I should say,\nthe reflection's gonna happen.\n\n209\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.840\nSo I got a little diagram here.\n\n210\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.510\nAnd when we look at UPC, all right?\n\n211\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.890\nAgain, imagine the cable.\n\n212\n00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.950\nWe have, right, we've got\nthe fiber optic cable, all right?\n\n213\n00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.120\nNotice that we have multiple light sources\ncoming down the center of this cable,\n\n214\n00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.260\nright, this UPC.\n\n215\n00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.249\nUPC, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,\nmake sure that we define that for you,\n\n216\n00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:25.569\nthat's an Ultra Physical Contact.\n\n217\n00:12:25.569 --> 00:12:30.456\nVersus APC, for the acronyms, those of\nyou guys that are keeping track of your\n\n218\n00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:34.760\njargon out there,\nthat's the Angled Physical Connector.\n\n219\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:40.690\nNow, when we look at\nthe Ultra Physical Connector,\n\n220\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:46.320\nor contact if you will,\nnotice that a portion of this fiber,\n\n221\n00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.280\nor the signal coming down this fiber, when\nit's terminated some of it reflects back.\n\n222\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.360\nThat just happens, we're going\nto get signal reflection, right?\n\n223\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.340\nVersus Angled Physical Connector.\n\n224\n00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.624\nNotice that what we end up having here is,\nnotice the angle.\n\n225\n00:13:02.624 --> 00:13:03.910\nOops let me get that out of there.\n\n226\n00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.030\nNotice the angle here.\n\n227\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.920\nAPC, make sure that if,\nwhen the connector's applied to the end of\n\n228\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.280\nthe cable, that we get an eight degree\nangle on the reflection, all right?\n\n229\n00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.860\nNow, why do we have to worry about that,\nall right?\n\n230\n00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.520\nAgain, keep in mind,\nevery time a fiber optic cable\n\n231\n00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.260\nhas a connector attached to it, a portion\nof the light is going to be lost, right?\n\n232\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.230\nIt's called light loss, all right?\n\n233\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.312\nLight loss is essentially due\nto the reflection that occurs\n\n234\n00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:36.813\nwhen the connector's applied, essentially\ncausing a damaged or disrupted signal,\n\n235\n00:13:36.813 --> 00:13:37.442\nall right?\n\n236\n00:13:37.442 --> 00:13:42.501\nYou can see that there's more\nreflection going on in the UPC when\n\n237\n00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:47.193\nit reflects straight back to\nits light source, all right?\n\n238\n00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:52.177\nNow, to understand that,\nand UPC is used in systems\n\n239\n00:13:52.177 --> 00:13:56.830\nthat require less precision, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.570\nEssentially, they can tolerate\na little bit more light loss, right?\n\n241\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.561\nSo if you have a signal or a system\nthat isn't sensitive to light loss,\n\n242\n00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:08.502\nextremely sensitive to light loss,\nyou can use the UPC, all right?\n\n243\n00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:10.470\nThe Ultra Physical Contact.\n\n244\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.952\nNow, it's a polished connector.\n\n245\n00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:14.580\nYou always have to have\npolished connectors, all right?\n\n246\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.260\nWhen you are connecting them.\n\n247\n00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.893\nThey're usually color coded blue, and\n\n248\n00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:23.543\nthey have a return loss of\nabout 50 decibel or higher.\n\n249\n00:14:23.543 --> 00:14:24.648\nYou don't have to worry,\n\n250\n00:14:24.648 --> 00:14:27.020\nI put that out there just in\ncase they ask you on the exam.\n\n251\n00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.190\nI don't think they're going to ask you.\n\n252\n00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:34.730\nHowever, you do have systems that\nneed precision fiber signaling.\n\n253\n00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.780\nThey cannot handle light loss, right?\n\n254\n00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.670\nThey are too sensitive, right?\n\n255\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.690\nAnd that's where the APC\nis gonna come in handy.\n\n256\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.700\nA little bit more expensive, right?\n\n257\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:51.219\nBut when it comes down to it, if you are\nrequiring precision fiber connectivity,\n\n258\n00:14:51.219 --> 00:14:57.276\nand cannot deal with light loss,\nuse the APC, the Angle Physical Contact.\n\n259\n00:14:57.276 --> 00:14:59.990\nAnd again, that's going to be one,\na return loss if you will,\n\n260\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.490\nof about 60 decibels or higher.\n\n261\n00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.060\nAnd again, it's color-coded green,\nall right?\n\n262\n00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.920\nSo I'm not sure if they'll show\nyou an exhibit on the exam, but\n\n263\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.940\nif they do, they color-code these.\n\n264\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.920\nThey make it easier, right?\n\n265\n00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.730\nIf you have a UPC,\nit's gonna be color-coded blue.\n\n266\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.700\nIf you have the APC,\nit's gonna be color-coded green.\n\n267\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.400\nRemember that the angle of the reflection\n\n268\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.430\nis directly relative to how much\nsignal is gonna be lost or light loss.\n\n269\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.515\nSensitive systems, go with APC.\n\n270\n00:15:25.515 --> 00:15:27.750\nSystems that aren't quite as sensitive,\n\n271\n00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.412\ndon't require that precision,\ngo with the UPC.\n\n272\n00:15:32.412 --> 00:15:36.560\nAll right, so those are a little bit about\nthe connectors that you have to also know.\n\n273\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.900\nThe other one, too, is an MTRJ.\n\n274\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.320\nThe MTRJ is\na Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack.\n\n275\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:41.863\nThat's another one.\nAnd\n\n276\n00:15:41.863 --> 00:15:46.120\nthis is one that really kinda snap locks,\nkind of like the RJ 45 jack.\n\n277\n00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.400\nSo there's also the MTRJ that I want\nyou to be aware of for the exam.\n\n278\n00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.980\nKnow that these are forms of connectors\nthat terminate the fiber optic cables.\n\n279\n00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.951\nAnd like I've said, when it comes to\nconnections, you don't just slice and\n\n280\n00:15:57.951 --> 00:15:59.063\ndice these, right?\n\n281\n00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:03.040\nYou need things like fusion splicers\nbecause some of them get so\n\n282\n00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.818\nprecise Again, talking about precision,\n\n283\n00:16:05.818 --> 00:16:10.330\nyou can't deal with the light loss,\nand they need to be precise.\n\n284\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.360\nI've seen somewhere,\nyou put the ends the fiber in.\n\n285\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.210\nYou close the lid down and\nit literally magnifies it.\n\n286\n00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.453\nYou can watch it on an LED readout.\n\n287\n00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:23.154\nAnd you could sit there and\nsee that it moves the core, right,\n\n288\n00:16:23.154 --> 00:16:28.957\nthe central core down until it touches\nto and gets them perfectly on center.\n\n289\n00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:32.320\nAnd then, it's glass, so\nit just fuses it together.\n\n290\n00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.800\nAnd again, can be very,\nvery expensive devices.\n\n291\n00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.320\nNow you might have seen\nit on the table earlier,\n\n292\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.480\ncome back to some of these other\ntechnologies that we have.\n\n293\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.510\nOne of the technologies that we need to\ntalk about is what's known as a fiber\n\n294\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.190\ntransceiver.\n\n295\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:52.130\nRemember when we talk about a transceiver,\nthat's a mix of two words, right?\n\n296\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.400\nTransmitter, receiver.\n\n297\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.070\nJust like we talked about a transceiver\nchip on a network adapter and\n\n298\n00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.790\nEthernet, right?\n\n299\n00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.610\nYou can think of it as a little\nprocessor that actually\n\n300\n00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.560\nprocesses your data while\nthere is sending or receiving.\n\n301\n00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.730\nNow these have gone through\nsome changes over the years,.\n\n302\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.270\nAnd when we talk about changes there\nare really some different standards out\n\n303\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.040\nthere that you need to be aware of.\n\n304\n00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.598\nOne of the earlier ones\nwas known as a GBIC.\n\n305\n00:17:18.598 --> 00:17:21.610\nAnd a GBIC really aren't used so\nmuch today.\n\n306\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:26.610\nThey are more of a legacy device and\nit stands for essentially Gigabit,\n\n307\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:32.540\nEthernet or, excuse me, Gigabit interface\nconnector if I can remember that.\n\n308\n00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.530\nAnd these were a little bit more bulky.\n\n309\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.410\nWhen we talk about things like the earlier\nSC connectors, these would be used back in\n\n310\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.840\nthe days of the SC connectors and didn't\nreally allow for a great port density.\n\n311\n00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.140\nAnd again, remember that port density\nalways boils down to the fact that\n\n312\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.960\nhow many ports can we\nget on a single switch?\n\n313\n00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.570\nThe more ports that we can get on the\nsingle switch, the better we are going to\n\n314\n00:17:55.570 --> 00:18:00.530\nbe doing as far as our connectivity or\nhow many devices that we connect.\n\n315\n00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.683\nSo let's go ahead and the next thing\nthat we're going to look at is the GBIC.\n\n316\n00:18:03.683 --> 00:18:05.991\nAnd this is an example\nif you will of a GBIC.\n\n317\n00:18:05.991 --> 00:18:11.128\nAgain, the gigabyte interface\nconverter here notice that we have a,\n\n318\n00:18:11.128 --> 00:18:16.349\nit's barely big right, and you might\nnot think that until you look at,\n\n319\n00:18:16.349 --> 00:18:19.370\nit next to what at to replaced right.\n\n320\n00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.990\nThese will be the earlier SC connectors\nthat we were talking about here and\n\n321\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:27.230\nyou can see I got two of these that\nI can put inside of this GBIC here.\n\n322\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.190\nBut we also have what's known as the small\nform factor pluggable module and\n\n323\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.394\nyou can see that notice how\nit's like half the size.\n\n324\n00:18:34.805 --> 00:18:40.493\nAnd this is what you see today more\nthan you see this earlier legacy, GBIC.\n\n325\n00:18:40.493 --> 00:18:44.225\nAnd this GBIC right here would take that\nstraight tip that we're talking about,\n\n326\n00:18:44.225 --> 00:18:46.455\nthat ST connectors you\ncan kind of see there,\n\n327\n00:18:46.455 --> 00:18:50.435\nversus this one here is going\nto use the LC connector.\n\n328\n00:18:50.435 --> 00:18:54.390\nWe can actually kinda show you\nthat in action here because\n\n329\n00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.070\nsome of the technologies that we had on\nthe table when we were looking at these\n\n330\n00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.180\nfiber optic cables, just happened\nto be one of the SFP modules.\n\n331\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.780\nThe small form-factor\npluggable module right here.\n\n332\n00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.490\nSo if we can take a look at that.\n\n333\n00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.760\nWe have a little one here on the desk,\nright?\n\n334\n00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.860\nAnd this is actually what replaced it.\n\n335\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.040\nThis is the small form\nfactor pluggable module.\n\n336\n00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.320\nAnd what I could do here is I could pull,\n\n337\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.570\nlet me pull the fiber\noptic protectors here.\n\n338\n00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.650\nAnd all you're gonna do essentially and,\nlet me lift that up there,\n\n339\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.110\nis we are going to plug this in and\nthat's it.\n\n340\n00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:35.230\nThat makes a connection with the cable and\nthe module gets plugged into the switch.\n\n341\n00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.990\nAnd these modules, again modular design\nyou can remove them if this goes bad,\n\n342\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.190\nyou take that out, and you essentially\nreplace it with another one.\n\n343\n00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.390\nAnd these all have standards too.\n\n344\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.395\nAnd we're gonna get back to what this is.\n\n345\n00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:52.770\nAgain this is one of\nthe multimode cables that we use,\n\n346\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.852\nagain to tie all the technologies we've\ntalked about together with an LC connector\n\n347\n00:19:56.852 --> 00:20:02.350\nmulti mode fiber duplex, so\ntwo-way communication in one of the SFPs.\n\n348\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:08.300\nAnd you can see, this just happens to be\nfor 10 BASE G and as you remember, what\n\n349\n00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.120\nwe talk about in the copper Standards,\nwe talked about the base standards.\n\n350\n00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.420\nWell this happens to be SR.\n\n351\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.150\nThis is short running essentially\n10 gigabits at 850 nanometers,\n\n352\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.525\nand that just happens to\nbe the wavelength there.\n\n353\n00:20:22.525 --> 00:20:25.465\nAnd you can also see if we\nlook that there's two variants\n\n354\n00:20:25.465 --> 00:20:27.015\nof the multimode fiber.\n\n355\n00:20:27.015 --> 00:20:30.585\nNotice how we were saying Zach,\n62.5 microns and\n\n356\n00:20:30.585 --> 00:20:32.975\nnotice that they also have a 50 microns.\n\n357\n00:20:32.975 --> 00:20:39.137\nSo again you can see the variance there\nand it is good to understand that, right?\n\n358\n00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:41.607\nThe different transceiver types.\n\n359\n00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:46.277\nNow I want to go a little bit farther\nin and talk about the standards, so\n\n360\n00:20:46.277 --> 00:20:49.470\nyou'll be aware of it if\nthey ask you on these exams.\n\n361\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.830\nThe GBIC again is called out on the exam,\nbut it's an older technology.\n\n362\n00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:00.560\nAnd the example the one that we showed you\nwas actually the 10 base SX, if you will.\n\n363\n00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.620\nAnd that supports gigabit\nEthernet at one gig and\n\n364\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.410\nthe range is right around 550 meters,\nright and it's gonna be multimode.\n\n365\n00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.840\nAnd it's also hot swappable.\n\n366\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.900\nThat's another thing that if\nyou're coming over from the A+,\n\n367\n00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.521\nyou probably recognize\nthat term hot swappable.\n\n368\n00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:17.190\nIt means I don't have to\npower off the switch.\n\n369\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.580\nIf I go in there and that's modules dead,\npull the module out,\n\n370\n00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.510\nput another one in and then plug\nthe cables in and you're good to go.\n\n371\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.335\nSo great thing.\n\n372\n00:21:24.335 --> 00:21:28.570\nNow they also have the smaller one that\nwe mentioned here that we showed you.\n\n373\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.169\nThe SFP and again that's small\nform factor pluggable module and\n\n374\n00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:34.777\nessentially it's really replaced the GBIC.\n\n375\n00:21:34.777 --> 00:21:38.914\nAgain it gives you greater speeds,\nbetter port density, so it's smaller.\n\n376\n00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:41.730\nWe can get more ports on a switch.\n\n377\n00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.450\nTransmission speeds of the SFP,\none gigabit Ethernet,\n\n378\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.580\nand like I said,\nreplace the earlier application of G bits.\n\n379\n00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.343\nIt supports technologies like your\nsynchronous optical networking\n\n380\n00:21:55.343 --> 00:21:58.470\nhere in the states, or\nif you're in Europe.\n\n381\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.738\nThe Single Digital Hierarchy,\n\n382\n00:22:00.738 --> 00:22:05.780\nSDH Gigabit Ethernet fiber channel\nis another one that this supports.\n\n383\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.186\nAnd again, with the SFP,\neven though we showed you one that is for\n\n384\n00:22:10.186 --> 00:22:13.087\nmulti mode, it also does signal mode too.\n\n385\n00:22:13.087 --> 00:22:16.061\nAnd we've kinda showed you that\nwith the LC connectors too,\n\n386\n00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:19.640\nbecause the LC connectors\nare gonna plug in to these SFPs.\n\n387\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.350\nNow this is another one of\nthose technologies that\n\n388\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.750\nthe committee has updated\nit over the years.\n\n389\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.440\nSo even though the SFP was a gigabit,\n\n390\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.611\nwhen a 10 G networks came out,\nthis was where we got SFP+.\n\n391\n00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:37.640\nSFP+ supports things like 16 gigs.\n\n392\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.622\nSo it supports things like fiber channel\nwhich is, you can get up to 16 gigs.\n\n393\n00:22:42.622 --> 00:22:47.151\nIt supports the 10G-based whatever\nthe fiber standard might be, and\n\n394\n00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:50.620\nagain, that's the 10\ngig Ethernet standard.\n\n395\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.700\nIt also supports things like OTN networks,\nthat's a little redundant there,\n\n396\n00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.640\nthe Optical Transport Networks, likewise.\n\n397\n00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.743\nAnd just when we thought that was all\nthere was, they said well that's not\n\n398\n00:23:02.743 --> 00:23:07.620\neven enough band, what 10G of,\nlike 10 gigs, that's awesome.\n\n399\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.880\nWell, that's not enough for\nthings like large data centers.\n\n400\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.410\nSo they also what's known as QSFP and\nQSFP +, but\n\n401\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.800\nyou don't have to worry about the QSFP+.\n\n402\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.740\nSo what is QSFP?\n\n403\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:28.220\nI want you to think about aggregating\nmultiple SFP+ or SFP connections, right?\n\n404\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:35.770\nSo if one SFP supports one gig,\nif I have a quad SFP, four.\n\n405\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.730\nFour, one gig fiber optic communication.\n\n406\n00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.097\nSo it basically aggregates multiple\nlinks together, so now we got four.\n\n407\n00:23:42.097 --> 00:23:48.820\nAnd SFP+ can do up to things\nlike four of the 10 gig, right?\n\n408\n00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.190\nSo it is a quad SFP+,\nif you can think of it that way.\n\n409\n00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.590\nAnd we're talking 40 gigs.\n\n410\n00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.440\n40 gigs on one module.\n\n411\n00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.732\nThat is amazing fast.\n\n412\n00:23:57.732 --> 00:23:58.920\nAnd they've got some beyond that, but\n\n413\n00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.398\nyou don't have to worry about that for\nthe exam.\n\n414\n00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:05.067\nBut that's before things like data centers\nthat need that bandwidth even though we're\n\n415\n00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:09.120\nthinking wow 40 gigabit transfer speeds,\nthat's absolutely amazing.\n\n416\n00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.900\nAnd that's something\nyou just keep in mind.\n\n417\n00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.729\nIt supports things like\nyour gigabit Ethernet,\n\n418\n00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:21.364\nfiber channel if you will, and even things\nlike infinity bond too or infa bond.\n\n419\n00:24:21.364 --> 00:24:24.277\nNow I think the last thing that\nwe need to talk about when we,\n\n420\n00:24:24.277 --> 00:24:27.850\nit comes to fiber, I know we're running\na little bit short on time here.\n\n421\n00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:31.920\nSo, let's talk a little bit\nabout some of the standards, and\n\n422\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.100\nI don't really have a diagram on this one,\nwe talked about some of these\n\n423\n00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.520\nbase standards in copper when\nit comes to Ethernet deployment.\n\n424\n00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.380\nSo I said, it supports 10 gigabit\nEthernet, while there are two of\n\n425\n00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.090\nthe 10G based standards or 10 based\nstandards I want you to be aware of.\n\n426\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.940\nLet me make sure, I said 10G based, they\ndon't really call out the 10G based but\n\n427\n00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.200\nthey do call out the 1000-based LX.\n\n428\n00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.600\nAnd they call out the 1000-based SX,\n\n429\n00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.010\nwhich just happened to be one\nof the examples we've shown you.\n\n430\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.960\nThe 1000-based LX, remember just like\nwe were mentioning in our copper,\n\n431\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.995\nif you're not familiar,\ngo back and check that out.\n\n432\n00:25:05.995 --> 00:25:11.273\n1000 is gigabit or 1000 megabits,\nright, baseband signaling.\n\n433\n00:25:11.273 --> 00:25:15.650\nAnd then the letter code on the end\ntells you what the media type is.\n\n434\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.280\nIn this case,\nthe LX is gonna be a long wave laser, and\n\n435\n00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.500\nwe're talking over a single mode fiber.\n\n436\n00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.382\nYou can implement this up to five\na kilometers, so quite a distance, right,\n\n437\n00:25:27.382 --> 00:25:29.120\n5,000 meters there.\n\n438\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.540\nAnd if it's multi mode,\nthis is where that standard comes down.\n\n439\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.920\nRemember we talked about multi mode,\nit doesn't have the length,\n\n440\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.721\nquite the reach if you will,\nof your signal mode fiber.\n\n441\n00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:43.074\nAnd we're talking 550 meters if\nyou have 1000-based LX that's\n\n442\n00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:45.420\nimplemented over multi mode.\n\n443\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.691\nIt also has an associated 802 standard.\n\n444\n00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:50.260\nRemember 802.3 is Ethernet, right?\n\n445\n00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.740\nAnd then you have all the little\nrevisions inside of Ethernet.\n\n446\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:26:00.074\nAnd another great thing, I can remember\none thing for two technologies.\n\n447\n00:26:00.074 --> 00:26:03.227\nSo both 1000BASE-LX and\n\n448\n00:26:03.227 --> 00:26:09.050\n1000BASE-SX fall under what's\nknown as the 802.3z standard.\n\n449\n00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.000\nJust in case they ask you it on the exam,\nyou'll be aware of that.\n\n450\n00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.888\nNow, let's go and jump to the other\none which is 1000-based SX right.\n\n451\n00:26:16.888 --> 00:26:20.442\nThis is a multi-mode cable,\nthey are multi-mode deployment standard.\n\n452\n00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:26.003\nAnd you can see depending on whether\nyou're using the 62.5 micron or\n\n453\n00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:31.410\nusing the 50 micron variety\nthe using the 62.5 micron variety.\n\n454\n00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:35.771\nYou can see 220 meters or 275 meters.\n\n455\n00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:40.788\nIf you're using the 50-micron, and here's\nwhere you'll start to notice that that\n\n456\n00:26:40.788 --> 00:26:45.396\ncore really does the more concentrated\nit is, the longer the distance, right,\n\n457\n00:26:45.396 --> 00:26:50.290\nbecause the 50-micron we can see 500\nmeters or as far up to 550 meters.\n\n458\n00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.738\nSo notice that 62.5 core\ndiameter's a lot larger, right?\n\n459\n00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:56.214\nWell relatively larger.\n\n460\n00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:58.536\n[LAUGH] I guess it's still\na millionth of a meter.\n\n461\n00:26:58.536 --> 00:27:02.880\nAnd we're only at 220 to 275 meters.\n\n462\n00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.757\nOr concentrated core 50 microns, and we\njump up to almost double that instantly,\n\n463\n00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:09.141\neven the smallest one.\n\n464\n00:27:09.141 --> 00:27:12.170\n500 meters all the way up to 550 meters.\n\n465\n00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.600\nAnd it is important to be\naware of that on the exam.\n\n466\n00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.730\nNow the other thing that they mentioned,\nand I did talk about this a little bit.\n\n467\n00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:19.870\nThey talk about duplex.\n\n468\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.720\nDuplex just means I can send and receive.\n\n469\n00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.760\nWell it depends on what type of\nduplex you're talking about.\n\n470\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.290\nIf you're talking about half duplex,\nit is a bidirectional communication but\n\n471\n00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.340\nit's like a walkie talkie, all right?\n\n472\n00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.520\nIt only happens in a single\ndirection at a time, right?\n\n473\n00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.320\nSo Zach and\nI have walkie-talkies in our hand, right?\n\n474\n00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.370\nAnd I'm like hey, Zach, what's going on.\n\n475\n00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.801\nWell, Zach has to wait for\nme to release that key,\n\n476\n00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:45.667\nthe dead key if you will before\nhe can communicate back.\n\n477\n00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:49.510\nHe can hear me as it comes in, and\nthen I have to release the channel and\n\n478\n00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.810\nthen he can communicate back with me.\n\n479\n00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:53.631\nNow, we can both try to\ncommunicate at the same time but\n\n480\n00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:55.145\nnobody is gonna get anything accomplished.\n\n481\n00:27:55.145 --> 00:28:00.092\nBut it's still a bi-directional\ncommunication just in\n\n482\n00:28:00.092 --> 00:28:02.674\na single direction at a time.\n\n483\n00:28:02.674 --> 00:28:04.480\nThat's what's known as half duplex.\n\n484\n00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.050\nRemember that full duplex is more\nlike a telephone conversation.\n\n485\n00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.950\nIt happens in both\ndirections at the same time.\n\n486\n00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.020\nIf Zach and I again,\nwe might not get anything couples,\n\n487\n00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.610\nwe're trying to talk at the same time,\nbut we could communicate and\n\n488\n00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.320\nwe could talk at the same time and\nhear each other at the same time.\n\n489\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.921\nThat is a bi-directional communication.\n\n490\n00:28:20.921 --> 00:28:24.260\nEach direction can happen simultaneously.\n\n491\n00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.980\nSo be aware of that and that's why we\nsee these fibers again where there's two\n\n492\n00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.420\nfibers at once because you can send on one\nfiber and you can receive on the other.\n\n493\n00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.980\nYou get that full duplex\ncommunication as it's known.\n\n494\n00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.410\nLast but no the least is what's known\nas a fiber distribution panel, right?\n\n495\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.227\nWell a fiber distribution panel\nis a lot like a copper based or\n\n496\n00:28:45.227 --> 00:28:47.883\ntwisted pair based patchville.\n\n497\n00:28:47.883 --> 00:28:52.150\nRight, we need a place to terminate\nall these fiber connections, right?\n\n498\n00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:52.930\nHow do we do that?\n\n499\n00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.180\nWell, I've actually got a picture\nof one pulled up here and\n\n500\n00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.150\nyou can kind of see that\nthis is a combination.\n\n501\n00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.430\nI like this one because it kinda\nharkens back to what we said before,\n\n502\n00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.060\nthis is actually you can see.\n\n503\n00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:07.890\nWhy don't we try that again if I\nknow how to work a web browser.\n\n504\n00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:11.020\nNotice that we've got our\ncopper media right here,\n\n505\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.560\nthese are RJ-45 jacks that we see.\n\n506\n00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:19.078\nBut then we also if we scroll up,\nwe can see that we have some GBex.\n\n507\n00:29:19.078 --> 00:29:22.700\nNow this is an older standard here.\n\n508\n00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.700\nBecause if you look up these\nare the SC connectors.\n\n509\n00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.580\nBut notice that we have our fiber optics\ncables that are actually kinda terminating\n\n510\n00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.960\nright here into this fiber optic\ndistribution or fiber distribution panel.\n\n511\n00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.190\nSo, that's what you've got and you\ntypically have these inside of your server\n\n512\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.680\ncloset, this happens to be\na floor patch panel if you will.\n\n513\n00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.620\nAnd this is kind of mixing both, right.\n\n514\n00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.769\nIt's mixing fiber optic communications\nalong with you have your copper\n\n515\n00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:48.837\nconnections or\nyour twisted pair implementations.\n\n516\n00:29:48.837 --> 00:29:52.561\nSo probably both of these are for some\nkind of Ethernet communication if I had\n\n517\n00:29:52.561 --> 00:29:56.920\nto take a guess here, but that essentially\nis your fiber distribution panel.\n\n518\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.350\nLot of different technologies, right?\n\n519\n00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.130\nKeep that in mind,\n\n520\n00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:03.160\na lot of different standards, completely\nunderstand it don't let it scare you.\n\n521\n00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.630\nGet these specifications under your belt\nso that if they put you in a scenario on\n\n522\n00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.250\nthe exam you'll be able to answer this,\nanswer these questions.\n\n523\n00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.770\nKeep in mind,\nanother great thing about going ahead and\n\n524\n00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.950\ndoing the memorization is that, in doing\nthe memorization, sometimes it's very\n\n525\n00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.290\neasy to write a question that says, okay,\nyou've got a single mode cable, and\n\n526\n00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.740\nyou need to, I don't know,\noperate at 2,000 meters.\n\n527\n00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.390\nOr maybe they're asking, they're putting\nyou in a scenario that says, hey,\n\n528\n00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.630\nthis business has to connect\nto this business, and\n\n529\n00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.860\nit's 1,000 meters away, which of\nthese standards are you gonna use?\n\n530\n00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:40.930\nWell if you know, again,\nthat 1000BASE-SX is only multimode?\n\n531\n00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:41.999\nYou're not gonna use it, right?\n\n532\n00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:45.857\nYou're not gonna be able to use that\nstandard in order to go a 1000 meters,\n\n533\n00:30:45.857 --> 00:30:47.902\nright, because the maximum distance for\n\n534\n00:30:47.902 --> 00:30:50.777\nmultimode in this application\nis gonna be 550 meters.\n\n535\n00:30:50.777 --> 00:30:55.918\nThese are easy questions to get to\nwrong if you're not paying to keywords,\n\n536\n00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:58.455\nbut they're also easy to get right.\n\n537\n00:30:58.455 --> 00:31:02.815\nSo definitely, know the facts and\nspecifications here.\n\n538\n00:31:02.815 --> 00:31:06.370\nDo your memorization so on the exam\nany scenario that they give you,\n\n539\n00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:08.930\nyou're gonna be doing well and\nnot only pass that exam.\n\n540\n00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.880\nWe want you to knock it\nout of the ballpark.\n\n541\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.570\n&gt;&gt; And\nwith your help Wes I'm sure they will.\n\n542\n00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.010\nThis is awesome stuff.\n\n543\n00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.420\nCabling solutions fiber part two.\n\n544\n00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.560\nMake sure you see part one and\n\n545\n00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.700\nsee everything in the CompTIA net plus\nseries that Wes is creating for you.\n\n546\n00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.330\nIt will help you.\n\n547\n00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.210\nIt really will and while you're in\nthe course library hundreds of other\n\n548\n00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.730\nvideos and\nthey're all designed to do one

00:00:08.312\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:11.865\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.477\n&gt;&gt; Greetings and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:17.058\nI'm your host Justin Dennison, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.683\nwhile we're continuing on with our\nCompTIA Network+ adventure, particularly,\n\n8\n00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:23.100\nwe're gonna be looking at\nnetwork devices today.\n\n9\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.970\nAnd here to help us in that very endeavor,\nis Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.830\nHow are you doing today, Wes?\n\n11\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.880\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing okay, thanks for\nhaving me back, Justin.\n\n12\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.690\nThat's right, we will be looking\nat various network devices,\n\n13\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.507\nas well as determining where we need to\nplace these devices within our networks.\n\n14\n00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:40.642\nAnd one of the very first ones\nthat we are gonna jump in and\n\n15\n00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:44.210\ntalk about in this episode,\nis the good old firewall.\n\n16\n00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.070\nAll right, now maybe some of you guys and\ngals out there are aware of the firewall\n\n17\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.670\nthat maybe is currently\nrunning on your machine.\n\n18\n00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.560\nAll right,\nmaybe on your Windows machine out there,\n\n19\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.780\nmaybe you got a firewall like IPtables,\nif you will, inside our firewall CMD,\n\n20\n00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.430\nI believe, inside of Linux systems, right?\n\n21\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.140\nBut those, are what are known\nas host-based firewalls, right?\n\n22\n00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.996\nAnd the reason they call them\nhost-based firewalls, or\n\n23\n00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.032\neven sometimes software-based firewalls,\nis, for one,\n\n24\n00:01:11.032 --> 00:01:15.018\nthey are screening the traffic that is\ncoming in and out of the network adaptor,\n\n25\n00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:17.364\non the host that they're running on,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:21.377\nThey're called software-based firewalls\nbecause typically they don't have\n\n27\n00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:25.461\na hardware appliance associated with them,\nunlike a network-based firewall.\n\n28\n00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:27.086\nIn fact, I kinda have got a diagram,\n\n29\n00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:30.030\nlittle diagram here of the difference\nbetween these two, right?\n\n30\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.945\nSo if you look at,\n\n31\n00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:35.155\nlike for instance, we'll just take\nthe traditional Windows Firewall, right?\n\n32\n00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:37.888\nLet's say software-based\nfirewall that works inside of\n\n33\n00:01:37.888 --> 00:01:39.400\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n34\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.220\nAnd again, it is just screening\ntraffic that's coming to and\n\n35\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.350\nfrom the network adapter, the NIC if\nyou will, inside of a specific host.\n\n36\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.261\nAll right, and\nthat's unlike the network-based firewall.\n\n37\n00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:55.915\nWhen we look at the network-based\nfirewall, notice where the position of\n\n38\n00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:59.518\nthe network-based firewall is in\nrelationship to the network, right?\n\n39\n00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:03.067\nNow, I will tell you that some routers\nmight even have firewalls built right\n\n40\n00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:03.630\ninto them.\n\n41\n00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.240\nSo abstractly, you could have\nmulti-functional device that is doing\n\n42\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.930\nall of this,\nbuilt into a single device, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.650\nBut the firewall, the network-based\nfirewall, what traffic is it screening?\n\n44\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.340\nWell, if you look,\nbased on its position within the diagram,\n\n45\n00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.032\nit's actually screening every bit of\ntraffic that comes into your network,\n\n46\n00:02:22.032 --> 00:02:23.655\nor is leaving your network.\n\n47\n00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:25.709\nUnlike the host-based firewall, right?\n\n48\n00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.810\nThe host based firewall, again, is just\nscreening traffic that is coming in and\n\n49\n00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.372\nout of the network adapter,\non that one machine.\n\n50\n00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:37.332\nThe network-based firewall,\nit goes farther and it screens all traffic\n\n51\n00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:42.621\ngoing to everybody within your networks,\nas well as out of your networks too.\n\n52\n00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:47.030\nAll right, and these firewalls,\nthey can be very complex.\n\n53\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.101\nIn fact, with the next generation\nof firewalls that we have,\n\n54\n00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.004\nyou might hear the term NGFW, right?\n\n55\n00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.368\nNext generation firewall,\n\n56\n00:02:53.368 --> 00:02:56.620\nthey can go all the way,\nif we're looking at the OSI model, right?\n\n57\n00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.849\nThey can go all the way\nup to the application,\n\n58\n00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.559\nthe application layer firewall.\n\n59\n00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.053\nAll right, firewalls, again, one of\nthe things that traditionally they do,\n\n60\n00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:07.183\nthe network-based firewalls, and\nreally the host based firewalls,\n\n61\n00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:10.260\nis they block all\nunsolicited inbound traffic.\n\n62\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.380\nNow, what do I mean by\nblocking unsolicited traffic?\n\n63\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.880\nWhich means you don't ask for\nthat traffic to come into your network,\n\n64\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.210\nit's going to be blocked by default.\n\n65\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.280\nNow, you can make an exception of that,\nwe call it exceptions,\n\n66\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.320\nthe exceptions of the rule is block\neverything that comes into the network,\n\n67\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.490\nexcept for this type of traffic\nthat I put a rule there, right?\n\n68\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.843\nOutbound traffic however,\nis typically allowed.\n\n69\n00:03:32.843 --> 00:03:38.790\nCuz it's typically inside of your network,\nbeing sent out to some source, right?\n\n70\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.126\nNow, I do want you to keep in mind\nthat if you're looking at a firewall,\n\n71\n00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:49.000\nin relation to l the OSI model that\nwe've talked about in other episodes,\n\n72\n00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.760\nfirewalls can do things like\ninspecting IP addresses, right?\n\n73\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.670\nIf they're inspecting IP addresses, then\nwhat they're basically doing is operating\n\n74\n00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.910\nat layer three of the OSI model, right?\n\n75\n00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.320\nThe network layer.\n\n76\n00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.050\nBut sometimes what they do is they\nmonitor the state of a connection.\n\n77\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.580\nWell, where's the state of a connection?\n\n78\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.920\nAnd we talk about transmission\ncontrol protocol.\n\n79\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.380\nThat sits at the transport and\nthe session layer of the OSI model.\n\n80\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.070\nWhen we talk about the TCP/IP session\nidentifiers, like sockets and ports, well,\n\n81\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.550\nsometimes you can do port-based\nrules that say hey, block this port.\n\n82\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.860\nWell, that's gonna be\nat the session layer.\n\n83\n00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.860\nBut then sometimes, these firewalls\nare smart enough that it says,\n\n84\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.890\nhey, I can peel back that encapsulation.\n\n85\n00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.311\nI can look down in that packet,\nand you know what?\n\n86\n00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:38.200\nI'm blocking unencrypted web traffic,\nright?\n\n87\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.840\nWell, just because you change\nthat port number to 443,\n\n88\n00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.810\ndoesn't mean that you're gonna fool\nthe application layer firewall.\n\n89\n00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.430\nCuz it can look and say hey, you're\ntelling me that this is encrypted traffic,\n\n90\n00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.100\nbut I can plainly see this\nis just basic HTTP traffic.\n\n91\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.508\nSo it's aware of those protocols and\nthey can be very very smart, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:56.508 --> 00:04:59.204\nThat's a network-based firewall.\n\n93\n00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:03.596\nNow, generically the objectives just say\nfirewall, so that's why we went ahead and\n\n94\n00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.210\nwe told you about both.\n\n95\n00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.370\nRemember, just like a host-based firewall,\n\n96\n00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.220\nsometimes it's called a software-based\nfirewall, a network-based firewall,\n\n97\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.010\nsometimes is also called\na hardware-based firewall, right?\n\n98\n00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.530\nNow, that gets a little confusing,\n\n99\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.700\ncuz, honestly, to me,\nthat was always confusing.\n\n100\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.220\nCuz if I think about it, Justin,\nyou've got a small piece of software\n\n101\n00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.690\nthat's actually running within\na hardware-based firewall.\n\n102\n00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.080\nBut just understand generically,\nthat's where those terms come from.\n\n103\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.842\nSoftware-based firewall running on\nyour host, host-based firewall.\n\n104\n00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:35.990\nYour hardware-based firewalls are a\ndedicated appliance that has the software,\n\n105\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.760\nessentially, that's performing\nthe firewall functionality, within them.\n\n106\n00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.440\nAll right, now the next thing we're gonna\ntalk about are a series of connectivity\n\n107\n00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.060\ndevices.\n\n108\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.450\nAnd I'm gonna do this in a little bit\ndifferent order than what you would see,\n\n109\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.770\nif you're following along at home\nwith the objectives, all right?\n\n110\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.807\nAnd the reason I wanna do\nthis in a different order,\n\n111\n00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:56.492\nis because I wanna do them,\nhistorically and\n\n112\n00:05:56.492 --> 00:06:00.893\nas well kinda related to their\nintelligence within the network, right?\n\n113\n00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:04.134\nIf you're gonna understand a network\ndevice, you have to kinda understand\n\n114\n00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:07.740\nwhat's going on within, inside of that\ndevice, just like we mentioned firewall.\n\n115\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.080\nSo the very first one that I wanna\nstart with is what is known as a hub.\n\n116\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.303\nHubs have been around for a while.\n\n117\n00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:16.287\nAnd I've gotta, generically, a little\ndiagram here, of a hub, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:16.287 --> 00:06:19.210\nNow, why did I start with a hub?\n\n119\n00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:25.390\nHubs are probably the dumbest,\nif you will, of all networking devices.\n\n120\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.910\nIn fact, Justin, you and\nI were talking about,\n\n121\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.440\nand you made a good point about that hub.\n\n122\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.030\nThat hub,\nit doesn't have any logic in it, right?\n\n123\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.415\nSo it is hardwired,\nelectrically hardwired,\n\n124\n00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:40.381\nto receive bits of information, right?\n\n125\n00:06:40.381 --> 00:06:43.994\nSo this computer, if it's sending\ninformation into the hub, all it's doing\n\n126\n00:06:43.994 --> 00:06:47.240\nis it's sending those raw bits down\nthat physical layer into the hub.\n\n127\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.720\nAnd the hub is hardwired to say,\n\n128\n00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.680\nyou know what, just broadcast this\ninformation out all of our other ports.\n\n129\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.350\nDo not make a logical decision,\ndon't worry about MAC addresses, right,\n\n130\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.260\nat the data link layer.\n\n131\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.790\nDon't worry about the IP addresses at\nthe network layer, I couldn't care less.\n\n132\n00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.600\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n133\n00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.363\nI take this information, and\n\n134\n00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:10.818\nmy wires are soldered in a way [LAUGH]\nthat I broadcast it out all other ports.\n\n135\n00:07:10.818 --> 00:07:13.790\nAll right, now there's an issue with hubs.\n\n136\n00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.978\nAll right, not only the fact\n[LAUGH] that they're, well,\n\n137\n00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:21.535\npretty unintelligent, is the fact that\nthey also crease contention, increase,\n\n138\n00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:23.636\nexcuse me, contention, all right?\n\n139\n00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:26.640\nWithin already contention-based\nnetworks right?\n\n140\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.730\nSo for instance,\nwe talked about in other episodes,\n\n141\n00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.300\nhow if we had a bus topology, right?\n\n142\n00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.190\nWe talked about that ethernet, the earlier\nethernet networks where bus topologies,\n\n143\n00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.190\nand the more nodes you would put on them,\nright?\n\n144\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:43.840\nIt would increase the contention\nwithin that network topology.\n\n145\n00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.860\nWell, hubs do the same thing.\n\n146\n00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.820\nThe more devices that you add to a hub,\n\n147\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.712\nthe more broadcast communications\nyou are gonna have.\n\n148\n00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:52.118\nThe other thing to keep in\nmind too is that with a hub,\n\n149\n00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:53.945\nit's a half-duplex communication.\n\n150\n00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:57.315\nNow, we haven't really talked about\nthe duplexing types here, but\n\n151\n00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:00.105\nhalf-duplex means It is\na two-way communication, but\n\n152\n00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:03.490\njust in one direction at a time,\nbecause I want you to think about it.\n\n153\n00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.990\nIf we go back to the diagram here, if I've\ngot this computer as sending information\n\n154\n00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:12.090\ninto the Hub, and it's going to\nbroadcast it out all other ports,\n\n155\n00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:16.490\nthen what must all other devices be\ndoing if this computer is communicating?\n\n156\n00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.611\nThey gotta wait, just wait.\n\n157\n00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:23.809\nYou've got data to send but I'm already\nsending data, right, and we can't send and\n\n158\n00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:25.967\nreceive data on the same electrical cable,\n\n159\n00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:30.250\nbecause we're gonna get electrical\ncollisions, right, and that's a bad thing.\n\n160\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.988\nSo the more devices,\njust like on the bus based network,\n\n161\n00:08:32.988 --> 00:08:35.680\nthe more devices you add to a hub,\nthe more contention.\n\n162\n00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.299\nThe more competition for communications,\nincrease the more wasted communication,\n\n163\n00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:44.347\nexcess communications that don't\nnecessarily need to be on your network,\n\n164\n00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:45.000\nall right.\n\n165\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.100\nSo the hub's where it started, all right.\n\n166\n00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.700\nThen, we moved into what was\nknown as the bridge, all right.\n\n167\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.430\nNow, there's a couple of different types\nof bridges, there's wired bridge and\n\n168\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.320\na wireless bridge too.\n\n169\n00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.624\nI wanna kind of tackle both.\n\n170\n00:08:56.624 --> 00:09:00.692\nNow again,understand that when we look\nat the objectives, ladies and gentleman,\n\n171\n00:09:00.692 --> 00:09:02.440\nthey're just saying a bridge.\n\n172\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.890\nBut again, I want you to kinda know the\ndifference between the wired bridge and\n\n173\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.010\nthe wireless bridge, all right?\n\n174\n00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.280\nSo the wired bridge, what would you have?\n\n175\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.770\nWell, within a local area network,\nall right, understand that that's where\n\n176\n00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.260\nthey're positioned, they're inside to\nyour local area network, all right.\n\n177\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.820\nYou could have two physical segments,\nright?\n\n178\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.910\nSegments, just a physical\ngrouping of computers together.\n\n179\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.320\nAnd essentially what you have here\nwhen you look at LAN segment 1 and\n\n180\n00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.090\nLAN segment 2, it really got two\ncomplete separate networks, right.\n\n181\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:37.416\nThere's no way for LAN segment 1\nto communicate with LAN segment 2,\n\n182\n00:09:37.416 --> 00:09:43.465\nso if you wanna take two of these segments\nand create an overall larger network,\n\n183\n00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:48.363\nthen you bridge the two smaller\nnetworks together, all right?\n\n184\n00:09:48.363 --> 00:09:52.314\nNow, the bridge, what it does,\nall right, it's kind of interesting.\n\n185\n00:09:52.314 --> 00:09:54.661\nIf a communication, let me go ahead and\n\n186\n00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:57.920\njust kinda move our little\nbox here out of the way.\n\n187\n00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.930\nIf this computer wants to speak with\nthis computer, does it make sense to\n\n188\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.480\nhave the bridge send that communication\nto workstation 4, 5, and 6?\n\n189\n00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.870\nNot really, if this was the hub,\nthat would absolutely happen.\n\n190\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.704\nHub doesn't understand anything.\n\n191\n00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:23.190\nSo now we start to see logical\ndecisions are being made here.\n\n192\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.380\nAnd what's being made?\n\n193\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.390\nWell, when workstation 1 sends\ninformation to workstation 2, we're\n\n194\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.310\nprobably still gonna have a bridge in\nhere, or a bus based network of some type.\n\n195\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.466\nSo that means, this computer's gonna\nhear it, this computer's gonna hear it,\n\n196\n00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:39.080\nthis computer's gonna hear it.\n\n197\n00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.904\nAnd the network adapter on this side\nof the bridge is gonna hear it as well.\n\n198\n00:10:42.904 --> 00:10:44.860\nBut the bridge, in this case,\n\n199\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.000\nisn't gonna pass the communication to\nits next interface on this next segment.\n\n200\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.352\nBecause what it's gonna do is it's gonna\ninspect the destination MAC address.\n\n201\n00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:59.200\nAnd it's gonna look at a table that\nit has, and the table will say,\n\n202\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.113\nhey, work station 3,\nthat's not on this segment.\n\n203\n00:11:03.113 --> 00:11:05.862\nThe MAC address lets me know\nthat it's actually connected\n\n204\n00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:08.070\nto this network this side of the bridge.\n\n205\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.920\nSo rather than allow all of that\ncommunication to go to LAN segment 2,\n\n206\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.490\nit isolates it.\n\n207\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.950\nAll right, so that is one of\nthe good things about a bridge.\n\n208\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:21.063\nYes, you can take two LAN segments,\nyou can make them into a larger network.\n\n209\n00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:27.050\nBut then you can also isolate them down\nin what we call collision domains, right?\n\n210\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:33.110\nBecause any electrical collisions that\nhappen for communications on computer 1,\n\n211\n00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:38.840\n2, and 3, only affect 1, 2, and 3 because\nthe Mac addresses are being inspected.\n\n212\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.401\nNow let say that workstation 1 wanted\nto send communication to workstation 4.\n\n213\n00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.653\nWell, the same process still applies\nbecause they're on LAN segment 1\n\n214\n00:11:48.653 --> 00:11:53.640\nstation 2, station 3, and the bridge\nare gonna receive that information.\n\n215\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.450\nBut this time what's gonna happen is,\nthe bridge is gonna say, wait a second,\n\n216\n00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.490\nlet me inspect the destination\nMac address, all right.\n\n217\n00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.620\nI'll look at a table here, all right.\n\n218\n00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.070\nSo I see that that information\nisn't bound for LAN segment 1, but\n\n219\n00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.690\naccording to my Mac table here that\nI have, I can actually send that\n\n220\n00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:16.970\ndirectly over to LAN segment 2 with\na destination MAC address is, all right?\n\n221\n00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.040\nSo now, we start to see that some logical\ndecisions are being made, all right?\n\n222\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.400\nWell, notice that we gotta kind of\na limitation on how many devices or\n\n223\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.940\nreally how many connections\nwe have to the bridge.\n\n224\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.800\nAnd if you look in this case,\n\n225\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.340\nwhat's gonna happen here was we're gonna\nstill gonna have hubs within this network.\n\n226\n00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.905\nOr we're gonna have some kind of\nbackbone cabling like the earlier bus\n\n227\n00:12:39.905 --> 00:12:40.620\ncommunication.\n\n228\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.650\nSo the bridges still didn't\neliminate the hubs, all right?\n\n229\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.930\nSo what can we do?\n\n230\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.535\nAll right, one of the things that you can\ndo is you could do multiport bridging,\n\n231\n00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:52.266\nall right?\n\n232\n00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:56.670\nMultiport bridging, we'll go into\nthis technology here in a second,\n\n233\n00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.610\nleads its way into and\nserves the basis for switches today.\n\n234\n00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.490\nWe'll come back to the switches\nin a second though, but\n\n235\n00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.860\nI want you to understand\nthat a multiport bridge,\n\n236\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.780\nyou could technically call the switch.\n\n237\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:13.508\nAll right, and we'll come back to\nthat here in a second cuzI also\n\n238\n00:13:13.508 --> 00:13:18.030\nwant to touch base on the wireless bridge,\nall right.\n\n239\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:23.860\nNow wireless bridges also work\nby taking two segments and\n\n240\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.020\nallowing communication to travel\nbetween those two sections,\n\n241\n00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.210\nthose two segments essentially\ncreating a bridge.\n\n242\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.780\nSo for instance, this would be good in\nscenarios where maybe you had a wired\n\n243\n00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.450\nnetwork here, that needs to\ncommunicate across the wireless\n\n244\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.480\ncommunication with wired network B but\nthere's a problem, right.\n\n245\n00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.420\nMaybe we don't have wires running,\n\n246\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.520\nwe don't have the ability to run\na cable in between these two.\n\n247\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.730\nSo what we can have here is we\ncan have the wired computers and\n\n248\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.040\nthe wireless computers talk\nto the access point, right?\n\n249\n00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.190\nDo the wired connection for the wireless\ndevices, or the wire devices, excuse me.\n\n250\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.640\nAnd they can communicate\nacross the wireless bridge\n\n251\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.220\nto the other computers\non the other segment.\n\n252\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.950\nSo concept still the same.\n\n253\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.238\nIn fact, we've talked about it\nin one of our other episodes,\n\n254\n00:14:13.238 --> 00:14:17.114\nwe talked about topologies where you\nhad a wireless local area network.\n\n255\n00:14:17.114 --> 00:14:22.582\nAnd you had a single basic service set and\nwe bridged two basic service\n\n256\n00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:28.830\nsets together and essentially what we\nnow have is an extended service set.\n\n257\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.959\nAn extended service set is almost\nlike a wireless bridge, right?\n\n258\n00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:35.630\nSo do be aware of that as well.\n\n259\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.650\nNow there might be times where you\njust need to extend the range of your\n\n260\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.060\nwireless network.\n\n261\n00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.730\nAnd maybe you don't need an entire AP,\na network,\n\n262\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.770\nan access point doing all the management,\nall the beckoning information and\n\n263\n00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.230\nyou just want to extend the range\nof the communication too.\n\n264\n00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.972\nWell inside of your wireless networks,\ninstead of doing wireless bridging,\n\n265\n00:14:56.972 --> 00:14:59.364\nyou can also do wireless\nrange extenders as well.\n\n266\n00:14:59.364 --> 00:15:01.170\nAnd that's really common\nin the home environments.\n\n267\n00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.468\nIt makes it fairly easy to extend your\nwireless network to the portions of maybe\n\n268\n00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:10.180\nyour home, where you realize that\nyou're getting sub-par performance.\n\n269\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.430\nThe performance isn't that best, or\n\n270\n00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.330\nmaybe the signal isn't even reaching\nthat side of the house to begin with.\n\n271\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.050\nAll right, so that is a little\nbit about our wireless bridge.\n\n272\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.700\nNow, we've talked about wireless\naccess points in other episodes, but\n\n273\n00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.310\nif you can just take a look.\n\n274\n00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:31.521\nRemember that the wireless access point,\nWAP, as they call it, or AP generically.\n\n275\n00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:36.482\nA wireless access point is nothing\nmore than a device that gives your\n\n276\n00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:41.980\nwireless devices within your networks\naccess to a wired network, right?\n\n277\n00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.100\nSo our access point here, right?\n\n278\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.610\nIt is connected to our wired network here,\n\n279\n00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.271\nin this case I'll just\ntake wired network A.\n\n280\n00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:52.937\nAnd I have wireless devices\nthat are in this network A.\n\n281\n00:15:52.937 --> 00:15:56.908\nThey need access to these wired computers,\nso how do they do it?\n\n282\n00:15:56.908 --> 00:16:00.444\nHence the term Wireless Access Point.\n\n283\n00:16:00.444 --> 00:16:05.976\nYour Wireless Access Point actually\ngives your wireless devices [LAUGH],\n\n284\n00:16:05.976 --> 00:16:10.279\nif you can remember that,\naccess to your wired network.\n\n285\n00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:10.930\nAll right.\n\n286\n00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.230\nSo that's a little bit about the bridge.\n\n287\n00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.030\nNow I do wanna go back to this concept\nthat I mentioned, a multi-port bridge.\n\n288\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.780\nRight.\nI said that forms the basis for\n\n289\n00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.270\nswitching technologies and\nswitches that we have, right?\n\n290\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.440\nBecause if I can take\nthese six computers and\n\n291\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.280\nthen connect all of those computers\nindividually to a connectivity device,\n\n292\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.900\nwe get a little bit better\nperformance out of it.\n\n293\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.540\nAnd I'll talk about that here in a second.\n\n294\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.400\nThis is where we get\nwhat's known as a switch.\n\n295\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.230\nA switch, really,\nis nothing more than a multi-port bridge.\n\n296\n00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.240\nThe difference is your devices\nhave a direct connection,\n\n297\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.990\nevery single one of them, into the switch.\n\n298\n00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:54.350\nVersus just one network adapter with\na bunch of devices connected to a hub and\n\n299\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.230\na single connection into\none side of the bridge.\n\n300\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.920\nNow, what's the benefit here?\n\n301\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.490\nThe benefit here is that when\na switch inspects the information,\n\n302\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:11.400\nit also does a lookup in the MAC table,\njust like a bridge does, right?\n\n303\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.190\nAnd then, let's say that Client1 wants\nto send information, I don't know,\n\n304\n00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.000\nto Client4, all right?\n\n305\n00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.010\nSo what does the switch do?\n\n306\n00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.320\nWell, the switch is going\nto inspect its MAC table.\n\n307\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.430\nAll right, and it's gonna look at\nthe ethernet frame in this case.\n\n308\n00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.470\nIt will look at the ethernet frame,\nand what it's gonna look at,\n\n309\n00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.790\nis it's gonna look and say, hmm,\nwhere do I need to send this?\n\n310\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.760\nWell, let me find out.\n\n311\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.850\nAnd inside of my MAC table,\nit will store the source and\n\n312\n00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.870\ndestination MAC addresses through\nconstant communication with the devices,\n\n313\n00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.730\nthe devices that are communicating\nwith the switch.\n\n314\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.190\nAnd it will build up this\ndatabase of MAC addresses.\n\n315\n00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.270\nAnd, in this case, once it says, okay,\nI know where that MAC address is.\n\n316\n00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.690\nIt's connected to, let's say,\nI don't know, port 10 on the switch.\n\n317\n00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.250\nMore importantly,\n\n318\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.810\nit knows how to forward the traffic\nbetween those ports out to the right\n\n319\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:10.120\nmachine that's connected to that port\nwith that same MAC address, all right.\n\n320\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.520\nNow, one of the great things\nalso about switches is,\n\n321\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.890\nremember we said that in a hub we're\ntalking about half duplex, right?\n\n322\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.470\nWell, in a switch you essentially\nget a full duplex communication.\n\n323\n00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.400\nI could send and receive out\nthe same port, right, because Client\n\n324\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.220\n1 can send information, and internally\nthe switch is doing that forwarding.\n\n325\n00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.060\nAt the same time, Client 5 can be\ncommunicating to me back to Client O1.\n\n326\n00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.700\nAll right, and essentially, too,\nwhat happens is each one of\n\n327\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.690\nthese computers now becomes their\nown individual collision domain.\n\n328\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.480\nWe've isolated those collisions\nbecause we don't have two\n\n329\n00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.730\ncomputers necessarily sending\ntraffic at the same time.\n\n330\n00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.740\nWith one exception.\n\n331\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.000\nBroadcast communications,\nif it is labeled for\n\n332\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.860\nthe broadcast MAC address,\nthat still goes out all ports.\n\n333\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.810\nAnd there is a potential that two machines\ncould do a broadcast at the same time.\n\n334\n00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:13.410\nSo you could still see some type of\nperformance hit there, but for the most\n\n335\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:19.610\npart, switches allow you a lot better\nperformance than the earlier hubs will.\n\n336\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.720\nAnd even more so\nthan the bridge, likewise.\n\n337\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.010\nAll right, so\n\n338\n00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.560\nwe're gonna go more into some of the\nswitching technologies in other episodes.\n\n339\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.860\nWe're just kind of, we wanna give you\na basis for these different devices.\n\n340\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.150\nAnd again, the next one, and\n\n341\n00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.060\nI didn't mention the intelligence\nwas in the middle right.\n\n342\n00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.640\nThis is the middle ground\nwe talk about intelligence,\n\n343\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.578\nbecause it is starting to\nmake logical decisions.\n\n344\n00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:48.880\nHowever,\n&gt;&gt; Now Wes, sorry to interrupt you there.\n\n345\n00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.950\nI definitely took him out of his groove.\n\n346\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.130\nHe was really in his groove, but\nthere's been a question gnawing at me.\n\n347\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.630\nSo you said these wireless extenders,\nright, they're just extending the range.\n\n348\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.720\nHow are they behaving differently\nthan a wireless bridge in particular?\n\n349\n00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.380\nOr are we getting too deep and\nwe'll cover that later on?\n\n350\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.420\n&gt;&gt; No that's a great question.\n\n351\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.270\nSee, the wireless range extender\nis more like a repeater.\n\n352\n00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.770\nAll it does,\nit's not really making a logical decision.\n\n353\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.670\nWhat it's doing is,\nit's saying, I see a signal,\n\n354\n00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.780\nI don't need to make any decisions which\nstation or anything that it goes to.\n\n355\n00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.250\nAnd I'm gonna regenerate it, and I'm going\nto extend its transmission distance.\n\n356\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.070\nAll right, when we have this wireless\nbridge, we still have to make some kind of\n\n357\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.420\ndecision as to whether that communication\nis going to cross the bridge and\n\n358\n00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.790\ngo into the second network or not.\n\n359\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.740\nSo really, from that standpoint,\nit's what decisions are being made.\n\n360\n00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.920\nAnd great question, too.\n\n361\n00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.220\nSo, that's the switch.\n\n362\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.000\nThe switch is kinda middle ground.\n\n363\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.500\nAnd if we wanna kinda recap too, with\nthe OSI model, I want you to remember,\n\n364\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:51.290\nwith the OSI model, hubs operate at\nlayer two, excuse me, layer one.\n\n365\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.750\nBecause they know raw bits.\n\n366\n00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.360\nThat's the physical layer.\n\n367\n00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.620\nYour switches operate for the most part,\n\n368\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.088\nswitching technologies operate at\nlayer two, the data link layer.\n\n369\n00:21:00.088 --> 00:21:03.910\nAll right, now the next one\nthat we've got to talk about\n\n370\n00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.700\nis another very important\ndevice on our networks.\n\n371\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.720\nAnd that is something known as,\nwell, it is known as a modem.\n\n372\n00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.280\nAll right, now I know some people\nare going, my gosh, modem.\n\n373\n00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.270\nWe're going way back in time here.\n\n374\n00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.640\nDo you guys still use these things?\n\n375\n00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.070\nAbsolutely, we still use these things,\nall right?\n\n376\n00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.010\nSo I got kind of a little diagram\non what a modem is, all right?\n\n377\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.610\nWhen we look at a modem, a modem is\njust short for modulator demodulator, or\n\n378\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.210\nmodulation demodulation.\n\n379\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.850\nHowever you want, I've heard a few\npeople call it different things.\n\n380\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.630\nBut modulate demodulate,\nmodulator demodulator.\n\n381\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.280\nAll right, so what is going on here?\n\n382\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:42.920\nAll right, well,\n\n383\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.200\nyou have digital signals, essentially\nthey're coming from your computer.\n\n384\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.540\nAnd they're going into the modem.\n\n385\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.170\nAnd then you have these\nconverter chips right,\n\n386\n00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.545\nyou have analogs to\ndigital converter chips.\n\n387\n00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:56.610\nDigital-analog converter chips and they\nrun them through modulation schemes that\n\n388\n00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.680\nturns that digital communication\ninto an analog signal, and\n\n389\n00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.670\nplaces it on your public switch\ntelephone network lines, the PSTN lines.\n\n390\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.500\nAnd then, on the other end, that analog\nsignal comes back off of the wire,\n\n391\n00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.590\ngoes into the modem, and\nthey basically run it through\n\n392\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.730\nthe analog-to-digital conversion chips,\nif you will.\n\n393\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.106\nAnd then it's delivered to the computer,\nand the computer processes it.\n\n394\n00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.921\nYes, we're talking dialup.\n\n395\n00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:27.350\nYes, we're talking about a whopping 56K\ntransmission speed, way back in time.\n\n396\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.130\nAnd like I said,\nif you think that we don't use those,\n\n397\n00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.510\nall you have to do is look at\nsome of the areas, in fact,\n\n398\n00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.370\nat the time of this recording, that have\nbeen affected by things like hurricanes.\n\n399\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.700\nWhen your satellite communications fail,\nwhen things like your,\n\n400\n00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:48.500\njust regular ethernet-based networks fail,\nwhen they get completely eliminated,\n\n401\n00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:55.870\nthere's so much distribution of the public\nswitch telephone network lines that,\n\n402\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.036\na lot of times, we're gonna use it in\nthings like disaster recovery situations.\n\n403\n00:22:59.036 --> 00:23:01.870\nWhere you'll have things like\ninsurance companies, you'll have\n\n404\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.490\nemergency support companies come in and\nthey'll come in with banks of modems, so\n\n405\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:11.500\nthat somebody can maintain or reestablish\neven the most basic communications.\n\n406\n00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.020\nAs well as things like backups, right?\n\n407\n00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.130\nSo don't think that the days of\ndial-up are completely gone.\n\n408\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.670\nWe still see it,\nwe still see modems in today's networks.\n\n409\n00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.550\nAll right, couple more that\nwe wanna kinda talk about.\n\n410\n00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.510\nWe're gonna talk about\nwhat is known really as\n\n411\n00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:34.360\na VOIP, a VOIP end point.\n\n412\n00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.770\nWhat's a VOIP endpoint?\n\n413\n00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:36.920\nWhat's VOIP to begin with?\n\n414\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.950\nWell, this is Voice Over IP.\n\n415\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.750\nAnd when we talk about a VOIP end point,\na lot of times it's gonna be a VOIP phone.\n\n416\n00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.530\nDoesn't have to be.\n\n417\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.811\nIt could be a device that has a VoIP\nclient on it, but let's go ahead and\n\n418\n00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:47.825\nkinda show you here.\n\n419\n00:23:47.825 --> 00:23:49.864\nYou'll have these VoIP endpoints,\n\n420\n00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:53.809\nin this case I'm just using things\nlike the traditional voice over IP,\n\n421\n00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:56.782\nwhich is what VoIP stands for,\nvoice over IP phones.\n\n422\n00:23:56.782 --> 00:24:01.210\nAll right, and they send neither\nthat H323 communication or\n\n423\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.660\nsession initiation protocols,\nzip if you will.\n\n424\n00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.360\nSometimes you might even\nhear them called zip and\n\n425\n00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.130\npoints, if they're using the zip protocol,\nbut remember voice over IP isn't\n\n426\n00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.300\njust restricted to the session\ninitiation protocol, all right?\n\n427\n00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.620\nAnd that's essentially what they are.\n\n428\n00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.240\nYou have your VoIP end points.\n\n429\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.240\nYou have VoIP server, and\nit is responsible for\n\n430\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.010\nhandling the communications and\ndistributing it to the endpoints.\n\n431\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.820\nAll right, let's see, a couple other\nones that we wanna end up talking about.\n\n432\n00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.320\nOne of the ones I wanna talk about is\nsomething known as media converters.\n\n433\n00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.690\nNow remember media converters,\nthis is more about interoperability\n\n434\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.040\nbetween two dissimilar\ncommunication types, right?\n\n435\n00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.480\nOne of the ones that we have\nthat's real common are the fact,\n\n436\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.890\nlike we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n437\n00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.340\nwe've mentioned fiber-optic communication\nand the two mode types, right?\n\n438\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.080\nWe have single mode and multi-mode.\n\n439\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.840\nWell, if you need to communicate from a\nmulti-mode to a single mode communication\n\n440\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.700\nmechanism, they don't work together,\nright?\n\n441\n00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.970\nThey don't play nice.\n\n442\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.430\nThey're completely different\ntypes of communications.\n\n443\n00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.530\nWhen you talk multi-mode, remember we're\ntalking about multiple light sources\n\n444\n00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.750\nversus a single mode, which basically\ntakes a single laser and fires it down\n\n445\n00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:15.245\na highly optimized and concentrated core\nand can do it up to 40,0000 kilometers.\n\n446\n00:25:15.245 --> 00:25:17.174\nSo they're completely different signals.\n\n447\n00:25:17.174 --> 00:25:22.870\nAnd you put a media converter, and\nit takes one protocol gateways.\n\n448\n00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:26.270\nGateways sometimes are media converters,\nand the fact that they take dissimilar\n\n449\n00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.826\nprotocols and allow them to communicate\nacross to each other for interoperability.\n\n450\n00:25:29.826 --> 00:25:34.052\nAnd you can put something like a single\nmode to multi-mode media converter, so\n\n451\n00:25:34.052 --> 00:25:38.370\nthat you can have those communication\ntypes between dissimilar systems.\n\n452\n00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.370\nYou also have things like, for instance,\nmulti-mode to Ethernet, right?\n\n453\n00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.441\nInternally, our local area\nnetworks most probably\n\n454\n00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:48.470\nare Ethernet-based communication types.\n\n455\n00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:51.330\nYou can even say single mode\nto Ethernet too, right?\n\n456\n00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.991\nBecause single mode communications can\nbe used from your ISP coming from your\n\n457\n00:25:54.991 --> 00:25:58.711\ninternet service provider into your\nbuilding through your demarcation point\n\n458\n00:25:58.711 --> 00:25:59.853\nand they hit Ethernet.\n\n459\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.080\nWhat do we do?\n\n460\n00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.770\nThey don't play nice together, right?\n\n461\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.380\nSo you put the media converter in there\nand again it does the conversion for you.\n\n462\n00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.910\nNow, I put coaxial in here, just because\nin the earlier days, you might see fiber\n\n463\n00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:19.700\noptic to the old Ethernet coaxial\nimplementations, but they are there.\n\n464\n00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.460\nAnd I think that's pretty much it, right?\n\n465\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.490\nSo when it boils down to,\none of the popular ones is a,\n\n466\n00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.580\nand I didn't even mention that, copper\nmedia versus a fiber optic light source.\n\n467\n00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:37.300\nThose don't jive well without anything in\nthe middle, again, to do the conversion,\n\n468\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:43.460\nso definitely know those conversion, know\na little bit about the media converters.\n\n469\n00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.470\nThe last one we have to talk about is\nprobably one of the smartest network\n\n470\n00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.510\ndevices that we have within\nour modern networks today, and\n\n471\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.865\nthat's something known as a router.\n\n472\n00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:57.160\nLet's go ahead and take a look at that.\n\n473\n00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.660\nAnd Justin, let me go ahead and\nexplain why I say,\n\n474\n00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.910\nwhy the router is probably\nthe smartest device.\n\n475\n00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:08.910\nAnd that's because a router, unlike\na switch, doesn't have to be connected\n\n476\n00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.440\nto the network in order to\nget traffic to that network.\n\n477\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.400\nAll right, and what I mean by\nthat is a switch is only aware of\n\n478\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.126\nthe devices that are directly\nconnected to its ports,\n\n479\n00:27:19.126 --> 00:27:22.340\nIf you're not connected to a portal\non the switch, guess what?\n\n480\n00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.570\nIt says, I don't know who you are.\n\n481\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.140\nI got a MAC table, and I build up the MAC\ntable based on the devices that connect to\n\n482\n00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.410\nthe ports and communicate with me, right?\n\n483\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.810\nRouters are different.\n\n484\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.380\nRouters can actually build\ndatabases of networks\n\n485\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.120\nthat they're not connected to, all right?\n\n486\n00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.200\nSo if Justin and\nI are both routers, right?\n\n487\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.780\nI can communicate with Justin and\nsay, hey,\n\n488\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.510\nJustin, I need to send\ntraffic to this network.\n\n489\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.490\nDo you know where it is?\n\n490\n00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.720\nCuz I don't know where it is.\n\n491\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.409\nAnd Justin, as router can look in his\nrouting table and say, you know what,\n\n492\n00:27:52.409 --> 00:27:56.790\nI don't know exactly where that network\nis, but I do have an entry here that tells\n\n493\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.100\nme if you send it to me, I can forward it\nto the next person in the line that does.\n\n494\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.370\nSo they can communicate with each other,\nand build up these network topologies.\n\n495\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.010\nAnd another thing, too,\nis they can connect\n\n496\n00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:12.840\nyou to these networks when they're not\ndirectly connected themselves, right.\n\n497\n00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.400\nSo routers are great connectivity devices.\n\n498\n00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.760\nThey are the smartest connectivity device.\n\n499\n00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.590\nAnd again with the communications\nbetween router to router, you could\n\n500\n00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.840\nhave something here where you have one\nrouter connected to three networks,\n\n501\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.180\nlet's say, just theoretically.\n\n502\n00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.390\nAnd you can have all these other\nrouters that are communicating and\n\n503\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:37.791\nthey could build up what essentially\nbecomes these large humongous topologies,\n\n504\n00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:43.590\nand networks that this first router didn't\neven know, doesn't even understand.\n\n505\n00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:48.030\nCuz all it has to know is that, hey,\nback to the analogy of Justin and I.\n\n506\n00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:52.940\nI talk to Justin, Justin says,\nwell, I don't exactly know where\n\n507\n00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.290\nthat network is way out here, but\nyou know what, I've talked to this guy.\n\n508\n00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:01.210\nAnd this guy said, well, if you send it\nto me, I can get it to the next person in\n\n509\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:06.120\nline, and again, finally, it will,\nthrough these communication processes,\n\n510\n00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.270\nthey will get that information to\nthe right endpoint, all right?\n\n511\n00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.500\nTo the right network, and then,\nby association, to the right endpoint.\n\n512\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.510\nRouters are what make up the communication\nacross the entire Internet.\n\n513\n00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.170\nIf it wasn't for\n\n514\n00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:26.150\nrouters, we'd be stuck with local\narea communications, in general.\n\n515\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.390\nAnd that would be all that we have.\n\n516\n00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.840\nSo understand that the routers\nare the smartest devices,\n\n517\n00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.960\nas a recap on your OSI model,\nremember they operate at layer three.\n\n518\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.480\nThey deal with IP addresses.\n\n519\n00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.738\nNow to round this one off, I know Justin's\ntelling me, he's giving me an eye saying,\n\n520\n00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:42.852\nit's getting a little close\nto the end of this episode.\n\n521\n00:29:42.852 --> 00:29:46.637\nLet's go ahead and wrap all this up and\nput some of these devices in our networks,\n\n522\n00:29:46.637 --> 00:29:48.696\nso you know where they\nwould be positioned,\n\n523\n00:29:48.696 --> 00:29:51.540\nshould you have to uninstall and\nconfigure them.\n\n524\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.010\nAll right.\nSo I got a little diagram here.\n\n525\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.280\nRight?\nWe've got our endpoints here.\n\n526\n00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:55.992\nWe've got our switches.\n\n527\n00:29:55.992 --> 00:30:00.320\nRemember, our switches are our\nsingle network, local area networks.\n\n528\n00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.270\nThey're only aware of the devices\nthat are connected to them,\n\n529\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.650\nif a computer has to send information\nto a computer on another network.\n\n530\n00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:13.550\nWell, if it's not connected to the switch,\nthe switch isn't gonna know how to do it.\n\n531\n00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.170\nBut guess what,\nwe can send it to the router.\n\n532\n00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.340\nThe router can say, hey, you know what?\n\n533\n00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.290\nI know where that network is, and\nI can help you get that information there.\n\n534\n00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.970\nRemember that the firewall typically,\nin the network-based firewall,\n\n535\n00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:31.080\nis going to be screening all traffic\ncoming in and out of your network.\n\n536\n00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.320\nSo we could say, if these networks\nare owned by two different people,\n\n537\n00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.924\nlet's say, two different companies, right?\n\n538\n00:30:37.924 --> 00:30:43.090\nI could do something like this, and we\nmight have a couple of firewalls, right?\n\n539\n00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.560\nSo understand that your firewalls\ncan be strategically placed.\n\n540\n00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.210\nBut if this was a heavily routed\nenvironment, where maybe, this,\n\n541\n00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.170\na single company owned both of\nthese networks, well, maybe,\n\n542\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:58.648\noutbound to the Internet,\nwe only have one inbound and one outbound,\n\n543\n00:30:58.648 --> 00:31:01.820\nand we put our network\nfirewall right there.\n\n544\n00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.830\nSo do keep that in mind that the network\nfirewall screens all traffic coming in and\n\n545\n00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.110\nleaving your network.\n\n546\n00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.850\nBut that kind of gives you an idea of\nthe placement of these devices within\n\n547\n00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.750\nyour modern networks for\nyour Net Plus exam.\n\n548\n00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.123\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes, thanks for\n\n549\n00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:19.930\ndefinitely seeing how those pieces of\nthe puzzle come together to provide, well,\n\n550\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.410\nincredibly complex, admittedly so,\na lot more complex than I even feared.\n\n551\n00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.288\nBut definitely thank you so much and\n\n552\n00:31:26.288 --> 00:31:29.800\nhopefully you stay tuned as we got\nmore network plus coming at you.\n\n553\n00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.290\nBut for this episode we're\ngonna go ahead and wrap it up.\n\n554\n00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.370\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Justin Dennison.\n\n555\n00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.099\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n556\n00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:45.029\n[MUSIC]\n\n557\n00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:49.840\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

Plus and this episode is\nadvanced networking devices.\n\n9\n00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.710\nThis is not mediocre networking,\n\n10\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.740\nthis is advanced networking devices,\nwith Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.460\nWes, good to see you.\n\n12\n00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.130\nThanks for joining us.\n\n13\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me here Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.320\nThat's right, we're going to be talking\nabout a lot of devices here that have\n\n15\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.770\na little bit more functionality than just\nthe traditional networking devices that\n\n16\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.400\nwe've looked at in other episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.020\nWhat do you say we just go ahead and\nwe'll dive right in and\n\n18\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.285\nwe'll start with the very first one?\n\n19\n00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:47.990\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The very first ones that they call out\n\n20\n00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.680\nis what is known as a multilayer switch.\n\n21\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.540\nNow why would they call\nit a multilayer switch?\n\n22\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.400\nAre we talking about a switch that really\nwhen it's put together looks like one of\n\n23\n00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.120\nthose vanilla wafers?\n\n24\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.830\nNo, that's not really the layers\nthat we're talking about.\n\n25\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.060\nWe have to harken back to our OSI model.\n\n26\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.360\nRemember the OSI models, that seven\nlayer model that we talked about?\n\n27\n00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; You know and it different layers,\n\n28\n00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.050\nthere's different functionalities,\nright, different services being provided\n\n29\n00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.030\nthat help move our data from source\nto destination across our networks.\n\n30\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.010\nWell this is where the multilayer switch\ncomes in or the term multi layer comes in.\n\n31\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.330\nNow when we look at switches,\n\n32\n00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.750\nwe've talked about in other episodes\nabout how switching functionality right.\n\n33\n00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.890\nThe switch receives a frame,\nright, in one of it's ports.\n\n34\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.820\nIt receives an ethernet frame and\nthen it does a couple things.\n\n35\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.130\nOne of the first things it does is it\ninspects the addressing information,\n\n36\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.860\nthe Mac address.\n\n37\n00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.230\nThat six byte address.\n\n38\n00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.790\nWe talked about on other episodes and\nit says, okay,\n\n39\n00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.470\nI see the destination MAC address and\nthen it references a database, right?\n\n40\n00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.650\nIt's database is what's\nknown as a MAC table, right?\n\n41\n00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.690\nAnd in that MAC table, if the switch\nis already communicated with the device\n\n42\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.140\nthat is That the destination is bound for,\nthat package is destined for.\n\n43\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.420\nThen it will have that\ninformation inside of the switch.\n\n44\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.720\nIf it hasn't, for whatever reason,\ntalk to that device.\n\n45\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.390\nThen it'll flood, you know, and\n\n46\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.410\nit'll send out a broadcast communication\nout all of its ports except for that one.\n\n47\n00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.220\nThat it received that\ncommunication in on and\n\n48\n00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.510\nit'll try to discover the device,\nbecome aware of it,\n\n49\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.630\nand when it does it puts that destination\nmac address in its mac table and\n\n50\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.050\nthen it doesn't have to worry about\nwhat port it's connected to, right?\n\n51\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.260\nSo that's the ethernet frames that\nwe talked about in the source and\n\n52\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.420\ndestination MAC addresses right that\nis layered two of the OSI model.\n\n53\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.010\nAnd Zach, when we talked about\nthe OSI model we say you know\n\n54\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.140\nswitching functionalities,\nthat's what happens.\n\n55\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.330\nThey happen at layer too.\n\n56\n00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.490\nWell, a multi layer switch.\n\n57\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.742\nLet's take a look at it here.\n\n58\n00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:44.590\nA multilayer switch, we're talking about\nagain multiple layers of the OSI model.\n\n59\n00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.190\nAll right, so let's say that I am\nsending information from my computer\n\n60\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.890\ninto the switch, right.\n\n61\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.140\nSo as we process the information, and\nmy computer gets that packet ready to send\n\n62\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.700\nout the network adapter, right,\nit goes down from layer seven.\n\n63\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.650\nApplication layer, goes down to\nthe presentation layer, session layer,\n\n64\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.540\ntransport, network, right.\n\n65\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.740\nDown to the data link layer.\n\n66\n00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.240\nAgain, we're layer two,\nwhere the switch is happening.\n\n67\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.390\nAnd then finally that mac layer, right,\nthat media access control layers basically\n\n68\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.310\ntakes that data and it allows it to be put\nin the raw bit form, right, where we get\n\n69\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.715\nout electrical binary ones and zeroes,\nright, we're at layer 1, right.\n\n70\n00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:22.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well the switch doesn't understand\n\n71\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.670\nanything about layer 1\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n72\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.660\nit's not really operating at that layer.\n\n73\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.930\nBut, if we're gonna talk about\nthose layers, let's go ahead and\n\n74\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.650\njust be complete on this, right?\n\n75\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.960\nBut then when the switch receives it,\nokay?\n\n76\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.560\nThe switch starts the switching process,\nright?\n\n77\n00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.110\nAnd that happens at layer 2.\n\n78\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.000\nAnd at layer 2, keep in mind that\nwhat we have going on is again\n\n79\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.110\na side expecting that MAC address, right?\n\n80\n00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.140\nIt's looking at a database that it holds,\nand again, if that MAC address is there\n\n81\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.930\nIt's going to say, okay,\nI know what port this is bound for.\n\n82\n00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.430\nBut the interesting characteristic\nabout the multi-layer switch\n\n83\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.660\nis it can actually send\ninformation up the stack.\n\n84\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.290\nWe have what are known as ASICs\napplication specifics integrated\n\n85\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.400\ncontrollers, integrated chips.\n\n86\n00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.030\nAnd what it can do is basically process\nnot only the data link layer and the MAC\n\n87\n00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.910\naddress information, it also exhibits\nthe characteristics of a router, right?\n\n88\n00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.570\nNow again, remember routing, right?.\n\n89\n00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.770\nAgain, you have to go back to that OSI\nmodel to know what that multi-layer\n\n90\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.280\nswitch is doing right?\n\n91\n00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.540\nSo the routers, right,\n\n92\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.110\nthey understand what's going on\nat layer three of the OSI model.\n\n93\n00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.380\nRight?\nThey understand IP addresses, source and\n\n94\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.940\ndestination IP addresses.\n\n95\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.450\nThose are those logical identifiers\nversus the hardware based identifier.\n\n96\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.140\nAnd then it makes a decision on\nwhere to send The destination\n\n97\n00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.030\npacket, that outbound packet I guess,\nthat based on a routing tip.\n\n98\n00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.520\nLet me look at the IP address.\n\n99\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.970\nLet me figure out what network I'm on.\n\n100\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.050\nLet me see if the network matches the\ndestination network within this IP packet\n\n101\n00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.440\nnow we're not in frames, we're above\nthe frames we're in the IP packet layer.\n\n102\n00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.190\nLet me go and\nthen investigate that and let me see.\n\n103\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.810\nAlright I see the destination IP address.\n\n104\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.620\nAnd then what it does is it says,\nwell okay let me go ahead now\n\n105\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.490\non my routing table what is the best path,\nright?\n\n106\n00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.890\nThat's routing, what is the best path?\n\n107\n00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.990\nOr interface to send that out\nthe best path within the router.\n\n108\n00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.160\nWe go back to my slide here, that's\nessentially what the switch is doing.\n\n109\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.420\nThe switch is receiving that information.\n\n110\n00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.490\nAgain, it's coming from client one,\nlayer one of the OSI model.\n\n111\n00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.410\nA raw bit forms.\n\n112\n00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.240\nIt goes into the switch.\n\n113\n00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.030\nThe switch performs\nthe ethernet functionality.\n\n114\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.000\nThe frame information no source and\n\n115\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.790\ndestination mac address, and\ninternally, this looks external.\n\n116\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.990\nUnderstand these are to just kind of\nvisualize what we're talking about.\n\n117\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.000\nAll of this is happening in the switch,\nright?\n\n118\n00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.940\nWe don't really individual layers right?\n\n119\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.480\nBut then it looks at IP address,\nand it understands source and\n\n120\n00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.910\ndestination IP address.\n\n121\n00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.120\nIt also exhibits the characters\nof a routing table and\n\n122\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.570\nknowing what interface to send it out on\nto you know to make the best path and\n\n123\n00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.230\nto make the best deliver the fastest\npath to get that information\n\n124\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.420\nthrough its destination network,\nbased on the IP address.\n\n125\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.650\nAnd again, all the same switch here.\n\n126\n00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.320\nWe're just trying to understand\nthat it's processing those layers.\n\n127\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.350\nI'm processing the frame.\n\n128\n00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.610\nI have no source of destination mac.\n\n129\n00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.660\nI can hand it up to the IP layer,\nall internally to itself with those ASICS.\n\n130\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.790\nAnd it essentially can choose based on IP,\n\n131\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.170\nand then finally it hands it out to\nthe right network, the right destination.\n\n132\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.030\nAnd that's essentially what a multilayer\nswitch is, a multilayer switch is nothing\n\n133\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.130\nmore than one that works with\nmore layers of the OSI model.\n\n134\n00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.860\nNow, one of the benefits to this is\nthe fact that you can get a single device,\n\n135\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.410\nSingle device, and it does allow you\nthe ability to do both routing and\n\n136\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.500\nswitching all in the same\nconnectivity device.\n\n137\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.180\nAll right, and that's essentially\nwhat a multi-layer switch is, right?\n\n138\n00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.480\nIt's not really too hard,\nand if you can understand\n\n139\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.340\nThat what's going on here is that\nit's nothing more than a switch.\n\n140\n00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.920\nIt's an advanced switch, right?\n\n141\n00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.930\nIt understands more characteristics than\nthe native switching lane, all right?\n\n142\n00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.660\nAnd the next thing we're gonna talk\nabout are what are known as proxies.\n\n143\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.660\nAll right, now when we talk about a proxy,\na proxy is, think of it as a middle man.\n\n144\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.790\nRight, I always think about a middle man.\n\n145\n00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.670\nRight?\n\n146\n00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.730\nAnd if I request the service, I have some\n\n147\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.140\nintermediate device that's sitting between\nme and that request that I'm making.\n\n148\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.270\nSo for instance, let's say that I'm\nmaking a request from a web server, or\n\n149\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.140\nmy web browser I guess is\nthe true client right?\n\n150\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.840\nI type in and\nneed to connect to a web page.\n\n151\n00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.308\nWell, as the web client and the proxy is\nnot there, it's basically my computer\n\n152\n00:07:47.308 --> 00:07:52.548\nsending an outbound communication to\nthe web server requesting over http.\n\n153\n00:07:52.548 --> 00:07:56.560\nHey, I'm going to make an http request,\nget me that web page.\n\n154\n00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.106\nGet me that resource.\n\n155\n00:07:58.106 --> 00:08:01.910\nRight, then back over HTTP, over\nthe Internet, over the network, right?\n\n156\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.090\nIt's returned back to my web browser.\n\n157\n00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.370\nMy web browser renders the page.\n\n158\n00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.270\nThat's without the proxy.\n\n159\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.630\nBut you put a proxy in there, and\n\n160\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.410\nnow what happens is my computer is\nstill looking to do the same thing.\n\n161\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.920\nNothing really changes there.\n\n162\n00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.560\nI'm still gonna make a request and\nI say I but it's the web browser.\n\n163\n00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.438\nI'm gonna make a web request.\n\n164\n00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:25.094\nThe web browser's gonna send\nthat information out, but\n\n165\n00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:29.739\ninstead this time of sending directly\nto the web server, it's gonna hit\n\n166\n00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:34.481\nthat intermediate device, the middle\nman or woman, person if you will.\n\n167\n00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.224\nCan't forget our ladies out there, right?\n\n168\n00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:38.481\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And what we have is a device that is\n\n169\n00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:43.248\nnow generating a new request and\nasking the web server that I\n\n170\n00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:47.750\nwas originally gonna ask,\nhey, I need that resource.\n\n171\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.340\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\n\n172\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.960\none of the things that we can do\nhere is let's take a look at it.\n\n173\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.100\nCuz there's a couple\ndifferent kinds of proxies.\n\n174\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.730\nI just want you to know\ngenerically that a proxy is\n\n175\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.980\nsitting in between a client and\na resource request.\n\n176\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.320\n&gt;&gt; And a question I have too, Wes,\n\n177\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.370\nis proxy can also be like limited access-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n178\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.470\n&gt;&gt; For whoever you, the user that\nyou would choose that's me, right?\n\n179\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.540\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly what it is and allows,\n\n180\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.020\nfrom an administrator standpoint it\nallows access control, all right?\n\n181\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.380\nAnd what do we mean by that, all right?\n\n182\n00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.600\nWell, typically when you talk\nabout a proxy, a lot of people\n\n183\n00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.610\ndon't really even think about what the two\ndifferent types of proxys that there are.\n\n184\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.840\nAnd I guess you could say transparent\nproxy could be a third one too.\n\n185\n00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.560\nBut you have forward proxy and\na reverse proxy.\n\n186\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.571\nAll right, a lot of times when\npeople are talking about proxies,\n\n187\n00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.920\nwhat they might not realize is, they're\npretty much talking about a forward proxy.\n\n188\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.515\nThat's the one that you're, well actually,\nreverse proxy, Zach, honestly, we'll see\n\n189\n00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:48.540\nwill work the same way that you're\ntalking governing access, all right.\n\n190\n00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.660\nAnd you can see that what we have is\nwe have a group of clients, right.\n\n191\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.268\nAnd the forward proxy is typically but\n\n192\n00:09:55.268 --> 00:10:00.091\nproviding services to a group of\nclients within an internal network.\n\n193\n00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:04.032\nAll right, now I want you to pay attention\nto the direction of the data flow.\n\n194\n00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:08.690\nAll right, we're going from the internal\nLAN, we've got a group of clients,\n\n195\n00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.560\nmultiple clients,\n\n196\n00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.590\nand they're making a request in this way,\nwe're just gonna say a web proxy.\n\n197\n00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.410\nThere's different types\nof proxies out there.\n\n198\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.450\nWeb proxy is one of\nthe common ones alright.\n\n199\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:23.160\nAnd it is important to understand that\nwhen this proxy receives a request,\n\n200\n00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.300\nit's a web request from\none of these clients.\n\n201\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.130\nIt kinda catches that information.\n\n202\n00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.200\nIt says, Zach you know,\nyou asked me directions to I don't know,\n\n203\n00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.340\ndirections to a place in\nVirginia somewhere, all right.\n\n204\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.105\nWell you know what, let me go ahead, and\n\n205\n00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:41.130\nI'm gonna ask that\nquestion on your behalf.\n\n206\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.435\nHold on, Ill get back with you.\n\n207\n00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm gonna go out, and\n\n208\n00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.830\nI'm gonna ask directions for you.\n\n209\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.400\nAnd when I receive that request,\nall right, maybe Zach says,\n\n210\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.540\nI don't wanna look like I don't\nknow what I'm talking about.\n\n211\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.430\nI mean, I know where Virginia is.\n\n212\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.770\nWell, the great thing about\nme asking on his behalf\n\n213\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.450\nI'm the one that looks\nlike I made the request.\n\n214\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.510\nNo one even knows.\n\n215\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.440\nIt's like Zach don't worry about it.\n\n216\n00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.330\nI got your back man.\n\n217\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n218\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.770\nthen I pass off the request back to Zach.\n\n219\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.900\nZach gets his directions to wherever\nit is that he's going and he's happy.\n\n220\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.722\nAll right now let's say that not Zach,but\nlet's say one of our other hosts,\n\n221\n00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:18.720\nMr. Rodrick out there Mike.\n\n222\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.580\nMike comes up and says,\nI need to get to that same location.\n\n223\n00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.238\nI love food so we'll call it\na direction to a restaurant, all right.\n\n224\n00:11:27.238 --> 00:11:31.092\nThen Mike asks me and says,\nWes, how do you get to that,\n\n225\n00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:34.688\nI need directions to that restaurant.\n\n226\n00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:39.595\nWell, I look and I'm like well wait\na second, I already have that answer.\n\n227\n00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:44.010\nZach asked me for\nthose directions earlier in the day or\n\n228\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.170\nwhatever time limits gonna\nTTLs gonna happen to.\n\n229\n00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.490\nI've already got that information so\nyou know what here you go.\n\n230\n00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.170\nI don't even have to make the request for\nyou.\n\n231\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.080\nSo there's two things\nthat are happening there.\n\n232\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.750\nOne is the fact that if we\ngo back to our diagram here\n\n233\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.760\nlet's say that this server\nout here on the Internet.\n\n234\n00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.430\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's say that's the web server.\n\n235\n00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.100\nAll right, so we got our web server\nout here and I'll make it so\n\n236\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.060\nyou guys can see out there, right,\nwe got our web server, all right.\n\n237\n00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.940\nNow, the proxy is actually\nmaking the request, right,\n\n238\n00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.200\nand this just so you can see it, probably\ngonna go through the firewalls, all right.\n\n239\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.795\nBut the interesting thing is,\naccording to the web server,\n\n240\n00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:28.119\non a security stand point,\nwhat we end up having here is,\n\n241\n00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:31.831\nto the web server,\nour network looks like this.\n\n242\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.505\nTo the web server, those internal\nclients that ask the question,\n\n243\n00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:41.720\nask for their request,\nthey don't even exist.\n\n244\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.230\nBecause I want you to understand\nthat when the request is made for\n\n245\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.440\nthe service,\nthe proxy generates a new request.\n\n246\n00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.370\nSo from a security standpoint, it masks,\nit hides the identity of the clients that\n\n247\n00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.060\nit's providing the service for\non the internal network.\n\n248\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.810\nSo that's one of the security\nadvantages that we get.\n\n249\n00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.290\nBack to Zach's question and to answer it\nmore fully, yes we get access control.\n\n250\n00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.930\nBecause as an administrator what\nI can do is I can say okay,\n\n251\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.752\nwe've got this group of clients on this\nnetwork, they're allowed to ask requests\n\n252\n00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:16.995\nout there somewhere along the Internet,\nbut I've got a network over here.\n\n253\n00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:21.870\nAnd these people shouldn't be connecting\nopenly to the Internet maybe for\n\n254\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.100\nsecurity purposes.\n\n255\n00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.270\nSo we get access control, right?\n\n256\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.690\nNot only masks the presence of\nthe clients that are making the requests,\n\n257\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.030\nproviding a service to the group of\nthose clients on the internal network.\n\n258\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:38.600\nBut also providing outbound access\ncontrol, just like you asked, all right?\n\n259\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.110\nNow let's take it from the standpoint of,\nmaybe you have some servers\n\n260\n00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:52.360\nthat you wanna let external clients\ngain access to on your internal network.\n\n261\n00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.960\nBut you don't want them to know about\nanything on your internal network.\n\n262\n00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.650\nThat's another thing from\nyour security standpoint.\n\n263\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.510\nIf I got, let's say, and\nFTP server on my internal network,\n\n264\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.910\nmaybe even in a DMZ, right,\nscreened subnet, perimeter network, so\n\n265\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.530\nyou can get external access, but\nyou can't get into my internal network.\n\n266\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:14.260\nBut I still don't want you to know where\nthat FTP server is or what it's about.\n\n267\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.100\nI don't want you to have\nany information about it.\n\n268\n00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.790\nWell, that's where\nthe reverse proxy comes in.\n\n269\n00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.680\nAnd a lot of times we talk about\nthe forward proxy because it is one of\n\n270\n00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.790\nthe common ones, but\nwe don't talk about the reverse proxy.\n\n271\n00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.160\nSo let's go ahead and let's look at that.\n\n272\n00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.620\nSo here's our forward proxy and\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n273\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.020\nNow I wanna look at a reverse proxy.\n\n274\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.960\nLet me get that text out of there.\n\n275\n00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.910\nSo now, I've got an external client.\n\n276\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.840\nWe're gonna say that that client is\nsomewhere out there on the Internet,\n\n277\n00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.760\nall right.\n\n278\n00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.890\nI've got an FTP server and the FTP\nserver might not even be in the LAN.\n\n279\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.900\nIt might actually even be in\nthe demilitarized zone here just so\n\n280\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.190\nthey don't give access\nto the internal network.\n\n281\n00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.250\nBut not only that I could have\na series of servers here,\n\n282\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.960\nright, providing all kinds of services.\n\n283\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.660\nAnd now what I'm doing is not so much\nthat I'm servicing outbound request from\n\n284\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:10.240\na group of clients, but what I have a\nsingle request coming in to my network and\n\n285\n00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.600\nthat reverse proxy sits in\nfront of a group of servers.\n\n286\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.030\nYou see the difference here?\n\n287\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:21.680\nWe got one coming in, our request coming\nin and that proxy can service the request,\n\n288\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.450\nconnect to the file transfer\nprotocol server and\n\n289\n00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.680\ndeliver the request, but\naccording to the outside world guess what?\n\n290\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.730\nWe're gonna do the same\nthing with our boxes here.\n\n291\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.690\nNone of this exists.\n\n292\n00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.030\nNone of the internal network exists and\n\n293\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.740\nthen we can also do access\ncontrol like that, so same thing.\n\n294\n00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.890\nJust like you asked before Zach,\n\n295\n00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.440\nwe can flip to the other\nside of the tracks, right?\n\n296\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.260\nMaybe I've got a couple of servers that I,\nyeah,\n\n297\n00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.450\nI want people to be able to get to but\nI got another one that I don't.\n\n298\n00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.720\nAnd there's other ways\nthat you do that too.\n\n299\n00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.820\nBut the reverse proxy can do that as well.\n\n300\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.877\nSo I want you to think of\nthe direction of the data flow.\n\n301\n00:15:53.877 --> 00:15:57.402\nAll right, a lot of times your reverse\nproxies are gonna be clients that\n\n302\n00:15:57.402 --> 00:16:00.987\nare out there on the Internet that\ncommunicate back in to our networks and\n\n303\n00:16:00.987 --> 00:16:05.044\nwe want to mask their presence versus\nThe forward proxy, which essentially takes\n\n304\n00:16:05.044 --> 00:16:08.333\na group of clients, a lot of times\ninternally on your network, and\n\n305\n00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:12.390\nyou're sending outbound requests to\na single service outside of your network.\n\n306\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.065\nThat's your forward proxy, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:16.065 --> 00:16:19.849\nKnow what the proxy's are doing.\n\n308\n00:16:19.849 --> 00:16:22.367\nKnow some of the benefits like\nwe've mentioned here, right?\n\n309\n00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:26.676\nAgain, reverse proxies usually serve\nas requests to external clients\n\n310\n00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:29.410\nversus the internal clients.\n\n311\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:34.010\nAnd it can provide services basically,\nservices this is getting a little\n\n312\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.061\nbit redundant, services to servers\nthat reside behind our network, right?\n\n313\n00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:40.530\nSo again,\nyou're basically putting [INAUDIBLE]\n\n314\n00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Servicing the servers.\n\n315\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.385\n&gt;&gt; Servicing the servers,\nthat's right, exactly.\n\n316\n00:16:43.385 --> 00:16:45.220\n[LAUGH] That's a lot of servicing.\n\n317\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.250\nOkay, so that's another one of these\ndevices that we have to be aware of and\n\n318\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.060\nwe have to know.\n\n319\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.590\nAnd again,\nthey're not gonna ask you to configure it.\n\n320\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.570\nPlease don't think that, right?\n\n321\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.730\nThey want you to explain the purposes,\nwhat are the benefits and\n\n322\n00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.200\nthat's what we wanna do here.\n\n323\n00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.210\nAll right, there's tons more\nyou can learn on this, and\n\n324\n00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.858\nwe never encourage somebody\nto just stop with the basics.\n\n325\n00:17:02.858 --> 00:17:05.730\nIf you wanna learn more,\nstudy more but those\n\n326\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.501\nare some of the basic things that these\ntwo types of proxies will do for you.\n\n327\n00:17:10.501 --> 00:17:15.547\nNow the next we have is what is known\nas a wireless controller, all right?\n\n328\n00:17:15.547 --> 00:17:20.512\nWell let's be careful with the term\nwireless controller cuz typically\n\n329\n00:17:20.512 --> 00:17:22.250\nthey're called WLCs and\n\n330\n00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:27.476\nwhat we mean by that is a wireless local\narea network controller all right?\n\n331\n00:17:27.476 --> 00:17:34.652\nWLAN controller, for short WLC,\nWLAN controller right?\n\n332\n00:17:34.652 --> 00:17:37.370\nNow what does that do?\n\n333\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:41.120\nWe have talked about in other episodes and\nthings like wireless infrastructure,\n\n334\n00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.290\nwe've talked about more\nthan one access point\n\n335\n00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.180\nservicing a network within\na larger network, right?\n\n336\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.415\nIf I have single access point, I have\nwhat's known as a basic service set.\n\n337\n00:17:51.415 --> 00:17:52.990\nWe've talked about that in other episodes,\n\n338\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:58.710\nthat one access point is managing all\nthe devices within the network, all right?\n\n339\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.460\nAll the stations, then I've also said\nthat you can make a larger network\n\n340\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.040\nby taking two basic service sets,\ntwo access points and\n\n341\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.839\nconfiguring them into\nan extended service set, an ESS.\n\n342\n00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:16.952\nAnd that means more than one access\npoint all servicing a larger network,\n\n343\n00:18:16.952 --> 00:18:18.831\nbut that's only two.\n\n344\n00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:22.805\nCould you imagine there were 50 of those,\n60 of those?\n\n345\n00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:27.018\nCan you imagine having to go to\nevery single access point and\n\n346\n00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:33.325\nupdating the firmware individually when\nit's time to upgrade the firmware?\n\n347\n00:18:33.325 --> 00:18:34.825\n50, 100 times, right?\n\n348\n00:18:34.825 --> 00:18:37.205\nCan you imagine?\n\n349\n00:18:37.205 --> 00:18:40.325\nWe've shown in other episodes how\nyou can get into the interface,\n\n350\n00:18:40.325 --> 00:18:41.545\na basic interface, right?\n\n351\n00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:42.877\nThey're not gonna ask you for\n\n352\n00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:45.545\nmore advanced wireless\nconfigurations on the Net+ exam.\n\n353\n00:18:45.545 --> 00:18:47.406\nBut they are gonna ask\nyou to understand that,\n\n354\n00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:48.980\nhey we gotta go to that web interface and\n\n355\n00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.198\nsome of those configurations that we've\nshown you that you have to be aware of.\n\n356\n00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:56.685\nThat's one access point, one.\n\n357\n00:18:56.685 --> 00:19:00.090\nCan you imagine five?\n\n358\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.760\nCan you imagine 10, 50, 100,\n100 access points you gotta configure?\n\n359\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.410\nNow if you're an hourly employee,\nyou're probably like,\n\n360\n00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.200\nman, don't steal my bread and butter.\n\n361\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.450\nDon't give me anything easier.\n\n362\n00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.490\nYou're gonna reduce my work week or you're\ngonna reduce the job security I have.\n\n363\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.450\nWell that's where the wireless local\narea network controller comes in.\n\n364\n00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.620\nThe WLC, again, wireless control,\nthat's why they abbreviate it.\n\n365\n00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.310\nIt's a lot easier to say\nthan what I'm trying to say.\n\n366\n00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.900\nAnd let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n367\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.630\nNow I'll explain some of these.\n\n368\n00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.080\nThere's a protocol that we\nuse in order to do this, and\n\n369\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.698\nthat's what the LWAPP is, right?\n\n370\n00:19:31.698 --> 00:19:39.536\nLWAPP as I call it, Lightweight\nAccess Point Protocol, all right?\n\n371\n00:19:39.536 --> 00:19:45.022\nBut the wireless LAN controller\nif you will, what does it do?\n\n372\n00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:49.824\nWell it controls and manages all of\nthe access points from the centralized\n\n373\n00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:54.090\nlocation, and that reduces\nthe administrative complexities.\n\n374\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.023\nNow it doesn't mean that\nit's not a complex device,\n\n375\n00:19:57.023 --> 00:20:00.230\nthat these are advanced devices\nby all means, all right?\n\n376\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.560\nBut the wireless controller,\n\n377\n00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.110\nsome of the benefits is we get\ncentralized configuration of all\n\n378\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.980\nthe access points that are connected\nto a larger network, all right?\n\n379\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.270\nAP 6, I need to do some configurations\non it, I just brought it online.\n\n380\n00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.390\nWell that's okay.\n\n381\n00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:21.364\nIf you are using something like LWAPP,\nagain, Lightweight Access Protocol,\n\n382\n00:20:21.364 --> 00:20:24.810\nor Lightweight Access Point Protocol.\n\n383\n00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.695\nAnd then there's other ones too like, and\nyou're gonna think I'm just making up\n\n384\n00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:32.197\nacronyms here and\nit almost sounds like it, Zach, CAPWAP.\n\n385\n00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:34.973\n&gt;&gt; I don't believe it.\n\n386\n00:20:34.973 --> 00:20:39.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] CAPWAP is the control and\nprovisioning of wireless access points.\n\n387\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.050\nIt's another protocol that, essentially,\nis based off of LWAPP, LWAPP, if you will.\n\n388\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.570\nAll right, so not only do we get\nthe configurations, remember when I said,\n\n389\n00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.880\nhey, we've gotta push out firmware\nto all of these different devices?\n\n390\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.360\nCan you imagine being able\nto configure them and\n\n391\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.410\nupgrade their firmware all\nfrom the wireless controller?\n\n392\n00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.590\nI just log in to the wireless controller\nand I could see the entire network.\n\n393\n00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.860\nI could see all of the access\npoints within the network.\n\n394\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.220\nAnd if I can't, I know there's a problem\nand that's our other benefit, monitoring.\n\n395\n00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.870\nI have a centralize location to monitor,\nright?\n\n396\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.470\nAnd it's not unlike some of the even\nthe smaller home devices you have.\n\n397\n00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.919\nYou have like, for instance,\n\n398\n00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:21.227\nubiquity based devices where they\nall daisy chain together, right?\n\n399\n00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:24.458\nYou can connect to a web interface and\ncan manage all of them, you can see them.\n\n400\n00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:27.515\nSo on a basic level, that's kind\nof what we're talking about here.\n\n401\n00:21:27.515 --> 00:21:30.700\nBut wireless LAN controllers,\n\n402\n00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.560\nwhat they allow you to do is scale\nup to a very, very large network\n\n403\n00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.120\nwhere you can service multitudes of\naccess points all from a single location.\n\n404\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:45.350\nSo not only do you get monitoring, the\nconfiguration, you get the being able to\n\n405\n00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:49.290\npush out things like firmware,\nyou also get troubleshooting.\n\n406\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.161\nI get a centralized\nlocation to troubleshoot.\n\n407\n00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:55.870\nLike I said, remote into it or connect\ninto the interface of the wireless LAN\n\n408\n00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:01.038\ncontroller, and you get the ability to\nsee, there's a problem with this device.\n\n409\n00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:04.500\nThere's a firmware\nupdate with this device.\n\n410\n00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.440\nThis device somebody brought online,\nbut it's not configured correctly for\n\n411\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.190\nwhatever reason.\n\n412\n00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.080\nYou have that visibility.\n\n413\n00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.000\nThe other neat thing that you get too\nwith the wireless LAN controllers is\n\n414\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.830\nthe fact that you get not only monitoring\nbut you get like network analyzation.\n\n415\n00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.500\nI can analyze the network at any point and\nsee what's going on.\n\n416\n00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.240\nDo I have enough bandwidth at\na certain location, right?\n\n417\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.230\nDo I have enough reach or location, right?\n\n418\n00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.600\nThe visibility of your network,\n\n419\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.712\nthat's what makes these really,\nreally good devices.\n\n420\n00:22:31.712 --> 00:22:36.490\nAll right next thing we got,\nwe got what's known as a VPN concentrator.\n\n421\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.390\nNow let's talk just briefly about the VPN,\n\n422\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:42.152\njust kind of recap the VPN,\nVirtual Private Network.\n\n423\n00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:47.930\nRemember that the VPN technology\nallows me to take my client\n\n424\n00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.960\nand a VPN based device,\nand what I can do is I can\n\n425\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.510\ncommunicate over a public\nnetwork in a private manner.\n\n426\n00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.664\nI could communicate over a public network\nin a way that we create a tunnel,\n\n427\n00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:05.310\nwe encapsulate the information,\nwe also encrypt it.\n\n428\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.606\nBut you have to understand that when\na device does encrypt tunneling,\n\n429\n00:23:10.606 --> 00:23:14.537\nan encryption sends that information\nover that public network so\n\n430\n00:23:14.537 --> 00:23:18.397\nthat it can't be eavesdropped on\nwhen it hits the other device,\n\n431\n00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:22.201\nthe endpoint, whether if\na client's a little bit different.\n\n432\n00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:25.433\nEither way,\nif you're doing site-to-site VPN,\n\n433\n00:23:25.433 --> 00:23:30.287\nyou've got two site to site routers,\nVPN gateway routers, well guess what?\n\n434\n00:23:30.287 --> 00:23:35.268\nFor every one of those communications that\ngoes through a tunnel is then encapsulated\n\n435\n00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:39.556\nand decapsulated, encrypted and\nunencrypted just for that one tunnel,\n\n436\n00:23:39.556 --> 00:23:42.200\nthere's a lot of that computational power.\n\n437\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.935\nRemember, any time you encrypt information\nat CPU and you're taking resources,\n\n438\n00:23:47.935 --> 00:23:52.392\nit takes CPU resources of the network\ndevice that is doing the encapsulation,\n\n439\n00:23:52.392 --> 00:23:55.044\ndecapsulation, encryption, decryption.\n\n440\n00:23:55.044 --> 00:23:59.031\nIt's one of the reasons we use such high\nencryption levels and other technologies,\n\n441\n00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:02.459\nsecurity technologies, because it\nincreases the computational power\n\n442\n00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:04.440\nthat it takes to break that information.\n\n443\n00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.829\nWell guess what?\nEven if nobody's trying to break that\n\n444\n00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:10.916\ninformation, we also have computational\npower that it takes to encapsulate,\n\n445\n00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:13.790\ndecapsulate, encrypt and decrypt.\n\n446\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.800\nSo let me show you what\nthe VPN Concentrator's all about.\n\n447\n00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.850\nSo I've gotta a diagram here.\n\n448\n00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:24.980\nVPN Concentrator basically allows you\nto have a device that can do multiple,\n\n449\n00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.620\naggregate, multiple simultaneous\nVPN connections and\n\n450\n00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.440\nstill get some kind of decent\nperformance out of it.\n\n451\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.080\nNow depending on the scalability\nof the device will dictate what\n\n452\n00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.650\nthe performance levels are.\n\n453\n00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:42.230\nI mean really today, I know there's plenty\nof the Cisco devices that still have\n\n454\n00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.200\nstandalone VPN Concentrators today.\n\n455\n00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.235\nBut a lot of times what you have today or\nwhat are known as MFDs,\n\n456\n00:24:47.235 --> 00:24:51.450\nmulti-functioning devices where\nyou have a firewall already.\n\n457\n00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.709\nI've got, I need a firewall, so\nI got firewall in my building.\n\n458\n00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:57.333\nAnd guess what the firewall also does,\nVPN Concentrator, so\n\n459\n00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:59.919\nit performs additional functionalities.\n\n460\n00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.170\nI'll give you an example,\nthe Cisco ASA firewall, right?\n\n461\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.790\nIt's a firewall,\nit does packet inspection,\n\n462\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.210\ndoes some other things that we're gonna\ntalk about too, intrusion detection, but\n\n463\n00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.730\nit also does VPN Concentrator.\n\n464\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:13.820\nI almost said concentration, but\nVPN Concentrator functionality, and\n\n465\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.000\nthe fact that it can handle\nmultiple simultaneous VPNs.\n\n466\n00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.620\nSo a lot of times, what you seeing\ntoday is again things like those\n\n467\n00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.737\nnext generation firewalls\nthat we talk about.\n\n468\n00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:25.876\nNext-generation firewall,\nwhich is in the list as well,\n\n469\n00:25:25.876 --> 00:25:30.145\nis nothing more than a firewall, that\nunderstands not only the network layer but\n\n470\n00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:33.067\nall the way up,\nmore importantly to the application.\n\n471\n00:25:33.067 --> 00:25:36.390\nYou might hear the term,\napplication layer firewall.\n\n472\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.430\nThey're smart.\n\n473\n00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.960\nThey can peel all the layers of the onion\nthat we say is the OSI model all\n\n474\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.280\nthe way back and look down in the data and\nsay, I know what the data is.\n\n475\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.240\nJust because you changed the port\nfrom 80 to 443 and you're trying to\n\n476\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.010\npawn it off to me as encrypted traffic,\nI can see those upper layers.\n\n477\n00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.490\nI know that's not encrypted traffic.\n\n478\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.960\nI know that's not HTTP or\nHTTPS like it's supposed to be.\n\n479\n00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.360\nI know it's HTTP.\n\n480\n00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.860\nWhy?\n\n481\n00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.530\nBecause it understands\napplication layer services.\n\n482\n00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.330\nAnd again, you'll hear the term,\nnext-generation firewall.\n\n483\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.160\nSay it over and over so\nyou know that it's NGFW.\n\n484\n00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.450\nThat's what it means, when you see NGFW,\nnext-generation firewall.\n\n485\n00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.380\nWe're talking about a layer 7 firewall,\n\n486\n00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.310\nan application layer firewall that not\nonly understands the network layer being\n\n487\n00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.250\nable to do packet inspection,\nsource and destination IP address.\n\n488\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.078\nAlso understands things like session layer\ninformation, transport layer information,\n\n489\n00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:40.337\nunderstanding TCP,\ncan see the state of the TCP connection,\n\n490\n00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:42.483\ncan stop things like SYN flood attacks.\n\n491\n00:26:42.483 --> 00:26:46.492\nBut it goes further than that, and goes\nall the way up to the application layer\n\n492\n00:26:46.492 --> 00:26:48.600\nknowing what protocols are being used.\n\n493\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.040\nAnd even potentially the context,\nif you will, of the data.\n\n494\n00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.620\nSo back to the VPN Concentrator, again\nkeep in mind that is a way that you can\n\n495\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:04.140\nhave multiples of these\nVPN communications,\n\n496\n00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.300\nin a single device,\nwith the intent of not losing performance.\n\n497\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.240\nAgain, because as you start to add more\nand more of these VPNs on each other,\n\n498\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.960\nthat's a lot of computational power that\na network device has to be performing.\n\n499\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.890\nSo, if you can get a device that has\na dedicated functionality and can bond, or\n\n500\n00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.360\nnot bond, it's not like bonding, but\n\n501\n00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.900\ncan perform multiple\ntunnels together like that.\n\n502\n00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.501\nThen you're gonna get a much better\nperformance out of your VPN communications\n\n503\n00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:33.768\nrather than watching your\nthroughput just tank.\n\n504\n00:27:33.768 --> 00:27:39.317\nBecause you do have a throughput that\nkind of degrades performance wise\n\n505\n00:27:39.317 --> 00:27:45.538\nbecause of the encryption, decryption,\nencapsulation and decapsulation.\n\n506\n00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:49.262\nAll right, and\nthat takes us to another concept, but\n\n507\n00:27:49.262 --> 00:27:52.317\nI'm looking at that clock Zach,\nlooks like I talked a lot on this one.\n\n508\n00:27:52.317 --> 00:27:53.825\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So it does look like we're gonna have\n\n509\n00:27:53.825 --> 00:27:55.616\nto come in back to a part two.\n\n510\n00:27:55.616 --> 00:27:58.566\n&gt;&gt; Wow, Advanced Networking Devices,\nPart-2 coming your way.\n\n511\n00:27:58.566 --> 00:27:59.486\nThis has been Part-1.\n\n512\n00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:03.686\nMake sure you watch both of them, and\nwatch everything in the CompTIA series.\n\n513\n00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:05.166\nWes does a wonderful job.\n\n514\n00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:08.506\nAnd while you're in the course library\nthere's hundreds of other videos.\n\n515\n00:28:08.506 --> 00:28:10.746\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n516\n00:28:10.746 --> 00:28:11.366\nCheck those out too.\n\n517\n00:28:11.366 --> 00:28:13.109\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about ITPro TV.\n\n518\n00:28:13.109 --> 00:28:13.951\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n519\n00:28:13.951 --> 00:28:15.116\nThanks for watching.\n\n520\n00:28:15.116 --> 00:28:15.886\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n521\n00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:16.706\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n522\n00:28:16.706 --> 00:28:17.446\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n523\n00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:25.068\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n524\n00:28:25.068 --> 00:28:30.909\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:08.347\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:11.615\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:16.035\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank for choosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.175\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net Plus,\n\n7\n00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:22.751\nAdvanced Networking Devices part two.\n\n8\n00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.285\nThat means there was a part one,\nmake sure you see that one too.\n\n9\n00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:28.085\nBringing us all the information we\nneed is the one and only, Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:29.015\nWes, good to see you.\n\n11\n00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:31.575\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back,\nas always, great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:35.012\nThat's right, part two, which means\nWes talked way too much in part one.\n\n13\n00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:35.830\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.410\nSo we're coming back with a,\nwell, the sequel here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.050\nIn the first part, we talked about\na couple of the advance devices, right?\n\n16\n00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.044\nWe talked about multi-layer switches,\nproxy servers, right,\n\n17\n00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.640\ndifference between forward and\nreverse proxy.\n\n18\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.380\nTalked about that wireless local area\nnetwork, or wireless LAN controller,\n\n19\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.660\nWLC, likewise with the VPN concentrator.\n\n20\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.420\nNow the next one that\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n21\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.500\njust kinda dive right into is gonna be\nwhat's known as load balancer, all right?\n\n22\n00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.424\nNow a load balancer really has to do\nwith high availability, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:14.448\nHigh availability, it could be done for\nperformance, could be done for,\n\n24\n00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:19.093\nwell, I'd say availability,\nfault tolerance, and redundancy.\n\n25\n00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:22.550\nTo ensure that one device\ndoesn't get overwhelmed, right?\n\n26\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.730\nSo let's face it, if you have a series,\na couple of servers,\n\n27\n00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.733\nright, and or maybe bank of servers right,\nyou got a web farm, right?\n\n28\n00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:36.720\nYou wanna make sure that one server,\nwithin that whole entire group\n\n29\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560\nof other servers isn't completely\ngetting overwhelmed, right?\n\n30\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.250\nSo if you only have a couple servers or\none server, right?\n\n31\n00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.100\nThat one server goes offline,\nwhat happens to your website?\n\n32\n00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.070\nIt goes down, right?\n\n33\n00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.066\nLoad balancing is a great way to ensure\nthat you get that high availability and\n\n34\n00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.323\nredundancy by making sure that whatever\nservice is being provided by the device.\n\n35\n00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:01.766\nIt sits behind the load balancer,\nall right,\n\n36\n00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:06.730\nvan have that service evenly spread\nout across multiple devices.\n\n37\n00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.790\nLet me give you an example\nwhat I mean here.\n\n38\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.714\nSo I got kind of a just generic diagram\nhere of your load balancers, right,\n\n39\n00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:16.227\nand we've got a couple here, right?\n\n40\n00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:18.524\nWe got LB 1, low balancer one and\nlow balancer two and\n\n41\n00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.480\nwe have here is kinda\nlike a server farm here.\n\n42\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.930\nWe got a cluster of servers behind it,\nright?\n\n43\n00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.130\nAnd these servers might be\nserving up web pages, all right.\n\n44\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.409\nNow one of the things that we want\nto ensure is that we get even\n\n45\n00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.590\ndistribution of the workload, all right.\n\n46\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.147\nAgain we could be doing this for\nthe benefit of performance or\n\n47\n00:02:37.147 --> 00:02:41.100\nwe could be doing this for\nthe benefit of fault tolerance.\n\n48\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.670\nIf we're doing this for the performance\nthan what we're making sure is that let's\n\n49\n00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.570\nsay these two servers don't get\nall of the web requests right?\n\n50\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.010\nBecause not only from the vantage\npoint of the end user but\n\n51\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.630\nalso from the vantage\npoint of the servers,\n\n52\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.800\nwe can get performance degrading, right?\n\n53\n00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.180\nSo how many of you out there and I'm gonna\nbe the first one to raise my hand, so\n\n54\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.570\nyou guys don't have to feel\nguilty about it, if this is you.\n\n55\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.240\nHow many of you today, when you go to buy\nsomething maybe out there on the Internet,\n\n56\n00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.200\nif it takes a little bit too long you're\nmoving onto the next product, right?\n\n57\n00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.252\nI've done that before,right, the faster\ncomputers get, the more impatient I get.\n\n58\n00:03:23.252 --> 00:03:26.780\nAll right, I don't want it now,\nI wanted it yesterday, all right.\n\n59\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.286\nAnd there are times when that every little\nbit of that performance of a web page\n\n60\n00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:32.964\ncoming back and rendering.\n\n61\n00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:38.744\nAnd opening up that page and seeing\nthe results of whatever that search are,\n\n62\n00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:43.270\nit takes a little bit too,\nand I'm gone, right?\n\n63\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.480\nIn our fast paced society we're gone,\n\n64\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.820\nwe're gonna go completely\nto a different customer.\n\n65\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.100\nWe that's not really too good for\nbusiness, right?\n\n66\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.886\nSo from a performance standpoint,\nany user experience.\n\n67\n00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:58.687\nWhen I have somebody hit my website I\nwant them to be able to get to it pretty\n\n68\n00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:00.120\ndarn quick, right?\n\n69\n00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.980\nI want that website to open up and\nwhen they do a search result for\n\n70\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.830\nwhatever it is that they're buying, a game\nor something or a gaming console, right.\n\n71\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.820\nI want it to open up right away, right,\nI want the performance to be good, right.\n\n72\n00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.430\nSo if we look back at my diagram here,\n\n73\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.860\nI want to make sure that maybe this server\nhere is getting a little overwhelmed.\n\n74\n00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.840\nWell, if we've got a load balancer, we can\npush some of the workload off onto this\n\n75\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.390\nserver, and then maybe push some of\nthe workload off onto this server.\n\n76\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.230\nOr maybe we've got it literally\nwhere it goes sequentially, and\n\n77\n00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.250\nit doesn't have to, right,\nyou can set it up the way you want.\n\n78\n00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.290\nBut the great thing is that not\nonly does it make it better for\n\n79\n00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.120\nthe end user, but\nit's also transparent to the end user.\n\n80\n00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.510\nI don't want to have to\nmaintain two websites,\n\n81\n00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.760\nthat's not the way things are going\nto work, right, that's horrible.\n\n82\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.720\nSo it's transparent to the end user and\nyou get that performance gain if you will.\n\n83\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.240\nBut then you can also be doing it for\nfault tolerance, all right.\n\n84\n00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.650\nIf I have a load balancer, and\nlet's say this one server gone offline, or\n\n85\n00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.780\nmaybe we happen to lose another server,\nokay, offline, all right.\n\n86\n00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.670\nWell, if I didn't have\nthe load balancing going on,\n\n87\n00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.548\nright I could have potentially\njust lost my site right?\n\n88\n00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:18.350\nBecause if everybody was hitting that one\nweb server those two web servers right\n\n89\n00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.090\nthere and they just went offline,\nguess what?\n\n90\n00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.870\nNo food for you, no purchase,\nno gaming console.\n\n91\n00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.550\nSo what we do,\n\n92\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.320\nwe get the benefit is that we can put\nthings like our network adapters.\n\n93\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.620\nLet me go ahead and kindamove these over\nand you can see what's going on here.\n\n94\n00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.650\nWe can put these in a performance mode,\n\n95\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.352\nwhere we have what's known\nas Active-Active, all right.\n\n96\n00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:47.480\nSo Active-Active says that every\nrequest that comes in, I want it,\n\n97\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.345\nit's gonna hit each one\nof the load balancers.\n\n98\n00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:53.700\nThen they're gonna work together, and\nthey're gonna spread the information out\n\n99\n00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.530\nlike a multi-tasker across\nthe whole entire web server farm.\n\n100\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.470\nThat's for performance.\n\n101\n00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.260\nNow we could change this around right.\n\n102\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.070\nWe could go from Active-Passive,and\nthis will be for\n\n103\n00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.320\nthings like fault tolerance and\nredundancy.\n\n104\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.050\nWell we already have the redundancy\nbecause we have two, right?\n\n105\n00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.199\nJust because you have two of something\ndoesn't mean that you're fault\n\n106\n00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.260\ntolerant, right?\n\n107\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.320\nBecause if I have two of something,\nand one's completely turned off,\n\n108\n00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.060\nyeah I've got redundancy,\nI've got two but it's not fault tolerant.\n\n109\n00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.690\n&gt;&gt; So Wes, depending upon the application,\n\n110\n00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.730\nyou can have multiples of load balancers,\nright?\n\n111\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Yes you can, absolutely,\n\n112\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.190\nit depends on how much of the workload\nyou need to distribute right?\n\n113\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.410\nAnd a lot of times it's relevant to how\nbig is the pipeline coming in, right?\n\n114\n00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.732\nIf the pipeline coming in has the\npotential to be bigger than the pipeline\n\n115\n00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:41.510\nthat it's going to,\nyou might have to spread it out, right.\n\n116\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:47.320\nSo Active-Passive what this says is we'll\njust let this load balancer do the work.\n\n117\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.170\nIt's gonna and\nyou see that we got connection,\n\n118\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.174\nit's got a connection to every\nserver within the web server farm.\n\n119\n00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:59.385\nAnd it'll just spread the information\nout to each server where it needs to go.\n\n120\n00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.660\nBut if this web,\n\n121\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.690\nthis basically what happens if this\nload balancer goes offline, guess what?\n\n122\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.740\nThis goes from a passive state,\nto an active state, right?\n\n123\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.660\nNow we've got fault tolerance.\n\n124\n00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.810\nLike I said,\nredundancy means more than one,\n\n125\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.920\nthat doesn't mean that you're\nfault tolerant, right?\n\n126\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.210\nIf I have two of something and one's\nturned off, yeah I've got redundancy, but\n\n127\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.080\nI certainly don't have fault tolerance.\n\n128\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.300\nSo, understand that while they\ndo kinda work hand in hand,\n\n129\n00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.650\ntechnically they're not\nthe same exact concept.\n\n130\n00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.067\nRedundancy allows for\nfault tolerance,all right.\n\n131\n00:07:33.067 --> 00:07:37.510\nAnd then what happens is,\nwhen I bring, if you will, that load\n\n132\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:43.320\nbalancer back online this might go from\nan active state back to a passive state.\n\n133\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.170\nAll right, and we'll shut it back down.\n\n134\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.608\nOr maybe this does stay active, right and\n\n135\n00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:54.024\nit changes this one to passive,\nright, so we flip flopped them.\n\n136\n00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:57.631\nSo one's back online, it's ready to go,\nbut the one that took over,\n\n137\n00:07:57.631 --> 00:07:59.173\nwe don't wanna mess with it.\n\n138\n00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:02.880\nWe don't want to change things up and\nstuff, so we'll just let it keep running.\n\n139\n00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.523\nAll right, and that's the great\nthing about load balancers,\n\n140\n00:08:06.523 --> 00:08:09.210\nbeing able to control\nthe flow of the data too.\n\n141\n00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:15.113\nRight, because one of the great things\nis if you're hitting a load balancer,\n\n142\n00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:18.790\nright, you're still\nproviding the services.\n\n143\n00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.030\nBut what's behind the load\nbalancer is transparent.\n\n144\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.500\nYou can't see, you don't even know\nit's there, that it's masked,\n\n145\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.220\nI guess you could say.\n\n146\n00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.210\nSo there are a lot of benefits,\nlike I said, redundancy, fault tolerance,\n\n147\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.790\nperformance.\n\n148\n00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.090\nBeing able to and\nwhen you talk about a load balance or\n\n149\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.370\nit performs load balancing in the very\nbasics, taken any jargon out of it.\n\n150\n00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.890\nI have a service that we're providing and\n\n151\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:46.060\nwhat we need to do is evenly distribute\nthat service across multiple devices.\n\n152\n00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.555\nWe load balance, right,\ngreat technology, great thing to have.\n\n153\n00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:50.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n154\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Now the next thing that we have is\nwhat is known as a RADIUS or AAA server.\n\n155\n00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.150\nAll right, now when we talk about RADIUS,\nlet's mention the term RADIUS.\n\n156\n00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.250\nAlright well, actually, I'm gonna go\nahead and talk about AAA first, right?\n\n157\n00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:08.054\nWe talk about authorization,\nauthentication and auditing, right?\n\n158\n00:09:08.054 --> 00:09:12.960\nSo basically, I did it a little backwards\nhere, right, let's try that again.\n\n159\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.510\nAuthentication, authorization and\naccounting, right?\n\n160\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.780\nThe ability to prove who you say you are,\nright?\n\n161\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.725\nSo for instance this morning, right, we\nhad a little authentication challenge that\n\n162\n00:09:24.725 --> 00:09:27.211\nwas going on to Zach, and\nhe didn't even realize it.\n\n163\n00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.490\nWell, he knows it, but\nmaybe not in this context.\n\n164\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.060\nHe was challenged this morning.\n\n165\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.830\nI'm Zach, I'm a host here at ITProTV,\nand I should be here.\n\n166\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.816\nOur front door said prove it.\n\n167\n00:09:38.816 --> 00:09:39.872\nSo what did he do?\n\n168\n00:09:39.872 --> 00:09:41.800\nRight, what did you do\nto get in that door?\n\n169\n00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.365\n&gt;&gt; I had a smoke bomb, and I no, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:09:44.365 --> 00:09:46.570\n&gt;&gt; I used my magnetic card.\n\n171\n00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.203\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell them about the explosives.\n\n172\n00:09:48.203 --> 00:09:50.238\nThat's right,\nyou've got your key card, right.\n\n173\n00:09:50.238 --> 00:09:51.741\n&gt;&gt; Key card.\n&gt;&gt; So essentially what's happening is\n\n174\n00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:52.910\nthe door is challenging it.\n\n175\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.362\nAnd saying, and it's funny,\nI didn't say challenging something, right?\n\n176\n00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:58.292\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might have said it that way, but\n\n177\n00:09:58.292 --> 00:09:59.580\nit challenged him, right?\n\n178\n00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.530\nBecause it's a locked door.\n\n179\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.590\nHe supposed to be here, all right?\n\n180\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.840\nThat locked door says prove it,\nwell security system that we have.\n\n181\n00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.580\nHe says, here's my authentication.\n\n182\n00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.373\n[SOUND] He touches it to the door,\nhe's allowed in here.\n\n183\n00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:18.385\nNow let's talk about, we saw\nauthentication, how about authorization,\n\n184\n00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:19.920\nall right?\n\n185\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.860\nNow with us as the host and\nthe subject matter experts, it's maybe not\n\n186\n00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.440\na good example because we have access\nto a pretty wide range if things.\n\n187\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.780\nI'll give you an example here.\n\n188\n00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.570\nIt will be a good example, I promise.\n\n189\n00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.230\nBy the time, I get\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n190\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.607\n&gt;&gt; Done with it, all right.\n\n191\n00:10:34.607 --> 00:10:36.310\nWe've got multiple businesses here.\n\n192\n00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.950\nNot just ITProTV-\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n193\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.575\n&gt;&gt; And that's where I thought,\nthis might be a-\n\n194\n00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:40.340\n&gt;&gt; It's true.\n\n195\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.520\n&gt;&gt; Good example, right?\n\n196\n00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.240\nSo we've got more than one\nbusiness that actually is under\n\n197\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.110\nthe umbrella building that we\nhave here at ITProTV, right?\n\n198\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.583\nWe've got a great media place that's back\nthere, got a development academy, just\n\n199\n00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:55.128\nabsolutely amazing other businesses here-\n&gt;&gt; Even we're at.\n\n200\n00:10:55.128 --> 00:10:58.961\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Zach what he did,\nand me as well, thanks for\n\n201\n00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:01.401\nletting me pick on you Zach, [LAUGH].\n\n202\n00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:05.652\nHe touched the door there\nleading him to the ITProTV side,\n\n203\n00:11:05.652 --> 00:11:08.740\nyour authenticator, all right?\n\n204\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.625\nNow that system said, I know it's Zach.\n\n205\n00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:15.593\nBut that system also says,\nlet me see what he is authorized to do.\n\n206\n00:11:15.593 --> 00:11:18.680\nWell guess what,\nit's all the same system around here and\n\n207\n00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.162\nif he touches it to the door that controls\none of the media solutions companies here.\n\n208\n00:11:23.162 --> 00:11:26.205\nIt says no, no, no, no, no,\n\n209\n00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:31.380\nyou're not authorized, so\nwe prove our identity.\n\n210\n00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.710\nThen we kinda determine\nwhat can that identity do?\n\n211\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.940\n&gt;&gt; Access, right?\n\n212\n00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.455\n&gt;&gt; Or not, that's the authorization.\n\n213\n00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:40.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n214\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.420\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nyou're allowed in this building, but\n\n215\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.400\nyou're not allowed in that\nroom in the building.\n\n216\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.120\nSo I can prove you are who you, well,\nI guess somebody could steal it.\n\n217\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.070\nBut for the most part, with that card,\nyou said, yup, I'm Zach.\n\n218\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.560\nWhen I was challenged, I could prove it.\n\n219\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.660\nI could perform that authentication.\n\n220\n00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.141\nBut then when the system looks\nat now what can you do now?\n\n221\n00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:03.510\nI know who you are, now what can you do,\nthat's the authorization side.\n\n222\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.027\nAnd then guess what, Zach goes over and\n\n223\n00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:11.218\nstarts to touch the other security access\npoints on the other businesses over and\n\n224\n00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:13.990\nover and\nover trying to get in there right?\n\n225\n00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.150\nWell that's where the third A comes in,\nand that's accounting.\n\n226\n00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.600\nThink of it as auditing, right?\n\n227\n00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.100\nThe system keeps track of the entries that\npeople were trying to make and performing.\n\n228\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.600\nSo we can track who was authenticated,\nwhat they were authorized to do, and\n\n229\n00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.495\nthen what they actually did.\n\n230\n00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n231\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.117\n&gt;&gt; So who are you, right.\n\n232\n00:12:36.117 --> 00:12:36.776\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:41.585\n&gt;&gt; Authentication,\nauthorization, what can you do?\n\n234\n00:12:41.585 --> 00:12:44.540\nLast one, auditing, counting.\n\n235\n00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.560\nWhat did you do, right?\n\n236\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.080\nThose are the three A's.\n\n237\n00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.830\nRADIUS bundles that concept into itself.\n\n238\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.630\nIt's called the remote\naccess dial-in user service.\n\n239\n00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.265\nSo when we have people that are externally\nin our building or I'm sorry,\n\n240\n00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:03.587\nexternal to our network.\n\n241\n00:13:03.587 --> 00:13:07.236\nAnd they need to make a remote access\nconnection, we could put a RADIUS server,\n\n242\n00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:09.570\nin fact let me go ahead and show you.\n\n243\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.190\nI have a remote access client, right?\n\n244\n00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.196\nAnd then we have these remote\naccess servers out here, and\n\n245\n00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:20.219\nthey allow you to connect to\nthem just like the front door.\n\n246\n00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:23.546\nBut then they turn around and\nthey send through a RADIUS message,\n\n247\n00:13:23.546 --> 00:13:25.070\nthey send that information.\n\n248\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.854\nYou said you were Zach, well let me take\nthat information that you're telling me,\n\n249\n00:13:28.854 --> 00:13:30.874\nand let me pass it off\nto this RADIUS server.\n\n250\n00:13:30.874 --> 00:13:34.307\nThe RADIUS server's gonna say, all right\nin this case it might be a user name and\n\n251\n00:13:34.307 --> 00:13:34.830\npassword.\n\n252\n00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.887\nCould be a smart card authentication,\nbut let's say user name and password,\n\n253\n00:13:38.887 --> 00:13:39.520\nall right?\n\n254\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.905\nI challenged you, and you said, I'm Zach.\n\n255\n00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:45.510\nHow do I know, prove it,\nyou put in your user name and password.\n\n256\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.800\nI'll take that and\nI'll send it to the RADIUS server.\n\n257\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.130\nThe RADIUS server will say,\nI recognize the user name Zach.\n\n258\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:55.630\nI recognize the password,\nchallenge accepted.\n\n259\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.270\nLet's go ahead and figure out\nwhat you're authorized to do and\n\n260\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.870\nwe'll apply those privileges to you.\n\n261\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.499\nThen later on in that\nevening I need to figure out,\n\n262\n00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:05.800\nwell I know Zach made\na remote access connection.\n\n263\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.460\nLet me see what he did.\n\n264\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.760\nAgain, who was he?\n\n265\n00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.020\nWhat was he authorized to do and\nwhat did he do, right?\n\n266\n00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.730\nThat's the remote access dial-in\nuser service, right, and\n\n267\n00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.301\nit's one of the ways that we\ncan do central authentication.\n\n268\n00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:26.525\nAnd again, central authentication,\nauthorization, and\n\n269\n00:14:26.525 --> 00:14:30.408\naccounting, and we use it for\nremote access clients.\n\n270\n00:14:30.408 --> 00:14:37.060\nAll right, now the next thing that we have\nto talk about are a bunch of acronyms.\n\n271\n00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.082\nAll right, cuz we don't ever talk about\nacronyms like RADIUS and VPN and all that.\n\n272\n00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:43.682\n[LAUGH] We've got some more\nthat we gotta talk about.\n\n273\n00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:46.709\nAnd that's something known as an IDS and\nan IPS, all right, so\n\n274\n00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:50.210\nlet's kind of help you out\nwith those terms, all right.\n\n275\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:56.260\nNot actually RADIUS here, but\nIDS is intrusion, detection, system, okay?\n\n276\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.810\nIPS, intrusion prevention system,\n[LAUGH] all right?\n\n277\n00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.050\nNow what are we talking about?\n\n278\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.030\n&gt;&gt; Are they related?\n\n279\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.910\n&gt;&gt; Are they related?\n\n280\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.300\nWell, sometimes they are, all right?\n\n281\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.900\nYeah, sometimes they are,\nsometimes they're not, all right.\n\n282\n00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.100\nAnd let me tell you what I mean here.\n\n283\n00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.846\nWhen we talk about intrusion detection,\nwe're talking about a system that,\n\n284\n00:15:17.846 --> 00:15:20.356\nwhat it does is, it monitors or\nscans, if you will.\n\n285\n00:15:20.356 --> 00:15:25.380\nFor signs of an intrusion\ninto your network, all right.\n\n286\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.810\nIf it detects an intrusion,\nit sends an alert.\n\n287\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.780\nZach's the admin on this network.\n\n288\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.160\nAll right, he's got an email forwarder\nset up on the IDS based machine.\n\n289\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.520\nAnd it's constantly 24/7\nmonitoring the network for\n\n290\n00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.310\nsigns that somebody's trying to\nattack from an external location.\n\n291\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.069\nWe get a beacon, right, and\nnot necessarily technical term beacon,\n\n292\n00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:51.650\nI'm just thinking of like a radar, right?\n\n293\n00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.476\nBoom, we've got an intrusion.\n\n294\n00:15:53.476 --> 00:15:58.332\nSo it's monitored, scanning,\nit's detected, right, detection,\n\n295\n00:15:58.332 --> 00:15:59.930\nand now what does it do?\n\n296\n00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.615\nIt fires off an email to the email\nserver that then alerts Zach and\n\n297\n00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:08.391\nsays, You not well, I guess it would say\nfirst it would say you've got mail because\n\n298\n00:16:08.391 --> 00:16:10.531\nwe know Zach still uses AOL, right.\n\n299\n00:16:10.531 --> 00:16:15.619\n[LAUGH] But then it would say hey\nthere's an intrusion on you network.\n\n300\n00:16:15.619 --> 00:16:16.970\nWe detected that.\n\n301\n00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.020\nNow Zach is aware of it and\nnow he can however he's got it set up\n\n302\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:27.510\nhe can either determine that\nattack needs to be countered or\n\n303\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.350\nwhatever the next steps might be,\nthat's a intrusion detection system.\n\n304\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.710\nBut it's a passive system sitting\non your network, all right.\n\n305\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.740\nNow there's intrusion prevention.\n\n306\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.600\nYou know what the big difference is?\n\n307\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.970\nCountermeasures, it does\neverything the IDS does,\n\n308\n00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.740\neverything, scans or monitors detection.\n\n309\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.850\nIf it didn't detect anything,\nthen it's not worth it's weight.\n\n310\n00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.490\nIt's a paper weight, so detection.\n\n311\n00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.380\nSame thing, fires off an email to Zach,\n\n312\n00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.510\nsays hey, you've got something\ngoing on on your network.\n\n313\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.280\nBut now what it does is says, doesn't\nreally say this, we'll say theoretically,\n\n314\n00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.330\nright, figuratively, it says.\n\n315\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.940\nWhile you're waiting to respond, I'm gonna\n\n316\n00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:13.310\nimplement a countermeasure that's gonna\nstop this intrusion within its tracks.\n\n317\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.900\nThat's intrusion prevention system.\n\n318\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.670\nNow let's be careful because of\nthe placement of these devices within your\n\n319\n00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.190\nnetworks, right?\n\n320\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.970\nI will tell you that, again, when we\ntalk about multi-functioning devices, we\n\n321\n00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.270\ntalk about things like the next-generation\nfirewall, which I keep harping through.\n\n322\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.920\nIt's on the list that we're going through,\nguys and gals out there,\n\n323\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.105\nbut you will see that the next-generation\nfirewall is not only being\n\n324\n00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:38.735\napplication firewalls,\nthey're VPN concentrators,\n\n325\n00:17:38.735 --> 00:17:43.535\nthey do IDS implementations and IPS\nimplementations all in the same device,\n\n326\n00:17:43.535 --> 00:17:47.085\nincluding doing the firewalls,\ntraditional firewall mechanisms.\n\n327\n00:17:47.085 --> 00:17:50.475\nLike they're multi-functioning devices,\nright?\n\n328\n00:17:50.475 --> 00:17:52.935\nThe IPS, it's inline to your network, and\n\n329\n00:17:52.935 --> 00:17:56.930\nlet me tell you what I mean by showing\nyou a little bit more of a diagram.\n\n330\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.005\nSo we have the IDS, all right.\n\n331\n00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:01.660\nNow notice what the flow\nof the traffic right?\n\n332\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.720\nTraffic comes into the Internet or\ncuz it's intrusion prevention, right?\n\n333\n00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.250\nSo it's inbound into your network right?\n\n334\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:13.770\nThe IDS is another device just like your\ncomputer's passive on your network right?\n\n335\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.650\nWe could do intrusion detection\njust by port mirroring a switch.\n\n336\n00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.603\nRight, we could take or take all\nthe data and mirror it over a one port,\n\n337\n00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:25.355\nplug a monitoring system into it and\nit's basically all of those,\n\n338\n00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:29.174\nthat data is being replicated to\na single port and it can sit there and\n\n339\n00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:32.405\nrun through it and\nsee if there's signs of an intrusion.\n\n340\n00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:33.231\nRight, so it's passive.\n\n341\n00:18:33.231 --> 00:18:37.218\nIt's another device within my network.\n\n342\n00:18:37.218 --> 00:18:41.376\nHowever, the IPS is going to be a device\nthat's screening every bit of traffic\n\n343\n00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:44.030\ncoming into my network\nfrom the outbound source.\n\n344\n00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:48.874\nSo notice that the IDS can be a passive\ndevice within your network versus\n\n345\n00:18:48.874 --> 00:18:51.063\nthe IPS and its functionality.\n\n346\n00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:55.008\nBecause again this is not only maybe\na dedicated device that's doing it.\n\n347\n00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:58.220\nIt's a multi-functioning device that's\nperforming the functionality but it sits\n\n348\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:05.130\ninline in your network trying to block any\nintrusions that come into your network.\n\n349\n00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:10.380\nHowever, both of them monitor,\ndetect and alert both sides.\n\n350\n00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.905\nIt's the IPS, which is the more modern one\nthat actually implements countermeasures,\n\n351\n00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:16.480\nright.\n\n352\n00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.730\nSo just know that for the exam, all right?\n\n353\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.680\nNow the next thing that we have is what is\nknown, we've got a couple of things that\n\n354\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.010\nthey talk about when they talk\nabout voice over IP, all right?\n\n355\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.100\nAnd we've talked about,\nin other episodes, we've talked about\n\n356\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.200\nthings like voice over IP, or\nVOIP if you will, end points, right?\n\n357\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.970\nAnd of VOIP end points, like a VOIP phone.\n\n358\n00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.540\nNow I want you to be careful because,\n\n359\n00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.250\nyou might hear terms out there\nlike SIP phone, all right?\n\n360\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.460\nAnd you might say well,\nis session initiation protocol and\n\n361\n00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.025\nvoice IP the same thing?\n\n362\n00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:52.260\nTechnically no and here's why.\n\n363\n00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.790\nSuch an initiation protocol, see voice\nover IP is more of an umbrella term for\n\n364\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.840\nthe fact that we can do convergence data.\n\n365\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.710\nWe can send not only data across that\nnetwork but we can also convert our\n\n366\n00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:08.605\nvoice signals into IP traffic that\ncan be sent over IP based networks.\n\n367\n00:20:08.605 --> 00:20:11.589\nSIP is a protocol that\nallows us to achieve VOIP.\n\n368\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:20.620\nH323 is another protocol that\nallows us to perform VOIP, right?\n\n369\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.820\nSo understand, right?\n\n370\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.770\nThere might be a little confusion there.\n\n371\n00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.340\nAnd what they talk about\nare voice over IP phones, or\n\n372\n00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.830\nno, I'm sorry, voice over IP PBX.\n\n373\n00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.555\nBoy, this is getting harder to say.\n\n374\n00:20:32.555 --> 00:20:37.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Voice over IP PBX, VOIP PBX,\n\n375\n00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:41.640\nright, sometimes they just call it IP,\nPBX, right, and\n\n376\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.750\nthen a voice over IP gateway, and\nthe reason both of them are there,\n\n377\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.740\nis because they typically work together,\nall right.\n\n378\n00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.460\nNow I got a crazy diagram up here, and\n\n379\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.697\nlet's see if you can follow my spaghetti,\nall right.\n\n380\n00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:58.208\nSo voice over IP, right,\nwe talk about voice over IP phones.\n\n381\n00:20:58.208 --> 00:21:01.407\nAnd I've got a couple\ndifferent types of phones.\n\n382\n00:21:01.407 --> 00:21:06.156\nWe got the SIP phones out there,\nwe've got the H323 phones, right.\n\n383\n00:21:06.156 --> 00:21:09.030\nThey're are all VPN types\nof VPN end points, right.\n\n384\n00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.725\nThe VPN PBX, what is a PBX?\n\n385\n00:21:10.725 --> 00:21:16.290\nIt's private branch exchange and you have\ntraditional private branch exchange.\n\n386\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:22.160\nTraditional PBXs actually handle the PSTN\nlines, right, the old telephone systems.\n\n387\n00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.630\nAnd I want you to think about it, Zach,\n\n388\n00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.750\ncuz I know you worked at a couple\nof companies that are fairly large.\n\n389\n00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:33.220\nI know that you worked at one company that\nwas more into TV and television, right.\n\n390\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.845\nYou guys probably had a lot of internal\nlines, internal phones, right?\n\n391\n00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n392\n00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.440\nlet's say that they weren't voice over IP\nphones, how is it that you have one number\n\n393\n00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.630\ncalling into your place with an extension,\nbut yet, it can make\n\n394\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.930\nit's way to whichever extension it is,\namongst hundreds of phones?\n\n395\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.980\nThat's the private branch exchange,\nall right?\n\n396\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.740\nAs of communication comes in,\nsomebody calls your network, and\n\n397\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.800\nwe're talking the old phone, telephone,\n\n398\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.360\nPSTN lines, it hits the private branch\nexchange and the private branch exchange\n\n399\n00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.690\nmaps that communication to the extension\nand sends it to the right phone,\n\n400\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:11.000\neven though you're just dialing a single\nnumber or maybe a couple of numbers.\n\n401\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.040\nThat's how we have one number\ndirecting you to a company and\n\n402\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:16.800\nthen extensions, right.\n\n403\n00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.710\nThe extension is the exchange system\nkind of like the switchboard operator.\n\n404\n00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.960\nSaying I see an incoming call,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n405\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.850\nconnect you to this phone in I don't\nknow Building A, floor one, whatever,\n\n406\n00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.250\nwhatever the extension might be, right.\n\n407\n00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:35.140\nWell, voice over IP PBXs\ndo the same thing.\n\n408\n00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:41.930\nThey can essentially internally switch\nif you will, or exchange right,\n\n409\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:47.190\nand allow the voice over IP\ncommunications to go to different VPN,\n\n410\n00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:53.020\nor not VPN, VOIP end points even if\nyou're only dialing a single number.\n\n411\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:57.996\nBut what's even cooler about\nthe voice over IP not gateways, but\n\n412\n00:22:57.996 --> 00:23:01.150\nPBX, private branch exchange,\nlet me show you here.\n\n413\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.760\nNot only can't do it voice over IP a lot\nof them the modern ones today actually\n\n414\n00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.970\nbundle in the technologies to\nhandle traditional phone lines.\n\n415\n00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.010\nSo we get one system that essentially\ncan handle the communications and\n\n416\n00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.650\nswitch the communications not\nonly with voice over IP but\n\n417\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.230\nalso the traditional telephone\nlines as well, all right.\n\n418\n00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.780\nWell guess what?\n\n419\n00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.480\nYou also need a voice over IP gateway to\nallow the outbound communications, well,\n\n420\n00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.660\ninbound communications.\n\n421\n00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.500\nIt comes into the gateway,\ngoes to the PBX,\n\n422\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.410\ncould be all built into one,\nbut goes to the PBX,\n\n423\n00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.390\nPBX determines which of these phone should\nI send this incoming communication.\n\n424\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.005\nLikewise, on the outbound trip,\n\n425\n00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:45.846\nthe gateway's gonna say,\nthis goes to the PSTN lines,\n\n426\n00:23:45.846 --> 00:23:49.937\nthis goes over to whatever the frame relay\nbase network or ISDN based network, right.\n\n427\n00:23:49.937 --> 00:23:54.930\nSo that's essentially what the voice over\nIP gateway and the voice over IP PBX or\n\n428\n00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.701\nprivate branch exchange is doing, right.\n\n429\n00:23:57.701 --> 00:24:02.639\nThe private branch exchange voice over IP\nis just working on an IP based network,\n\n430\n00:24:02.639 --> 00:24:05.080\nand includes and can function.\n\n431\n00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.879\nAnd will service even the old\ntelephone lines likewise.\n\n432\n00:24:08.879 --> 00:24:10.453\nAll right?\n\n433\n00:24:10.453 --> 00:24:13.260\nNow Zach, I kind of skipped over one and\nI don't know,\n\n434\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.091\nI really like this stuff so\nwhy I overshot the runway on this one.\n\n435\n00:24:16.091 --> 00:24:16.968\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know,\n\n436\n00:24:16.968 --> 00:24:19.275\nwe were talking about,\nit's kind of interesting right?\n\n437\n00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:22.000\nWe've been talking about\nsome security devices.\n\n438\n00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.150\nWe've talked about\nmulti-functioning devices, right?\n\n439\n00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.350\nWe've talked about a device that\ncould do VPN concentration.\n\n440\n00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.298\nYou know, I could do IDS,\nI could do IPS technologies as well.\n\n441\n00:24:31.298 --> 00:24:35.110\nAll right, well, we've got a lot of\ndifferent security technologies out there\n\n442\n00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.200\nthat we try to detect threats,\nwhether it be internally on our network,\n\n443\n00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.210\non our host if you will,\nour networks, right?\n\n444\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.115\nWe have IDS, IPS, firewall, and\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some.\n\n445\n00:24:47.115 --> 00:24:52.220\nWouldn't it be nice to take all\nof those services that are being\n\n446\n00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:58.180\nprovided security-wise and just bundle\nthem all into a single interface?\n\n447\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:02.770\nWell that's where something known as UTM\ncomes in, Unified Threat Management.\n\n448\n00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.760\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n449\n00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.880\nWe've got a little example.\n\n450\n00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.010\nWhen we say Unified Threat Management.\n\n451\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.930\nNow I've got USM here.\n\n452\n00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:17.510\nThat is not, and let me try,\nthat isn't at all an objective.\n\n453\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.890\nBut you see the term a lot, and\nI don't want it to confuse you.\n\n454\n00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.785\nIt just means Unified Security Management.\n\n455\n00:25:22.785 --> 00:25:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n456\n00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.290\n&gt;&gt; It's the same concept.\n\n457\n00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.880\nAnd the reason I do that is so\nif you are new to this technology and\n\n458\n00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.920\nyou never heard of UTM, and you start\nto Google, and hopefully you will\n\n459\n00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.890\ncontinue to do your studies, not just\noutside of what you see in this video.\n\n460\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.070\nWe want you to just blow\nthis exam out of the water.\n\n461\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.790\nAnd you start typing in UTM,\nand you see also USM?\n\n462\n00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.900\nThey're the same thing,\nthey're synonymous terms.\n\n463\n00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.320\nUnified Threat Management.\n\n464\n00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.490\nUnified Security Management.\n\n465\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.840\nThe ability that I could get\nthings like an antivirus gateway,\n\n466\n00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.300\nwe can get things like intrusion\ndetection services, but remember,\n\n467\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.060\nintrusion detection isn't\nintrusion prevention.\n\n468\n00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.540\nCuz now we go from just detecting,\n\n469\n00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:06.290\nwe also go to preventing, including things\nlike firewall services individually.\n\n470\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.260\nBut the big thing is,\nwe bundle that into a single location.\n\n471\n00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.450\nAll right.\n\n472\n00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:13.640\nRemember we talked about our\nWireless LAN Controllers Act?\n\n473\n00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.710\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n&gt;&gt; And we said hey man,\n\n474\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.430\nall of the things that I can\ndo in a single location,\n\n475\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.840\nconfiguring, monitoring, troubleshooting,\npushing out firmware updates, and\n\n476\n00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.150\nall I gotta do is log into\nthe Wireless LAN Controller.\n\n477\n00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.030\nWell imagine all of the little security\nthings that you've got going on\n\n478\n00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:32.580\nacross your network, and you can log into\na single device and control them all.\n\n479\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.410\nLittle bit simplified administration,\nright?\n\n480\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.244\n&gt;&gt; I want one of those.\n\n481\n00:26:35.244 --> 00:26:37.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Absolutely, right?\n\n482\n00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.410\nSo it's a great thing, right?\n\n483\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.050\nIt's a good thing to have.\n\n484\n00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.640\nLast but not least,\nis something known as a content filter.\n\n485\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.970\nAnd I don't have any diagram for\nthis one, all right?\n\n486\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.160\nJust like the next generation firewall,\nbecause it kind of comes up throughout\n\n487\n00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.040\nsome of these advanced devices\nthat we're talking about.\n\n488\n00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.250\nAnd that's something known\nas a content filler.\n\n489\n00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.010\nAnd a content filter can be a hardware\ndevice or even just an application, but\n\n490\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:04.090\na content filter allows\nyou to filter content.\n\n491\n00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.452\n&gt;&gt; That's good!\n\n492\n00:27:05.452 --> 00:27:07.010\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n[LAUGH] What it allows you to is,\n\n493\n00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:11.500\nit allows you as an administrator\nto ensure that when information\n\n494\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.809\nis coming into your network, it's only\nthe information that technically you want.\n\n495\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.800\nThink about content.\n\n496\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.310\nNow, there are obvious things we know\nshouldn't be in a business environment,\n\n497\n00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.870\nespecially when you're surfing the web,\nright?\n\n498\n00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.190\nYou guys know the risque stuff,\nI don't even have to mention it, right?\n\n499\n00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.460\nHas a few x's in the term, all right?\n\n500\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.030\nBut there are other things\nthat we don't think about that\n\n501\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.040\ncould be a violation of a security policy,\nand maybe you are not aware of it.\n\n502\n00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.220\nMaybe social media,\n\n503\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:40.000\nmaybe your company doesn't want YouTube\nvideos being watched on your network.\n\n504\n00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.350\nYou filter that content out.\n\n505\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.530\nDrop it.\n\n506\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.900\nRight?\nNetflix.\n\n507\n00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.990\nNetflix is one of the reasons,\nI don't know,\n\n508\n00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.170\nthat maybe a little of opinionated there,\nright?\n\n509\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But all these media streaming\n\n510\n00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.340\ncompanies out there.\n\n511\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.430\nNow we need neutrality because there's\n75% of all the traffic in the world is\n\n512\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.260\nstreaming videos, right?\n\n513\n00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.740\nWouldn't it be nice to save that content\nthe moment it hits my gateway, drop it?\n\n514\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.450\nI don't even want it on my network.\n\n515\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.100\nI don't want 75% of the bandwidth,\nthat I'm having to pay somebody else so\n\n516\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.735\nthat my business functions,\nbeing utilized for YouTube.\n\n517\n00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:14.320\nAnd again,\nnot a dig on YouTube by any means.\n\n518\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Please don't think that.\n\n519\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.240\nI love my Netflix, I fall asleep\nlistening to YouTube every night.\n\n520\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.650\nAll right?\n\n521\n00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.240\nBut the point is,\nhere's other things, right, gambling.\n\n522\n00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.740\nI don't care if you gamble,\nthat's a choice you make.\n\n523\n00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.220\nBut in some states, and\nI'm sure you might be aware of this Zach,\n\n524\n00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.731\nworking in the news industry,\nin certain states gambling is illegal.\n\n525\n00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:35.631\n&gt;&gt; Can't do it!\n\n526\n00:28:35.631 --> 00:28:37.498\n&gt;&gt; You can't do it at all, right?\n\n527\n00:28:37.498 --> 00:28:41.399\nSo now not only does it become\na violation of your security policy,\n\n528\n00:28:41.399 --> 00:28:44.813\nbecause people shouldn't be\ndoing online gambling, but\n\n529\n00:28:44.813 --> 00:28:50.595\nnow it becomes some kind of a criminal or\ncivil liability on your company's part.\n\n530\n00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:53.445\nSo we don't allow you\nto get to that content.\n\n531\n00:28:53.445 --> 00:28:54.950\nContent filtering.\n\n532\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.350\nAnd you can do it in a lot of ways.\n\n533\n00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.160\nYou can do it things on ratings,\nyou can do it things on, like for\n\n534\n00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.800\ninstance, URL filtering allows\nyou to do content filtering.\n\n535\n00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.290\nAnd I can do it on keywords, I can say\nthese keywords are not allowed to be\n\n536\n00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.080\nsearched for, you can't have information\nthat's coming into our network that way.\n\n537\n00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.360\nSo content filtering is also another one,\ncontent filter.\n\n538\n00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.249\nAll right?\nYou could put it on your web server,\n\n539\n00:29:16.249 --> 00:29:17.760\nyour proxy servers are a good place.\n\n540\n00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.417\nYou talked about, when we were\nmentioning proxies, Zach, you mentioned-\n\n541\n00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:22.261\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n542\n00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:23.171\n&gt;&gt; Access, right?\n\n543\n00:29:23.171 --> 00:29:27.951\nWell I can say, not only can't this\nseries of computers connect outbound to\n\n544\n00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:30.579\nthe Internet, but these three that can?\n\n545\n00:29:30.579 --> 00:29:32.477\nThey're not gonna see\nthat information come in,\n\n546\n00:29:32.477 --> 00:29:35.360\nbecause the moment it hits\nthe content folder, we discard it.\n\n547\n00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.090\nIt's a great way to get the control of the\ninformation that's traversing your network\n\n548\n00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:42.160\nwhen it's you that owns the network and\nthen you that might be liable for\n\n549\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.820\nthe stuff that's on that network.\n\n550\n00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.978\nAs well as, helping to increase\nthe productivity of your employees.\n\n551\n00:29:46.978 --> 00:29:47.479\nAll right?\n\n552\n00:29:47.479 --> 00:29:49.680\nAnd there's your business sense for\nthe day.\n\n553\n00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.960\nBut I will tell you,\nknow some of these devices,\n\n554\n00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:57.060\nbe able to explain in your own mind,\nand then sit into the exam booth and\n\n555\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.580\nlook at a scenario in which one of\nthese devices might be applicable.\n\n556\n00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.240\nIf you can do that, you're going to\nbe doing well for the Net+ exam.\n\n557\n00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.960\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of it is thanks to you, Wes.\n\n558\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.690\nAdvanced networking devices part two.\n\n559\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.390\nThere is a part one, watch them both.\n\n560\n00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.320\nAnd watch everything in the CompTIA Net+\nseries that Wes put together for you.\n\n561\n00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.480\nYou're gonna be glad you did, and\nwhile you're there in the course library,\n\n562\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.620\nhundreds of other videos all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n563\n00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.161\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n564\n00:30:22.161 --> 00:30:23.769\nTell everybody you know about that.\n\n565\n00:30:23.769 --> 00:30:25.060\nAnd I'm Zach Memos.\n\n566\n00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.830\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n567\n00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.052\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n568\n00:30:28.052 --> 00:30:34.044\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:30:34.044 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:13.086\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n4\n00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:16.690\nchoosing ITPRO.TV empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.881\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net+,\n\n6\n00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.687\n&gt;&gt; This is going to be virtualization and\n\n7\n00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.243\nnetwork storage, and we've asked our\nIT expert and all around great guy,\n\n8\n00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:26.895\nWes Bryan to help us out with that.\n\n9\n00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:27.801\nWes, good to see you.\n\n10\n00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.341\n&gt;&gt; Exact.\n\n11\n00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:29.201\nThanks for having me here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:29.741\nThat's right.\n\n13\n00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:32.580\nWe are looking at some pretty\ninteresting concepts and\n\n14\n00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.181\npretty popular concepts for the most part.\n\n15\n00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:36.950\nWe're going to be looking at,\nwell, virtualization technologies.\n\n16\n00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.600\nAnd it's interesting because\nhere at network plus, we don't\n\n17\n00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.210\ntalk a lot about some of the other\nportions of the virtualization technology.\n\n18\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000\nSo we're gonna kind of touch on both.\n\n19\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.111\nWe'll definitely talk about\nthings like virtual machines.\n\n20\n00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:54.200\nWe'll talk about things like host and\nguest operating systems.\n\n21\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.030\nThen, we're gonna get in to some of\nthe vitalize networking components that we\n\n22\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.610\nneed to be aware of since\nit is a network plus exam.\n\n23\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.480\nAnd we're also gonna look at different\ncomponents within that work storage.\n\n24\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.410\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive right in.\n\n25\n00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.430\nAnd we're gonna talk about some of\nthe virtual networking components.\n\n26\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.330\nAnd what I wanna talk about, with the\nslide that we got here, the, the little\n\n27\n00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.180\ndiagram we got here, I want us to know and\nunderstand what virtualization is.\n\n28\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.660\nSee without virtualization,\nyou know we have these abstract layers.\n\n29\n00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.820\nRight, when it comes to computing.\n\n30\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.810\nWe've got our hardware.\n\n31\n00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.123\nRight?\nAnd just above our hardware.\n\n32\n00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:29.122\nWell, let's talk about our hardware,\nwe've got our computational resources.\n\n33\n00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.890\nWe've got things like our CPU, right.\n\n34\n00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.571\nWe have our memory.\n\n35\n00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:32.542\nWe have our storage.\n\n36\n00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.330\nWe have our networking communications,\nright.\n\n37\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.970\nAnd then traditionally, without any\nkind of of virtualization technology,\n\n38\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.650\nif we look we have an operating system\nthat's installed on our hardware, right.\n\n39\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.880\nRight, and then above that,\nthe next layer is gonna be,\n\n40\n00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.240\nwell, not necessarily like the OSI\nmodel when I say application layer.\n\n41\n00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.450\nBut that's gonna be the software that\nruns within the operating system.\n\n42\n00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.650\nNow, that's all fine and good.\n\n43\n00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.700\nBut one of the things I want you\nto understand is that when we\n\n44\n00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.010\nhave something like this, right?\n\n45\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.016\nWhen we have our operating system running\non our hardware, but one thing to keep\n\n46\n00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:07.741\nin mind is that if we have a little\nlot of computational resources, right?\n\n47\n00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:10.911\nWe have a very,\nvery strong multi-core process.\n\n48\n00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.721\nWe've got a lot of RAM at 64 gigs of RAM.\n\n49\n00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:19.141\nWe've got just terabytes of storage and\nwe've got a pretty good network adapter.\n\n50\n00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.605\nWhat we've got is a single operating\nsystem that is utilizing all of these\n\n51\n00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:28.429\nresources and some of those resources\nmight just get pushed by the wayside, and\n\n52\n00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:34.280\nnot fully or adequately used, efficiently\nused by that single operating system.\n\n53\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.210\nOr the applications that are running\nwithin the operating system.\n\n54\n00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.420\nWe might have some wasted resources.\n\n55\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.114\nWouldn't it be nice if we could find\na way that we could more efficiently\n\n56\n00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:49.969\nallocate resources not just to a single\noperating system that's running\n\n57\n00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.960\non a physical machine or\nnot just to a handful of applications\n\n58\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.372\nthat's running in a single operating\nsystem on a single machine?\n\n59\n00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:02.078\nWould it be nicer if we take those\nresources and we could have more\n\n60\n00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:06.818\nthan one operating system running side by\nside in its own isolated environment and\n\n61\n00:03:06.818 --> 00:03:10.387\nwe can allocate a portion of the CPU,\na portion of the memory,\n\n62\n00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:14.670\na portion of the storage and a portion\nof the networking communications?\n\n63\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.910\nJust that single operating system and\n\n64\n00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.670\nall of those other resources that don't\nreally efficiently get used, right?\n\n65\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.150\nThey're not used the way they could be.\n\n66\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.770\nNow, they don't get wasted.\n\n67\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.560\nThey don't just put in the side,\nput in the closet close closet door.\n\n68\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.500\nWe can't use them anymore.\n\n69\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.180\nBut now,\n\n70\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.110\nwe can do is we can show another operating\nsystem on the same physical machine.\n\n71\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.790\nAnd then we can take\nthat operating system,\n\n72\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.490\nthat second operating system if you will.\n\n73\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.734\nAnd we can now locate some of those\nunused resources that CPU to that second\n\n74\n00:03:44.734 --> 00:03:49.412\noperating system a little bit more of its\nmemory to the second operating system.\n\n75\n00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.540\nAnd then the storage right a hard\ndrive space whether it's a hard disk\n\n76\n00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.930\ndriver solid state storage and\n\n77\n00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.470\nagain that networking communication's\nprobably mentioned that twice right?\n\n78\n00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.020\nSo this is really about taking\nthose four horsemen right?\n\n79\n00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.089\nI call him in the computing architecture,\nright?\n\n80\n00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.420\nAnd dividing them up a little bit better.\n\n81\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.097\nNow, that's what virtualization\ntechnology allows me to do,\n\n82\n00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:14.410\nan what we don't see here is proper\nutilization of our resources.\n\n83\n00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.070\nWell, how do we do virtualization?\n\n84\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.542\nWell, we do virtualization through\nsomething known as hypervisor.\n\n85\n00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:25.690\nAll right and a hypervisor will do\nis it will add another layer here.\n\n86\n00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.320\nWell, it depends on\nwhere the hypervisor is.\n\n87\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.340\nWe're going to talk about a couple\ndifferent types of hypervisors.\n\n88\n00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.910\nBut the goal here is to add another layer\nso that we can install multiple different\n\n89\n00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.630\noperating systems on it on a single\npiece of hardware, all right.\n\n90\n00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.530\nAnd if we look here I've actually got an\nexample and now don't about the type yet.\n\n91\n00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.790\nWe'll talk about that\ncoming up here in a second.\n\n92\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.464\nBut wouldn't it be nice once we have\nthis extra layer known as a hypervisor,\n\n93\n00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:51.230\nall right.\n\n94\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.280\nThe hypervisor manages communication\nto all of those resources,\n\n95\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.360\nthose computational resources that we're\ntalking about the CPU, the memory,\n\n96\n00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.700\nthe storage, the network, right?\n\n97\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.950\nAnd then,\nwe can install another operating system,\n\n98\n00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.580\nan operating system on\ntop of this hypervisor.\n\n99\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.760\nAnd the first operating system is\ngonna communicate with the hypervisor\n\n100\n00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.920\nthat is gonna be kind of\nlike the middleman, right?\n\n101\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.870\nIt's gonna be kind of like the loan shark,\nif you will, here,\n\n102\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.780\nI'll give you this amount of CPU space,\nor the CPU resources,\n\n103\n00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.430\nI give you 2 gigs of the memory,\ncuz maybe that's all you really need.\n\n104\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.430\nWe've got 64 128 gigs of RAM in here.\n\n105\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.050\nAnd I've allocated that first operating\nsystem, just two of those 128 gigs.\n\n106\n00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.510\nWell, remember those wasted\nresources we're talking about?\n\n107\n00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.770\nWe now have 126 gigs,\nroughly probably about 124,\n\n108\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.440\ncuz you still need that hypervisor\nneeds a little bit of memory to run.\n\n109\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.580\nBut I got, let's say worst case scenario,\n\n110\n00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.510\nI got 124 gigs of RAM that I can now\nallocate to another operating system, or\n\n111\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.410\nmaybe just 2 gigs to the second\noperating system, or even 4 gigs,\n\n112\n00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.670\n10 gigs to the second operating system\ndepending on how much of memory it needs,\n\n113\n00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.890\nand now,\nI've got 118 I can still allocate.\n\n114\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.222\nStorage, same thing,\nI can divide some of the storage up and\n\n115\n00:06:02.222 --> 00:06:05.059\nI could say okay first operating system,\nyou're gonna get to go ahead and\n\n116\n00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:06.961\nyou're gonna get this\namount of storage space.\n\n117\n00:06:06.961 --> 00:06:11.638\nSecond operating system you're gonna get\nthis amount and then if I still got more\n\n118\n00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:16.039\nleft over rather than it sitting in\nthe closet sitting idle, being wasted,\n\n119\n00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.852\nnot used properly, we can continue up to\nthe point we don't have any more resources\n\n120\n00:06:20.852 --> 00:06:24.540\nto allocate or we need those\nresources to perform adequately.\n\n121\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.160\nWe can use them a little\nbit more efficiently.\n\n122\n00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.010\n&gt;&gt; Just a quick question, Wes, are the\nsecondary tertiary operating systems\n\n123\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.610\nyou're talking about,\nare they always VMs, or no?\n\n124\n00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes they are, yes.\n\n125\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.300\nWhen we say VMs, we haven't really said\nwhether they're a virtual machine, right?\n\n126\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.280\nThis is what we call virtual machines,\nall right?\n\n127\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.690\nYou gotta understand\nWhat virtual machine is.\n\n128\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.899\nA virtual machine is really a software\nrepresentation of a physical device,\n\n129\n00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:49.050\nnow all right.\n\n130\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.182\nYou have portions in your operating\nsystem that communicate with your\n\n131\n00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:53.970\nhardware, right.\n\n132\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.272\nIn this model,\nhere we got a single operating system and\n\n133\n00:06:57.272 --> 00:06:59.740\nit controls all of the hardware, right.\n\n134\n00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.389\nThat's the purpose of an operating system.\n\n135\n00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.431\nThose of you that are coming over for\nA plus probably recognize this.\n\n136\n00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:06.647\nIf we didn't have an operating system,\n\n137\n00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:11.290\nwe'd have a glorified overly expensive\npaperweight that is the system unit right?\n\n138\n00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.880\nWe can't use it,\n\n139\n00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.210\nthat's why we have an operating system it\nallows us to interact with the hardware.\n\n140\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.430\nBut when we put the Hypervisor\nthat abstract layer there, right?\n\n141\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.310\nNow, that Hypervisor becomes\nthe access to the hardware.\n\n142\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.011\nAll right, and\nwe can install operating systems, again,\n\n143\n00:07:29.011 --> 00:07:33.083\nabstractly, on top of the hyper-visor,\nand then what it does,\n\n144\n00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:37.080\nlike the original host operating\nsystem would do on this model,\n\n145\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.700\nwhat it does is it becomes the manager\nof the hardware, if you will.\n\n146\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.260\nAnd it allows this operating\nsystem to talk to the hypervisor.\n\n147\n00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.623\nThis operating system to talk to\nthe hypervisor in the background,\n\n148\n00:07:48.623 --> 00:07:52.576\ntransparent to the operating systems that\nare running on top of it they all think\n\n149\n00:07:52.576 --> 00:07:55.598\nthat yeah we're the only ones here,\nI'm the only one here.\n\n150\n00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:58.506\nNo other operating system has\naccess to this hardware, and\n\n151\n00:07:58.506 --> 00:08:01.313\nthe Hypervisor can just do all\nof the translation for us.\n\n152\n00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:04.132\nIt's very good for\nthings like testing environments, right?\n\n153\n00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:09.524\nIf I have not only proper resource\nallocation, right, better, more efficient\n\n154\n00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:15.300\nresource allocation, but it's also a good\nway to do a testing environment, right?\n\n155\n00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.550\nI bring up one of these virtual machines\ninside of this operating system,\n\n156\n00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.330\nI install an application that\nwe're testing, and guess what?\n\n157\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.500\nIf it causes a problem, we have things,\nadditional technologies that you'll learn\n\n158\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.490\nabout as you go on into\ndifferent courses and stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.263\nWe have things like snapshots where I can\nactually create a point in time snapshot,\n\n160\n00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.220\na point in time copy of the system state.\n\n161\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.810\nSo that if I make a configuration or\na change or\n\n162\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.460\nif I damage the operating system, I can\nroll back to an earlier point in time.\n\n163\n00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.220\nSo it is really ultimately about better,\n\n164\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.240\nmore efficient utilization of the\nresources you have within the system, but\n\n165\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.810\nit also lends itself to great\ntesting environments as well.\n\n166\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.870\nNow what you have here,\nwe talk about guest VM.\n\n167\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.604\nThe guest VM essentially is\nthe virtual machine that is running on\n\n168\n00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:04.331\ntop of the Hypervisor.\n\n169\n00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:11.680\nYou might also hear the term\nGuest operating system, Guest OS.\n\n170\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.400\nAnd why do we call that a Guest OS, right?\n\n171\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.820\nWell, the Hypervisor is actually kinda\nlike a small operating system in the fact\n\n172\n00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.930\nthat there is what's known as the host\noperating system, and it essentially\n\n173\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:28.710\nis allowing the communication\nbetween that and the hardware.\n\n174\n00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.860\nNotice that we have,\nin this case, in this example,\n\n175\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.220\nwe have two guest operating systems or\nguest OSes, right?\n\n176\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.800\nAnd that's the operating system that's\nrunning in that virtualized, that logical,\n\n177\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.510\nif you will, that software\nrepresentation of the hardware.\n\n178\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.630\nNow, notice the position of the Hypervisor\nhere, notice that the Hypervisor is\n\n179\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.836\nright on top of the metal, or\nthe resources, the hardware.\n\n180\n00:09:51.836 --> 00:09:54.930\nIt's what we call a bare metal Hypervisor,\nand this is what you're gonna see inside\n\n181\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.420\nof your performance level or\nyour business environments, right?\n\n182\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.159\nBecause it does give you\nthe better performance.\n\n183\n00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:03.600\nYou've got access to the hardware.\n\n184\n00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.472\nNow, there's another type of Hypervisor\nand it's really only used for\n\n185\n00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:11.358\ntest environments, and you really\ndon't want to use it in production.\n\n186\n00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:15.460\nBecause while it does add another layer,\n\n187\n00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.402\nthe where it adds it is\na little bit inconvenient.\n\n188\n00:10:20.402 --> 00:10:23.040\nI said convenient for\ntesting purposes, but\n\n189\n00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.245\nnot really convenient for\nperformance in business applications.\n\n190\n00:10:27.245 --> 00:10:29.527\nAnd this is what is known\nas a Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n191\n00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:31.913\nNow, I want you to pay attention\nto the color coding, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:31.913 --> 00:10:34.355\nThere's a reason I color\ncoded them this way, right?\n\n193\n00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.795\nAnd that is because I want you\nto notice that we still have\n\n194\n00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:40.385\na host operating system, all right?\n\n195\n00:10:40.385 --> 00:10:45.025\nBut then we put a Hypervisor on\ntop of the host operating system.\n\n196\n00:10:45.025 --> 00:10:49.482\nAnd what we mean by that is a Type 2,\nand this is called a Type 2 Hypervisor,\n\n197\n00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:54.291\nthe Type 2 Hypervisor is really nothing\nmore than another program running on your\n\n198\n00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:54.930\nmachine.\n\n199\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.460\nSo if you have, for instance, maybe I\nhave the Office Suite here, maybe I have\n\n200\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:04.500\nDreamweaver, and maybe I have everybody's\nfavorite Minesweeper game, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.653\nWell, if I install a Type 2 Hypervisor,\n\n202\n00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:10.710\nit's just another application\nprogram running on your machine.\n\n203\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.150\nAnd because of that, it does take\na little bit of a performance hit, right?\n\n204\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.510\nWe have a lot of translation\nthat's going on,\n\n205\n00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.920\nunlike the Type 1 Hypervisor where\nit's direct hard ware access, right?\n\n206\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.474\nAgain, that's why they call it a bare\nmetal cuz it sits right abstractly on top\n\n207\n00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:28.860\nof the hardware.\n\n208\n00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.521\nAgain, we have multiple layers here, and\nI put a guest operating system, again,\n\n209\n00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:38.138\nsame concept, you could also say that the\nguest virtual machine is there as well.\n\n210\n00:11:38.138 --> 00:11:43.486\nWe could call that the Guest VM,\nif you want, all right?\n\n211\n00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.730\nBut notice all the translation\nthat has to go.\n\n212\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.330\nWhen I put applications to do testing\nhere, it's got to communicate with\n\n213\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.720\nthe guest operating system which now\nhas to communicate with the Hypervisor,\n\n214\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.960\nwhich like other programs,\nare in competition to speak to\n\n215\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.520\nthe host operating system,\nwhich then likewise talks to the hardware.\n\n216\n00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.930\nSo you can see there's a lot of\nthings that are going on there and\n\n217\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.050\nthat does give you a performance hit.\n\n218\n00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.280\nAnd that's why these are perfect for\ntesting environments.\n\n219\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.560\nIn fact, let me show you an example\nof a Type 2 Hypervisor, right?\n\n220\n00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.248\nIf I, and in fact let me adjust my\ndock preferences here, I like to\n\n221\n00:12:15.248 --> 00:12:18.480\nminimize my dock so you guys get a little\nbit more real estate on the screen here.\n\n222\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.380\nBut I've got VMware Fusion, right?\n\n223\n00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.550\nNotice that VMware Fusion is sitting right\nnext to Finder, Google Chrome, Notes,\n\n224\n00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.760\nSkype and all of my other programs, right?\n\n225\n00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.160\nThis is a Type 2 Hypervisor, and it would\nbe no different if I launched up Chrome or\n\n226\n00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.590\nI launched up, in this case,\nVMware fusion, right?\n\n227\n00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:40.929\nSo, this is a Type 2 Hypervisor and\nit's perfect to be able to test software.\n\n228\n00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:46.160\nSo you could see in the background\nthat I'm running Mac OS, right?\n\n229\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.921\nBut wouldn't it be nice that\nif I wanted to do testing,\n\n230\n00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:51.681\nI could turn around here and\nI could launch up through,\n\n231\n00:12:51.681 --> 00:12:55.360\nthat's Type 2 Hypervisor,\nI can launch up another operating system.\n\n232\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.600\nIn this case, yes, I know,\nthis isn't Hackintosh out here, right?\n\n233\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.490\nThis is Mac.\n\n234\n00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.350\nWe're running Windows on Mac, right?\n\n235\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.830\nNow, I know what you guys out there\nthat are running Mac you said, wow,\n\n236\n00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.590\nthat's blasphemy.\n\n237\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:07.840\nWell, the point is,\n\n238\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.750\nit gives me the ability to test\nother operating systems, right?\n\n239\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.847\nAnd I can do things like, for instance,\ncreating Virtual Machine Snapshots.\n\n240\n00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:18.930\nThis one, I believe does have a,\nit doesn't have a snapshot.\n\n241\n00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.720\nI wanna make a configuration change\nto this virtual machine, but\n\n242\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.900\nI don't wanna worry about having\nto reinstall the operating system,\n\n243\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.250\ncuz Wes can break an operating system or\nthe best of them, all right?\n\n244\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.880\nSo what do I do?\n\n245\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.425\nI come in here and I say just go ahead and\nwe'll take a snapshot, right?\n\n246\n00:13:32.425 --> 00:13:38.182\nAnd I could say, I don't know, I do this a\nlot, I call this base install, all right?\n\n247\n00:13:38.182 --> 00:13:39.462\nSo I know exactly that,\n\n248\n00:13:39.462 --> 00:13:42.990\nthat this the point that I install\nthe operating system, right?\n\n249\n00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.820\nWe end up taking that, and you can see\nthat it's taking that snapshot, right?\n\n250\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.470\nWell, if I get in here and, let's say,\nI don't know, I log in, right?\n\n251\n00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.160\nAnd I don't know,\nI'm just going to give you off the top.\n\n252\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.180\nHopefully, this will log in fairly quick,\n\n253\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.630\nbut while we're waiting maybe I make\na modification to the registry, right?\n\n254\n00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.440\nAnd again, I'm testing something.\n\n255\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.188\nOr I install a piece of software or\ninstall a driver, right?\n\n256\n00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:13.580\nAnd I get in here, and\nI'm typing something like regedit.exe.\n\n257\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.360\nShould launch up my registry editor.\n\n258\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.130\nI come in here, and I make\na modification to the registry, right?\n\n259\n00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.720\nWe really shouldn't be doing that, but\nsometimes you have to do that for, again,\n\n260\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.860\ntesting purposes, right?\n\n261\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.870\nSo I get in here, and\nI don't even know if I might be able to.\n\n262\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.830\nI don't even know if I can.\n\n263\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.350\nLet's try to delete part of the registry.\n\n264\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.860\nBoy, I just deleted an entire\nportion of the registry.\n\n265\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.110\nThat's bad, and\nany of you guys knows that Windows,\n\n266\n00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.361\nyou should never be modifying\nthe registry, right?\n\n267\n00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:42.150\nWell, I just deleted\na portion of registry.\n\n268\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.480\nThis computer is probably very messed up\nright now because Wes did something wrong.\n\n269\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.949\nWell, that's okay, because one of\nthe great things about virtualization, and\n\n270\n00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:53.214\nthis is why I harp on the testing process,\n\n271\n00:14:53.214 --> 00:14:56.275\nis that if I look at my snapshots,\nI made a mistake.\n\n272\n00:14:56.275 --> 00:14:57.054\nWell, look what I can do.\n\n273\n00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:00.348\nI'll just restore the snapshot\nhere real quick, and\n\n274\n00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:01.860\nit'll ask me do you wanna\nstay at the current state?\n\n275\n00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.391\nLet's say Don't Save,\njust throw it out, please throw it out.\n\n276\n00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:09.500\nAnd let's delete any camera that's\nseen Wes delete the registry, right?\n\n277\n00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.020\nAnd now I'm back to the current state,\nright?\n\n278\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.131\nThat is a great thing, right?\n\n279\n00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:18.233\nAnd now, if I open up the registry or\nI open up my operating system again here,\n\n280\n00:15:18.233 --> 00:15:21.570\nI get to start over,\nI get to start fresh, right?\n\n281\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:22.860\nSo that's some of the things that,\n\n282\n00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.040\nI don't want to discourage anybody\nfrom the Type 2 Hypervisors.\n\n283\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.180\nThey are definitely worth their\nweight in gold, all right?\n\n284\n00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.190\nNow, that being said, that is a little\nbit about your Type 1, Type 2 Hypervisor.\n\n285\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:37.820\nKnow the difference.\n\n286\n00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820\nJust remember that the Type\n1 Hypervisor just means that\n\n287\n00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.680\nthis is what you're\ngonna use in production.\n\n288\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.560\nYou get a really big server, lot of\nmemory, lot of CPU, a lot of storage.\n\n289\n00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.701\nMaybe your storage is separate,\n\n290\n00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:52.480\nwhich we've gotta talk about coming up,\nSAN technology, all right?\n\n291\n00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.837\nAnd then what I can do is I can\nrun multiple servers virtualized,\n\n292\n00:15:55.837 --> 00:15:58.946\nvirtual operating systems,\ndon't let the term fool you,\n\n293\n00:15:58.946 --> 00:16:01.141\nvirtual machines on that single server.\n\n294\n00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:04.825\nAnd now, rather than having to just run\na single operating system and waste,\n\n295\n00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:08.849\nlet's say, 100 gigs of ram because, well\nAnd I install one operating system and\n\n296\n00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:12.591\nthat's all, it uses all of that memory\nwhether it's actually utilizing it or\n\n297\n00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:14.433\nnot is a completely different story.\n\n298\n00:16:14.433 --> 00:16:19.397\nPut inside one hypervisor on it and I can\ninstall 15 server operating systems on\n\n299\n00:16:19.397 --> 00:16:21.807\nit and divvy them up the way I so choose.\n\n300\n00:16:21.807 --> 00:16:24.874\nType 2's like things\nlike the old virtual PC,\n\n301\n00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:27.720\nVirtual Box one of\nthe great ones out there.\n\n302\n00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.440\nFree, open source, I'm definitely\nmarketing here, not making any money,\n\n303\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.330\ncheck it out if you wanna\ndo stuff like this.\n\n304\n00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.310\nVMware Fusion another example of\ntype 2 hypervisors that are really\n\n305\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.720\njust like you see here are another\nprogram in competition for\n\n306\n00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.980\nthe resources within your hardware,\nso great thing to have.\n\n307\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.880\nNow, virtual machines, they need to\nbe able to communicate, all right?\n\n308\n00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.920\nAnd that's where we get to\nthe networking side of this, right?\n\n309\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.970\nThat kinda sets the stage for\n\n310\n00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.150\nthe virtual networking components\nthat we talk about, all right?\n\n311\n00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.960\nWell, inside of my machines,\nI have a network adapter.\n\n312\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.900\nWell, I have a network adapter.\n\n313\n00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.010\nWell you know I have a network\nadapter inside of the Mac, right?\n\n314\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.550\nThe physical network adapter\nis an intel of some sorts,\n\n315\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.050\nI'm not exactly sure\noff the top of my head.\n\n316\n00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.470\nBut my virtual machines also\nthey think they're a physical\n\n317\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.490\npiece of hardware even though\nthe hypervisors kind of lie into them and\n\n318\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.960\ntelling them, yeah, this is your hardware.\n\n319\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.910\nWell I also have to be able to\ncommunicate with this operating system.\n\n320\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.430\nAnd there are a couple of different\nways that we can do this, right?\n\n321\n00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.900\nWe do this through what are known as,\nwell, there's a couple of types of\n\n322\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.350\ndifferent communications that we can do,\nand we'll talk about that coming up.\n\n323\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.950\nBut I need a virtualized network adapter.\n\n324\n00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.290\nSo if I log into my Windows machine here,\nright?\n\n325\n00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.670\nAgain, this is a virtual\nmachine running on my Mac.\n\n326\n00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.190\nWell, I have what's known as\na virtual network adaptor.\n\n327\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.310\nNow, those of you that are out there that\nmaybe don't have a virtualized machine,\n\n328\n00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.720\nbut maybe you have a Windows machine.\n\n329\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.860\nNow, my head's kind of covering this\nup here, but if I look in the lower\n\n330\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:59.110\nright hand corner I'll notice that I have,\nwell I have network access, right?\n\n331\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.810\nI can see my network icon coming up and\n\n332\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:06.070\napparently a problem with my Microsoft\naccount, we'll fix that later.\n\n333\n00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.710\nBut notice that I've got,\nwell I've got an adapter.\n\n334\n00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:15.045\nTo me and you can see right, Intel 82574L.\n\n335\n00:18:15.045 --> 00:18:17.670\nThat's the network\nadapter that's in my Mac.\n\n336\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.700\nI just found out what\nthe network adapter version was.\n\n337\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.670\nThat's the physical network adapter.\n\n338\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.340\nBut the hypervisor's virtualizing it for\nme.\n\n339\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.860\nIt's saying to this operating\nsystem that's your network adapter.\n\n340\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.030\nWell, I've got more than one machine here.\n\n341\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.060\nIn fact,\nif I go back to my vm ware fusion,\n\n342\n00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.060\nif I can get there without making\nyou guys seasick out there.\n\n343\n00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.050\nNotice that I've got another operating\nsystem, and another operating system.\n\n344\n00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:47.440\nWell each one of these machines also has\na network adapter, but it's virtualized.\n\n345\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.312\nThey're sharing the physical network\nadapter within the host which would be no\n\n346\n00:18:52.312 --> 00:18:55.233\ndifferent than a type one hypervisor,\nright?\n\n347\n00:18:55.233 --> 00:18:58.330\nHow they share it's a little\nbit more efficient, all right?\n\n348\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.029\nBut a virtual network adapter works\njust like any other network adapter.\n\n349\n00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:05.205\nIn fact, when I right click on that\nvirtualize network adapter and\n\n350\n00:19:05.205 --> 00:19:08.665\nI bring up its properties looks no\ndifferent than all the other of windows\n\n351\n00:19:08.665 --> 00:19:12.518\nnetwork adapters that we look at if you\ngot a physical workstation, a laptop, or\n\n352\n00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:13.730\neven a surface, right?\n\n353\n00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.690\nSurface tablet out there,\n\n354\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.490\nand if I right click or\nif I choose Internet Protocol Version 4.\n\n355\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.600\nAnd I look at the properties I can\nsee yep it's set up for DHCP and\n\n356\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.050\nwouldn't you know it, if I go ahead and\n\n357\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.180\nI close out of all of this, and I right\nclick on my little Windows icon there.\n\n358\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.950\nAnd I choose Power Shell,\nthat's right get powerful,\n\n359\n00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.590\nwe're gonna go into Power Shell here.\n\n360\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.395\nCD backslash we'll go ahead and\nclear up the screen here and\n\n361\n00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:40.983\nI do an ipconfig like we talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n362\n00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:43.040\nWell, okay, look at this.\n\n363\n00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.780\nI have an IP address, I've got a subnet\nmask, I've got a default gateway.\n\n364\n00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.760\nI've even got an IPv6 address.\n\n365\n00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.750\nSo, to this operating system\nthe hypervisor is making you think it's\n\n366\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.640\ngot its own physical network adaptor\nwhen it really just resides in software.\n\n367\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.450\nThat's why we say virtual.\n\n368\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.270\nThink of logical.\n\n369\n00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.950\nSoftware, right?\n\n370\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:07.280\nBut, it functions no different\nthan any other network adaptor.\n\n371\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.000\nIn fact, let's go ahead, I tell you what.\n\n372\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.200\nLet's send a ping out\nto Google's DNS server.\n\n373\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.096\nSo we'll do ping 8.8.8.\n\n374\n00:20:15.096 --> 00:20:18.230\nNot commas in an IP address, I swear.\n\n375\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.540\nAnd they don't start out like that.\n\n376\n00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.920\nEventually I will ping an IP address, and\nnotice that I'm getting responses, right?\n\n377\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.470\nWhy?\nWhy am I getting responses from something\n\n378\n00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.502\nthat doesn't really exist?\n\n379\n00:20:30.502 --> 00:20:32.071\nWell that's where\nthe hypervisor's coming in.\n\n380\n00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:35.766\nThe hypervisor's taking that information\nand passing it down to the hardware,\n\n381\n00:20:35.766 --> 00:20:38.715\nin this case it's passing it down\nto the back operating system.\n\n382\n00:20:38.715 --> 00:20:41.908\nAnd then the operating system is sending\nit out to the physical network and\n\n383\n00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:44.190\nout over the Internet and\nI'm getting a reply back.\n\n384\n00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.970\nSo to Google's DNS server it's\nreturning me some ICM ping packets and\n\n385\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.730\nit thinks that it is a normal, regular,\n\n386\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.790\nphysical network adapter even though\nit only resides in software, all right?\n\n387\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.540\nSo that's one of the first things\nthat we need when we look at\n\n388\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.868\nthe networking components, right?\n\n389\n00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:03.070\nAnd I know Zach,\nI'm doing this a bit out of order, but\n\n390\n00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.275\nI think we should start with\nthe operating system first.\n\n391\n00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:06.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n392\n00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:10.310\n&gt;&gt; Now we could create entire\nvirtual networks, if we want.\n\n393\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.350\nIn fact, if I go ahead and\nget out of my virtual machine here for\n\n394\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.060\na second, and we bring back up this.\n\n395\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.920\nAnd again,\nthis just happens to be VMWare Fusion.\n\n396\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.260\nThis is one of the ones\nthat I use on my Mac.\n\n397\n00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.680\nThere's all different kinds out there.\n\n398\n00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.840\nAnd I definitely encourage you guys\nto research some additional ones.\n\n399\n00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.170\nBut if I go into VMWare Fusion, right?\n\n400\n00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.150\nAnd I go into its preferences.\n\n401\n00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.500\nI can see that, guess what?\n\n402\n00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.810\nThere's some networking\noptions right here.\n\n403\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.770\nAnd if I look at the networking options, I\nhave all different options that I can do.\n\n404\n00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.280\nFor instance, I've got what's\nknown as Private to my Mac.\n\n405\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.994\nI've got VMNet2.\n\n406\n00:21:44.994 --> 00:21:46.471\nWhat are these?\n\n407\n00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.710\nWhat do these really mean?\n\n408\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.560\nWell, that's what's known\nas virtual switches.\n\n409\n00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:57.360\nAnd a virtual network adapter\ncommunicates to a virtual switch.\n\n410\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.656\nDon't let it get too technical guys and\ngirls out there, its the same process.\n\n411\n00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:08.480\nBuilt into this virtualization\nsoftware is a virtualized switch.\n\n412\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.240\nAnd I can create networks around it.\n\n413\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.880\nAnd if I want,\nlet me see if I can do one real quick.\n\n414\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.800\nAll right,\nI wanna create an additional network.\n\n415\n00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.290\nWow, it was that easy.\n\n416\n00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.114\nJust click a button, right?\n\n417\n00:22:21.114 --> 00:22:26.550\nAnd now I could connect the host,\nwhich is the host operating system, right?\n\n418\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.860\nMy Mac, and\nI could connect it to this network so\n\n419\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.580\nthat my Mac can connect to the virtual\nswitch and communicate through it as well.\n\n420\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.740\nBut it also goes even farther than that.\n\n421\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.480\nNotice that it also gives DHCP addresses.\n\n422\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.090\nNotice that we have a Subnet IP and\na Subnet Mask.\n\n423\n00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.560\nWell guess what?\n\n424\n00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.910\nOn my network here, virtual machines,\nwhen I ran that ping.\n\n425\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:54.190\nIn fact, we'll go ahead and ping,\nlet's ping their other public DNS server.\n\n426\n00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.700\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and do a switch-T\non this that'll make it a persistent ping.\n\n427\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.890\nThose of you that are in\nNIX-based systems, UNIX, LINUX.\n\n428\n00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.970\nWell even BSDs under the hood here in Mac,\nit's NIX-based system.\n\n429\n00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.040\nIt's usually, pings are persistent and\nuntil you stop them.\n\n430\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.600\nWindows you have to actually put the slash\nt and it makes it to keep going.\n\n431\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.690\nNow, what's going on here?\n\n432\n00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.040\nI'm not communicating with\njust my local network anymore.\n\n433\n00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.365\nThere is information that's going to\nthe software within this machine,\n\n434\n00:23:21.365 --> 00:23:24.775\nthe virtualize switch,\nthat's then being translated,\n\n435\n00:23:24.775 --> 00:23:29.080\nsent out the physical network\nadapter on the Mac, all right?\n\n436\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.580\nAnd it is going to our routers, or\n\n437\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.330\nour default gateway being routed off\nof our network out over the Internet\n\n438\n00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:40.080\nto Google servers, back into our network,\nand back into this machine.\n\n439\n00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.880\nSo how is this IP address being handed?\n\n440\n00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.200\nWhy is this IP address being allowed?\n\n441\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.270\nAnd the communication over IP.\n\n442\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:54.104\nWell, that's because inside of this\nsoftware is also what's known as a virtual\n\n443\n00:23:54.104 --> 00:23:55.675\nrouter, that allows us.\n\n444\n00:23:55.675 --> 00:23:59.426\nRemember, the switch connects\nlocal area networks together, but\n\n445\n00:23:59.426 --> 00:24:01.928\nswitches whether virtualized or physical,\n\n446\n00:24:01.928 --> 00:24:06.355\nthey only recognize the computers that\nare directly connected to their ports.\n\n447\n00:24:06.355 --> 00:24:10.814\nSo how is it that I can send\ninformation between the different\n\n448\n00:24:10.814 --> 00:24:13.793\nnetworks that I've just created vm1.\n\n449\n00:24:13.793 --> 00:24:17.249\nNotice it's a 192.168.209 subnet, and\n\n450\n00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:20.714\nthen I have another one\nhere that's autogenerated.\n\n451\n00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:26.858\nAnd I could say you know what, I think\nI'm gonna do the 10.10.0.0 network,\n\n452\n00:24:26.858 --> 00:24:30.970\nand maybe we'll just leave it\na class with a subnet mask.\n\n453\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.430\nYeah, discard the change,\nlet's try that again.\n\n454\n00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.752\nLet's try an actual IP address,\nthere we go.\n\n455\n00:24:37.752 --> 00:24:40.793\nAll right, maybe the subnet mask,\nI don't know,\n\n456\n00:24:40.793 --> 00:24:46.549\nmaybe I wanna do Classless Inter-Domain\nRouting, so I do a 255.255.254, right?\n\n457\n00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:49.357\nI do a /23 network, well, wait a second.\n\n458\n00:24:50.654 --> 00:24:53.100\nThis is routing, this is a virtual router.\n\n459\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.980\nAnd it understands things like even cider,\na variable link subnet mask, right?\n\n460\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.120\nIt's how we perform,\nClassless Inter-Domain Routing.\n\n461\n00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.530\nSo we also have a virtualized\nrouter in here.\n\n462\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.490\nAll right, so just to go a little bit\nfurther with this in a diagram so\n\n463\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.350\nyou can kinda see it,\n\n464\n00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:10.780\nnotice that we have a virtualized switch\nand the switch runs within the host.\n\n465\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.360\nYou'll hear that term host and\n\n466\n00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.780\nguest, a host operating system,\na guest operating system.\n\n467\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:21.430\nThe host is hosting all the other guests,\nright, it contains the hypervisor.\n\n468\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.450\nAll right, where that hypervisor sits is\ncontingent on whether it's a type 1 or\n\n469\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.543\na type 2 hypervisor, all right.\n\n470\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.300\nBut you'll notice that I can\ncreate multiple switches, right?\n\n471\n00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.900\nAnd there's a few different kinds of\ncommunications, right, that you could do.\n\n472\n00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.851\nSo for instance, if I go back to our type\n\n473\n00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:45.061\n2 hypervisor in VMware Fusion.\n\n474\n00:25:45.061 --> 00:25:47.610\nThey all name it a little bit different,\nright?\n\n475\n00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.920\nSo notice,\nthis is Internet sharing with my Mac.\n\n476\n00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.620\nIf I do this, then this means that the Mac\ncan perform network address translation\n\n477\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.250\nfor me, all right?\n\n478\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.928\nAnd that means that I will sit behind the\nvisualized router in the VMware Fusion and\n\n479\n00:26:00.928 --> 00:26:06.038\nnetwork translation is gonna happen or,\nwe could do bridge networking.\n\n480\n00:26:06.038 --> 00:26:09.813\nAnd when we do bridge networking it says,\nlet this computer,\n\n481\n00:26:09.813 --> 00:26:13.454\nwhich by the way this Windows\nmachine is in a bridged state.\n\n482\n00:26:13.454 --> 00:26:17.006\nLet this computer talk to the physical\nnetwork just like it was in the other\n\n483\n00:26:17.006 --> 00:26:18.735\nphysical machine on your network.\n\n484\n00:26:18.735 --> 00:26:23.093\nAnd then the last one is custom, and\nthe custom once are where we can say, no,\n\n485\n00:26:23.093 --> 00:26:26.470\nI don't want network address translation.\n\n486\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.820\nI don't need to communicate with\nthe physical network through a net device.\n\n487\n00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.414\nSo let me go ahead and we'll just have a\nprivate communication between the virtual\n\n488\n00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:39.020\nmachines and the Mac that this is running\non, or let's go even further than that.\n\n489\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.482\nAnd then we'll just go ahead and\nsay you know what,\n\n490\n00:26:41.482 --> 00:26:44.059\nI'll uncheck this connect\nMac to the host network and\n\n491\n00:26:44.059 --> 00:26:47.530\nnow the virtual machines only\ncommunicate between themselves.\n\n492\n00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.604\nThey don't communicate with a Mac and they\ndon't communicate with a physical network.\n\n493\n00:26:50.604 --> 00:26:54.809\nAnd that's perfect for testing purposes\nincluding things when you're testing like,\n\n494\n00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:58.410\nI don't know, the ability to help\nan antivirus software to catch a virus.\n\n495\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.930\nYou certainly don't wanna\ninfect the network.\n\n496\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.480\nAnd what we've done, another benefit of\nthe virtualization, whether you're talking\n\n497\n00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.890\na virtual switch, a virtual network\nadapter, or NIC, as they say.\n\n498\n00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.410\nNetwork Interface Card,\nvirtual router, virtual machine,\n\n499\n00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.860\nwe've isolated that communication to\njust the virtualized environment.\n\n500\n00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.440\nPerfect for testing, right?\n\n501\n00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.230\nNow in Hyper-V,\nthey call it by some different things.\n\n502\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:24.048\nRight, they call it, what's known as\nan internal, an internal virtual switch.\n\n503\n00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:26.983\nThe internal virtual switch allows\nyou to communicate with the host, and\n\n504\n00:27:26.983 --> 00:27:28.606\nthe virtual machines, but that's it.\n\n505\n00:27:28.606 --> 00:27:31.276\nYou also have a private switch,\nthe private switch says,\n\n506\n00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:33.468\njust let the VMs communicate,\nand that's it.\n\n507\n00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:37.323\nAnd then you have an external switch which\nis what allows your virtual machines to\n\n508\n00:27:37.323 --> 00:27:40.725\nconnect to the physical network and\nbe seen just like they were any other\n\n509\n00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:43.180\nphysical device within your network,\nall right?\n\n510\n00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.030\nSo these are a little bit of\nthe components in virtualization.\n\n511\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.570\nNow I mentioned antivirus, right?\n\n512\n00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.346\nWell, you have to understand that\nsince these machines act and\n\n513\n00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:58.130\nessentially are no different than\na physical machine with the exception of\n\n514\n00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:02.080\nthe fact that they're running multiple\ninstances on a single physical device.\n\n515\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.937\nThey also have security things that\nwe need to worry about, all right?\n\n516\n00:28:05.937 --> 00:28:07.240\nAnd when we talk about security,\n\n517\n00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.000\nwe talk about things like\nvirtual firewalls, all right?\n\n518\n00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.550\nNow, this is kinda interesting because,\na firewall host-based firewall,\n\n519\n00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.100\nlet's say I've got a work station\nright here, nothing virtual,\n\n520\n00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.850\nwe could see it physically plug into it\nand I'm running the Windows firewall.\n\n521\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.900\nThat's a host-based firewall, right?\n\n522\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.716\nGuess what, it's a piece of software\nscreening the network adapters inbound/\n\n523\n00:28:27.716 --> 00:28:30.409\noutbound traffic in applying\nsome kind of action based on\n\n524\n00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:33.063\nthe rules that are associated\nwith the right security.\n\n525\n00:28:33.063 --> 00:28:34.970\nWell, guess what\nthe virtual firewall does?\n\n526\n00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.220\nThe virtual firewall is just\na software-based firewall that runs\n\n527\n00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.980\nin the virtual machine and screens\nthe communications that we actually\n\n528\n00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.980\nhave right now going in and\nout of the virtualized network adapter.\n\n529\n00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.660\nRight, and I can show you one of those.\n\n530\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.020\nIf we get a virtual firewall,\nin this case,\n\n531\n00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.300\nit looks like to you it's no\ndifferent than any other firewall.\n\n532\n00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.764\nRight, so if I typed wf.msc,\nI'm gonna bring in the Windows Firewall in\n\n533\n00:29:00.764 --> 00:29:05.372\nthe virtual machine, here with event\nsecurity Windows Firewall with event\n\n534\n00:29:05.372 --> 00:29:08.325\nsecurity in,\nnow I've got a virtual firewall.\n\n535\n00:29:08.325 --> 00:29:11.037\nNow this is no different than\nthe Windows Firewall that would be running\n\n536\n00:29:11.037 --> 00:29:11.588\non a desktop.\n\n537\n00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:13.934\nThe difference is,\nit's running in the virtual machine and\n\n538\n00:29:13.934 --> 00:29:16.234\nit's only screening the information\nthat's coming to and\n\n539\n00:29:16.234 --> 00:29:19.495\nfrom the virtual network adapter\nthat it is running inside of.\n\n540\n00:29:19.495 --> 00:29:22.655\nAll right, so those are some of the\ncomponents that you need to be aware of\n\n541\n00:29:22.655 --> 00:29:25.270\nwhen it comes to virtual networking.\n\n542\n00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:28.680\nBut we've got more to go,\nwe don't have enough time.\n\n543\n00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.840\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Wes.\n\n544\n00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.920\nIn fact, I didn't say a word because\nI was absolutely mesmerized by what\n\n545\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.740\nyou were saying.\n\n546\n00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.250\nVirtualization in network storage part two\ncoming your way, this has been part one.\n\n547\n00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.845\nMake sure that you watch everything\nin the CompTIA net+ series,\n\n548\n00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:40.855\nWes does a wonderful job.\n\n549\n00:29:40.855 --> 00:29:42.495\nAnd while you're in the course library,\n\n550\n00:29:42.495 --> 00:29:45.945\nhundreds of videos all designed\nto you help you go further.\n\n551\n00:29:45.945 --> 00:29:49.115\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be very glad you did.\n\n552\n00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:50.435\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n553\n00:29:50.435 --> 00:29:51.195\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n554\n00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:52.081\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n555\n00:29:53.706 --> 00:29:59.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n556\n00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:02.799\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:11.889\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.186\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:16.430\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.810\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we continue\non with CompTIA Net+ Virtualization and\n\n7\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.980\nNetwork Storage Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.089\nThere was a Part 1,\nhopefully you saw that.\n\n9\n00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.204\nAnd the one and only IT expert Wes Bryan\nbrought us that information, and\n\n10\n00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:30.130\nhe's gonna give us even more\ninformation right now, aren't you?\n\n11\n00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Zach,\nthanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.166\nThat's right we talked about, well, all\nabout virtualization in the first part.\n\n13\n00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.928\nAnd, well, we probably could have\njust named that one virtualization,\n\n14\n00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.840\ncuz I didn't get to the network\nstorage side of things and\n\n15\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.040\nthat is what we're gonna talk about here.\n\n16\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.486\nNow Zach, you'd asked me before we started\nthis episode, hey, a little recap?\n\n17\n00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.938\nAnd you know what I said, no, we don't\nneed a recap, but now I'm gonna do\n\n18\n00:00:51.938 --> 00:00:55.361\na double reversal on you, I'm gonna\nkeep this poor guy wondering here.\n\n19\n00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:57.351\nBut we'll go ahead and\njust do a little recap here,\n\n20\n00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.150\nremember we looked at some of\nthe virtualized networking components.\n\n21\n00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.318\nAnd even kinda set the stage for why we\nwould use those networking components,\n\n22\n00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:05.199\ntalking about things\nlike virtual machines.\n\n23\n00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.903\nWe talked about virtual machines,\nhypervisors, virtual switches, routers,\n\n24\n00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.890\nnetwork adapters and firewalls.\n\n25\n00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.257\nSo if those are a little foreign to you,\ngo back like Zach said, watch that Part 1.\n\n26\n00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:18.809\nAnd then come back here and\njoin us in Part 2,\n\n27\n00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.110\nbecause in this episode it's\nall about network storage.\n\n28\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.239\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, there's various or\n\n29\n00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:25.900\nthere's different network types,\nnetwork storage types?\n\n30\n00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, there is,\n\n31\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.700\nnow one of the most basic ones that they\ncall out, and it's always interesting.\n\n32\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.933\nYou look at the acronyms, and it's almost\nlike they reverse each other, right?\n\n33\n00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:41.310\nSo we got a NAS or a NAS device, N-A-S,\nand then we have a SAN, which is S-A-N.\n\n34\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.202\nSo here we go got,\nit looks like the letters are reversed, so\n\n35\n00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:46.151\nwhat is the difference between the two?\n\n36\n00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:50.827\nWell the SAN is actually fairly complex,\nso I'm gonna start with the NAS device.\n\n37\n00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:55.150\nNAS, NOS, I've heard it called everything,\nif you listen to R&amp;B and\n\n38\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.290\nhip-hop, you might say NOS,\nand NAS I've heard it as well.\n\n39\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.195\nBut either way it's N-A-S and it stands\nfor Network Attached Storage, all right?\n\n40\n00:02:04.195 --> 00:02:08.050\nNow network attached storage\nisn't really too complex,\n\n41\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.980\nit doesn't necessarily lend itself\nto high speed or high performance,\n\n42\n00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.000\nif you will, high performance computing.\n\n43\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.865\nEssentially it's nothing more\nthan a glorified file server,\n\n44\n00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.560\nstorage server, if you will.\n\n45\n00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.019\nWhat you have is you have a device that\nhas multiple drive bays in it, so we can\n\n46\n00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.772\nput our hard drives in there, it could be\nsolid state drives as well, depending.\n\n47\n00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.360\nAnd I guess that would increase\nthe storage performance, right?\n\n48\n00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.175\nBut that's essentially all it is,\n\n49\n00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:37.682\nit's got a very small slim line\noperating system that runs on it, and\n\n50\n00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:41.688\nit coordinates the communication,\ntypically a high speed network adapter.\n\n51\n00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:46.531\nAnd that's really all it does, it's just\nanother device that sits like any other\n\n52\n00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:49.070\nTCP/IP based node on your network.\n\n53\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.250\nAnd you can access the shared storage\nmedium over the network, right?\n\n54\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.100\nThat's a network attached storage device,\nall right?\n\n55\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.812\nWhen you purchase one of these, you can\npurchase them for a few hundred dollars.\n\n56\n00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:04.910\nThey don't really cost all that much.\n\n57\n00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.210\nNow they can, just like anything that you\nbuy, it can get very, very expensive.\n\n58\n00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.343\nIt can be relatively cheap depending\non how much money you wanna spend.\n\n59\n00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:18.349\nIn fact, let's go ahead, and again, I've\nstole Zach's credit card one more time.\n\n60\n00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.739\nWe're gonna go out here to Newegg here.\n\n61\n00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.208\n&gt;&gt; Wait a minute, you did?\n\n62\n00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:24.704\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go out to Newegg,\nand we're gonna just go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:25.880\nput NAS right there.\n\n64\n00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.353\nSo desktop NAS, there's also rack mounts,\nthat means if you're in the server\n\n65\n00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:33.374\nclosets, but\nthe concept is still the same, right?\n\n66\n00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:34.280\nWhat do we have?\n\n67\n00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.470\nWe've got a storage component,\nand here's one, QNAP.\n\n68\n00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.790\nIn fact, we've got QNAPs and\nwe've had QNAPs on our own networks here.\n\n69\n00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.475\nBut I want you to kinda see\nthat if we look here, well,\n\n70\n00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:43.926\nlook at what we got, right?\n\n71\n00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:46.440\nWe've got some drive bays, right?\n\n72\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.403\nAnd I like these, they've got the keys to\nlock them down and kinda keep them secure,\n\n73\n00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:51.120\nbut you have a series of drive bays.\n\n74\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.998\nYou fill it up with your hard drives and\nwhatever the capacity might be.\n\n75\n00:03:55.998 --> 00:03:59.540\nAt $900 dollars, so\nthis one's fairly expensive.\n\n76\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.299\nAnd you can see that it's got\nsome small components in it.\n\n77\n00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.940\nIt's got a dual core processor,\n4-Bay, it's an Intel i3.\n\n78\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.100\nSo not bad,\nit does 4000K video playback, right?\n\n79\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.132\nIt's got some memory in it,\nnothing really crazy.\n\n80\n00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:15.079\nThis one's actually a little bit\nbetter because, if you'll notice,\n\n81\n00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:16.909\nthis actually supports a 10 gig network.\n\n82\n00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.761\nSo I say it's not really high speed,\nI guess I put my foot in my mouth on that\n\n83\n00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:21.360\none, because-\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty good.\n\n84\n00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.262\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely Zach.\n\n85\n00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.042\nSo they're definitely coming\nup in the performance, right?\n\n86\n00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:30.867\nHowever, the next one that w're gonna talk\nabout is something known as a storage area\n\n87\n00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:31.680\nnetwork.\n\n88\n00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.808\nAnd that's separate than what we see here,\nall right?\n\n89\n00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:37.669\nWhen we get into a storage area network,\nwe're talking about\n\n90\n00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.220\na component that you use and the drives\ncan be located all over the place.\n\n91\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.070\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nget away from spending Zach's money.\n\n92\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.500\nKinda talk about the components\nthat you see inside of a SAN.\n\n93\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.126\nA SAN, again, is a drive array,\nit's the same kind of drive array, right?\n\n94\n00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:59.158\nBut typically when you connect to it,\nyou don't necessarily connect to it.\n\n95\n00:04:59.158 --> 00:05:01.875\nThere's exceptions,\nwe're gonna talk about connections,\n\n96\n00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.576\nwe're not out of the woods on that one.\n\n97\n00:05:03.576 --> 00:05:06.980\nBut you typically don't connect to\nit over things like a traditional\n\n98\n00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.030\nIP based network, or\neven over traditional ethernet.\n\n99\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.846\nThere's exceptions to the rules, I know\nsome of you out there are probably saying,\n\n100\n00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.407\nwell, wait a second,\nI know some protocols.\n\n101\n00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:17.209\nWe'll get back to those,\nall right, and why is that?\n\n102\n00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:19.822\nWell, because if you're\nusing a SAN device,\n\n103\n00:05:19.822 --> 00:05:24.648\nyou typically are gonna spend on a cheap\nscale 70, $80,000 for a cheap one,\n\n104\n00:05:24.648 --> 00:05:29.120\n$50,000 maybe,\nmaybe if it get's a little cheaper, right?\n\n105\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.790\nAnd you could spend hundreds\nof thousands of dollars.\n\n106\n00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.990\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back to the NAS [LAUGH].\n\n107\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n108\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.338\nAnd so we don't wanna spend Zach's money.\n\n109\n00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:37.169\nZach's like, no man,\nI'm taking my credit card back.\n\n110\n00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.170\nBut these are very expensive right?\n\n111\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.500\nBut the other thing about a storage are\nnetwork is you're typically connecting to\n\n112\n00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.420\nit over high speed fiber\noptic communications,\n\n113\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.940\nsomething known as fiber channel.\n\n114\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.358\nAnd that's kind of what we've got,\n\n115\n00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:50.568\nsome of the components that\nare mentioned here, right?\n\n116\n00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:54.515\nFiber channel uses what's known\nas a switched fabric, right?\n\n117\n00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:57.204\nAnd we talked about fiber\nchannel in other episodes, but\n\n118\n00:05:57.204 --> 00:06:00.689\nsince we're talking about network storage,\nwe'll kind of recap that.\n\n119\n00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:04.465\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nthe components that are in fiber channel.\n\n120\n00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.693\nWe have what are known as\nhost bus adapters, and\n\n121\n00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:11.175\na host bus adapter is kinda\nlike a network adapter.\n\n122\n00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.345\nIt's essentially like a network adapter or\n\n123\n00:06:13.345 --> 00:06:16.430\na network interface controller in\nethernet based networks, right?\n\n124\n00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.338\nThe difference is, you're gonna\nconnect to fiber channel fiber optic\n\n125\n00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:24.298\ncable to the HBA, or the host bus adapter.\n\n126\n00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:27.167\nAnd then it connects through\nthat fiber optic communication,\n\n127\n00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.830\nto a fiber channel switch,\nand these could be redundant.\n\n128\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.264\nAnd a lot of times they are redundant,\ncuz we are talking\n\n129\n00:06:33.264 --> 00:06:38.176\ntens of thousands of dollars in cost for\nthe fiber cables, the fiber switches.\n\n130\n00:06:38.176 --> 00:06:41.233\nAnd usually what you do is you\nimplement more than one, so\n\n131\n00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:45.769\nthat you have high speed access, you have\nredundancy and fault tolerance, right?\n\n132\n00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:47.624\nIn other episodes we talk\nabout fault tolerance and\n\n133\n00:06:47.624 --> 00:06:48.968\nredundancy though load balancers.\n\n134\n00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:50.680\nOne goes down,\nthe other one's still there.\n\n135\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.980\nWell, you can do the same thing\nwith the fiber channel switches.\n\n136\n00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.140\nAnd then they connect,\nin turn, into the SAN right?\n\n137\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.215\nAnd again, in large arrays,\nusually very, very expensive drives,\n\n138\n00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:06.790\nhigh RPM drive, even solid state today,\nbut very high RPM drives right?\n\n139\n00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.559\nIn the NAS, I can put things like SATA\ndrives in there, and even at 4 terabytes\n\n140\n00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:16.709\nin just a single drive, you're only\ntalking about $100, $200 per drive.\n\n141\n00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:19.320\nThese SAS drives, serial attached SCSI,\n\n142\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.505\nthese type of drives they can be $1,500,\nso they're very, very expensive.\n\n143\n00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:27.190\nThey're for very, very fast reads and\n\n144\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.690\nwrite performance over\nfiber optic communication.\n\n145\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.219\nThat's a storage area network, all right?\n\n146\n00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:36.017\nNow since we're mentioning fiber channel,\nright?\n\n147\n00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:40.500\nThat's not the only way you connect\nto a storage area network, right?\n\n148\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.400\nI said there are exceptions to the rule,\nbecause fiber channel, well,\n\n149\n00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.590\nwe'll stick with fiber channel for\na little bit more.\n\n150\n00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.619\nCuz I wanna talk about some of the\ncomponents that you might see on the exam.\n\n151\n00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:53.245\nI'm not sure if you will, but you might,\nso let's be aware of them, right?\n\n152\n00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:58.039\nIn network adapters,\nin an ethernet based network, we use what?\n\n153\n00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:02.275\nWe use MAC addresses and then MAC\naddresses identify That computer uniquely,\n\n154\n00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:06.560\nand I know it's the network adapter,\nbut it's in the computer, right?\n\n155\n00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.020\nUniquely identify that\nnode on the network.\n\n156\n00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.490\nWell, HBAs use a little bit\ndifferent convention, but\n\n157\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.910\nthe theory's the same, right.\n\n158\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.430\nWe're gonna uniquely identify a fibre\nchannel endpoint within the switch fabric.\n\n159\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.730\nAnd what we do for\n\n160\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.940\nthat is use what's known as\na World Wide Node Name, right, a WWNN.\n\n161\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.640\nThis falls under a more\numbrella term they call a WWN.\n\n162\n00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.770\nIt's not the next latest and\ngreatest wrestling organization.\n\n163\n00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.610\nIt's World Wide Name, right.\n\n164\n00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.460\nIt's a unique identifier.\n\n165\n00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.070\nIt's what we uniquely identify devices or\nentities within the network.\n\n166\n00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.710\nAnd under that, one of the ways we do\nthis in fibre channels specifically,\n\n167\n00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.110\nis with World Wide Node Names, right?\n\n168\n00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.540\nIt identifies the end point, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.980\nNow, we have to identify the ports, right,\n\n170\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.280\nthat the end point is\nmaking a connection to.\n\n171\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.408\nAnd that's where something\nknown as a WWPN comes in.\n\n172\n00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:03.950\nGuys, world wide is the same,\nbut now instead of node name,\n\n173\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.465\nwe're saying port name.\n\n174\n00:09:05.465 --> 00:09:10.030\nAll right, and if I make a connection\nvia an HBA, I've got a port, and\n\n175\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.120\nyou could actually just say, for instance,\nyou could have, you could say this is\n\n176\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.345\non both sides, a port number for\nthe HBA and on the switch itself.\n\n177\n00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:21.080\nAll right, so the World Wide Port Number\n\n178\n00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.820\nuniquely identifies the port that's\nassociated with that switch.\n\n179\n00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.470\nAnd you could say each HBA\nhas its own port number.\n\n180\n00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.970\nNow I will tell you something\nthat can change here.\n\n181\n00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.960\nAnd let's go ahead, I'm gonna modify my\nslide on the fly, cuz that never fails,\n\n182\n00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.515\nright, Zach?\n\n183\n00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:38.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Zach is going, god, here we go.\n\n184\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:43.000\nSo let's say that I take this HBA and\nwe've got a multi-homed,\n\n185\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.520\njust like network adapters, right,\nwe've got a multi-homed end point.\n\n186\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.360\nIn this case it's a server\nattached to the SAN.\n\n187\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:57.490\nWell, guess what, now that I've got two\nHBAs I now have two unique WWPNs, right.\n\n188\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.060\nHBA1, it has World Wide Port Number\nthat it's connected to.\n\n189\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.179\nHBA2, the second host bus\nadapter has WWPN2, right.\n\n190\n00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:11.718\nAnd again, you could rightfully just kinda\ndouble these up cuz the connection is from\n\n191\n00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:15.230\nthe host bus adapter to\nthe port on the switch, right.\n\n192\n00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.270\nBut notice what didn't change,\nthe World Wide Node Name.\n\n193\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.972\nThe end point is still identified\nas an endpoint but I could have,\n\n194\n00:10:21.972 --> 00:10:26.772\nand sometimes you do, a lot of times with\nredundancy I might do something like this.\n\n195\n00:10:26.772 --> 00:10:31.438\nWhere maybe I have a completely\nseparate switch and for\n\n196\n00:10:31.438 --> 00:10:34.989\nhigh availability and fault tolerance,\n\n197\n00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:39.872\nwhat we end up having is we\nhave one HBA that is connected.\n\n198\n00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:43.460\nOop, see, like I said, and\nthis is why you should never-\n\n199\n00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.078\n&gt;&gt; Do it on the fly.\n\n200\n00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.809\n&gt;&gt; Do it on the fly, but\nthat's okay, that's okay.\n\n201\n00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:49.506\nWe're gonna deal with it and\nI'm gonna make it work here, all right.\n\n202\n00:10:49.506 --> 00:10:55.390\nSo now what I end up having is\nI've got redundancy here, right?\n\n203\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.140\nSo I've got two fibre switches and\nwe have additional redundancy so that\n\n204\n00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.850\nif I lose connection to one of the fibre\nswitches that has access, if you will,\n\n205\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.950\nto the SAN, then I have another question\nthat also has access to the SAN.\n\n206\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.878\nAnd, again, depending on your level\nof redundancy, this becomes more and\n\n207\n00:11:13.878 --> 00:11:15.033\nmore expensive.\n\n208\n00:11:15.033 --> 00:11:20.179\nAnd even just to start it is very, very\nexpensive to implement these, all right.\n\n209\n00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.463\nSo that is what fibre channel is, and\n\n210\n00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:26.635\nfibre channel offers very very\nhigh speed communications.\n\n211\n00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:29.875\nIn fact even some of the earlier\ncommunications you would see things like\n\n212\n00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:31.677\neight gigs and less.\n\n213\n00:11:31.677 --> 00:11:36.167\nBut 8 gigabyte transfer speed,\n\n214\n00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:40.677\n16, 32, 128 gig speeds over distances\nthat can run kilometers, right?\n\n215\n00:11:40.677 --> 00:11:44.799\nSo if you are a company that has\ndatabases that does tens of thousands\n\n216\n00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:48.705\nof transactions if not hundreds\nof thousands of transactions,\n\n217\n00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:53.509\nand you need quick access into the\nstorage, you're gonna use fiber channel.\n\n218\n00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:56.875\nBut, see, the one thing to keep in mind,\nit has a benefit, right?\n\n219\n00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:58.230\nFibre channel has a benefit.\n\n220\n00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.841\nIt is extremely fast, right.\n\n221\n00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:04.911\nStorage area networks,\nthey're extremely scalable.\n\n222\n00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:09.659\nI don't have to have just one SAN,\nI can have two storage area networks and\n\n223\n00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:12.354\nwe can have the fabric split up even more.\n\n224\n00:12:12.354 --> 00:12:14.271\nBut again, that's a lot of cost.\n\n225\n00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:16.887\nWe'd get to hundreds of thousands\nof dollars really really quick.\n\n226\n00:12:16.887 --> 00:12:19.430\n&gt;&gt; So, you'd be seeing this in\na larger enterprise enviroment, right?\n\n227\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to give you an example,\n\n228\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.880\none of the other host that work here,\nhe use to work for a bank out in Seattle.\n\n229\n00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.434\nAnd they had, I think they had a couple\nof them, one was like 70,000 one that\n\n230\n00:12:29.434 --> 00:12:33.666\nwas like $120,000 fibre channel\nswitch network, SAN if you will.\n\n231\n00:12:33.666 --> 00:12:38.920\nAnd think about it they're doing things\nlike EFTs, electronic fund transfers.\n\n232\n00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.650\nYou need them there in\nseconds if not milliseconds.\n\n233\n00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.314\nYou're doing stock, right,\nwhere seconds count,\n\n234\n00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:49.620\nwith stocks and bonds and stuff like that,\nyou need fast, fast storage.\n\n235\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.890\nYou're doing insurance claims and\nstuff like that,\n\n236\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.510\nin an insurance organization a lot of\ntimes like banking information and\n\n237\n00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.210\nstuff like that,\nyou need fast communication.\n\n238\n00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.970\nThey're the ones that can justify\nthe cost because they need the speed.\n\n239\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.350\nHowever, there are other ways that you\ncan take benefits of using SAN and\n\n240\n00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.950\nthere's benefits and drawbacks, right?\n\n241\n00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.940\nThe other ones that we're gonna talk\nabout here except for InfiniBand,\n\n242\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.890\nwe'll come back to because it's another\none that's equal to fibre channel and\n\n243\n00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.000\nreally really fast as well.\n\n244\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.110\nBut there are other ways\nthat you can connect.\n\n245\n00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.960\nAnd I don't really have any diagrams, but\njust understand that these are other ways\n\n246\n00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.140\nthat you can connect to the storage area\nnetworks and use existing infrastructure.\n\n247\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:33.516\nAll right, one of them is FCOE,\nfibre channel over Ethernet, all right.\n\n248\n00:13:33.516 --> 00:13:36.808\nNow, first benefit,\ngoing out the gate, a lot cheaper.\n\n249\n00:13:36.808 --> 00:13:39.593\nA lot cheaper, all right.\n\n250\n00:13:39.593 --> 00:13:42.960\nFirst drawback, going out the gate,\na lot slower as well, right.\n\n251\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.680\nWe're not getting the speeds but\nI typically have because\n\n252\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.970\nEthernet is the most popular local area\nnetwork implementation that we have today.\n\n253\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.570\nChances are, very good chance, I'm gonna\nhave an Ethernet network inside of my\n\n254\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.070\nlocal area network, regardless of\nthe size of my business, right?\n\n255\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.010\nSo I can take and I can leverage\nthe existing infrastructure.\n\n256\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.546\nUsing Ethernet networks,\nbasically while still preserving,\n\n257\n00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:13.260\nif you will, the underlying fibre\nchannel protocol, all right.\n\n258\n00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.345\nAnd again, it allows for\nthings like IP networks and\n\n259\n00:14:16.345 --> 00:14:22.060\nSAN traffic all to be consolidated,\nif you will, into a single network.\n\n260\n00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.120\nSaves me money.\n\n261\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.500\nI've got existing networks,\nlet's use them, right?\n\n262\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.870\nThere's benefits of an FCOE and\n\n263\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.640\nagain FCOE just in case you\ndidn't know what the acronym is.\n\n264\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.860\nRecognize it on the exam.\n\n265\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.130\nThere's benefits, right?\n\n266\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.020\nReduces the amount of network interface\ncards that we need to connect to an AP\n\n267\n00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.560\nnetwork and a storage area network.\n\n268\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.240\nAll right, if I wanted to connected\nto a storage area network and\n\n269\n00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.430\nan IP network basically\non the same machine,\n\n270\n00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.680\nI'd have to have a network interface\ncard and I'd have a host bus adapter.\n\n271\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.460\nIf I have FCOE, I'm using my existing\nEthernet network interface cards and\n\n272\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.400\nI can connect to both, right?\n\n273\n00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.655\nCable and switch reduction.\n\n274\n00:15:00.655 --> 00:15:03.090\nI've already got Ethernet-based switches.\n\n275\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.395\nI can reduce the amount of\nswitches on my network.\n\n276\n00:15:05.395 --> 00:15:07.900\nSo this is all about cost,\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n277\n00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.480\nIt's the only reason you're gonna do it.\n\n278\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.200\nWhen it comes down to it,\nit doesn't even hold a candle,\n\n279\n00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.910\nif you will, to the speeds that\nyou get out of fibre channel.\n\n280\n00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.520\nAll right, the other thing too is you get\na power and cooling cost reduction, right,\n\n281\n00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.170\nif you're thinking about going green.\n\n282\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.770\nThe biggest drawback is\nthat it's going to be slow.\n\n283\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.720\nNow that isn't the only thing\nthat'll allow you to connect\n\n284\n00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.230\nto storage area networks when\nit comes to connection types.\n\n285\n00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.660\nAll right, we've got fibre channel,\n\n286\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.300\nthat's its native communication\nattached to a storage area network.\n\n287\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.342\nWe've talked about FCLE,\nthe fiber channel over Ethernet.\n\n288\n00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.420\nWell, there's also one that's has\nbeen around for a while too, and\n\n289\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.320\nthat's called iSCSI.\n\n290\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.180\nNow, what is iSCSI?\n\n291\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.849\nThat acronym it's short for,\nInternet small computer systems interface.\n\n292\n00:15:53.849 --> 00:15:57.743\nThose of you that are coming over from\nA+ probably heard of SCSI before, right?\n\n293\n00:15:57.743 --> 00:16:00.304\nWe use serial attached SCSI-based devices.\n\n294\n00:16:00.304 --> 00:16:04.676\nWell, here's another thing,\nIf I have ethernet based networks,\n\n295\n00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:09.588\nthe most prevalent and common protocol\nsuite that we use to communicate long\n\n296\n00:16:09.588 --> 00:16:13.807\ndistances over the network,\nwhether it be LAN communications,\n\n297\n00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:17.456\nWAN communications, or\nboth are TCPI based networks.\n\n298\n00:16:17.456 --> 00:16:20.600\nSo what iSCSI allows you\nto do essentially is\n\n299\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.830\nto connect to storage arrays using\nyour existing IP based networks.\n\n300\n00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.920\nRight, it carries those\niSCSI commands that's\n\n301\n00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.710\nover a TCPIP based network again so we can\ncommunicate with the storage area network.\n\n302\n00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.900\nNow the architecture here just so\nyou're aware the iSCSI client right?\n\n303\n00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.900\nThe software that runs on your machine,\nthat's whats known as an initiator,\n\n304\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.017\nyou might hear it call\nthe iSCSI initiator.\n\n305\n00:16:44.017 --> 00:16:48.200\nIt's what's allows us to send commands\nacross the network, remember we said,\n\n306\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.350\nit allows us to encapsulate those iSCSI\ncommands over an IP based network.\n\n307\n00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.320\nWell, those commands are actually\ncalled CBD, if you will, or\n\n308\n00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.010\nCommand Descriptor Block,\nall right, CBDs if you will.\n\n309\n00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.810\nAll right, and the storage device\nthat you connect to through iSCSI\n\n310\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.410\nif the client is an initiator,\nwell, guess what?\n\n311\n00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.700\nThe storage arrays are called targets and\nthat's how we identify it.\n\n312\n00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.560\nSo remember your architecture for iSCSI,\n\n313\n00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.390\nyour iSCSI initiator is the iSCSI client\nthat allows you to connect to the storage.\n\n314\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.470\nThe storage is a target, it's iSCSI\ntarget you're pointing to that target.\n\n315\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.830\nAnd those commands those iSCSI commands\nthat are sent in between over iSCSI or\n\n316\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:29.840\nover the TCIP based network,\nthey are gonna be called CBDs, right, and\n\n317\n00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.335\nagain those are those\nCommand Descriptor Blocks, all right.\n\n318\n00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:37.980\nBenefits again, it allows for connection\nto storage arrays over the existing\n\n319\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.620\nLAN communications including long\ndistance WAN communications, right?\n\n320\n00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.590\nIt's a low cost alternative\nto Fibre Channel.\n\n321\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.900\nThe problem is it is not comparative\nto the performance of Fibre Channel.\n\n322\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:57.570\nIf you need the performance, you have to\ngo with all-out, straight Fibre Channel.\n\n323\n00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.070\nIf you don't have that, you wanna have the\nbenefits of connecting to a storage array\n\n324\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.580\nand you don't need the performance,\n\n325\n00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.490\nwhich if you're gonna spend the money\nyou really should need the performance.\n\n326\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.770\nThen you have a low-cost alternative to\nfibre channel, however very very slow.\n\n327\n00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.230\nAll right, so couple more topics\nthat we need to talk about here,\n\n328\n00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.620\nwe got a few more minutes in this episode.\n\n329\n00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.130\nThe next one I wanna talk about is\ncomparative to fibre channel, and\n\n330\n00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.130\nthat's something known as InfiniBand,\nall right?\n\n331\n00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.530\nI always wanna say infinity band but\n[LAUGH] InfiniBand.\n\n332\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.170\nIf InfiniBand is a different\nkind of protocol.\n\n333\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:33.890\nHowever the technologies, the\narchitectures pretty close to the same.\n\n334\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.730\nIt is a high performance\nnetworking communication, right?\n\n335\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.550\nIt is used where you need high\nthroughput and very low latency.\n\n336\n00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.770\nAnd that's the other thing\nthat I didn't mention.\n\n337\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.450\nYeah that could be the same thing that's\nsaid about fiber channel right very\n\n338\n00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.170\nhigh bandwidth, high throughput,\nI can get 128 gigs per second.\n\n339\n00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.320\nThat's pretty impressive,\nvery very low latency right?\n\n340\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.830\nHowever this is really used most commonly\nin things like interconnections for\n\n341\n00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.120\nsuper computers.\n\n342\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.760\nRight where we need that high speed,\n\n343\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.740\nyou've got high speed high\nperformance computing.\n\n344\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.210\nSo you see it doesn't have to stay\nthere but that's where it's used a lot.\n\n345\n00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.920\nIt also uses HBAs and it also uses\nswitches, again it's its own protocol,\n\n346\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.580\nso understand that it's comparative to\nfiber channel, it's not the same thing.\n\n347\n00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.020\nIt's very scalable just like\nfiber channel is as well.\n\n348\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.490\nAnd it uses switch upper topology\nagain just like fiber channel.\n\n349\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.920\nNow, there are a couple of different,\na few,\n\n350\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.320\nquite a few different rate\ntransmissions speeds and\n\n351\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.410\njust wanna mention a few of them briefly\njust in case they ask you on exam.\n\n352\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.890\nAnd again, we don't know what they're\ngonna ask you, so study, study,\n\n353\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.820\nstudy, right?\n\n354\n00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.790\nBut some of the things that\nas an example you'll see,\n\n355\n00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:48.470\nyou'll see terms that maybe you\nrecognize in memory standards,\n\n356\n00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.580\nSDR, Single Data Rate, DDR,\nDouble Data Rate, right?\n\n357\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.380\nNow the concepts are the same, right?\n\n358\n00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.970\nSingle Data Rate, Double Data Rate is\ndouble over the single rate, right?\n\n359\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.092\nSo we can see things like\nin the SDR you might see\n\n360\n00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:07.290\nInfiniBand SDR Single data rate and\nit's operating at five Gigs,\n\n361\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.380\nor 2.5 Gigs, excuse me, for\nits transfer speeds, all right?\n\n362\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.800\nDouble Data Rate, DDR, all right?\n\n363\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.700\nNow, those of you that\nare [INAUDIBLE] plus,\n\n364\n00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.730\nmay I add another one that\nyou can remember, DDR.\n\n365\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.845\nYou already know what double data\nrate is at the memory, right?\n\n366\n00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:23.820\nIt doubles it over STR and\nthat's one of the great thing.\n\n367\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.380\nNow, I know it's just the doubling over\nthe earlier one that we talked about\n\n368\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.200\nthat's five-gigabit speeds.\n\n369\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.360\nBut then they got quad, all right,\n\n370\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:35.370\nand I want you think quad as\nin quadruple the single rates.\n\n371\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.100\nZack help me out my math is so\nhorrible what is four times 2.5?\n\n372\n00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.400\n&gt;&gt; I belive that would be ten.\n\n373\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Ten gigs.\n\n374\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.940\nThat's right.\nWhat do we have for him, Johnny?\n\n375\n00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.190\nThat's right.\n\n376\n00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.185\n&gt;&gt; My card back.\n\n377\n00:20:46.185 --> 00:20:48.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] His card back before\nwe spend all this money.\n\n378\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.300\nThat's right.\n\n379\n00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.160\nYou'll see QDR.\n\n380\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.290\nIt's just Quad Data Rate.\n\n381\n00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.520\nIt's quad, quadruple,\nwhich you're single data rate is.\n\n382\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.970\nAgain, I'm trying to give you things that\nyou can make it a little bit easier for\n\n383\n00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.890\nyou to memorize as some of\nthis stuff on the exam.\n\n384\n00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.370\nIf you say QDR, Quad Data Rates, ten gigs.\n\n385\n00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.550\nNow here's another one, FDR.\n\n386\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.120\nNot Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\n387\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.100\nI know where you're going on that one,\nZach.\n\n388\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.990\nFDR, now I am gonna test you\non this one even though,\n\n389\n00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.810\nthis ones called Fourteen Data Rate.\n\n390\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.268\nWhat do you think the giga\nspeed of 14 data rate is?\n\n391\n00:21:25.268 --> 00:21:26.676\n&gt;&gt; 14.065.\n\n392\n00:21:26.676 --> 00:21:29.280\n&gt;&gt; How does he know the exact amount?\n\n393\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.280\n&gt;&gt; I am a computative machine.\n\n394\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n395\n00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:32.390\nHe cheated.\n\n396\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.003\nHe read the teachers answers.\n\n397\n00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:35.711\n[LAUGH] That's right but\n\n398\n00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:39.820\nI say that because in the name\nis the transmission speed.\n\n399\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.030\nNow we, and I want you to\nremember exactly what Zach said.\n\n400\n00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.860\nThe specifics,\njust like he said, the 14.0625,\n\n401\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.860\nbecause CompTIA likes their\nspecifications, right?\n\n402\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.510\nSo specifications, specific, right?\n\n403\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.868\nHowever if you can remember it on\nthe exam as a Fourteen Data Rate, FDR and\n\n404\n00:21:59.868 --> 00:22:03.170\nInfiniBand, I'll try to\nget it right eventually,\n\n405\n00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.718\nI always want to say it that way.\n\n406\n00:22:04.718 --> 00:22:09.650\nInfiniBand FDR Fourteen Data Rate,\nthen you know it's\n\n407\n00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.800\n14 gigabytes transfer speed and\nI don't know if they're gonna be so\n\n408\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.370\nspecific that they'll put two different\nanswers that have 14 something in them.\n\n409\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.050\nIf you can remember FDR's 14, you probably\ngonna be doing good for the exam, I don't\n\n410\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.750\nknow, but do know the specifics again\nbecause when we we get into our random\n\n411\n00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.880\ninfrastructure, and we start talking about\nthings like channelized services, right?\n\n412\n00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.500\nBut what is it?\n\n413\n00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.840\nThe data signal standards.\n\n414\n00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.470\nYou have to know the individual\nchannelized speeds.\n\n415\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.010\nI'm not sure on this one that you do or\ndon't, so\n\n416\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.330\nbe aware of it, right&gt; So\nthat's InfiniBand.\n\n417\n00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.160\nNow we talked a little bit about\nfiber channel over ethernet.\n\n418\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.170\nWe kind of mentioned with\nethernet communications and\n\n419\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.760\nstuff, but the last thing that we have to\ntalk about here real briefly is something\n\n420\n00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.750\nknown as a jumbo frame.\n\n421\n00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.990\nAnd the jumbo frame really is\nabout ethernet communications.\n\n422\n00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:03.760\nWith ethernet communications\nthere is what's known as, well,\n\n423\n00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.030\nmost networks have what's known as an MTU,\na Maximum Transmission Units.\n\n424\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:15.090\nIt says, this is exactly\nthe maximum that you can transmit,\n\n425\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.970\nno more no less, if you transmit any more,\n\n426\n00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.460\nthe device the connectivity\ndevice is gonna drop the frame.\n\n427\n00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.520\nAll right well what is ethernet's MTU?\n\n428\n00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.260\nIt's 1500 bytes.\n\n429\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.280\nNow there are a little padding there.\n\n430\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.080\nMost offer like Windows operating system\nsets the maximum transmission unit at\n\n431\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.220\n1500 bytes.\n\n432\n00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.026\nBut a lot of switches might have a little\nbit extra for things like the 802.1q or\n\n433\n00:23:39.026 --> 00:23:43.766\nthe VLAN assignment, the VLAN tagging unit\ncuz that adds a little bit more data but\n\n434\n00:23:43.766 --> 00:23:45.909\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n435\n00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:50.640\nKnow that ethernet maximum transmission\nunit is 1500 bytes which means that if all\n\n436\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.427\nyour storage device or\nyour connectivity device,\n\n437\n00:23:53.427 --> 00:23:57.896\nexcuse me are set to 1500 bytes, and\na computer through error, corruption,\n\n438\n00:23:57.896 --> 00:24:02.495\nor virus tries to send something down\nthat pathway, that's over 1500 bytes.\n\n439\n00:24:02.495 --> 00:24:04.838\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Switch looks at it, and discards it.\n\n440\n00:24:04.838 --> 00:24:05.726\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n441\n00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:08.261\nIs where jumbo frame comes in.\n\n442\n00:24:08.261 --> 00:24:13.299\nJumbo frames allows you to grow\n\n443\n00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:19.703\nthe frame size up to 9,000 bytes.\n\n444\n00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:22.380\nThat's why they call it a jumbo frame,\nall right.\n\n445\n00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.016\nNow there are some things to keep in mind.\n\n446\n00:24:24.016 --> 00:24:26.742\nIt can perform or, excuse me, I'm sorry,\n\n447\n00:24:26.742 --> 00:24:30.146\nit can improve your network performance,\nall right?\n\n448\n00:24:30.146 --> 00:24:32.050\nWhat are you doing?\n\n449\n00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.001\nPutting more data into a frame,\nright, more data,\n\n450\n00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:38.490\nI'm sending more information\nin a single frame.\n\n451\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.080\nSometimes you might say data packets,\nbut it's not packets.\n\n452\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.596\nRemember packets,\nare the PDU that happens at network,\n\n453\n00:24:45.596 --> 00:24:51.415\nthe protocol data unit that happens\nat the layer 3 of the OSI model.\n\n454\n00:24:51.415 --> 00:24:54.675\nRemember the data link layer,\nthe PDU or the protocol data unit,\n\n455\n00:24:54.675 --> 00:24:56.385\nis what's known as a frame.\n\n456\n00:24:56.385 --> 00:25:01.260\nSo this allows you to grow\nthe frame up to 9,000 bytes but\n\n457\n00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.560\nif your devices aren’t\nconfigured to support a PDU,\n\n458\n00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.440\nif you will, of 9,000 bytes.\n\n459\n00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.521\nWell, they're gonna inspect it, and\nthey're gonna say, no, what, 9,000,\n\n460\n00:25:11.521 --> 00:25:12.550\nwhat the heck is this stuff?\n\n461\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.450\nWe're set to 1,500, you know that,\nand discards it, right?\n\n462\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.990\nSo you have to make sure that your\nconnectivity devices are setup, or\n\n463\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.590\nthat could be a problem, right?\n\n464\n00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.050\nThe good thing about putting\nmore data into the frame and\n\n465\n00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.810\nwhere it could improve your performance,\nis the fact that the CPU\n\n466\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.600\non the connectivity devices don't have\nto process as many frames, right?\n\n467\n00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.110\nBecause we use stored forward technology,\n\n468\n00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.730\nthat's one of the most common\nswitching types today.\n\n469\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:45.280\nAnd store means I receive the entire\nframe, I calculate the CS at the end,\n\n470\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.330\nthe frame checks some sequence,\nverifying that the frame is intact and\n\n471\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:55.620\nit hasn't been corrupted in any way and\nthen I forward it on to the destination.\n\n472\n00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.480\nIf we find a corruption, we discard it,\nwe recall the frame back, right?\n\n473\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.120\nIt's part of what that data link layer is\ndoing, flow control and error detection.\n\n474\n00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.090\nNow, if I have to do that on 1,500 bytes,\nI'm gonna do a lot more than checking that\n\n475\n00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:16.400\nframe checksum sequence\non a 9,000 byte frame.\n\n476\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.941\nSo it means that your CPUs have\nless frames to process, all right?\n\n477\n00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.000\nHere is where it comes to a problem.\n\n478\n00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.700\nOne of the things about\nchecking frames more often,\n\n479\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.810\nis that you can detect errors quicker,\nright?\n\n480\n00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.282\nSo, if I think about it,\n1,500, 1,500 is 3, right?\n\n481\n00:26:36.282 --> 00:26:36.827\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n482\n00:26:36.827 --> 00:26:37.651\n&gt;&gt; So, what is that?\n\n483\n00:26:37.651 --> 00:26:43.886\nSo, two, that would be nine, that would be\nthree times, I have to check that frame.\n\n484\n00:26:43.886 --> 00:26:46.057\nLet me make sure I get that,\none, two, three.\n\n485\n00:26:46.057 --> 00:26:50.629\nYeah, I'd have to check those\nframes like nine times,\n\n486\n00:26:50.629 --> 00:26:53.270\nmy math is probably bad on that.\n\n487\n00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.330\nBut I'm having to calculate the frame\nchecksum sequence more often, all right.\n\n488\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.835\nYes, it puts a burden on the CPU, but\nit means that I'm only having to discard\n\n489\n00:27:02.835 --> 00:27:07.100\n1,500 bytes of data if I do find\na problem with the information.\n\n490\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:13.170\nYes, in a 9,000 byte jumbo frame,\nI have to check and\n\n491\n00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:18.970\nprocess less frames, but it means what\nhappens if the calculation is wrong or\n\n492\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.830\nwe calculate it and\nthere's an error in 9,000 bytes?\n\n493\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.600\nWe have to discard the entire 9000 bytes.\n\n494\n00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.939\nSo that means that your packet loss, or\nframe loss, ratio rate could increase too.\n\n495\n00:27:31.939 --> 00:27:34.200\nSo that is one thing to keep in mind.\n\n496\n00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.919\nYes, you have to process less frames,\nright, but\n\n497\n00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:40.966\nit also means you have the potential for\ndamage to be there so you have to throw\n\n498\n00:27:40.966 --> 00:27:44.787\nmore data away when one of the frames\nis discarded and we have to recall.\n\n499\n00:27:44.787 --> 00:27:49.171\nSo while it can have a benefit,\njust like anything else in life,\n\n500\n00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:55.530\nnetworking in general, is that it also can\npotentially have its drawbacks as well.\n\n501\n00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:56.950\nSo do keep that in mind.\n\n502\n00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.695\nAnd those are little bit about\nthe storage network technologies,\n\n503\n00:27:59.695 --> 00:28:01.910\nnetwork storage technologies\nthat we have to know.\n\n504\n00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.930\nKnow some of the specifications here,\nknow some of the components so\n\n505\n00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.720\nthat if they ask you on the Network Plus\nexam, not only are you gonna get it right,\n\n506\n00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.780\nbut you're gonna knock\nit out of the ballpark.\n\n507\n00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.370\n&gt;&gt; Because of Wes, I'm telling you.\n\n508\n00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.250\nVirtualization and Network Storage Part 2,\nthere is also a part one,\n\n509\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.740\nmake sure you see those both parts one and\npart two.\n\n510\n00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.435\nAnd by the way, see everything in\nthe CompTIA Plus series that Wes\n\n511\n00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:24.785\nhas put together for you and\nour great course library.\n\n512\n00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:26.175\nThere's hundreds of videos there and\n\n513\n00:28:26.175 --> 00:28:29.845\nthey're all designed to help you\ngo further, check those out too.\n\n514\n00:28:29.845 --> 00:28:32.935\nAnd tell everyone you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be very glad you did.\n\n515\n00:28:32.935 -->

certification.\n\n15\n00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.924\nAnd like Zach said,\nwe're going to be looking at,\n\n16\n00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.377\nwell the other side of our networks we've\nbeen focusing on the Lan facing side,\n\n17\n00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.716\ntalking about all the LAN technologies.\n\n18\n00:00:46.716 --> 00:00:50.772\nBut what we haven't talked about\nis the side of the network that,\n\n19\n00:00:50.772 --> 00:00:54.017\nunless you work for\na service provider, you work for\n\n20\n00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:58.776\nISP, Telco or telecommunications company,\na lot of times you don't see.\n\n21\n00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:01.307\nBut it is going to be important\nof the net plus exam, so\n\n22\n00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:04.142\nwe have to understand what some\nof these technologies are.\n\n23\n00:01:04.142 --> 00:01:06.415\nAnd just like anything else that\nwe've been talking about or\n\n24\n00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.224\neverything else I should say,\nthat we've been talking about through this\n\n25\n00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:11.697\nnet plus journey, there's going\nto be a lot of specifications.\n\n26\n00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:16.039\nAll right, we're going to start learning\nabout channelized services, and\n\n27\n00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.710\nwhen we talk about our\nLAN based technologies,\n\n28\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.479\na lot of times we don't talk about\nchannelized services, right?\n\n29\n00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.226\nWe talk about things like\ngigabit Ethernet, right?\n\n30\n00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:28.384\nWe talk about 10 gig Ethernet or\nin some of the older networks,\n\n31\n00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:32.621\nwhich we really don't use much today but\n10 meg, 100 megs.\n\n32\n00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.038\nBut now we're gonna talk\nabout on the ISP side,\n\n33\n00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:40.398\nhow they actually divide up\nthe bandwidth that they have, so\n\n34\n00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:45.015\nthat multiple customers can\nutilize the transmission media and\n\n35\n00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:48.454\nthe networks and\ntechnologies that they have.\n\n36\n00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:51.214\nSo, we're going to start\nright here by talking\n\n37\n00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:55.354\nabout some of the different service\ntypes that you can see out there when\n\n38\n00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:58.738\nwe talk about the WAN side of\nour network communications.\n\n39\n00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:03.682\nNow, we have to understand that a lot\nof the technologies that we're going\n\n40\n00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:08.705\nto talk about really fall under what\nis known as a Digital Signal Hierarchy,\n\n41\n00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.076\nis what it's called, a DS system.\n\n42\n00:02:11.076 --> 00:02:16.505\nAnd the Digital Signal Hierarchy, if you\nwill, is basically just a set of service\n\n43\n00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:21.716\nlevels and according to the different\nlevels will denote how much bandwidth.\n\n44\n00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:25.362\nAnd we have different technologies that\nallows us to hit these different service\n\n45\n00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:27.567\nlevels, and\nin fact let me show what I mean here.\n\n46\n00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:31.235\nIn fact, we have here on my screen,\nwe have what's known as,\n\n47\n00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:35.204\na lot of times you'll see this\njust called digital signal levels.\n\n48\n00:02:35.204 --> 00:02:39.669\nYou might see digital signal transmission\nrates but it really falls under this,\n\n49\n00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.016\nhere in North America at least,\nunder what's known as DSH,\n\n50\n00:02:43.016 --> 00:02:44.806\nthe Digital Signal Hierarchy.\n\n51\n00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:47.853\nAnd there's a whole bunch of\nthese levels of services, right?\n\n52\n00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:52.608\nAnd they standardize these levels and they\nsay, hey, if you wanna provide this level,\n\n53\n00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:56.607\nwhatever technology you implement\nmust adhere to these service levels.\n\n54\n00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:59.859\nAll right, so there are a few\nthat I want you to be aware of.\n\n55\n00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.114\nAnd the ones that really are going to\naffect your understanding of some of\n\n56\n00:03:04.114 --> 00:03:07.601\nthe other technologies,\nas we move into things like ISDN,\n\n57\n00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.505\nthat are heavily channelized.\n\n58\n00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:11.777\nAll right, so you are going to know,\nhave to know.\n\n59\n00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:17.021\nNow, if we can look at the list here,\nthere are several out there and\n\n60\n00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.981\nin fact this I need to fix\nthis here real quick here.\n\n61\n00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.385\nWhat you end up having here is DS0,\n\n62\n00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:29.046\nDS0 is the first transmission\nrate if you will.\n\n63\n00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:31.507\nAnd you're going to notice that channels,\n\n64\n00:03:31.507 --> 00:03:34.641\nwhen we talk about broadband\ncommunications, right?\n\n65\n00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:36.809\nWhen we talk about\nbaseband communications,\n\n66\n00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:40.321\nwe talk about one signal goes over\nthe media at the same, one time, right?\n\n67\n00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:44.789\nWe can get multiple sources that\ncan use that bandwidth, but\n\n68\n00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.474\nthrough time divisional multiplexing,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:49.711\nYou can talk it this time,\n\n70\n00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:52.423\nyou are the only one using\nthat baseband communication.\n\n71\n00:03:52.423 --> 00:03:55.759\nNow somebody else talks, you're\nthe only one using that communication.\n\n72\n00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.827\nSee, when we talk about\nbroadband communications,\n\n73\n00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:03.063\nthey actually divide the entire\nbandwidth into this discrete channels.\n\n74\n00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:08.653\nAnd one channel according to the Digital\nSignal Hierarchy is equal to 64K,\n\n75\n00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.634\n64 kilobyte per second.\n\n76\n00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:13.769\nNow, you can see that we also have DS1,\nall right.\n\n77\n00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.678\nWhen we look at DS1 now,\nDS1 we want you to understand that\n\n78\n00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:22.225\nDS1 is 1.544 megabits, all right?\n\n79\n00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:26.788\nAnd what that essentially means is\nthat we're taking 24 of those DS0's,\n\n80\n00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:31.294\nwhich is a single channel, right,\nand we're aggregating them together.\n\n81\n00:04:31.294 --> 00:04:34.631\nOr basically we're going to squish\nthem to the, all together and\n\n82\n00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:38.589\nif you want that kind of speed you're\ngoing to use all 24 channels, right?\n\n83\n00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.803\nSo it's a multiplex communication and\n\n84\n00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:44.432\nsends more than one signal going\ndown that transmission media.\n\n85\n00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:47.981\nWhatever the media is that you use\nin order to adhere to this standard,\n\n86\n00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:48.593\nall right.\n\n87\n00:04:48.593 --> 00:04:53.756\nSo you're going to see that come up again\nthat one point five or four megabits.\n\n88\n00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:59.707\nAnd again, it's just a 24 of these\nDS0 channels together, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:03.644\nAnd then you've got and there's more,\nthere's some that I didn't put in here,\n\n90\n00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:07.695\nthere's zero, there's one two three four\nand I didn't put them in the list because\n\n91\n00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:10.662\nthey're really not applicable\nto the Network Plus exam, and\n\n92\n00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:12.624\nwe've got enough to learn, all right.\n\n93\n00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:17.356\nSo let's not put a lot of other stuff in\nour minds that we really don't, aren't\n\n94\n00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:22.252\ngonna help us for the exam, but you'll see\nthat we also have DS3 here on the list.\n\n95\n00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:25.944\nNow that's 44.736 megabits and\nthat's a pretty big number, right?\n\n96\n00:05:25.944 --> 00:05:28.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when we look at that number,\n\n97\n00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.206\nhow do we come up with that number?\n\n98\n00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:35.058\nWell, if you take 672 of\nthose DS0 services or\n\n99\n00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:39.574\nchannels, and\nyou squish them all together.\n\n100\n00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:44.136\nAnd we use them as a single pipeline if\nyou will, multiplex all these signals\n\n101\n00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:47.858\ntogether you're gonna to\ncome up with 44.76 megabits.\n\n102\n00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:52.878\nAll right, so understand that there\nis a method to the madness, right?\n\n103\n00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:56.733\nUnderstand that this isn't just\na crap shot across the board, right?\n\n104\n00:05:56.733 --> 00:06:00.921\nAnd we hope we come up with\na certain number or number,\n\n105\n00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.205\nthese numbers are structured\nthis way because again,\n\n106\n00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:09.971\nit's always that single channel\nrate of 64K, all right.\n\n107\n00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:11.626\nNow, in North America here,\n\n108\n00:06:11.626 --> 00:06:15.202\nin order to adhere to these digital\nsignal standard we have, and\n\n109\n00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:20.057\nall around the world really, we have what\nare known as carrier designations, right?\n\n110\n00:06:20.057 --> 00:06:23.107\nThe carrier designations that we have\ninside of North America are called\n\n111\n00:06:23.107 --> 00:06:25.213\nT-carriers, you might\nhave heard them before.\n\n112\n00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:28.464\nMaybe you've heard of the term T1 line,\nT2 line, T3 line, right?\n\n113\n00:06:28.464 --> 00:06:29.238\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n114\n00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:33.424\n&gt;&gt; Well, these are the physical media, the\ncopper media, cuz our transmission mediums\n\n115\n00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:36.934\nthat we have are really no different\nthan what we have in our LAN, right?\n\n116\n00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:42.265\nWe have fiber optic communication,\nlong distances at high speeds copper,\n\n117\n00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:47.098\nshorter distances, relatively\nslower speeds relative to copper,\n\n118\n00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:50.868\nand we also have fiber optic\ncommunications as well.\n\n119\n00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:54.338\nWell, the carrier systems\ndenote the copper cable and\n\n120\n00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:58.940\nsometime you can see things like\ntraditional PSTN lines that are used for\n\n121\n00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.289\nthese T-carrier systems, right?\n\n122\n00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.645\nSo what is the carrier system going to do?\n\n123\n00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:05.878\nWell, it's going to be something\nknown as dedicated bandwidth, right?\n\n124\n00:07:05.878 --> 00:07:09.681\nWhen we look at other technologies,\nthat I'll elaborate a little bit more on,\n\n125\n00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:12.026\nwe look at things like cable broadband,\nright?\n\n126\n00:07:12.026 --> 00:07:14.544\nMaybe you have cable broadband\nat your house, right?\n\n127\n00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:17.209\nWell, cable broadband is\na shared bandwidth and\n\n128\n00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:20.849\nthat's why at certain times of\nthe day you get certain speeds, and\n\n129\n00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:22.543\nthen other times-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n130\n00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:23.402\n&gt;&gt; Peak times, Zach,\n\n131\n00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:26.089\nhave you ever done this when you\nwake up in the morning, right?\n\n132\n00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:29.339\nAnd when you wake up in the morning\nmaybe you're checking the Drudge Report,\n\n133\n00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:31.199\nmaybe you're checking your news, right?\n\n134\n00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.255\nAnd you get on there and\nthings are just happening quick,\n\n135\n00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.238\nthen you get home about six, right?\n\n136\n00:07:36.238 --> 00:07:39.654\nAnd here on the east coast 6 o’clock\nis what we call just before prime time.\n\n137\n00:07:39.654 --> 00:07:42.909\nAnd I say prime time not so much TV wise,\nbut everybody's coming home,\n\n138\n00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.794\neverybody's at their house,\neverybody's on the Internet.\n\n139\n00:07:45.794 --> 00:07:48.974\nWe have shared bandwidth, well that\nmeans your piece of the pie is going to\n\n140\n00:07:48.974 --> 00:07:52.534\nbe a little bit smaller and you'll notice\nthat those speeds kind of tank, right?\n\n141\n00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:55.055\nThe performance seems to\ndegrade a little bit, right?\n\n142\n00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:58.064\n&gt;&gt; I try to watch Stranger Things\nthat comes off stranger thugs and\n\n143\n00:07:58.064 --> 00:07:59.079\nit freezes\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n144\n00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.213\nthat's That's the slower version, right?\n\n145\n00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.324\n&gt;&gt; Four of my kids\nare watching at the same time.\n\n146\n00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:06.726\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and that's a great example\nof how internally within your LANs,\n\n147\n00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.677\nyou start to see the performance degrade.\n\n148\n00:08:08.677 --> 00:08:10.864\nAnd that can happen at any\ntime of the day, right?\n\n149\n00:08:10.864 --> 00:08:13.560\nWell the same thing\nhappens on your ISP side.\n\n150\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.954\nThey have a shared set of bandwidth,\nright?\n\n151\n00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.463\nAnd they share about out and\n\n152\n00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:22.490\namongst all the different groups within\nthe massive nodes that they support.\n\n153\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.884\nWell, when you're talking about\nthese carrier systems and\n\n154\n00:08:25.884 --> 00:08:29.675\nyou are going to pay for\nwhat's known as a dedicated service level,\n\n155\n00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:33.280\na dedicated signal level,\ndigital signal hierarchy, right?\n\n156\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.886\nAccording to whatever your\nservice level agreement is,\n\n157\n00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:38.050\nthat's gonna be your bandwidth.\n\n158\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.781\nAnd unlike the shared resources that\nwe talk about with cable broadband,\n\n159\n00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:43.474\nyou're guaranteed that speed.\n\n160\n00:08:43.474 --> 00:08:47.253\nNow you're gonna pay, even for\na fractional carrier line,\n\n161\n00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:49.784\nyou might pay $199 a month, right?\n\n162\n00:08:49.784 --> 00:08:52.843\nConsiderably more than\nyou would pay just for\n\n163\n00:08:52.843 --> 00:08:56.156\naverage residential cable broadband,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:56.156 --> 00:09:00.162\nWell that's because, I want you to think\nof, let's say I make a call to Zach,\n\n165\n00:09:00.162 --> 00:09:00.790\nall right?\n\n166\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.620\nI've got my cell phone, he's got his\ncell phone, we make a call, all right?\n\n167\n00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:11.000\nNow, let's leave that call connected and\nlet's just put it to the side,\n\n168\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.470\nand let's walk away from\nit leaving it connected.\n\n169\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.210\nThat is a dedicated connection and\nlet's leave it that way for the month.\n\n170\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.480\nLeave it that way whether\nyou're using it or not.\n\n171\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.600\nThat's what it is to have\na dedicated leased line.\n\n172\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.120\nIt's alway yours,\nit's dedicated bandwidth.\n\n173\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.410\nSo it's expensive, right?\n\n174\n00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.290\nIt is a circuit that's created for\nyou from whatever\n\n175\n00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:35.690\nyour on premises location is through\nthe ISP's network that guarantees you,\n\n176\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.581\nlet's say if a you get\na digital signal zero, 64K.\n\n177\n00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:46.740\nDoesn't seem like a lot, right, but\nyou can get up to 44.736 megabits.\n\n178\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.670\nSo when we talk about these lease lines as\nbeing the copper media that allow us to\n\n179\n00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.660\nadhere to the signals,\nthey're called carrier systems.\n\n180\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.170\nIf we can go back to the slide here,\n\n181\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.750\nyou'll see that there\nare different carrier designations.\n\n182\n00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.730\nAgain, these are still the carrier system,\nbut the carrier designations,\n\n183\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.860\nthey differ a little bit\nhere in the states or\n\n184\n00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.560\nin North America versus our European\nbrothers and sisters out there and Japan.\n\n185\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.417\nThat if you're in the North America in\ngeneral, it's gonna be a T-carrier system.\n\n186\n00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:14.450\nWe'll have T1, T2, T3 lines, right?\n\n187\n00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.708\nIf you're in Europe, you're gonna have E,\nall right, E-carrier system.\n\n188\n00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.821\nYou're gonna have E0, E1, E2, E3, right?\n\n189\n00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:25.030\nOr I think it might even start at E1,\nright?\n\n190\n00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.640\nIf you're in Japan, you're gonna have\nwhat's known as the J-Carrier system.\n\n191\n00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.020\nThat's their designation, all right?\n\n192\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.521\nNow there are only two that I\nreally care about for the exam.\n\n193\n00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:34.111\nI put Japan in here just as a little,\n\n194\n00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:36.665\nyou can see that there's\nanother one out there, right?\n\n195\n00:10:36.665 --> 00:10:39.470\nI don't want you to worry about Japan,\nthough.\n\n196\n00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.661\nBut, what I do want you to worry about\nis the North American carrier system and\n\n197\n00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:44.000\nthe European carrier systems.\n\n198\n00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.589\nThese are important for the exam and\n\n199\n00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:51.600\nthey are called out by the objective so\nwe want you to be aware of them.\n\n200\n00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.363\n&gt;&gt; Good to know!\n\n201\n00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:55.621\n&gt;&gt; All right, now what I've gone ahead and\n\n202\n00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:59.490\ndone is shown you how do we\neven arrive at these numbers.\n\n203\n00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.492\nIt's not a crap shoot across the board,\nright?\n\n204\n00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:03.015\nWe're not closing our eyes and\nthrowing a dart at the dart board and\n\n205\n00:11:03.015 --> 00:11:05.120\nwhatever we get,\nthat's what we happen to make.\n\n206\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.870\nAgain, there's, it's architect, right?\n\n207\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.180\nSomebody has put\nthe architecture together.\n\n208\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.972\nSo the North American T-carrier system\nhas been around for a long time.\n\n209\n00:11:13.972 --> 00:11:16.210\nI wanna say Bell Labs was\nthe first one that started it, and\n\n210\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.596\nit goes back to, I want to say the 60s.\n\n211\n00:11:17.596 --> 00:11:22.057\nAnd the T-Carrier system that they\nuse they have a T1 line, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:24.640\nWell a T1 line is 24 channels.\n\n213\n00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.164\nAnd again, DS 24 64 kilobit per second\nchannels, all aggregated together,\n\n214\n00:11:30.164 --> 00:11:34.340\nall right, for\nan overall speed of 1.44 megabits right?\n\n215\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.799\nSo you can essentially say\nthat if you want to get, and\n\n216\n00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.380\nlet's go back over to our digital signal.\n\n217\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.792\nLet's say that there are, say, hey, we're\ngonna give you a DS1 level of service,\n\n218\n00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:47.908\n1.44 megabits.\n\n219\n00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:53.790\nWell, in order here, in North America,\nto accomplish that level of higher signal,\n\n220\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.620\nif you will, we're gonna have\nto use a T1 line, all right?\n\n221\n00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.220\nAnything less than that becomes\nwhat's known as a fractional T1 line.\n\n222\n00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.930\nAnd it's exactly what it says, right?\n\n223\n00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.832\nThink about your pie, that's why I use\nthat, piece of the pie, all right?\n\n224\n00:12:07.832 --> 00:12:09.588\nFractional T1 lines\nmean if you don't need,\n\n225\n00:12:09.588 --> 00:12:12.607\nmaybe you just have a little bit of\nsignaling information, embedded systems,\n\n226\n00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:14.965\nor something, but\nthey've always gotta be communicating.\n\n227\n00:12:14.965 --> 00:12:18.270\nThat might not take a lot of bandwidth,\nall right?\n\n228\n00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.100\nSo in that case,\nyou don't need to rent, or lease,\n\n229\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.490\nif you will, the whole entire 1.44\nmegabits, you only need a portion of it.\n\n230\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.125\nAnd we'll get into that here in a second,\n\n231\n00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:30.444\ncuz that's gonna bring us into things like\nISDN, which I think make a little bit more\n\n232\n00:12:30.444 --> 00:12:32.577\nsense once you understand\nthe channelized service.\n\n233\n00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:36.808\nSo that's your T1 line, and\ndefinitely know, and if we look again,\n\n234\n00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:38.973\nremember it iss 24 DS0 signals.\n\n235\n00:12:38.973 --> 00:12:41.320\nBut then there's also the T3\nline that they call out.\n\n236\n00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.430\nAnd the T3 line,\nagain back to those DS signals, right?\n\n237\n00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.240\nThat's 672 of those channels or\nthose DS0 channels.\n\n238\n00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.602\nThat's 672, to be more specific,\n64 kilobit per second\n\n239\n00:12:55.602 --> 00:13:00.067\nchannels all aggregated together\nin this one line, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:03.884\nThat's the T3 line, 44.736 megabits.\n\n241\n00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:06.850\nNow what's interesting\nis this standard here,\n\n242\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.495\nNorth American T-Carrier system,\nit's been around for a very long time.\n\n243\n00:13:11.495 --> 00:13:15.091\nSo when Europe got on the bandwagon, and\nmore importantly, when I say Europe,\n\n244\n00:13:15.091 --> 00:13:18.153\nI'm talking about the International\nTelecommunications Union,\n\n245\n00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:20.102\ntheir standardization sector, ITU-T.\n\n246\n00:13:20.102 --> 00:13:24.340\nWe need to standardize a carrier system.\n\n247\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.796\nTheir's is actually a little\nmore optimized than ours.\n\n248\n00:13:25.796 --> 00:13:29.780\nBecause I want you to look at\nthe difference between a T1 and an E1.\n\n249\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.862\nE1 is just about twice the bandwidth,\n\n250\n00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:38.969\nnotice that it's 2.048 megabits\ntransfer speeds, all right?\n\n251\n00:13:38.969 --> 00:13:43.419\nAnd that gives us, not 24,\ntheir's are 30 of the DS0 signals,\n\n252\n00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:48.446\nwhich is why it's a little higher,\nright, cuz it's not 24, it's 30.\n\n253\n00:13:48.446 --> 00:13:51.482\n&gt;&gt; Wes, just real quick, will you ever\nsee this application here in the states?\n\n254\n00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:55.168\n&gt;&gt; Not the E-Carrier systems, but\none of the things we have to keep in mind,\n\n255\n00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.900\nand it’s a great question Zach.\n\n256\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.950\nWe’re here in the states,\n\n257\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.380\nwhy are we talking about something\nthat you’ll see in Europe?\n\n258\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.381\nYou have to remember Comptia is\na vendor neutral worldwide accredited\n\n259\n00:14:04.381 --> 00:14:05.410\ncertification.\n\n260\n00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n261\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.660\n&gt;&gt; So it's very common to say that if you\nbecome a networking expert or a networking\n\n262\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.960\nadmin, and maybe Network+ is your leaping\nstone to your next certification and\n\n263\n00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.040\nhigher levels of certification.\n\n264\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.570\nIt's pretty feasible to say that you\nmight not only be here in the states.\n\n265\n00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.968\nIn fact, right now we've got people\nthat are joining us, part of our crew,\n\n266\n00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:26.811\npart of our team,\nthat are from the UK right now.\n\n267\n00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:28.084\nSo just to understand that,\n\n268\n00:14:28.084 --> 00:14:31.120\nthat's one of the reasons that\nyou'll see the E-Carrier system.\n\n269\n00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:36.011\nThey don't worry too much, they haven't\ncalled out the J-carrier systems yet, but\n\n270\n00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:37.626\nthey do call out E1 and E3.\n\n271\n00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.562\nSo if we go back to our slide here,\n\n272\n00:14:39.562 --> 00:14:42.341\nremember that E1 is 30\nof the DS0 channels.\n\n273\n00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:46.107\nAnd again that's on it together,\nif you will, aggregated together,\n\n274\n00:14:46.107 --> 00:14:48.260\nthat's gonna be 2.048 megabits.\n\n275\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.140\nAnd there's also E3, all right?\n\n276\n00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.133\nNow the E3 channel,\nI've actually kind of got wrong here.\n\n277\n00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:58.460\nThis is actually 30, that is not right.\n\n278\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.928\nHold on one second,\nlet me get my channels right, here.\n\n279\n00:15:00.928 --> 00:15:06.086\nThat's actually 16 DS1 channels.\n\n280\n00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:10.481\nAll right,\nnow if we look at that 16 DS1 channels,\n\n281\n00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:15.560\nif there are 2.048 megabits per,\nwell we're gonna come\n\n282\n00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.754\nout with a whopping 34 megabit\ntransfer speeds, all right?\n\n283\n00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.620\nSo do keep that in mind, all right?\n\n284\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.292\nThat it is a 34 megabyte transfer speed.\n\n285\n00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.520\nIt essentially takes their E1 lines and\n\n286\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.050\naggregates 16 of those together,\nall right?\n\n287\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.320\nSo know E1 and E3, all right?\n\n288\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.130\nIt's very important.\n\n289\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.110\nNow, the next thing that\nwe wanna talk about,\n\n290\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.059\nnow that we've kinda set the stage\nhere for our digital hierarchy.\n\n291\n00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.192\nWhat the courier designations are, and\n\n292\n00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:50.447\nalso what the T-Carrier and\nE-Carrrier systems are.\n\n293\n00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:53.952\nThat brings us into our next topic,\nall right?\n\n294\n00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:58.977\nSome of the service types that we have out\nthere are, one they call out called ISDN.\n\n295\n00:15:58.977 --> 00:16:00.860\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n296\n00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.679\nIt was one of those ones that was really\nattractive when in the earlier days all we\n\n297\n00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:06.940\nhad was dial up, all right.\n\n298\n00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.640\nDial up was 56k, that's what you get.\n\n299\n00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.190\n56 kilobits per second, right?\n\n300\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.914\nISDN's a little different.\n\n301\n00:16:14.914 --> 00:16:20.810\nNow if we could take a look at\nthe slide here, we've got ISDN.\n\n302\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.240\nAnd Integrated Services Digital Network\nis about taking digital signals,\n\n303\n00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:32.460\nmodulating them, if you will, and\nturning them into an analog signal and\n\n304\n00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.510\nsending them over PSTN of the POTS lines,\nright?\n\n305\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:41.020\nAnd what we can do, depending on\nwhat kind of bandwidth we need.\n\n306\n00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:45.730\nWell, to dictate which T-carrier\nsystem we might get, all right?\n\n307\n00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.370\nAnd we have to know a couple\nof designations here in ISDN.\n\n308\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.880\nWe have two different service levels.\n\n309\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.750\nWe have what's known as\nbasic rate interface ISDN or\n\n310\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.680\nintegrated services digital network.\n\n311\n00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.690\nWe also have what's known as primary rate,\n\n312\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.390\nor PRI-ISDN,\nprimary rate interface, all right?\n\n313\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:09.870\nNow, I also wanna talk briefly about\ntwo concepts that we have here as well.\n\n314\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:12.420\nWe have what are known as B channels,\nor Bearer Channels, and\n\n315\n00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.700\nwe have what are known as Delta Channels,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.990\nBearer channels or B channels,\n\n317\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.260\nif you will, are gonna be what\nare responsible for moving your data.\n\n318\n00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.700\nThe Delta channels on the other hand,\nthey don't move data.\n\n319\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.080\nThey control things like signaling,\nbringing the communication up,\n\n320\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.960\nmaintaining the communication, and\nthen tearing it down once it's done.\n\n321\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.450\nSo I want you to know B channels and\nD channels.\n\n322\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.970\nWell, can you guess what\na single B channel,\n\n323\n00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.600\nif it's carrying your data,\nwhat bandwidth it might have?\n\n324\n00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.080\nCan you take a guess?\n\n325\n00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.590\nThat's gonna be 64 kilobit per second.\n\n326\n00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.680\nI wonder how they got that number?\n\n327\n00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.100\nWell, if we look back.\n\n328\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.140\nRemember, digital signal hierarchy.\n\n329\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.530\nA single bearer channel on ISDN\nline is 64 kilobit transfer speeds.\n\n330\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.270\nAgain, everything is channelized,\nall right?\n\n331\n00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.700\nYou want more channels,\nyou pay more money.\n\n332\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.265\nYou want more bandwidth,\nyou pay more money.\n\n333\n00:18:05.265 --> 00:18:09.990\nBut the great thing is you only pay for\nwhat you need, right?\n\n334\n00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.170\nSo we wanna know that,\nB channels and Delta channels.\n\n335\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.530\nAnd again, B and D channels.\n\n336\n00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.390\nNow if we look at BRI, or\nbasic rate interface, ISDN, all right?\n\n337\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.530\nI've got two ISDN lines here,\nor BRI-ISDN lines.\n\n338\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.320\nUnderstand that, again,\n\n339\n00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.589\nin a T1 line you essentially get\n1.544 megabit transfer speeds.\n\n340\n00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.898\nBut, if we look at a single BRI-ISDN line,\nright?\n\n341\n00:18:36.898 --> 00:18:44.460\nIt's actually gonna use a fractional\nT1 because it is only a 128 kbps.\n\n342\n00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.933\nSo just a single T1 or\nBRI connection is 128 Kilobits,\n\n343\n00:18:48.933 --> 00:18:52.142\nif I said megabits I was wrong, 128K.\n\n344\n00:18:52.142 --> 00:18:55.991\nWhich is why I said in the days\nthat this first came out, boy,\n\n345\n00:18:55.991 --> 00:19:01.060\nthis was a lot more attractive over\nthings like dial up, all right?\n\n346\n00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.670\nAnd you can see here that I've\nactually got two lines, right?\n\n347\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.588\nI've got two BRI lines to show you that\nhey, yes, we could aggregate these.\n\n348\n00:19:07.588 --> 00:19:14.170\nI got 128K, and then, another portion of\nthat fractional T1 line could be using,\n\n349\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:20.120\nagain, a completely different, separate\ncustomer's information too, all right?\n\n350\n00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.350\nThat's why they call it a fractional T1.\n\n351\n00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:26.030\nYou're not using the entire bandwidth\nof what the T1 is capable of, so\n\n352\n00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.700\nwhat do they do?\n\n353\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.380\nThey divide it up, and\nyou pay for what you need.\n\n354\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.980\nYou might need a few of these\nfractional T1 lines, right?\n\n355\n00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.500\nWhatever it is that you need to\naggregate together to get the bandwidth\n\n356\n00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.600\nthat you need.\n\n357\n00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.760\nI just happened to show you that there is,\njust for demonstration purposes,\n\n358\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.520\nis overall channelized service,\nwe've got two here.\n\n359\n00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.830\nTwo completely different\nservice providers.\n\n360\n00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.040\nBut notice the delta channel,\n16 kilobits delta channel, all right?\n\n361\n00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.475\nThat's why sometimes you\nmight see 144 kilobits.\n\n362\n00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:56.970\nNot all of it is gonna be used for\nyour data.\n\n363\n00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.440\nSome of it's used for signaling,\ndefining the parameters,\n\n364\n00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.450\nmaintaining the communication and\ntearing it down.\n\n365\n00:20:02.678 --> 00:20:05.770\nNow BRI-ISDN that we see here is\ntypically what you would see inside of\n\n366\n00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.740\nthings like residential areas and\neven commercial businesses.\n\n367\n00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.070\nWell what if you needed more bandwidth?\n\n368\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.890\nOr you were the telecommunications\nprovider, we'll just say TELCO,\n\n369\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:18.830\nif you're the telecommunications provider,\nthat's where something like primary rate\n\n370\n00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.130\ninterface comes in, and that's PRI-ISDN.\n\n371\n00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.870\nNow I'll tell you, Zach,\nI didn't take the time to sit out here and\n\n372\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.070\ndraw 24 individual lines, all right?\n\n373\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.540\nI did not, I got a little\nlazy on this one, all right?\n\n374\n00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:41.750\nBut know what I want you to know is that\nnotice that the PRI-ISDN is 23 B channels.\n\n375\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.400\nSo 23 channels carrying our data,\n23 of those barer channels,\n\n376\n00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.600\nat 64 kilobits per, all right?\n\n377\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.260\nSo when we look at that, that's\nessentially equal to what the T1 line is.\n\n378\n00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.990\nThat's a full T1 line.\n\n379\n00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:02.670\nOr if you're in Europe, and again, we're\ngonna kind of tie this back together, and\n\n380\n00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.430\nI did mention our Australian\nviewers out there.\n\n381\n00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.640\nWe're not forgetting you.\n\n382\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.640\nThey also fall under the e\ncarrier system likewise too.\n\n383\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.000\nSo if you're in Europe or\nyou're in Australia.\n\n384\n00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.600\n&gt;&gt; It's E.\n\n385\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.690\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be E1, right?\n\n386\n00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.160\nThat's the copper line\nthat you're gonna achieve\n\n387\n00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.550\nthis type of service I'm offering, right?\n\n388\n00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.850\nService level.\n\n389\n00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.230\nNotice that the D channel\nhere has a little,\n\n390\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.780\ngotta little bit more padding\nin it than the earlier.\n\n391\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.635\nPRI ISDN has a 16 kilo bit delta\nchannel here with pre or primary.\n\n392\n00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:33.895\nPrimary rate interface ISDN,\n\n393\n00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:37.705\nyou're looking at 64 kilobit\ndelta channels, all right?\n\n394\n00:21:37.705 --> 00:21:41.387\nThen you can kind of see how we tied\ntogether with the T-carrier systems, or\n\n395\n00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:44.195\nE-carrier systems, or even,\nI put in this just in case,\n\n396\n00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:45.945\nyou know, the J-carrier systems.\n\n397\n00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:49.495\nI just put that in there for, just so\nyou guys can kind of see the comparison.\n\n398\n00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:53.460\nI don't want you to worry about\nJ-carriers, if you will, for this exam.\n\n399\n00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.590\nAll right, so\nthat takes us through our ISDN.\n\n400\n00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.640\nNow, there are other technologies\nthat we also have to consider, too.\n\n401\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.410\nAnd by the way, these are all\ncopper based transmission medium.\n\n402\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:04.090\n&gt;&gt; Mm hm.\n\n403\n00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.160\n&gt;&gt; All right?\n\n404\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.090\nAnd that's something known as,\ndigital subscriber line, DSL, all right.\n\n405\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.220\nNow when we talk about\ndigital subscriber line,\n\n406\n00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.630\nthis is another common service type\nthat we have out there that your\n\n407\n00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:20.280\nservice providers provide for\nyour WAN communication, right?\n\n408\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.230\nYour ISPs out there.\n\n409\n00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:27.261\nNow digital subscriber line\nis interesting, all right?\n\n410\n00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:31.906\nIt essentially can put voice and\ndata within the same communication line if\n\n411\n00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:35.529\nyou will, but\nthe frequencies are separate, all right?\n\n412\n00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:39.276\nWhat you typically need is like\na DSL filter on the end of\n\n413\n00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:43.320\nthe connection there to\nseparate those signals.\n\n414\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.880\nBut you could see here with the DSL, and\nI would have had in a slide here and\n\n415\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.370\nput a DSL.\n\n416\n00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.470\nThat's asymmetric digital subscriber line.\n\n417\n00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.050\nThe reason I did that is\ncuz it's the most common.\n\n418\n00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.850\nIt just means your uploads and\nyour downloads are at different speeds.\n\n419\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.960\nYou also have symmetric DSL, but\nit isn't the most common type.\n\n420\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.820\nSo I just went ahead and\nput the most common type in here,\n\n421\n00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.650\nbecause there's quite a few different\ntypes of digital subscriber line.\n\n422\n00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.120\nAnd what you have is you have A DTE,\nright?\n\n423\n00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.440\nA data termination equipment, right?\n\n424\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.000\nThat's something that's inside\nof your network as a customer.\n\n425\n00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.490\nAll right, typically a subscriber modem,\nsometimes you can hear it called CPE,\n\n426\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.140\nCustomer Premise Equipment.\n\n427\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.580\nAnd then that connects you,\nif you will, to the PSTN lines.\n\n428\n00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.450\nAnd multiple, fi you will,\n\n429\n00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.790\nmultiple signals can be put across the\nhigh speed backbone with something known\n\n430\n00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:41.230\nas the digital subscriber\nline access multiplexer.\n\n431\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.320\nUnderstand that we have\nchannels here coming from, and\n\n432\n00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.900\nsignals coming from, more than one source.\n\n433\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.390\nSo when we have these devices it\ndoesn't matter if it's a copper based\n\n434\n00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.170\ncommunication.\n\n435\n00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.680\nDoesn't matter If it's\na fiber-optic communication,\n\n436\n00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.072\nwe'll talk about SONET coming up that also\nuses something like this called an atom.\n\n437\n00:23:59.072 --> 00:24:03.770\nAll right, it takes multiple signals and\nit combines it into one massive\n\n438\n00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.570\nsingle signal and sends it over\na single physical medium, right?\n\n439\n00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.270\nIt's called multiplexing.\n\n440\n00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.540\nIt's a mux device, multiplexer.\n\n441\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.000\nAll right,\nnow on the other side of a communication,\n\n442\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.940\nwhen you're receiving multiple\nsignals off of the ISP and\n\n443\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.324\nit has to go to separate customers,\nthey call it de-multiplexing.\n\n444\n00:24:22.324 --> 00:24:23.330\nA de-mux device.\n\n445\n00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.910\nSo, you have mux, multiplexing,\nde-mux, de-multiplexing, right?\n\n446\n00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.770\nSo, it separates those signals.\n\n447\n00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:29.610\nAnd, if we can look here,\n\n448\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:34.240\nback at our diagram,\nit would be de-multiplexed, if you will.\n\n449\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.540\nSo, you've got, going into the high speed\nbackbone, these signals are combined,\n\n450\n00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.590\nand we offer the high speed backbone,\nthey're gonna be separated,\n\n451\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.830\nso multiplex versus demultiplex,\nall right?\n\n452\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.820\nAnd that's a couple of the service\ntypes that we have to look at.\n\n453\n00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.410\nWe've got a couple more\ncopper types to look at.\n\n454\n00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.060\nAnd then we're gonna get into other\ngreat things, things like satellite.\n\n455\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.650\nWe've gotta look at fiber fiber, one of\nthe fastest WAN technologies out there.\n\n456\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.010\nBut unfortunately it does look like we're\ngonna have to save that for a part two.\n\n457\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.310\n&gt;&gt; And we will watch part\ntwo of WAN technologies.\n\n458\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.310\nThis has been part one.\n\n459\n00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.810\nAnd make sure you see everything\nin the CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n460\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.070\nAnd while you're doing that.\n\n461\n00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.770\nCheck out all the other\nvideos in the course library.\n\n462\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.630\nHundreds of videos all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n463\n00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.985\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro Tv.\n\n464\n00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:19.720\nThey'll be really glad you did.\n\n465\n00:25:19.720 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.895\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:07.646\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:10.530\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.322\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:16.338\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:20.244\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net+,\n\n7\n00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:22.925\nand this is gonna be\nWAN Technologies part 3.\n\n8\n00:00:22.925 --> 00:00:26.369\nWhere we hear Wes Bryan all\nthe things we don't know, or\n\n9\n00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550\nmaybe we just need a refresher.\n\n10\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.393\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Good to see you again.\n\n11\n00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:31.234\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nI don't know the things that I don't know.\n\n12\n00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:32.443\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right, but\n\n13\n00:00:32.443 --> 00:00:36.399\nwe're continuing on like Zach said,\nwe're going further on well,\n\n14\n00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.370\nthe side of our network that\nsometimes we really don't see, right?\n\n15\n00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.427\nUnless you work for an Internet\nservice provider, maybe you work for\n\n16\n00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:44.956\na telecommunications provider,\n\n17\n00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.974\nthen you're probably very familiar\nwith these subjects already.\n\n18\n00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:52.030\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n19\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.057\nIn the last episode, we were talking\nabout different technologies,\n\n20\n00:00:56.057 --> 00:00:58.515\ndifferent service offerings, like ATM,\n\n21\n00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:02.759\nwe talked about things like frame relay,\nall different kinds of things.\n\n22\n00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:07.005\nAnd so far, we've really been talking\na lot about different copper medias,\n\n23\n00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.560\nwhen we talk about things like\nleased lines, T1 lines, if you will.\n\n24\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.560\nBut now, we're gonna kinda move into\nour fiber-optic communication type that\n\n25\n00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.282\nwe have for WAN based technologies,\nand that's something known as SONET.\n\n26\n00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:26.356\nSONET is a very,\nvery fast fiber-optic technology that your\n\n27\n00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:31.824\nInternet service providers use\nto provide high speed bandwidth,\n\n28\n00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:35.950\nor high speed networking, if you will.\n\n29\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.806\nNow, Sonet has a little bit of\narchitecture that I want you to be aware\n\n30\n00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:41.414\nof for the exam, all right.\n\n31\n00:01:41.414 --> 00:01:46.060\nSo let's go ahead and let's take\na look at a diagram here that I have.\n\n32\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.533\nSONET has essentially\nthe synchronous optical networking,\n\n33\n00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.812\nif I didn't mention that what SONET is.\n\n34\n00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:58.110\nIt works with a dual ring topology, and\nthe rings can be local collector rings,\n\n35\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.656\nthey could regional collector rings too,\nas well as the big one here in\n\n36\n00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:09.410\nthe middle is what's known as\na high-speed backbone ring, all right?\n\n37\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.348\nSo, you notice that you\nhave what are known,\n\n38\n00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:14.206\nthe smaller ones are what are known\nas your local collector rings.\n\n39\n00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.850\nNow, I didn't put any regional rings in\nhere, they would be intermediate, right?\n\n40\n00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.462\nThey'd be like the medium size ring\nbetween the local collector ring, and\n\n41\n00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.467\nthen what the high speed backbone is, but\n\n42\n00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.952\neither way you get the point\nof the hierarchy here.\n\n43\n00:02:26.952 --> 00:02:33.970\nThe local collector ring is what accepts\na signal from the customers, right?\n\n44\n00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.388\nAnd that gets placed on\nthe local collector ring, and\n\n45\n00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:38.600\nthen you have these\nconnectivity devices here.\n\n46\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.930\nOne of the connectivity devices that we\nhave is what is known as an ADM, an A-D-M.\n\n47\n00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.900\nAnd that's actually something known as\nan add-drop multiplexer, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.730\nWhen we talk about an add-drop\nmultiplexer, all right.\n\n49\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.817\nWe talked about in other episodes,\nwe talked about the DSLAM, the digital\n\n50\n00:02:52.817 --> 00:02:56.200\nsubscriber line access multiplexer,\nremember what we said about that, right?\n\n51\n00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.172\nIt takes multiple subscriber data, right,\n\n52\n00:02:59.172 --> 00:03:03.869\nfrom multiple subscriber sources,\nbasically combines the signal and\n\n53\n00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.640\nsends that signal's signal across\nthat high speed backbone network.\n\n54\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.702\nWell, the ADM here, the add drop\nmultiplexer essentially is one of the very\n\n55\n00:03:12.702 --> 00:03:16.147\nimportant element inside of\nyour fiber-optic networks here.\n\n56\n00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:21.138\nAnd basically it takes it and\nmultiplexes or combines, if you will,\n\n57\n00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:26.216\nseveral lower bandwidth,\nreally we're dealing with wavelengths,\n\n58\n00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:29.071\nif you will, streams, data streams.\n\n59\n00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:33.695\nAnd then places them on a regional\ncollector ring or in this case, depending\n\n60\n00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:38.910\non where you're located, it could be right\non the SONET backbone ring, if you will.\n\n61\n00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.994\nThe SONET backbone ring has\nthe highest bandwidth, and\n\n62\n00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:46.529\nthat's typically what you're going to\nsee inside the Telco Company in general.\n\n63\n00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:52.001\nAll right, now one of the great\nthings about the full or excuse me,\n\n64\n00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:58.760\nthe dual ring topology is that like we've\ntalked about in other ring topologies.\n\n65\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.438\nWe talked about the fact that it's\na self-healing type communication,\n\n66\n00:04:02.438 --> 00:04:04.927\nin the fact that,\nsince it's dual ring, right,\n\n67\n00:04:04.927 --> 00:04:06.785\nwhen we have two we have redundancy.\n\n68\n00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:12.147\nAnytime we have redundancy it helps us to\nachieve fault tolerance if we want to,\n\n69\n00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:16.430\nit's a very fault tolerant\ntype of communication.\n\n70\n00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.332\nNow, and this is all related to fiber,\nright, fiber transmission medium,\n\n71\n00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:24.611\nthere're couple other topics that I wanna\ntalk about when it comes to fiber as well.\n\n72\n00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.942\nAnd when we talk about fiber, we have\nto talk a little bit about what are,\n\n73\n00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:31.790\nwhen it comes to the cabling types,\nall right?\n\n74\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.048\nAnd when we talk about the cabling types\nwe do have to keep in mind that just like\n\n75\n00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:39.800\nwhen we talked about T1 lines,\nwe talked about T2 lines, right?\n\n76\n00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.681\nWhat we also have fiber-optic lines that\nhave their own standards likewise too,\n\n77\n00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:48.620\nbut they called something\na little bit different.\n\n78\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.260\nWhat they're called,\nis optical carrier transmissions, right?\n\n79\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.103\nOC for short, optical carriers,\nand they also have a certain set\n\n80\n00:04:56.103 --> 00:05:00.780\nof specifications that are called\nout on the exam, all right?\n\n81\n00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.165\nNow, in earlier episodes\nhere in WAN Technologies,\n\n82\n00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:06.240\nthe first part we talked about T1,\nwe talked about T3, all right.\n\n83\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.901\nWe also talked about the E\ncarriers as well, E1 and\n\n84\n00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.805\nE3 likewise in the European carriers.\n\n85\n00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:18.417\nWell, when it comes to your optical\ncarriers, they call out two as well,\n\n86\n00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:24.409\nOC-1 and excuse me I'm sorry,\nnot OC-1, OC-3, and OC-192.\n\n87\n00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.062\nAnd again, OC is just short for\noptical carrier, let's go ahead and\n\n88\n00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:28.176\ntake a look at that, right.\n\n89\n00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:33.211\nWe talked about optical carrier 3,\nwe're talking about a transmission speed\n\n90\n00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:38.036\nof 155 megabits, all right, so\nits a fairly fast communication speed.\n\n91\n00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:41.420\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nAll right, now I definitely want you to\n\n92\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.191\nknow of OC-192 because we have 10\ngig networks right on our LAN side,\n\n93\n00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:52.504\nwe have 10G based T, if you will,\ntwisted pair implementations or\n\n94\n00:05:52.504 --> 00:05:59.290\n10G based SX for short wave with lasers,\nshort range lasers, if you will.\n\n95\n00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.790\nNow, that's your land based\ncommunications, all right?\n\n96\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.164\nHere's where our gateway device comes\ninto play here too because if you have\n\n97\n00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:10.100\nan internal 10G network, and\nthat's LAN communication.\n\n98\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.979\nWe also have a 10G based offering\nfrom your Internet service provider,\n\n99\n00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.800\nwhich is the WAN side, all right?\n\n100\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.749\nNow, we do need our gateway device,\nright, doing that translation because\n\n101\n00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:25.410\non the 10G base side we're running\nEthernet our Ethernet standards.\n\n102\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.950\nBut on the WAN side, we're going to\nbe running optical carriers under\n\n103\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.390\nthe synchronous optical networking and\nthat speed is going to be 10G.\n\n104\n00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.966\nNow, I've kind of just rounded up, I don't\nknow how specific they're going to get,\n\n105\n00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:38.604\nall right.\n\n106\n00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:42.250\nSpecifications means, you've got to be\na little specific here from time to time.\n\n107\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.746\nSo, I went ahead and gave you the actual\nrating for OC-192, that's 9953, so\n\n108\n00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:50.500\n9,953.2, and I said point 29-\n&gt;&gt; 2 8.\n\n109\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.599\n&gt;&gt; I want to say,\nit's point 28, yes, thank you.\n\n110\n00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.790\nAnd thank you, I'm glad I remembered that,\nbut it's point 28.\n\n111\n00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.870\nAll right, let me be really specific and\nget it right.\n\n112\n00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.840\n[LAUGH] But it's 9,953.28 megabits per\nsecond, so it's just under the 10G, right?\n\n113\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.394\nBut essentially, it's how we're going\nto achieve our 10G communications, and\n\n114\n00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:17.712\nthey have them beyond that to, all right.\n\n115\n00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:23.180\nData centers require a lot more\nbandwidth than just 10G, right.\n\n116\n00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.264\nThere's a reason we have\nthe QSFP plus standard, right?\n\n117\n00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:35.243\nRemember that that is a quad small\nform factor pluggable module,\n\n118\n00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:39.679\nand it can basically be\nquadruple of 10G connection, so\n\n119\n00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:43.046\nthat's 40 gig transfer speeds, right?\n\n120\n00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:47.713\nSo, you can see that inside of our\nnetworks we can move a lot of information\n\n121\n00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:52.699\nreally, really fast especially when\nit's data centers and stuff like that.\n\n122\n00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.219\nSo, these optical carriers\ngo well beyond 10G.\n\n123\n00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:58.366\nBut these are the only ones\nthat are required for the exam.\n\n124\n00:07:58.366 --> 00:08:02.078\nNow, if you wanna study more, and you\nwant to find out more about the optical\n\n125\n00:08:02.078 --> 00:08:04.050\ncarriers, and I encourage you to do so.\n\n126\n00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.900\nYou can look at some specifications.\n\n127\n00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.070\nType in any search engine OC standard.\n\n128\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.390\nAnd you'll come up with these.\n\n129\n00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.190\nThese are the two,\n\n130\n00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.540\nthough, that we definitely want\nto be aware of for the exam.\n\n131\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.730\nNow another technology that I\nwant you to be aware of, too,\n\n132\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.270\nwhen it comes to fiber optic\ncommunications, all right,\n\n133\n00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.660\nis the multiplexing technologies that\nthey have for fiber optic communication.\n\n134\n00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.670\nNow we talked a little bit\nsomething the add on the add\n\n135\n00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.340\ndrop multiplexer if you will,\nthat just multiplexes.\n\n136\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.790\nIt basically accepts all the information\ncoming from the customers\n\n137\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.420\nthat are connected to the local collector,\nand boy if I can get that,\n\n138\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.710\nright, and then place it on\na back bone network right?\n\n139\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.400\nWell we've got some when\nit comes to fiber there\n\n140\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.760\nare a couple of different multiplexing\nmethods that we need to be aware of.\n\n141\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.700\nYou might have heard these before,\nmaybe you haven't.\n\n142\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.760\nWe have what's known as DWDM.\n\n143\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.900\nWe also have what's known as CWDM.\n\n144\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.880\nNow, these aren't radio stations.\n\n145\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.300\nWhat we're talking about here is\ndense wavelength multiplexing,\n\n146\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.640\nand then we have what's known as coarse\nwavelength multiplexing all right?\n\n147\n00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.570\nAnd I want you to know\njust some of the slight or\n\n148\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.720\nbasic characteristics between the two.\n\n149\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.710\nYou don't have to be an electrical\nengineer by any means to pass this exam,\n\n150\n00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.450\nbut I would know a little\nbit of the characteristics.\n\n151\n00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.550\n&gt;&gt; So maybe you said this and\nmy brain didn't fill it in,\n\n152\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.980\nbut DWDM what was the D part?\n\n153\n00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.080\n&gt;&gt; That is dense wavelength\ndivision multiplexing.\n\n154\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.210\n&gt;&gt; That's it all right.\n\n155\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.640\n&gt;&gt; And the other one would be\n\n156\n00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.010\ncoarse again CWDM coarse wavelength\ndivision multiplexing okay?\n\n157\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.620\nNow, so what are the differences?\n\n158\n00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.200\nAll right, coarse, so I'm gonna start\nwith the second one first, right?\n\n159\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.420\nCoarse wavelength division multiplexing\nis systems that essentially\n\n160\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:01.440\nspread out the energy of the laser\nover a larger distance, if you will,\n\n161\n00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:07.330\nlarger range than dense-wavelength\ndivision multiplexing, all right?\n\n162\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.130\nNow what does that do?\n\n163\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.420\nThat gives you a less\nprecise communication, right?\n\n164\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:18.070\nSo if precision, right,\nfine tuned, laser precision\n\n165\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:22.510\nisn't something that you require,\nyou can go with coarse wave length, right?\n\n166\n00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.110\nCWDM.\n\n167\n00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.040\nWhat would be beneficial?\n\n168\n00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.450\nCost, cost goes down, right?\n\n169\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.990\nLess precision, less cost, beneficial.\n\n170\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.240\nBut just like the pros,\nthere's always gonna be a con, right?\n\n171\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.800\nIt's not precise, and that also shortens\nthe overall distance, all right?\n\n172\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.690\nNow, dense-wavelength,\n\n173\n00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.160\nthis is again multiplexed via\nmultiple wavelengths, right?\n\n174\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.120\nMultiple wavelengths down that cable, but\nit allows for longer distances, right?\n\n175\n00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.730\nLonger distances than the coarse\nwavelength division multiplexing.\n\n176\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.930\nIt requires more precision\ndue to the frequency spacing.\n\n177\n00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.660\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because we have those wavelengths\n\n178\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.660\nare very, very finely multiplexed together\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna cost more right.\n\n179\n00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.230\nIt's gonna be expensive but it's gonna\ngive you a higher bandwidth too.\n\n180\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.100\nAll right so just a couple of\ndifferent characteristics of the fiber\n\n181\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.090\noptic transmission medium that I\nwant you to be aware of all right.\n\n182\n00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.870\nNow the next thing that we have to be\naware of are a couple of different\n\n183\n00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:30.550\ntechnologies that they kinda call out\nhere and one of them is called DM VPN.\n\n184\n00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.251\nAll right, wow, another acronym,\nI don't even have [CROSSTALK] exactly,\n\n185\n00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:36.435\nit is, all right.\n\n186\n00:11:36.435 --> 00:11:40.390\nSo let's go ahead and\ndefine the last three letters, VPN.\n\n187\n00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.642\nYou've heard of the VPN.\n\n188\n00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:43.190\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n\n189\n00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.740\n&gt;&gt; That's the Virtual Private Network.\n\n190\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.470\nBut what's the DM?\n\n191\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.510\nAll right,\nwe're not talking about district manager.\n\n192\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.760\nSorry, if you guys out there\nare district managers watching us.\n\n193\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.580\nWe're talking about dynamic multipoint.\n\n194\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.410\nSo, think about it.\n\n195\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.970\nDynamic multipoint VPN.\n\n196\n00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.420\nDynamic, what does that mean?\n\n197\n00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.850\nSubject to change, right?\n\n198\n00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.880\nIt's not gonna be static.\n\n199\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.890\nJust like we talked about dynamic\naddressing versus static addressing.\n\n200\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.410\nStatic addressing stays the same.\n\n201\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.540\nDynamic addressing has\nthe ability to change.\n\n202\n00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.670\nAll right to adapt if you will.\n\n203\n00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.170\nAll right?\n\n204\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.520\nA VPN communication,\nin fact, let me go ahead and\n\n205\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.590\nshow you I got a little diagram made,\nall right?\n\n206\n00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.990\nLet's say if we were just talking\nabout a VPN communication,\n\n207\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.660\nthen what we have is a static\nconfiguration between two VPN gateways.\n\n208\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.710\nThat is a VPN.\n\n209\n00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.780\nThat allows you that virtualized point to\npoint communication that's gonna be always\n\n210\n00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.450\non, right?\n\n211\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.590\nNever changes,\nthat's how it works, all right?\n\n212\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:45.930\nWith a dynamic multi-point VPN, now\nthink of the second letter, multi-point.\n\n213\n00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.530\nIt means that you're gonna\nhave more than one location.\n\n214\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.540\nAnd one of the benefits\nof the DMVPN if you\n\n215\n00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.600\nwill is that it creates this\nvirtual mesh topology, all right?\n\n216\n00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.680\nNow I want you to take it back to our\ntopologies that we talked about, right?\n\n217\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.690\nWe said mesh topology,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n218\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.900\nThat means every device\nhas a connection to\n\n219\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.260\nevery other device within the network,\nright?\n\n220\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.940\nNow it's expensive, all right,\n\n221\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.220\nand we typically don't do this\nis a wired communication, right.\n\n222\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.000\nOutside of the ISP's frame relay will\ndo things like mesh networks and\n\n223\n00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.250\nstuff like that, but we typically will\nsee this in wireless communications,\n\n224\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.270\nright we'll see a mesh network.\n\n225\n00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.230\nAll right, so this is a virtualized\nmesh network, it means it's the routers,\n\n226\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.720\nthe devices that are actually going to.\n\n227\n00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.080\nThe control is virtualized, it's not an\nactual point to point communication, but\n\n228\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.740\nthe benefit, if you will, is that it\nallows each one of these remote sites to\n\n229\n00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.750\nconnect to any other remote site within\n\n230\n00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.550\nthe DMVPN whenever they need to,\nall right.\n\n231\n00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.640\nAnd we don't have to go\nthrough just a single VPN\n\n232\n00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.810\nto go back out to the Internet\nto connect to another site.\n\n233\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.730\nAgain, that's the great thing about it,\n\n234\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.330\nregardless of what their location is,\nall right?\n\n235\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.710\nNow, we've got a couple of technologies\nthat it also uses when we talk about VPNs.\n\n236\n00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.910\nI want you to be aware of\nsomething we call GRE.\n\n237\n00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.670\nThis is the generic routing\nencapsulation protocol.\n\n238\n00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.890\nAnd what it does, is when you're creating\nthese virtual point-to-point links\n\n239\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.460\nover an IP-based network,\nis it Is the encapsulation\n\n240\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.190\nprotocol that allows you to encapsulate\nthat information and create that link.\n\n241\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.700\nThis just happens to use a variant\nthat's called multipoint GRE all right?\n\n242\n00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.370\nIt also uses things like next hop\nresolution protocol, that's the NHRP.\n\n243\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:45.420\nIt also uses dynamic routing\nprotocols as well all right?\n\n244\n00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.290\nAnd when we say dynamic routing protocols,\nwe get into routing and switching,\n\n245\n00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.060\nbut I mean things like\nCisco's proprietary EIGRP.\n\n246\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.790\nRIP if you will or RIP version two\nrouting information protocol OSPF,\n\n247\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.570\nthe open shortest path first.\n\n248\n00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.850\nAnd things like BGP\nthe border gateway protocol.\n\n249\n00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.830\nAll right and then also uses things\nlike IPsec, dynamic IPsec encryption.\n\n250\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.770\nSo, know what the dynamic multipoint\nVPN is when it comes down to it,\n\n251\n00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.470\nthe basics are that it just creates\nthis virtual mesh topology and\n\n252\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.750\nevery remote location can\nconnect to every other location.\n\n253\n00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.280\nAll right, regardless of\nwhatever that location might be.\n\n254\n00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.940\nSo every remote site can connect to every\nother remote site regardless of what\n\n255\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.880\nthe location might be.\n\n256\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.950\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n257\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, so the next thing that\nwe gotta talk about here in the list,\n\n258\n00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:35.150\nZach as I am looking through this\nis what is known as a Trunk.\n\n259\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.210\nAll right, now this is the last thing as\nfar as some of the characteristics that we\n\n260\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.880\nneed to be aware of, and\nwhat is a SIP trunk.\n\n261\n00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.260\nAll right, now this is not a little\nchest where you sit down and\n\n262\n00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.640\ntake a drink in when you are thirsty.\n\n263\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.338\nAll right.\n\n264\n00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:50.990\nWhat we're talking about is\nsession initiation protocol.\n\n265\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.171\nAll right, so when talk about SIP,\nyou should be thinking voice over IP.\n\n266\n00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:57.004\nAll right, now if we can go ahead and\ntake a look at a little diagram here.\n\n267\n00:15:57.004 --> 00:15:59.880\nNow we've talked about some of\nthese technologies already, right?\n\n268\n00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.999\nWe've talked about the voice over IP PBX,\nthe private branch exchange.\n\n269\n00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:06.716\nAnd behind that I've got\nour telephony based phones,\n\n270\n00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.750\nIP phones in this case, right?\n\n271\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:14.285\nThey connect to the gateway, and\nthen all of these multiplexed, right?\n\n272\n00:16:14.285 --> 00:16:18.490\nEssentially, all these multiple\ncommunication sources have to share\n\n273\n00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.860\na single communication pathway.\n\n274\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.839\nJust like I said what a trunk is,\nthis happens to be a SIP trunk, so\n\n275\n00:16:23.839 --> 00:16:26.399\nit's directly related to\nvoice over IP technologies.\n\n276\n00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:30.843\nIt allows all of those different\ncommunications to be sent across one\n\n277\n00:16:30.843 --> 00:16:33.530\nsingle communication channel, right?\n\n278\n00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.832\nThey're all gonna use that same trunk, if\nyou will, that same SIP trunk, all right?\n\n279\n00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:42.023\nSo be aware of that, again,\nit's directly related to voiceover IP, and\n\n280\n00:16:42.023 --> 00:16:46.432\nit just means it's typically behind\nyour gateway and your voiceover IP PBX.\n\n281\n00:16:46.432 --> 00:16:48.439\nAnd it connects you to your ISP and\n\n282\n00:16:48.439 --> 00:16:52.175\nallows all those communications\nto use that single pathway.\n\n283\n00:16:52.175 --> 00:16:56.890\nAll right, those are a couple of\nthe things that we need to be aware of.\n\n284\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.150\nNow the next thing that\nwe've got to know is,\n\n285\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.153\nwe've got to know a little bit about\nsomething known as the demarcation point.\n\n286\n00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:08.542\nNow I kind of talked about the demarcation\npoint earlier here, if you remember,\n\n287\n00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:13.630\nI said with a demarkation point,\nit's really about responsibility here.\n\n288\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.600\nAnd what we mean by that\nresponsibility is the fact that\n\n289\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.152\nyou have carriers providing\nsome kinda service.\n\n290\n00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:27.503\nYou have the customers that have to\nhave their cabling inside of their\n\n291\n00:17:27.503 --> 00:17:30.990\nresidential area or even commercial area.\n\n292\n00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.428\nSo when we say demarcation point,\n\n293\n00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:38.230\nit really comes down to that point\nof responsibility, if you will.\n\n294\n00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.966\n&gt;&gt; Hey Wes, don't mean to stop you, but\n\n295\n00:17:39.966 --> 00:17:42.580\nearlier you'd mentioned\nabout the demarcation point.\n\n296\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.042\nSo what exactly is that?\n\n297\n00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:48.038\n&gt;&gt; It all boils down to the point\nof responsibility, right?\n\n298\n00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:51.056\nAgain, and\nI kinda mentioned earlier, right?\n\n299\n00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:54.302\nYou have these boxes on the outside\nof things like residential areas or\n\n300\n00:17:54.302 --> 00:17:55.575\neven in commercial areas.\n\n301\n00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:59.397\nSometimes in commercial areas, there might\neven be the what they call the entrance\n\n302\n00:17:59.397 --> 00:18:03.182\nfacility, when you're talking about\nstructured cabling, structure wiring.\n\n303\n00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:08.139\nWhere your carriers network actually\ncomes into your server closet and\n\n304\n00:18:08.139 --> 00:18:13.426\nthen at a certain point to one side of\nit is the telecommunication provider,\n\n305\n00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:15.839\nservice provider's equipment.\n\n306\n00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:18.547\nAnd then the other side of it,\nit's obviously your server closet,\n\n307\n00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:21.601\nyour switches and everything, and\nthat's your point of responsibility.\n\n308\n00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.704\nLet me show you what I mean,\nI actually got one pulled up, and\n\n309\n00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:26.107\nthis is actually one from a telecom,\ntelecommunications company.\n\n310\n00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:30.340\nAnd you can see, I really want\nyou to kinda see this right here.\n\n311\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.304\nNotice where it says telephone\nnetwork interface, generically,\n\n312\n00:18:33.304 --> 00:18:34.505\nit's what they call a NID.\n\n313\n00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:36.220\n&gt;&gt; I have one of those.\n&gt;&gt; Network interface device, right?\n\n314\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.199\nWe're up here on Wikipedia Commons here.\n\n315\n00:18:41.199 --> 00:18:44.711\nNotice how it says telephone\ncompany access and\n\n316\n00:18:44.711 --> 00:18:49.374\nit says to this side, and\nit says customer access to this side.\n\n317\n00:18:49.374 --> 00:18:50.963\nSo what's going on here, all right??\n\n318\n00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:55.651\nWell, what they're saying is that\nif you were to pop this box open,\n\n319\n00:18:55.651 --> 00:18:59.861\nthe carrier's network would\ncome into this side of the box.\n\n320\n00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:04.969\nAnd all the cable leading out of\nit to that side, figuratively,\n\n321\n00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:09.521\nis going to be the ISP's\nresponsibility to fix, right?\n\n322\n00:19:09.521 --> 00:19:13.211\nIf anything happens, brakes, they're gonna\nbe the ones that are responsible for\n\n323\n00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:15.140\nservicing that side, all right?\n\n324\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.990\nNotice that if we go back here\nto this side, it says well,\n\n325\n00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.310\nthis is customer access.\n\n326\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.751\nThey don't want you having access to\ntheir network, that's their job, right?\n\n327\n00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:27.110\nBut what you do have access\nto is this side, and\n\n328\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.621\nthen all of the cabling from then.\n\n329\n00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:33.834\nWhether it's leading into your commercial\nbuilding or maybe you're already in your\n\n330\n00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:36.827\nserver closet or\nyou're talking about a residential area.\n\n331\n00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:38.794\nLike you said, you've got one\non the outside of your house.\n\n332\n00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:40.551\n&gt;&gt; Do.\n&gt;&gt; That little box, and again,\n\n333\n00:19:40.551 --> 00:19:43.356\nwhat that's gonna lead back to is\nlike the cabling, if you will,\n\n334\n00:19:43.356 --> 00:19:46.325\nthat's inside of your house or\ninside of your commercial building.\n\n335\n00:19:46.325 --> 00:19:46.910\nAnd guess what?\n\n336\n00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.923\nYou're going to be responsible for\nmaintaining all of the cabling.\n\n337\n00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:51.602\nIf something happens there, right?\n\n338\n00:19:51.602 --> 00:19:55.653\nIf I decide that I wanna bust a wall\ndown inside of the house, and\n\n339\n00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.722\nI cut one of the Cat cables\nthat are on that side.\n\n340\n00:19:58.722 --> 00:20:01.500\nIt's not gonna be the cable\ncompany's responsibility, right?\n\n341\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.323\nI don't call the cable company and\ntell them that my TV's broke.\n\n342\n00:20:04.323 --> 00:20:07.813\nI might, but there not gonna do anything\nabout it, it's my job to fix the TV,\n\n343\n00:20:07.813 --> 00:20:09.770\nthat's my point of responsibility.\n\n344\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.144\nHowever, if something happens to their\ncable on the outside that causes my cable\n\n345\n00:20:14.144 --> 00:20:17.502\ntelevision to go out,\nI can call the cable provider, right?\n\n346\n00:20:17.502 --> 00:20:22.287\nThat's their point of responsibility, and\nthat's essentially what the d mark is,\n\n347\n00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:26.087\nthe demarcation point,\nit is really the point of responsibility.\n\n348\n00:20:26.087 --> 00:20:27.998\nNow, speaking of network interface device,\n\n349\n00:20:27.998 --> 00:20:31.140\nwe've got another one here that I need\nto mention too, that's in the list.\n\n350\n00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.955\nAnd that's called a network interface or\nexcuse me, I'm sorry,\n\n351\n00:20:34.955 --> 00:20:37.213\nit's called a smart jack, all right?\n\n352\n00:20:37.213 --> 00:20:41.798\nWhen you have things like for instance,\nyou might have something like a an ISDN\n\n353\n00:20:41.798 --> 00:20:46.520\nline, you might have in fact, you could\nsee this one's right next to a 66 block\n\n354\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.460\nthat we've talked about\nin other episodes here.\n\n355\n00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.438\nBut a smart jack essentially is a network\ninterface device that does signal,\n\n356\n00:20:54.438 --> 00:20:59.185\nit does code and does protocol conversions\nas well as a little bit more than\n\n357\n00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:03.112\njust a simple jack, if you will,\nthat allows connections.\n\n358\n00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:05.695\nIt also does things like\ndiagnostics as well, and\n\n359\n00:21:05.695 --> 00:21:09.381\nyou can actually see there are three\ncabinets here, the shelves as they\n\n360\n00:21:09.381 --> 00:21:12.776\ncall them, two shelves, excuse me,\nand we'll get this right.\n\n361\n00:21:12.776 --> 00:21:15.242\nTwo shelves, three smart jacks, right?\n\n362\n00:21:15.242 --> 00:21:18.153\nAnd you could see some of the lights\non here in the diagnostics telling you\n\n363\n00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:21.845\nwhether you've got connection, whether\nsomething's up, whether something's down.\n\n364\n00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:24.854\nOr again, whether you're running\njust general diagnostics,\n\n365\n00:21:24.854 --> 00:21:26.257\nthat's called a smart jack.\n\n366\n00:21:26.257 --> 00:21:28.450\nAnd again,\nthey call it a network interface unit.\n\n367\n00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.666\nBut again, it's just another\nform of network interface, and\n\n368\n00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:33.920\nit's something to be aware of for\nthe exam.\n\n369\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.575\nNow that leads me to the last\nconcept that we have to understand\n\n370\n00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:44.245\na little bit about and\nthat's something known as a CSU/DSU.\n\n371\n00:21:44.245 --> 00:21:48.246\nIn the earlier days, these CSUs,\nDSUs would be separate devices, right?\n\n372\n00:21:48.246 --> 00:21:52.409\nAnd they're called channel service\nunit and data service unit.\n\n373\n00:21:52.409 --> 00:21:55.184\nAnd one side of it would\nconnect to your DTE,\n\n374\n00:21:55.184 --> 00:21:59.090\nyour data termination equipment,\nlike a router if you will.\n\n375\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:04.045\nThe other side would connect to\nthe DCE the data circuits equipment,\n\n376\n00:22:04.045 --> 00:22:07.043\nthat's inside of the carriers network.\n\n377\n00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:10.429\nIn fact, I can kinda show you\nwhere the CSU/DSU would sit,\n\n378\n00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:13.017\nIf you're looking at the network topology.\n\n379\n00:22:13.017 --> 00:22:17.940\nToday, and for a long time now,\nyou can see that the CSU/DSUs are built\n\n380\n00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:23.046\ninto one little module, if you will,\nthat can be put right into a switch.\n\n381\n00:22:23.046 --> 00:22:28.598\nBut here it is, all right, see the CSU/DSU\nis behind the demarcation point.\n\n382\n00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:31.268\nAnd that connects to the DTE,\nthe data termination equipment.\n\n383\n00:22:31.268 --> 00:22:34.203\nIn this case, a router, if you will,\nand then the DSU again,\n\n384\n00:22:34.203 --> 00:22:37.872\nthis side is gonna connect to the DCE\ninside of the carrier's network in, and\n\n385\n00:22:37.872 --> 00:22:39.974\nthat's the data circuit equipment again.\n\n386\n00:22:39.974 --> 00:22:43.942\nSo just realize what the DSU/CSU is,\nit essentially takes that signal,\n\n387\n00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:47.273\nif you will, that's coming off\nof the customer's network.\n\n388\n00:22:47.273 --> 00:22:51.198\nAnd converts it into a signal that can be\nthen placed onto the carrier's network and\n\n389\n00:22:51.198 --> 00:22:53.003\nmoved along the carrier's network.\n\n390\n00:22:53.003 --> 00:22:56.987\nSo that's one of the last little\ncomponents to definitely be aware of, and\n\n391\n00:22:56.987 --> 00:22:58.450\nkinda know where it seats.\n\n392\n00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:03.629\nIf you were happen to give maybe\na network diagram on the exam,\n\n393\n00:23:03.629 --> 00:23:06.628\nwhich one of these is the CSU/DSU?\n\n394\n00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:09.850\nJust be able to point it out, like I\nsaid in the earlier days, they would\n\n395\n00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:13.370\nbe separate devices today, and for\na long time now they're a single device.\n\n396\n00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.875\nAnd even just a module that you could\nput inside of your network connectivity\n\n397\n00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:18.362\ndevices in your server closet.\n\n398\n00:23:18.362 --> 00:23:21.654\nSo those are some of the WAN\ntechnologies that we've been looking at.\n\n399\n00:23:21.654 --> 00:23:24.798\nAnd some of the things that you will\nneed to know for the Network+ exam.\n\n400\n00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:28.674\nAnd also it's good to know because a lot\nof times we don't see what's on the other\n\n401\n00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:32.690\nside of the street there when it comes\nto your Internet service providers.\n\n402\n00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.195\nKnow some of the channelized services,\n\n403\n00:23:34.195 --> 00:23:37.393\nknow some of the technologies that we've\ntalked about over these past few episodes.\n\n404\n00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:41.448\nSo that you'll be doing good the next\ntime, you sit your Network+ exam.\n\n405\n00:23:41.448 --> 00:23:43.892\n&gt;&gt; Well once again Wes,\nthank you for being so complete.\n\n406\n00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:46.214\nWAN Technologies,\nparts one, two, and three.\n\n407\n00:23:46.214 --> 00:23:50.095\nAnd also the entire series, of the CompTIA\nNet+, that Wes has put together for you.\n\n408\n00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:53.582\nSee them all, enjoy them all, learn from\nthem all, through the course library check\n\n409\n00:23:53.582 --> 00:23:55.868\nout the other hundreds of\nvideos that are there as well.\n\n410\n00:23:55.868 --> 00:23:58.780\nAnd they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n411\n00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.762\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro.TV, they'll be really glad you did.\n\n412\n00:24:01.762 --> 00:24:03.058\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n413\n00:24:03.058 --> 00:24:03.994\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes

00:00:29.493\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n14\n00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:34.025\nThat's right, this episode is gonna\nbe all about If we have a failure,\n\n15\n00:00:34.025 --> 00:00:39.590\nall right, can our business, can it\nmaintain whatever its operations might be?\n\n16\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.890\nAnd that's gonna be important.\n\n17\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.320\nOr if we have some kind of disaster,\nright?\n\n18\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.710\nHow can we take, if you will,\nthat area that maybe has been destroyed or\n\n19\n00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.590\ncomponents of it have been destroyed,\nhow do we maintain again our day-to-day\n\n20\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.520\noperations should\nsomething like that happen?\n\n21\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.064\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be looking at\nproactive and reactive, aren't we, Wes?\n\n22\n00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:03.650\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and some of the concepts\nthat we talk about is before hand, right?\n\n23\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.330\nJust like you said proactive, but some of\nthem will be after something has happened\n\n24\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.100\nwe gotta kinda figure out\nwhere do we go from here?\n\n25\n00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.300\nBut regardless,\nit all starts with planning.\n\n26\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.530\nSo I guess all of it's really proactive,\nright?\n\n27\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.100\nAgain, when we implement it\nsometimes might be reactive, right?\n\n28\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.250\nBut it all starts with planning.\n\n29\n00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.660\nSo let's go ahead and let's start out with\nthe very first concept that we need to be\n\n30\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.390\naware of, right?\n\n31\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.960\nThey talk about availability concepts.\n\n32\n00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.550\nWell, one of the very first things when it\ncomes to availability concepts is, well,\n\n33\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.800\na couple of terms, right?\n\n34\n00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.090\nRedundancy and fault tolerance.\n\n35\n00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.860\nNow fault tolerance is an exam objective,\nbut redundancy is not.\n\n36\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.070\nBut you do need to know that redundancy\nis how we achieve fault tolerance, right?\n\n37\n00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.660\nSo when we talk about fault tolerance,\nit's the ability of a system, the device,\n\n38\n00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.910\na network, to continue the operations,\ncontinue to operate,\n\n39\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.110\nif you will,\nin the event of some kind of failure.\n\n40\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.780\nNow when I say a system you could have a\nwhole bunch of systems that are providing\n\n41\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.460\na service, right?\n\n42\n00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.390\nSo it could be just\na component within that system,\n\n43\n00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.640\ncould be a component within a device.\n\n44\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.055\nRight, and we need to make sure that we\ncan again maintain or continue to operate.\n\n45\n00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:14.020\nNow we achieve fault tolerance\nthrough redundancy, all right?\n\n46\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.630\nAnd what is redundancy?\n\n47\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.800\nRedundancy is just having more than\none of a component or a system, right?\n\n48\n00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.370\nSo let me give you an example, because\nI keep using component, system device.\n\n49\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.830\nLet me tell you want I mean, all right?\n\n50\n00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.570\nFor instance,\nlet's go back to our A+ training.\n\n51\n00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.459\nMaybe some of you guys and\ngals out there are coming over from A+.\n\n52\n00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.306\nBut if not, you need to know a little bit\nabout something called redundant array of\n\n53\n00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:38.390\nindependent disks, right, RAID arrays.\n\n54\n00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.910\nWhy do we use RAID arrays?\n\n55\n00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.935\nWell, let's go ahead and just take\nperformance just out of the mix because\n\n56\n00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:45.633\nthat's one of the reasons that we do it,\nbut redundancy, right?\n\n57\n00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:49.073\nWe have more than one hard drive so\nthat in the event of a failure,\n\n58\n00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:51.966\nwith hard drives,\nit's not a matter of if they fail.\n\n59\n00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.405\nIt's a matter of just\nwhen they're gonna fail.\n\n60\n00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:58.452\nSo then if one of those drives fails we\nstill have access to the most important\n\n61\n00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:01.943\nthing in information technology today,\ninformation, right?\n\n62\n00:03:01.943 --> 00:03:03.560\nWe have more than one.\n\n63\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.590\nIf we have, let's say more than\none route leading into a network,\n\n64\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.160\nwhy do we have more than one\nroute leading into a network?\n\n65\n00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.860\nIsn't one route fine?\n\n66\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.340\nYeah, it is, but what if that route fails?\n\n67\n00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.880\nNow you can't communicate in and\nout of that network, right?\n\n68\n00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.593\nRedundancy in a device itself could be the\nfact that maybe we have multiple routers.\n\n69\n00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.714\nMaybe we have multiple firewalls, right?\n\n70\n00:03:25.714 --> 00:03:27.750\nWhy would we want more than one firewall?\n\n71\n00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.795\nWell, if one firewall goes offline,\nwhat happens?\n\n72\n00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.598\nYour entire system is open to attack.\n\n73\n00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:38.320\nBut if we've got two firewalls, right,\nredundancy gives us fault tolerance.\n\n74\n00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.420\n&gt;&gt; Quick question for you, Wes.\n\n75\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.320\nAre backups considered redundant?\n\n76\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.930\nIs that redundancy, having backups?\n\n77\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.120\n&gt;&gt; No, backups I would say are just\na protection in case of a failure, right?\n\n78\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.307\nIt should be a part of system maintenance,\ntoo, just normal system maintenance.\n\n79\n00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:57.951\nBut backups are a part of\nbusiness continuity, I could say.\n\n80\n00:03:57.951 --> 00:04:02.413\nBut what you need to understand, though,\nis that I back my information up, right?\n\n81\n00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:05.255\nWe get a copy of the most\ncritical information so\n\n82\n00:04:05.255 --> 00:04:08.032\nthat if a system does fail,\nwe can restore it.\n\n83\n00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:11.231\nAll right, and we're gonna get in to\nback ups here coming up because they\n\n84\n00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.482\nare important and there are some things\nthat you have to know about backups\n\n85\n00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:16.382\nincluding things like types, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:16.382 --> 00:04:18.548\nSo fault tolerance and\nredundancy, remember that,\n\n87\n00:04:18.548 --> 00:04:21.110\nthey're not the same thing but\none is how we achieve the other.\n\n88\n00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.355\nRedundancy having more than one\nof something is how we achieve\n\n89\n00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:26.010\nfault tolerance.\n\n90\n00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.793\nNow we also got a term\nknown as high availability.\n\n91\n00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:31.677\nI want you to be aware of\nhigh availability, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:35.839\nSo high availability is any system,if you\nwill, that can maintain continuity of\n\n93\n00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.470\noperations without a failure for\na long duration of time.\n\n94\n00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.230\nAll right, these services are typically\ntested for durability, if you will.\n\n95\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.650\nA lot of effort is made, if you will,\nto ensure things like the redundancy,\n\n96\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.549\nmore than one, and\nthe fault tolerance that we can\n\n97\n00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:54.954\nwithstand a foreseeable component failure,\nall right?\n\n98\n00:04:54.954 --> 00:04:58.321\nNow depending on something\nknown as your SLA, all right,\n\n99\n00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:03.490\nyour service-level agreement, will dictate\nhow much availability you have, right?\n\n100\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.623\nSee, high availability is actually\na metric, if you will, all right?\n\n101\n00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:12.358\nAnd that metric says,\nhow close can we get to 100% uptime?\n\n102\n00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:16.550\nNow, if money's no object, well,\nthen you'd probably stay up 100% of\n\n103\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.770\nthe time when we talk about\navailability to a service, right?\n\n104\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.368\nBut it's very, very expensive.\n\n105\n00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:26.987\nSo it's not realistic to say\n100% availability, all right?\n\n106\n00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:29.969\nHigh availability again is\nthat metric that tells you\n\n107\n00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.496\nhow close to 100% availability you get.\n\n108\n00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:34.354\nAnd there are different metrics,\nall right?\n\n109\n00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:36.812\nSo I got a little chart here\nthat I wanna kinda talk about so\n\n110\n00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:39.905\nyou understand what we mean when we\nsay high availability, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:44.377\nWe have what's known as the 99% all right,\nor the 9s,\n\n112\n00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:47.766\nif you will, as they might call it, right?\n\n113\n00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:54.047\nAnd if we look we look at 99% uptime,\nright, the two nine availability, right?\n\n114\n00:05:54.047 --> 00:06:00.840\nThis is again just your how\nclose to 100% complete uptime.\n\n115\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.390\nNo interruptions, no, I can't say delays\nbut no interruptions of service at all.\n\n116\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.864\nAll right, well, your SLA,\nyour service level agreement.\n\n117\n00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:14.565\nBy the way, service level agreement,\nreal quick, is just the minimum level\n\n118\n00:06:14.565 --> 00:06:18.977\nof acceptable performance that\na service provider an give you, again,\n\n119\n00:06:18.977 --> 00:06:20.590\naccording to a contract.\n\n120\n00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.600\nAnd then things like, what are the\nrequirements of that service provider\n\n121\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.140\nshould they fail to give you\nthat level of service, right?\n\n122\n00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.705\nSo if you have a 99 or\ntwo nines, 99% uptime,\n\n123\n00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:41.010\nthen what you see is that downtime per\nyear Is around 3.65 days, all right?\n\n124\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.189\nNow that's not acceptable for\na lot of people,\n\n125\n00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.964\ncuz I want you to think of a company that\nmakes $1 million an hour on online sales.\n\n126\n00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:47.594\n&gt;&gt; Like?\n\n127\n00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:49.375\n&gt;&gt; All right, I will tell you.\n\n128\n00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.892\n&gt;&gt; Starts with an A.\n\n129\n00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:51.720\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right?\n\n130\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.270\nLike Amazon, absolutely.\n\n131\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.451\nSo let's take Amazon, right?\n\n132\n00:06:55.451 --> 00:07:02.764\nSo if Amazon is offline for three days,\nmillions of dollars that they've lost.\n\n133\n00:07:02.764 --> 00:07:03.542\n&gt;&gt; Maybe more.\n\n134\n00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:07.130\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Zack, so\nthat's probably not acceptable.\n\n135\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.410\nBut you know the metric, right?\n\n136\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.550\nDowntime per month, about 7.2 hours.\n\n137\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.573\nAnd again, now we're at $10 million now or\nmaybe they might lose, I don't know.\n\n138\n00:07:16.573 --> 00:07:18.269\nI'm just throwing numbers at you, right?\n\n139\n00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:20.875\n$1 million an hour,\nthey're gonna lose $7 million in 7 hours.\n\n140\n00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.412\nProbably, like you said,\na lot more than that.\n\n141\n00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:27.631\nWhat's the downtime per\nweek at 99% uptime?\n\n142\n00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:29.863\nWell, that's 1.6 hours, right?\n\n143\n00:07:29.863 --> 00:07:32.219\nBut notice as these number increase, and\n\n144\n00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:37.002\nI'm not gonna go through every one here\nbecause there's one that's highlighted in\n\n145\n00:07:37.002 --> 00:07:41.513\nblue that's really what is just about\nthe most availability that any company,\n\n146\n00:07:41.513 --> 00:07:45.060\nreally, any service provider\ncan really give you, right?\n\n147\n00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.718\nAll these other ones you will see\nare typically where below that.\n\n148\n00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:53.740\nAnd that's the nines,\nthe five nines, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.917\nThe five nines is true high availability,\nall right?\n\n150\n00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:01.143\nAnd this is about the closest that\nmany service providers can get.\n\n151\n00:08:01.143 --> 00:08:06.368\nAnd a lot of them won't even give you,\ntheir SLA will say, hey We're not\n\n152\n00:08:06.368 --> 00:08:12.860\nguaranteeing you that you'll only have\n5.6 minutes downtime a year, all right?\n\n153\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.770\nThat means in one month for\n\n154\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.810\n25 seconds just under 30 seconds,\nyou won't have access to a service or\n\n155\n00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.620\nin a week you'll have 6 seconds that you\ndon't have access to that service, right?\n\n156\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.480\nThat's five nines.\n\n157\n00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.620\nSo know that the five nines is about as\nclose about higher availability as you can\n\n158\n00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.660\nget because when you look at six nines\nnow we're down to 31.5 seconds per year\n\n159\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.210\nthat you won't have access to\nwhatever the service provider is.\n\n160\n00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.890\nThink about things like the cloud, right?\n\n161\n00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.930\nWe have cloud based resources that we\nneed access to them to ensure that our\n\n162\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.535\nbusiness survives.\n\n163\n00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:50.210\nWell, cloud based providers, you mentioned\nAmazon, AWS, if you will, Azure Microsoft.\n\n164\n00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.190\nWe're gonna look at some of their\nSLAs as we need to look and\n\n165\n00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.560\nkinda understand some of the components\nwithin the SLA a little bit later.\n\n166\n00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.140\nThis is high availability and\nwe want you to know five nines,\n\n167\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.097\nagain, 5.26 minutes per year downtime,\n\n168\n00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:12.820\n25.9 seconds per month,\ndowntime per week is around 6.05 seconds.\n\n169\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.740\nAll right, so that is high availability.\n\n170\n00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.780\nAll right, now,\nthe next topic that we got to talk about.\n\n171\n00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.520\nWe do have to know, and we've kind of\ntalked about this in other episodes.\n\n172\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.485\nAnd that is something\nknown as load balancing.\n\n173\n00:09:25.485 --> 00:09:29.115\nAnd why is load balancing important to us?\n\n174\n00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:32.720\nWell, when we're talking\nabout high availability,\n\n175\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.720\nwhen it comes to load balancing,\nunderstand that load balancing is just\n\n176\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.070\nabout distributing the services\nthat are provided,\n\n177\n00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:47.703\nthe workload that it takes to provide that\nservice, across more than one machine.\n\n178\n00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:52.260\nAll right, again, we've talked about it in\nanother episode but when it has to do with\n\n179\n00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.900\nhigh availability, one of the ways that\nwe can do that is with load balancing.\n\n180\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.590\nNow the other thing is clustering and\nclustering is an interesting concept.\n\n181\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.990\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here.\n\n182\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.080\nClustering can give you high availability.\n\n183\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.700\nIt can give you fault tolerance,\nif you will, because what we do is we take\n\n184\n00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.040\nmore than one server and\nwe combine them together.\n\n185\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.140\nAnd I don't mean squish them together, but\n\n186\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.240\nwhat we do is we combine their\ncomputational power, the memory,\n\n187\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.860\nthe storage, and we put them in\na group where they work together.\n\n188\n00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.220\nThink of all of these\nservers as all holding hands,\n\n189\n00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.320\nbeing a gigantic multitasker.\n\n190\n00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.690\nSo, for instance,\nif I have a web page, all right?.\n\n191\n00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.400\nAnd let's take somebody like Amazon,\nagain, we talk about high availability,\n\n192\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.830\nthey want you to be able to\npurchase their product, right?.\n\n193\n00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.470\nBut you go to their website and\nit's offline.\n\n194\n00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.282\nOr it just takes a few seconds.\n\n195\n00:10:45.282 --> 00:10:48.920\nI know faster computers get\nthe more impatient I get.\n\n196\n00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.500\nAnd if I have to wait for\n\n197\n00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.550\na webpage to render and it takes awhile,\nI might go to another site.\n\n198\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.310\nNow Amazon's so big now that I'll\nprobably just bear with it and\n\n199\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.160\nkind of grit my teeth and\nmaybe complain a little bit.\n\n200\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.485\nBut if you're a small business, if you're\na medium business, and your large business\n\n201\n00:11:04.485 --> 00:11:07.530\nthat maybe is not Amazon,\nthat could cost you a lot of money.\n\n202\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.770\nSo if you can take, let's say, you're\nproviding a service like a website, and\n\n203\n00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.016\nyou can get seven, eight web servers?\n\n204\n00:11:16.016 --> 00:11:19.900\nAnd if they are all providing that\nweb server functionality, and\n\n205\n00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.178\none goes offline, oops,\nthat is not what I meant to do.\n\n206\n00:11:23.178 --> 00:11:27.860\nOne goes offine, that's okay, I just\nlost server seven in the cluster, but\n\n207\n00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.250\nguess what, I still have six other or\n\n208\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.860\nseven other servers that are providing\naccess to that web page.\n\n209\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.670\nAll right, another server goes offline.\n\n210\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.660\nThat's okay, right?\n\n211\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.480\nBecause I still have six other servers,\nright?\n\n212\n00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.940\nSo the clustering allows you to group\ndevices together that are providing\n\n213\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.330\na essential resources so\n\n214\n00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.300\nthat if one goes offline,\nyou still have access to the resource.\n\n215\n00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.220\nNow, a lot of times what you'll see\nis we'll actually combine things like\n\n216\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.105\nclustering and\nload balancing together, right?\n\n217\n00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:01.210\nAnd again the same slide that\nwe've used in another episode but\n\n218\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.590\nto understand that we might\nhave the cluster here and\n\n219\n00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.050\nwhat I'm doing is load balancing\nin front of the cluster that says,\n\n220\n00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.850\nhey, Zach when you visit the web\npage you're gonna go ahead and\n\n221\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.730\nyou're gonna actually visit the web\npage from server one, right?\n\n222\n00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.930\nAnd when this user visits the web page,\nthey might be on server eight.\n\n223\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.390\nBecause we're not only load balancing,\ndistributing the load across\n\n224\n00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:30.180\nall of these web servers, but we're also\ndistributing it across the cluster too.\n\n225\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.330\nSo we get availability\nthrough load balancing.\n\n226\n00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.240\nWe get availability and\nperformance out of the clustering as well.\n\n227\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.810\nAnd what's great about\nclustering is that when you have\n\n228\n00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.710\na clustering software, right?\n\n229\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.410\nYou have some kinda clustering manager,\n\n230\n00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.890\nwhat these servers do is they actually\ncommunicate with one another.\n\n231\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.858\nAll right, and server 1 tells\nthat the clustering software and\n\n232\n00:12:52.858 --> 00:12:55.240\nall these severs do, hey, I'm still here.\n\n233\n00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.410\nHey I'm still here,\nit's called a heartbeat, right?\n\n234\n00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.930\nAnd if the clustering\nsoftware doesn't see,\n\n235\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.960\nif you will, that a server has checked in,\nI can't hear that heartbeat anymore.\n\n236\n00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.803\nThen we assume after a certain point,\nbased on its configuration and\n\n237\n00:13:08.803 --> 00:13:11.650\nwe've got more episodes that you\nshould definitely check out.\n\n238\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.170\nThat go into things like advance\nclustering services that says,\n\n239\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.010\nhey, it's no longer online.\n\n240\n00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.800\nI'm gonna consider it not\na part of the cluster and\n\n241\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.110\nwe're gonna have to move any resources\nthat that server was providing\n\n242\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.067\nto another server within the cluster,\nright?\n\n243\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.470\nSo great things to have.\n\n244\n00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.710\nIt's usually expensive implementation\ncuz you have to have more than one.\n\n245\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.749\nAgain, remember, redundancy, more than\none is giving us our fault tolerance.\n\n246\n00:13:34.749 --> 00:13:40.451\nWe distribute, through load balancing,\nthe workload across multiple devices and\n\n247\n00:13:40.451 --> 00:13:43.997\nnow we're not overburdening\njust a single device.\n\n248\n00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:49.196\nSame thing with clustering too, I don't\nwant the webpage being served up from\n\n249\n00:13:49.196 --> 00:13:55.110\na single server if there's 10,000 people\nvisiting it within the last hour.\n\n250\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.920\nI want to distribute it across\nthe nodes within the cluster.\n\n251\n00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.360\nAll right, so great technology to have.\n\n252\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.780\nUnderstand what load balancing and\nyour clustering does for you.\n\n253\n00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.220\n&gt;&gt; So clustering is, in fact,\na form of redundancy.\n\n254\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.930\n&gt;&gt; It is, absolutely, yes, exactly.\n\n255\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.940\nAnd again, it's done for\ndifferent reasons, all right?\n\n256\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.390\nA lot of times it's done for\nperformance and fault tolerance as well.\n\n257\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.940\nBut how you set it up, is based on you.\n\n258\n00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.940\nAnd again, I don't think they\nare going to ask you, by any means,\n\n259\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.210\non how to set up a cluster.\n\n260\n00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.490\nBut they might ask you,\nwhat is the purpose of the cluster.\n\n261\n00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.380\nWhat is the cluster doing?\n\n262\n00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.940\nAgain, more than one device providing\na resource, if you will, and\n\n263\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.360\nthey all communicate with each other\ntypically through some kind of clustering\n\n264\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.380\nmanagement software, if you will.\n\n265\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.940\n&gt;&gt; Make sense.\n\n266\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.720\n&gt;&gt; All right, now that takes care of some\n\n267\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.850\nof the introductory topics\nthat we have to talk about.\n\n268\n00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.880\nBut availability concepts don't\nreally just stop there, all right?\n\n269\n00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.810\nWe also have something known as\nport aggregation, all right?\n\n270\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.850\nAnd when we talk about port aggregation,\nwhat do we mean, all right?\n\n271\n00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.980\nAnytime we talk about aggregation we're\ntalking about combining more than\n\n272\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.690\none of something for\na couple of different reasons.\n\n273\n00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.996\nCould be for performance gain, could\nbe for fault tolerance gain, all right?\n\n274\n00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:14.259\nSo, I want you to think of, for instance,\nif I have, let's say, if I have a,\n\n275\n00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:16.398\nI don't know, let's say,\nif I had a single link.\n\n276\n00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.900\nLet me go ahead and show you, right?\n\n277\n00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:29.120\nLet's say that I have got ports on a\nswitch, and I have got a two 1 gig ports.\n\n278\n00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.840\nWell, if I slap in two network\nadapters into this server and\n\n279\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.980\nI connect one of the NICs, or\nthe network interface cards,\n\n280\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.680\nto port 1, connect another\nnetwork interface to port 2 and\n\n281\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.070\nthen we aggregate or\nbond these ports together.\n\n282\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.420\nNotice what's happening here, right?\n\n283\n00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.272\nWe've got one link that's\noperating at 1 gig.\n\n284\n00:15:51.272 --> 00:15:54.013\nWe've got another link\nthat's operating at a gig.\n\n285\n00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:56.003\nAnd if I combine these together,\n\n286\n00:15:56.003 --> 00:15:59.840\nI can get a performance gain\nbecause what ends up happening, and\n\n287\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.977\nlet me just stay here because I need\nto talk about NIC teaming as well.\n\n288\n00:16:03.977 --> 00:16:08.988\nAnd a lot of times you're gonna see that\nThese are sometimes performed together,\n\n289\n00:16:08.988 --> 00:16:09.504\nright?\n\n290\n00:16:09.504 --> 00:16:13.987\nBut notice that I have the ability with\nthese two network adapters in a single\n\n291\n00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:16.940\ndevice that are connected\nto two separate ports.\n\n292\n00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.680\nWell I can aggregate those ports together,\nright?\n\n293\n00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.940\nWe'll tell you why here in a second coming\nup and we'll kinda tie this together.\n\n294\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.391\nBecause when we've got two\nof these NICs together,\n\n295\n00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.239\nthat's what's known as NIC teaming.\n\n296\n00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:30.820\nAnd that is a concept that you\nhave to be aware of too, right?\n\n297\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:36.310\nNIC teaming is where we take\ntwo network adapters, right?\n\n298\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.790\nAnd we basically do the same thing,\nwe bond them together.\n\n299\n00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.330\nAnd now instead of one network adapter,\nI've got two links coming out of two\n\n300\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:49.360\nseparate network adapters that we could\nconfigure for different reasons as well.\n\n301\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.989\nSo you could say, NIC Teaming,\nI've seen it NIC bonding.\n\n302\n00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:58.080\nI've seen NIC aggregation,\nyou might hear, again port aggregation.\n\n303\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.560\nOne of the reasons I mention link\nis I have heard it called link\n\n304\n00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.890\naggregation, right?\n\n305\n00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.315\nSo don't let those terms fool you,\nall right?\n\n306\n00:17:06.315 --> 00:17:08.965\nNow let me tell you why we would\ndo something like NIC teaming and\n\n307\n00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:12.595\nport aggregation a little bit more here,\nall right?\n\n308\n00:17:12.595 --> 00:17:14.715\nOne is for performance, all right?\n\n309\n00:17:14.715 --> 00:17:18.465\nNotice that what we did is again,\nwe had two links, right?\n\n310\n00:17:18.465 --> 00:17:22.765\n1 gig link here,\nwe have a 1 gig link here.\n\n311\n00:17:22.765 --> 00:17:27.250\nWell, if I configure these and\nbond them or aggregate them together,\n\n312\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:33.200\nthen what I essentially have is\na 2 gigabit link, a single link.\n\n313\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.010\nIt can be seen as a 2 gig link,\nnow that's for performance, right?\n\n314\n00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.510\nBecause I've got one gig that I can use,\nwe could do like a full duplex\n\n315\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.930\ncommunication where one of the network\nadapters is for a gigabit outbound.\n\n316\n00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.460\nAnd one of the network adapters is for\ngigabit inbound.\n\n317\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.700\nSo essentially we have a full duplex\ncommunication operating at 2 gigs, right,\n\n318\n00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.560\nso for performance.\n\n319\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.240\nBut remember, this isn't just about\nthe performance side of things,\n\n320\n00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.500\nit can also be for fault tolerance, right?\n\n321\n00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.330\nSo for instance, notice what we have here.\n\n322\n00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:10.410\nIf we can configure this same way,\nwe've got port aggregation on one side.\n\n323\n00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.593\nWe've got NIC teaming on the other,\nall right?\n\n324\n00:18:12.593 --> 00:18:17.585\nAnd we configure these in what's\nknown as an active passive.\n\n325\n00:18:17.585 --> 00:18:20.207\nSame thing we talked about when we\ntalked about load balancers, right?\n\n326\n00:18:20.207 --> 00:18:24.435\nOne load balancer might be turned on and\ndoing the load balancing.\n\n327\n00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:27.945\nAnd it's in an active state where\nthe other one's passively just waiting for\n\n328\n00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.891\na failure to happen and then it initiates.\n\n329\n00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:31.560\nWell, the same thing goes here.\n\n330\n00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.834\nWe can put our network adapters\nin an active-passive situation.\n\n331\n00:18:35.834 --> 00:18:39.367\nSo what that means is that this\nnetwork adapter is actually sending\n\n332\n00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:42.030\nthe information and\nreceiving the information.\n\n333\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.750\nNow, understand that this doesn't give\nyou any of the performance game right?\n\n334\n00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.214\nAll right,\nbecause only one network adapter sending,\n\n335\n00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:51.004\nreceiving communication while\nthe other one is just waiting.\n\n336\n00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:54.498\nJust like no, no, I'm listening now,\nl'm just waiting,\n\n337\n00:18:54.498 --> 00:18:56.492\nl'm just here chilling, right?\n\n338\n00:18:56.492 --> 00:18:57.714\nBut then what happens?\n\n339\n00:18:57.714 --> 00:19:02.539\nAll right, in this NIC teaming sense,\nif we're doing this for fault tolerance.\n\n340\n00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:05.474\nIf one of these network adapters fails,\n\n341\n00:19:05.474 --> 00:19:10.237\nwell then what happens is since\nthis network adapter has failed.\n\n342\n00:19:10.237 --> 00:19:15.590\nThe link is no longer available,\nthe other one becomes active, all right?\n\n343\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.555\nAnd when the other one becomes active,\nit takes over where the first one failed,\n\n344\n00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:23.782\nand continues to provide\nwhatever that service is.\n\n345\n00:19:23.782 --> 00:19:29.082\nSo remember, redundancy,\nredundancy, more than one,\n\n346\n00:19:29.082 --> 00:19:33.430\ngives you is how you\nobtain fault tolerance.\n\n347\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.920\nAnd even more so when we have something\nlike this, we can turn around.\n\n348\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.390\nAnd when this network adapter is brought\nback online for whatever reason,\n\n349\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.520\nwhether it's replaced or\nwhatever happened.\n\n350\n00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.010\nIt can go into a passive state, and\nthis one stays in the active state and\n\n351\n00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.390\nit continues to do a job.\n\n352\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.117\nJust like when the failure happened,\nbut the difference is now,\n\n353\n00:19:54.117 --> 00:19:57.182\nif we lose that network adapter,\nwell what happens?\n\n354\n00:19:57.182 --> 00:20:01.641\nWell this one is no longer passive now and\nthis one goes to active, right?\n\n355\n00:20:01.641 --> 00:20:02.420\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n356\n00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.446\n&gt;&gt; So basically we've got that one now\ntaking over where the failed network\n\n357\n00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:07.504\nadapter left off.\n\n358\n00:20:07.504 --> 00:20:11.580\nSo that's how we're achieving\nthe fault tolerance, right?\n\n359\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.593\nNow, I did want to, let me scroll\nback up here, link aggregation\n\n360\n00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:21.632\nis sometimes defined in\nthe Ethernet standard as 802.3ad.\n\n361\n00:20:21.632 --> 00:20:24.600\nI want you to know that for\nthe exam, right?\n\n362\n00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.900\nThere's something known as\nLink Aggregation Control Protocol.\n\n363\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.682\nAll right, that's what you're gonna see,\nthat's the IEEE standardization for\n\n364\n00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:34.610\nlink aggregation.\n\n365\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.530\nSo not sure if they're\ngonna ask you on the exam.\n\n366\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.131\nBut if you're gonna be talking\nabout things like port aggregation,\n\n367\n00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:46.062\nNIC teaming if you will,\nagain link aggregation, know the 802.3.\n\n368\n00:20:46.062 --> 00:20:53.853\nAll right, now that is a little bit\nabout some of the availability concepts.\n\n369\n00:20:53.853 --> 00:20:57.359\nBut we don't really stop there when\nit comes to availability concepts.\n\n370\n00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.133\nWe've got some other things that\nwe need to keep in mind too.\n\n371\n00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:03.372\nAnd they call out things like\npower management, right?\n\n372\n00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:07.731\nSo power management,\nwe need some fault tolerance in our,\n\n373\n00:21:07.731 --> 00:21:12.017\nbasically the thing that runs\nall of our devices, right?\n\n374\n00:21:12.017 --> 00:21:14.560\nI could have NIC teaming, right?\n\n375\n00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.280\nI could have port aggregation, right?\n\n376\n00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.560\nI could have load balancing.\n\n377\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.900\nI could have things like clustering.\n\n378\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.240\nBut what happens if the power goes off?\n\n379\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.232\nWell, we have none of that.\n\n380\n00:21:24.232 --> 00:21:25.010\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n381\n00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.554\n&gt;&gt; Get the gerbils on the wheels, quickly.\n\n382\n00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:28.493\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, absolutely.\n\n383\n00:21:28.493 --> 00:21:32.170\nSomebody's gonna be on their\nfitness bike powering everything.\n\n384\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.180\nJust kidding, so what we need is we also\nneed redundancy in our power, right?\n\n385\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.200\nSo power management,\n\n386\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.370\nwe have to implement some kind of\nredundancy to get fault tolerance.\n\n387\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.820\nAnd there's a few different ways\nthat you can do this, right?\n\n388\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.760\nOne of the things that they call\nout is something known as battery\n\n389\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.840\nbackups, all right?\n\n390\n00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.560\nMore commonly we're gonna talk about UPSs,\nall right?\n\n391\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.160\nUPS, we're not talking\nabout a delivery service.\n\n392\n00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.010\nWhat we're talking about here is something\nknown as an uninterruptible power supply.\n\n393\n00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.310\nUninterruptible power supply,\nso what does that mean, right?\n\n394\n00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.590\nWhy would we need an uninterruptible\npower supply, all right?\n\n395\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:08.430\nWell, understand that when you turn\nyour systems off intentionally,\n\n396\n00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.180\nthose are called graceful shutdowns,\nall right?\n\n397\n00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.690\nAnd we've gotta kinda understand that to\nunderstand what the UPS is actually doing\n\n398\n00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:14.409\nfor us, right?\n\n399\n00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.830\nWhen you power a system down\nunder its own means, right?\n\n400\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.260\nSo for instance I go into a Windows\nserver and I shut it down.\n\n401\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.976\nAnd I give whatever the reason is\nthat it requires me to shut down.\n\n402\n00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:29.610\nI am doing what's known as\na graceful shutdown, all right?\n\n403\n00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.505\nThat's important because that\nhelps to protect my data,\n\n404\n00:22:32.505 --> 00:22:34.523\nwhen we do graceful shutdowns, right?\n\n405\n00:22:34.523 --> 00:22:36.813\nAnd you have things like journal\nfile systems, if you will.\n\n406\n00:22:36.813 --> 00:22:39.836\nYou have a database if you will\nthat has a lot of different logs,\n\n407\n00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:41.619\ntransaction logs that's going on.\n\n408\n00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:43.860\nIt's got the database,\ndon't wanna get it corrupted.\n\n409\n00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.546\nWhen you shut it down gracefully, the\noperating system says all right we need to\n\n410\n00:22:48.546 --> 00:22:52.845\nstop all the writes that are going on\nto this file, to this database, right?\n\n411\n00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:55.051\nTo the operating system, to the page file.\n\n412\n00:22:55.051 --> 00:22:56.949\nWe need to shut everything down, and\n\n413\n00:22:56.949 --> 00:23:00.760\nwhen we do that we'll maintain\nthe integrity of all of that information.\n\n414\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.450\nThat is the polar opposite of what's known\nas a kernel power failure, right, or\n\n415\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:07.610\nany power failure really.\n\n416\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.440\nWhen we're talking about operating\nsystems is critical kernel power failure.\n\n417\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.257\nCuz what happens is your device might be\nin the middle of a write operation to\n\n418\n00:23:14.257 --> 00:23:16.147\nthe hard disk, hard drive, right?\n\n419\n00:23:16.147 --> 00:23:18.143\nOr whatever the storage array\nmight be that you're using.\n\n420\n00:23:18.143 --> 00:23:20.930\nAnd the problem with that is,\nif we're writing.\n\n421\n00:23:22.754 --> 00:23:24.918\nBoy, if we had left\nthat episode like this,\n\n422\n00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:27.460\nit would be like the Sopranos ending,\nright?\n\n423\n00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.860\nWe wouldn't know what's going on.\n\n424\n00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.550\nBut worse than that, is we'd end\nup getting file corruption, right?\n\n425\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.680\nNow, we don't want that.\n\n426\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.450\nSo an uninterruptible power supply\nis a battery backup if you will,\n\n427\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.055\nthat allows your systems to perform\ngraceful shutdowns, all right.\n\n428\n00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:47.520\nHere's what a UPS is not for, to\n\n429\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.220\npower your systems until your electrical\ncompany brings the power back online.\n\n430\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.421\nIt's not what it's for, all right?\n\n431\n00:23:54.421 --> 00:23:59.329\nIt is to maintain a great, or actually\njust to when the power kicks over to\n\n432\n00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:04.076\ngive you a long enough A long enough\ntime span, I guess you'd save your\n\n433\n00:24:04.076 --> 00:24:08.521\npower to perform a graceful shutdown,\nto shut the devices down.\n\n434\n00:24:08.521 --> 00:24:11.445\nAnd you might have some kind of\ntrigger event that says, hey,\n\n435\n00:24:11.445 --> 00:24:14.932\nthe moment I'm on a battery backup,\nthe moment I'm on a UPS, go ahead and\n\n436\n00:24:14.932 --> 00:24:18.950\nstart shutting these systems down and\nwhatever their volatility might be, right?\n\n437\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.400\nWhatever is most crucial,\nshut down, right?\n\n438\n00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.430\nPerform the graceful shutdown, right?\n\n439\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:29.740\nNow if you need a little bit more\ntime [LAUGH] as far as power goes,\n\n440\n00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.150\nwell you might go a little bit farther.\n\n441\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.130\nUPS is not gonna be the way you go.\n\n442\n00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:34.300\nYou might need a power generator.\n\n443\n00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.220\nNow power generators aren't so\nmuch necessarily to do graceful shutdowns.\n\n444\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.510\nThey continue to power your devices and\n\n445\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.900\nif you have mission critical systems that\nmight be something that your company has.\n\n446\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.870\nFor instance, take somebody as\nbig as Amazon, big as Azure,\n\n447\n00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.060\nMicrosoft Azure, all right.\n\n448\n00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.640\nAWS has one of biggest if not\nthe biggest redundancy and\n\n449\n00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.360\nfault tolerance system in the world.\n\n450\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.490\nI mean they have entire geographical\nregions that fail over to\n\n451\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.550\nelectrical grids right and\nare well beyond that.\n\n452\n00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.650\nFacebook is one that\nIs pretty interesting.\n\n453\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.740\nThey have one of the most\nredundant systems out there,\n\n454\n00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.740\nbecause they add, gosh,\nI don't know how much,\n\n455\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.430\nthousands of servers a day, a day-\n&gt;&gt; A day.\n\n456\n00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.110\n&gt;&gt; Is how big they are expanding daily.\n\n457\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.920\nAll right, they have generators out there\n\n458\n00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.220\nthat are big enough that could power 700\nhouses for a month, just one of them.\n\n459\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.055\nAnd there's 20 of them 30 of\nthem just on a single building.\n\n460\n00:25:38.055 --> 00:25:40.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right it's absolutely insane.\n\n461\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.100\n&gt;&gt; They're not taking any chances.\n\n462\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.200\n&gt;&gt; No they're definitely not.\n\n463\n00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; Now there's a type of generator\n\n464\n00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.160\nyou wanna be careful about.\n\n465\n00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.710\nRemember when we talked about computer\ncircuitry and this kind of goes back to\n\n466\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.198\nyour A+ training, right,\nremember that your network devices,\n\n467\n00:25:52.198 --> 00:25:54.657\nall your computing equipment\noperates on direct current, right.\n\n468\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:26:00.320\nYour computing components, they don´t\ndo well with frequency variations.\n\n469\n00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.860\nIt's why we don't use alternating current.\n\n470\n00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.640\nWell we do to bring the power source in\nand then we run it through a converter and\n\n471\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.800\nit converts it over to direct current,\nright to DC.\n\n472\n00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:13.040\nNow, you don't wanna be using things\nlike gasoline generators, all right?\n\n473\n00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.990\nWhy, well gasoline generators provide\na pretty big power fluctuation, right?\n\n474\n00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.540\nAnd any of you that have\never been around when,\n\n475\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.490\nI know I used to be a commercial\npainter before I got into IT.\n\n476\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.870\nWe'd go out to a job site\nthat didn't have any power.\n\n477\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:31.550\nWe still needed to run\nan airless spray gun, right.\n\n478\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:35.710\nWell, every time that the gasoline\ngenerator would go on,\n\n479\n00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.610\nif you had your hand on that trigger\nthat when you were spraying right,\n\n480\n00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.010\nyou could notice a very sizable\ndrop in the pressure sometimes.\n\n481\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.410\nYou would hear the gasoline generator bog\ndown and then it would kind of spin up and\n\n482\n00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.020\ngain its power back right.\n\n483\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.600\nWell, that's a frequency variation\nthat circuitry's not gonna do well.\n\n484\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:59.870\nThe airless might do just fine it'll build\nup enough compression it'll tolerate that.\n\n485\n00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.380\nSo you don't wanna use\ngasoline generators.\n\n486\n00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.920\nMost often these are diesel generators\nthat they use so do keep that in mind.\n\n487\n00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.310\nIf they give you that option on the exam,\n\n488\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.690\nwhich one are you gonna\nuse over the other?\n\n489\n00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.480\nGonna wanna use the diesel generator.\n\n490\n00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.860\nNow the other thing is redundant circuits.\n\n491\n00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.120\nRemember that we use that a lot in\nthings like server closets, right.\n\n492\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.120\nAnd speaking of server closets,\nredundant power supplies,\n\n493\n00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.560\nin fact I've got a picture of\na redundant power adapter.\n\n494\n00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.080\nYou can see this one right here,\nit's a quick change, right?\n\n495\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.570\nNotice that there are two\npower supplies here.\n\n496\n00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.720\n&gt;&gt; Yeah!\n&gt;&gt; Right, and they also have two plugs,\n\n497\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.440\nand this is so you can daisy-chain, but\nyou might find that you have not only\n\n498\n00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.330\nredundant power supplies or\ndual power supplies.\n\n499\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.100\nBut not only do I have more\nthan one power supply,\n\n500\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.240\neach one of these power supplies is\nplugged into the separate circuit.\n\n501\n00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.220\nBecause here's what doesn't make sense.\n\n502\n00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.610\nIf I have two power supplies and\n\n503\n00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:03.020\nI've spent the money to be redundant\nto try to achieve full tolerance,\n\n504\n00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.290\nand I plug both of those power supplies\ninto the same electrical circuit.\n\n505\n00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.750\nWhat happens when that circuit goes bad?\n\n506\n00:28:09.905 --> 00:28:12.790\nDoesn't matter that I have two power\nsupplies, if both power supplies.\n\n507\n00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.650\nThat´s right.\n\n508\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.270\nSo what do we do?\n\n509\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.570\nWe have redundant circuits.\n\n510\n00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.990\nI plug one of the power\nsupplies into once circuit.\n\n511\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:24.110\nI plug the other power supply\ninto the other circuit.\n\n512\n00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.880\nSo now,\nI've achieved fault tolerance, right.\n\n513\n00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.941\nBecause, not only if one of those power\nsupplies goes bad, but, if one of\n\n514\n00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:36.550\nthe circuits behind that power supply\ngoes bad, we're still online, right?\n\n515\n00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.350\nWe still have our direct current\nrunning into our devices.\n\n516\n00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.020\n&gt;&gt; Makes perfect sense.\n\n517\n00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.140\n&gt;&gt; And these are some of the things.\n\n518\n00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.203\nAnd, you know, Zach,\nI'm looking at the time.\n\n519\n00:28:46.203 --> 00:28:49.544\nZach's telling me might have to wrap this\none up here, but we've got a lot more to\n\n520\n00:28:49.544 --> 00:28:52.840\ntalk about when it comes to business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery.\n\n521\n00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.990\nBut it does look like we're gonna\nhave to save that for another time.\n\n522\n00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.520\n&gt;&gt; But awesome information as always\nWes I'm looking forward to part two of\n\n523\n00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.920\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery.\n\n524\n00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.180\nAnd see everything in the CompTIA Net+\nseries that Wes has put together for\n\n525\n00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.950\nyou and while you're in the course library\nhundreds of other videos all designed to\n\n526\n00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.740\nhelp you do one thing, go much further.\n\n527\n00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.170\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n528\n00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.140\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n529\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:16.940\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n530\n00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.740\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n531\n00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching,\nwe'll see you soon.\n\n532\n00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:26.393\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:29:26.393 --> 00:29:29.685\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.191\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.001\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.305\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.234\nwatching ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.550\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA and Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.550\nAnd this is Remote Access Methods,\nPart III.\n\n9\n00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.110\nAnd Wes Bryan has returned\nto help us out with this.\n\n10\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.180\nWes, great to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back.\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.786\nThat's right, we've got a lot of ways\nthat we can connect to our devices or\n\n13\n00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:34.803\nour computers.\n\n14\n00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:37.503\nAnd while we're not in the same\nphysical location as those computers,\n\n15\n00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.923\nremember that's what we've been looking at\nas we've been talking over the last, well,\n\n16\n00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:44.000\nI guess we're working on a trilogy here,\nthe first couple of episodes, right?\n\n17\n00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.687\nWe talked about VPN communication, showed\nyou a little bit about one of the oldies\n\n18\n00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:49.458\nthat is still around out there, PPTP.\n\n19\n00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:53.791\nWe also showed you L2TP, and IPSEC, and\nshowed you with a packet capture why we\n\n20\n00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:58.210\nwould use something like IPSEC, right,\ngetting that encrypted information.\n\n21\n00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.549\nWell, we got some other\nremote access methods, right,\n\n22\n00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.094\nthat we also need to talk about,\nsome additional protocols.\n\n23\n00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:05.940\nAnd that's what we're gonna be\nlooking at here in this episode.\n\n24\n00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.462\n&gt;&gt; So remote access methods, Wes,\nwhy wouldn't we be using Telnet?\n\n25\n00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:13.555\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Zach, we talked about Telnet\nthroughout this series, right?\n\n26\n00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:14.395\nIt's an oldie but goodie,.\n\n27\n00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:15.900\nIt's been around for a very long time.\n\n28\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.090\nIt goes all the way back\nto the days of ARPANET.\n\n29\n00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.730\nIt had its heyday, right?\n\n30\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.525\nAnd in those early days, we weren't really\nworried about securing the communications\n\n31\n00:01:23.525 --> 00:01:26.200\ncuz there weren't a lot of\ncommunications going on, right?\n\n32\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.125\nThere was just a select few.\n\n33\n00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:27.949\n&gt;&gt; It just wasn't as\nimportant at that point.\n\n34\n00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:32.622\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yeah, it wasn't after the\n.com boom, right, where everybody was on\n\n35\n00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:35.922\nthis massive network, but\nwe have to worry about it, right?\n\n36\n00:01:35.922 --> 00:01:39.995\nEven though it would allow your client\noperating system to appear to a host\n\n37\n00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.479\ncentralized computing system\nas being a dedicated terminal,\n\n38\n00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.940\nit has problems, right?\n\n39\n00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.070\nOne of the problems is it doesn't\nencrypt that information.\n\n40\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.000\nAnd in fact, let's kind of show you why.\n\n41\n00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.310\nWe've also talked about SSH, and\nSSH is a remote access method, too.\n\n42\n00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.790\nSo let's come up in our Ports and\nProtocols episode, right,\n\n43\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.840\ncuz we gotta talk about the port and\nthe protocol and in general what it does.\n\n44\n00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.140\nBut let's see it in action, right?\n\n45\n00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.100\nAnd this also kind of ties together a lot\nof things that we've talked about when\n\n46\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.380\nit comes to security, right?\n\n47\n00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.840\nWe talk about mitigating some\nof those network based attacks,\n\n48\n00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.370\nlike man in the middle attacks, right?\n\n49\n00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.940\nWell, this is one of\nthe ways that you can do it.\n\n50\n00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.210\nI'm on my Windows 10 machine here.\n\n51\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.590\nLet's go ahead, and let's show you why\nyou might not use something like Telnet,\n\n52\n00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.400\nwhy you would use something\na lot more secure, like SSH.\n\n53\n00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.353\nSo I'm gonna go ahead, and what I'm\ngonna do is I'm gonna fire up Wireshark.\n\n54\n00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:30.304\n[COUGH] Now when we fire up Wireshark,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n55\n00:02:30.304 --> 00:02:33.390\nI'm gonna start capturing some packets.\n\n56\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930\nAll right, and\nlet me go ahead real quick and\n\n57\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.460\nlet me put a filter in here and\nfilter down some of this traffic.\n\n58\n00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.157\nJust wanna see my network adapter,\nall right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:47.120\nSo very good.\n\n60\n00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.420\nLet's go ahead and\nwe will start right there.\n\n61\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.410\nNow that that filter's in place,\nwhat we're gonna do is we'll go ahead and\n\n62\n00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.360\nlet me go ahead and just make sure the\nfilter's in place and we're capturing it.\n\n63\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.620\nLet's go ahead and what we'll do is\nwe'll fire up a command prompt here.\n\n64\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.330\nAnd we're gonna drill down into Telnet,\nright?\n\n65\n00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.050\nSo I'm gonna make\na Telnet connection here.\n\n66\n00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.501\nSo if I can type Telnet,\nwe'll be doing good.\n\n67\n00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n68\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.800\nwe'll get down in here\nto Microsoft's Telnet.\n\n69\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.570\nWe've got a packet capture going\non on this machine to see what\n\n70\n00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.540\ninformation can we see.\n\n71\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.745\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and type in open.\n\n72\n00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:19.334\nAnd it's gonna ask me well, who do you\nwanna open this Telnet session with?\n\n73\n00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:22.483\nAnd I'm gonna say, hey, we're gonna go\nahead and we're gonna reach out, and\n\n74\n00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:24.230\nwe're gonna connect to the Telnet server.\n\n75\n00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.990\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n76\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.345\nAnd it could take a second, right?\n\n77\n00:03:27.345 --> 00:03:31.347\nAnd we've got that Wireshark in\nthe background, that protocol analyzer,\n\n78\n00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:34.230\npacket sniffer, right,\ngathering information.\n\n79\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.000\nNow notice what it says here.\n\n80\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.380\nYou're about to send your\npassword information over\n\n81\n00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.440\nto a remote computer in the Internet zone.\n\n82\n00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.860\nDo you wanna do this?\n\n83\n00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.150\nI gonna go ahead and say yes.\n\n84\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.220\nWe really shouldn't, but\nI'm gonna go ahead and say yes, all right.\n\n85\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.632\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll type in our username, administrator,\n\n86\n00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.666\nand our super secret password.\n\n87\n00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.791\nAnd there we go,\nwe got a Telnet session, right?\n\n88\n00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:59.675\nI can type in cd, right?\n\n89\n00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.145\nI can do a dir, right, and\n\n90\n00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:06.005\nI can see that sure enough, we've got some\ninteresting stuff going on here, right?\n\n91\n00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.095\nI can see the hard drive and everything.\n\n92\n00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:10.425\nNow let's go ahead real quick,\n\n93\n00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:16.080\nnow that we've got our packets captured,\nlet's go ahead and stop this capture.\n\n94\n00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.290\nAll right, now notice that it did find it.\n\n95\n00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.040\nIt found it in here.\n\n96\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.770\nIt found the Telnet session, right?\n\n97\n00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.350\nIt found the protocol and\neverything that we want.\n\n98\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.480\nLet's do something kinda interesting here.\n\n99\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.600\nI'm gonna start with the very first\nTelnet session, or packet, if you will.\n\n100\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.870\nAnd I'm gonna choose Follow &gt; TCP Stream,\nright?\n\n101\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.720\nWe're gonna follow the stream.\n\n102\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.950\nNow this is the information\nthat it captured.\n\n103\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.370\nAnd I want you to notice something here.\n\n104\n00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.470\nLog in.\n\n105\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.769\nNow you might say, well,\nwait a second here.\n\n106\n00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:46.440\nIt's printing it twice.\n\n107\n00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.110\nWhat's going on?\n\n108\n00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.990\nWell, that's the way Telnet operates,\nright?\n\n109\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.630\nWe send the command and then it has\nto print the command on the screen.\n\n110\n00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.100\nSo that's why there's\ntwo of each character.\n\n111\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.212\nBut it tells me that's my user name and\n\n112\n00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:04.220\nmy password, plain text, right there.\n\n113\n00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.670\nSo I can see what's going on.\n\n114\n00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.300\nAnd I believe we can also see the\ninformation that's being returned to it.\n\n115\n00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.720\nSo if I do a dir, right, directory,\nand I wanna view the local directory,\n\n116\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.850\nnow if somebody is capturing this\ninformation, they do not know what\n\n117\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.930\nthe back structure is on that machine,\ntoo, but it's in plain text, right?\n\n118\n00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.810\nSo that's not what we want,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n119\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.430\ncompare that to something else, right?\n\n120\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.320\nSo I am gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna start our capture over again.\n\n121\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.440\nSo let us go ahead and do that.\n\n122\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.100\nAll right, and we'll go ahead and\nfilter this out, and there we go.\n\n123\n00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.430\nAnd that's not quite the filter I want.\n\n124\n00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.640\nSo let me go ahead and\ndo an ip.addr just like we did before.\n\n125\n00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.260\nWe'll go ahead and do that same thing and\nI'll filter it out so\n\n126\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.460\nit's just this IP address of\nthe network adapter on this machine.\n\n127\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.940\nNow we're gonna something\na little bit different.\n\n128\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.763\nI'm not gonna use my command prompt here.\n\n129\n00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:00.880\nI'm gonna go ahead and fire up putty.\n\n130\n00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.869\nAnd what we're gonna do this time\nis we're going to say this time,\n\n131\n00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:07.590\nwe're gonna connect via SSH over port 22.\n\n132\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.470\nAnd I've already got\nsome settings in here.\n\n133\n00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.080\nLet's see, yep, load them up.\n\n134\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.550\nThere's my centOS box, right?\n\n135\n00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.890\nNow my centOS box is running\nthe SSH daemon on it, right?\n\n136\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.440\nSo it's got that service ready to go.\n\n137\n00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.050\nLet's go ahead, and with that Wireshark\nin the background, let's go ahead and\n\n138\n00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.550\nopen the session.\n\n139\n00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.950\nAll right, and\nwe'll kind of zoom in here so\n\n140\n00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.980\nyou guys can see what's\ngoing on out there, right?\n\n141\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.276\nSo I'm gonna log in.\n\n142\n00:06:31.276 --> 00:06:36.800\nAnd this time I'll use my username and\nmy password, then we'll run that.\n\n143\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.740\nNow I'm connected to the centOS server,\nright?\n\n144\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.100\nI can do something like an ls-la,\noops, and,\n\n145\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.701\nnope, how about we try that, ls-la.\n\n146\n00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:48.590\nThere we go.\n\n147\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.610\nSo you can see, right,\nI'm in a bash prompt here.\n\n148\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.969\nBasically, I've connected\nover an SSH session.\n\n149\n00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.610\nAll right, now let's go ahead\nnow that that's happening.\n\n150\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.220\nLet's go back to our Wireshark here,\nand let's see,\n\n151\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.430\nwe'll take the filter off,\nand we'll do SSH, all right?\n\n152\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.827\nNotice that we've got some\nSSH going on here, and\n\n153\n00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:13.150\nI can see where it's coming from,\nand where it's going to, right?\n\n154\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.142\nThis is coming from my local IP address\nhere on this Windows 10 machine, as 0.128.\n\n155\n00:07:18.142 --> 00:07:21.508\nThe centOS server's .129.\n\n156\n00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:25.310\nLet's go ahead and let's take one of these\nsessions and we'll do the same thing.\n\n157\n00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.636\nWe'll right-click on it.\n\n158\n00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:30.900\nWe'll choose follow TCP stream, all right?\n\n159\n00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.585\nNow I see some plain\ntext information here.\n\n160\n00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:37.460\nBut it's interesting, the plain text\ninformation is all the key exchange.\n\n161\n00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.690\nWhat protocols,\nwhat encryption do you support?\n\n162\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.840\nWell, I can see the encryption right here,\nit's in plain text.\n\n163\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.700\nBut once the conversation starts,\nlook what goes on now, Zach.\n\n164\n00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.280\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n\n165\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's a bunch of gobbledygook.\n\n166\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.818\nThat's the technical term for\nencrypted information, right?\n\n167\n00:07:52.818 --> 00:07:54.939\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I can't see the data, right?\n\n168\n00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.666\nAnd if I was to, let's say,\nget out of this here and\n\n169\n00:07:57.666 --> 00:08:01.687\nI was to pick up any one of these packets,\nnotice the information, right?\n\n170\n00:08:01.687 --> 00:08:04.018\nAnd if I open this up, it tells me.\n\n171\n00:08:04.018 --> 00:08:08.030\nIt tells me what the encryption is,\nshows me that this is the key exchange.\n\n172\n00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.250\nShows me what the key exchange is,\n\n173\n00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.160\nshows me the crazy long\npublic key information too.\n\n174\n00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.300\nBut it's all encrypted, so\nwe can't rebuild the information.\n\n175\n00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.900\nSo when it comes to a remote access\nmethod, don't be using Telnet.\n\n176\n00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.420\nYou can see why, use something like SSH.\n\n177\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.470\nNow these aren't the only ways that you\ncan make remote access connections, right?\n\n178\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.980\nSomething that's built into Windows,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n179\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.510\nclose these down,\nis something like RDP, right?\n\n180\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.900\nRDP is the Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n181\n00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.310\nIt's part of what's known as\nthe Remote Desktop Connection software.\n\n182\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:47.000\nIt allows me to connect from my machine,\nlet's say my Windows 10 client, and\n\n183\n00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.090\nI don't wanna walk over to the server\ncloset, fire up the KVM, and\n\n184\n00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.780\nlog in locally to the machine.\n\n185\n00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.570\nWell, I can take RDP, or\nthe Remote Desktop Connection software,\n\n186\n00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.340\nand I can connect over the network\ninto a Windows server, and\n\n187\n00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.550\nI can manage it from another location.\n\n188\n00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.620\nLet's show you what that looks like.\n\n189\n00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.710\nAll right, so on my Windows 10 client\nwe can go down and type MSTSC and\n\n190\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.500\nyou can see that we've got this\nRemote Desktop Connection app, right?\n\n191\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.720\nLet me go ahead, we'll do the same thing.\n\n192\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.000\nWe'll fire up Wireshark again,\n\n193\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.760\nsee if we can eavesdrop on\nthis information, all right?\n\n194\n00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.860\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nstart a capture here.\n\n195\n00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.930\nI think I'll do the same filter here,\n\n196\n00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:26.460\nwe'll just filter this down\nto just my local IP address.\n\n197\n00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.994\nAnd where did my?\n\n198\n00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:29.890\nAnd we'll try this again.\n\n199\n00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.166\nMSTSC, we'll launch up\nRemote Desktop Connection.\n\n200\n00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:35.476\nAll right, we're gonna do the same thing,\n\n201\n00:09:35.476 --> 00:09:38.416\nwe'll put the IP address of\nthe destination computer.\n\n202\n00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:43.116\nAnd I'll tell you what, looks like\nI have already connected before so\n\n203\n00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:47.470\nI'm gonna take the username and\npassword out, right?\n\n204\n00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.310\nLet's compare apples to apples, right?\n\n205\n00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.944\nAnd I'm gonna type in now, retype it.\n\n206\n00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:55.325\n10.10.10.10.100.\n\n207\n00:09:55.325 --> 00:10:01.430\nAnd, again, let me go ahead and\ntake the username out.\n\n208\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.478\nAnd we'll choose connect.\n\n209\n00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:07.398\nAll right.\n\n210\n00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:10.553\nNow, give it a second here,\nwe'll see if it connects,\n\n211\n00:10:10.553 --> 00:10:12.780\nsometimes it might take a second here.\n\n212\n00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.340\nAll right.\n\n213\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.020\nLooks like it tried, there it is.\n\n214\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.880\nThere's the username and password.\n\n215\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.470\nSo let me go ahead and authenticate.\n\n216\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.990\nAnd it will connect to my Windows\nserver across the network.\n\n217\n00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.510\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n218\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.250\n&gt;&gt; And what I should see is\nthe desktop of the server.\n\n219\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.150\nNow I'll still see my desktop,\nthe local Windows 10 desktop here too, but\n\n220\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.410\nwhat I should see Is\nthe Windows server's desktop.\n\n221\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.685\nNow it does use a self-signed certificate,\nso you have to understand that if you're\n\n222\n00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:42.600\ngonna use remote desktop you\nneed to trust the certificate.\n\n223\n00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.702\nYou need to understand and be sure that\nyou're connecting to the right machine.\n\n224\n00:10:47.702 --> 00:10:52.390\nI'm gonna ahead and say yes, and we will\nconnect and we'll see what it looks like.\n\n225\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.610\nNow notice this is my Windows 10 desktop,\nright?\n\n226\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.850\nNotice the difference when RDP,\nthe protocol, the application if you will,\n\n227\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.160\nRemote Desktop Connection\nactually makes that connection.\n\n228\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.700\nYou can see just for a second there the\ndesktop said Windows Server 2012, right?\n\n229\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.330\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I can see here that if I wanted to,\n\n230\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:14.910\nif I needed to do something like manage\nthe DHCP I could pull up the DHCP console,\n\n231\n00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.340\nand I'm now taking\ncontrol over the desktop.\n\n232\n00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.440\nAnd I'm managing the server from\nmy client operating system, right?\n\n233\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.780\nAnd this is the way that we would want\nto manage the Windows server, right?\n\n234\n00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.950\nLet's go ahead, and now that's done,\nI'm gonna go ahead and disconnect here.\n\n235\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.280\nAnd let's look at our Wireshark here,\nall right?\n\n236\n00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.870\nAnd I see a lot of TCP information here.\n\n237\n00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.880\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's choose to follow the stream here and\n\n238\n00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.430\nsee what we can find, right?\n\n239\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.750\nNow I can see the connections here, right?\n\n240\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.550\nAnd you know what, it is still going,\n\n241\n00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:50.060\nlet me stop that so\nwe don't have that information there.\n\n242\n00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.075\nAll right?\n\n243\n00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:55.845\nNow, I can see the host name, right?\n\n244\n00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:58.455\nThat I can see, but\nif I look through here,\n\n245\n00:11:58.455 --> 00:12:02.640\nwhat I'm gonna find is that there is\na lot of encrypted information, right?\n\n246\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.005\nHere's my data, and\nif I open it up there's the data link.\n\n247\n00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:10.695\nI don't see the actual information, right?\n\n248\n00:12:10.695 --> 00:12:16.940\nSo we do have the ability,\nagain, when we're using RDP,\n\n249\n00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.040\nto allow secure communications\nbetween my machine and\n\n250\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.690\nthat machine, again,\nover the Remote Desktop Protocol.\n\n251\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.410\nNow, that's two of them, right?\n\n252\n00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.240\nThat's SSH and RDP, and\nthen compare it back to Telnet and\n\n253\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.330\nwhy you wouldn't use that.\n\n254\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.120\nBut there's another one that we\ncan use too, this is a very basic,\n\n255\n00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.105\nstripped down, remote access method.\n\n256\n00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:40.860\nYou gotta be very careful with it, because\nagain, it has very limited security, and\n\n257\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.880\nthat's something called VNC.\n\n258\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.060\nThe VNC is virtual network computing, and\nyou also have to be careful with that one.\n\n259\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.570\nBut it's just a basic way to allow me\nto view the desktop, interactively,\n\n260\n00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.460\nof another machine, again,\nover a remote connection.\n\n261\n00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.740\nLet's go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n262\n00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.730\nSo I'll go ahead and\nlaunch up my VNC viewer here.\n\n263\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.710\nAnd what I'm gonna do is kind of like\nthe remote desktop connection software,\n\n264\n00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.210\nI'm gonna tell it, where is the server\nthat you want to connect to?\n\n265\n00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.870\nAnd I've got the IP address here,\nand we'll choose connect, and\n\n266\n00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.100\nit is password-protected.\n\n267\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.180\nBut again, you can see I can connect.\n\n268\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.960\nOops, and try that again there.\n\n269\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.609\nCancel.\n\n270\n00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.110\nAnd let's do a switch user here.\n\n271\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.806\nWell when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Del, and\nyou are controlling other desktops,\n\n272\n00:13:33.806 --> 00:13:37.073\nyou gotta make sure of which computer\nit is that you're signing out.\n\n273\n00:13:37.073 --> 00:13:37.895\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; Looks like I signed\n\n274\n00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:39.425\nout of my local machine,\nlet's try that again.\n\n275\n00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:43.110\n[LAUGH] I will get logged back in here but\nwe should see,\n\n276\n00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.660\nprovided I type my password right, what we\nshould see is that that VNC Viewer, again,\n\n277\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.110\nthe Virtual Network Computing Viewer\nshould\n\n278\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.440\nstill be connected to\nacross the network here.\n\n279\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.470\nApparently I haven't typed my username and\npassword in right.\n\n280\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.250\nAll right, so let's try that again here.\n\n281\n00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.600\nAnd I'm not worried about that.\n\n282\n00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.770\nWe will fire up that viewer again.\n\n283\n00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.940\nAnd what I need to do is,\n\n284\n00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.480\ninstead of doing Ctrl+Alt+Del on the local\nmachine, you have this little option here\n\n285\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.980\nto send the Ctrl+Alt+Del to\nthe server across the VMC computing.\n\n286\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.760\nAnd now I'm logging into the local\nserver across the network, and\n\n287\n00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.080\nwe'll go ahead and type it.\n\n288\n00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:32.960\nAnd sure enough, remember, my DHCP console\nwas open when we connected over RDP.\n\n289\n00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.220\nNow, the difference between RDP and\nVNC here is, RDP,\n\n290\n00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.300\nyou'll notice I had the log back in,\nright?\n\n291\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.330\nBecause when you use\nthe Remote Desktop Protocol,\n\n292\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.530\nyou are doing an interactive login.\n\n293\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.660\nYou are taking control over the desktop,\n\n294\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.920\nso anybody that would be sitting locally\nat that machine, whether its a server or\n\n295\n00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.040\nclient or what have you,\nit would log them out.\n\n296\n00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.310\nIt would sign them out if you will, right?\n\n297\n00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.310\nVNC on the other hand, you'll notice that\nhere is my machine that I'm logged into.\n\n298\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.900\nWell, guess what?\n\n299\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.960\nThis is the server that's behind\nthat VNC connection, right?\n\n300\n00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.130\nAnd it's in real time,\nyou'll notice something here.\n\n301\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.670\nHere's my Windows 10\nmachine that I'm using VNC\n\n302\n00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.700\nto make the remote access connection.\n\n303\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:18.220\nAnd as I move stuff locally,\nit's doing the same thing.\n\n304\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.790\nSo this is an interactive way,\n\n305\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.060\nwhen you use VNC, VNCs good,\nall these have their place.\n\n306\n00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:29.400\nWe used to use VNC at a place\nthat I worked to train students,\n\n307\n00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.520\nand the instructors,\nmyself and other instructors,\n\n308\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:40.200\ncould use the VNC viewer without using\nRDP to connect to a student's machine.\n\n309\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.520\nIf I use RDP and I connect,\nthey can't see what's going,\n\n310\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.010\nbecause I've just taken control over\nthe desktop and it logs them out, right?\n\n311\n00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.390\nSigns them out or\nlocks the computer on them.\n\n312\n00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.586\nBut when I use VNC, it's just simplistic,\nand as I move stuff,\n\n313\n00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:57.239\nthey can see what's going on,\nor as their doing stuff,\n\n314\n00:15:57.239 --> 00:16:02.131\nmyself as an instructor, I can say,\nno, no, no, nope, not IPv4,\n\n315\n00:16:02.131 --> 00:16:06.685\nYou want to click or right-click\nthe server and choose Properties.\n\n316\n00:16:06.685 --> 00:16:09.180\nAnd in realtime they can\nsee what's going on here.\n\n317\n00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.110\nSo VNC is another way\nthat you can do this too.\n\n318\n00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:16.860\nSo we have RDP, SSH, and\nVNC, really good protocols.\n\n319\n00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.770\nVNC, be careful with it, very limited.\n\n320\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:24.090\nDepends on the software developer\nat all if there is security on it.\n\n321\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.250\nUse SSH.\n\n322\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.960\nUse RDP in a Windows environment,\nvery, very good.\n\n323\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.832\nDefinitely steer away from Telnet, right?\n\n324\n00:16:30.832 --> 00:16:32.090\nWe shouldn't be using that at all.\n\n325\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.008\nBut sometimes you need to make a remote\naccess connection to do management and\n\n326\n00:16:36.008 --> 00:16:38.910\nstuff, and\nthat's where the HTTPS can come in, right?\n\n327\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.490\nHypertext Transfer Protocol\nover Secure Socket Layer.\n\n328\n00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.027\nWe'll have a management URL, right?\n\n329\n00:16:43.027 --> 00:16:44.800\nAnd a web interface.\n\n330\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.890\nWell, you can actually see that,\nlike for instance,\n\n331\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:51.030\nin your wireless access point, right?\n\n332\n00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.650\nAnd I can do a log in here and the first\nlog in, we're not doing it secure, so\n\n333\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.460\nthis is over HTTP.\n\n334\n00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.830\nBut I can come into the administration\npane if I wanted and couple of things.\n\n335\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.090\nIf I try to enable this right away,\nit's gonna give me a warning and say, hey,\n\n336\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.530\nyou didn't change the default password,\nright?\n\n337\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.395\nWe've looked in our security shows,\nour security episodes through Net Plus,\n\n338\n00:17:12.395 --> 00:17:16.730\nthat's' why you steer away from the\ndefaults, and let me show you what I mean.\n\n339\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.490\nAnd you know it didn't give me a problem,\nbecause I just cleared the password there.\n\n340\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.330\nIt might give you a, especially in this\nLinksys interfaces, it might say, hey,\n\n341\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.940\nyou're not allowed to enable\nremote management over HTTPS\n\n342\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.550\nif you don't change the password.\n\n343\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.538\nSo it didn't give me that error.\n\n344\n00:17:31.538 --> 00:17:32.800\nSo that's okay.\n\n345\n00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.059\nBut notice that I can do remote\nmanagement access over HTTPS.\n\n346\n00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:42.597\nAnd that would allow me that management\nURL that says, hey, if you're going to\n\n347\n00:17:42.597 --> 00:17:47.544\nmake a remote connection over, let's say,\nthe Internet and you're gonna connect to\n\n348\n00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:52.470\nthe management URL like we are here, you\nhave to do it over a secure connection.\n\n349\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.830\nAll right, and that's important, right?\n\n350\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.848\nRemember, the secure connection, you're\ngonna use something like transport layer\n\n351\n00:17:57.848 --> 00:18:02.220\nsecurity, 1.2 TLS if you will, and that's\ngonna encrypt your information between\n\n352\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.210\nyour machine, and the device that\nyou're trying to manage, right?\n\n353\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.960\nYou don't want people to be\nable to eaves drop on it.\n\n354\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.190\nEspecially if you're using\nsomething like Telnet.\n\n355\n00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.040\nSo this gives you an idea of\nsome of the scenarios that you\n\n356\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.500\nmight even see these different\nremote access protocols in,\n\n357\n00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.330\nand it's very important to know why\nyou would use one over the other.\n\n358\n00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.290\n&gt;&gt; So can we use these\ntechnologies if the network fails?\n\n359\n00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.373\n&gt;&gt; That's a great question, but no.\n\n360\n00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:27.182\nNo, you cannot.\n[LAUGH]\n\n361\n00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:27.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Simplistic.\n\n362\n00:18:27.794 --> 00:18:28.394\n&gt;&gt; Yea, no, you cannot.\n\n363\n00:18:28.394 --> 00:18:32.380\nSo one of the things, and\nI'm glad you asked that,\n\n364\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.851\nis one of the things that you have to\nkeep in mind is that using something\n\n365\n00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:42.520\nlike this management URL, or\nif we're using SSH, right?\n\n366\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.706\nLet me get back over here,\nfigure out which machine I'm on here.\n\n367\n00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.920\nI'll go ahead and\nclose our VNC down, right?\n\n368\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.830\nUsing something like your RDP,\nremote desktop protocol.\n\n369\n00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:57.000\nUsing something like PuTTY with SSH,\nright, to make that connection.\n\n370\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.100\nEvery one of these pieces of software\nrequires your network communication right,\n\n371\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.230\nremote access methods,\n\n372\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.230\nright, the other thing to keep in mind\nis that they are also sending traffic\n\n373\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.570\nacross your network just like\nall your other normal traffic.\n\n374\n00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.602\nAnd that's important to understand,\nmaybe you don't want that and\n\n375\n00:19:13.602 --> 00:19:16.018\nlike Zach said what happens\nif the networks goes down.\n\n376\n00:19:16.018 --> 00:19:18.737\nThat's where something known as\nout-of-band management comes in.\n\n377\n00:19:18.737 --> 00:19:21.500\nOut-of-band management, really simplistic,\n\n378\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.750\nall it means is a dedicated\nnetwork channel.\n\n379\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.150\nA dedicated channel that says I can, like\nfor instance you have the LILO boards,\n\n380\n00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:32.000\nthe integrated lights-on lights-out\nboards in some of your servers, right?\n\n381\n00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.880\nAnd that allows me to connect\nto the management interface\n\n382\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:40.110\nvia a dedicated network connection\ndirectly to that server and\n\n383\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.830\ndo things like firmware updates, right?\n\n384\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.450\nRestart server if I need.\n\n385\n00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.200\nThe network can be offline.\n\n386\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.950\nNow, if that channel's offline and\nthe whole thing's down,\n\n387\n00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.900\nthen we can't use it anyways.\n\n388\n00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.050\nBut out of out-of-band management whether\nyou're using something like a modem,\n\n389\n00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.260\nwhether you're using something\nlike a console router.\n\n390\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.460\nIf you're using something like a dedicated\nethernet channel into a network adapter,\n\n391\n00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.880\nagain, allows you the ability\nto be able to configure and\n\n392\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.080\nmanage these devices even\nif the network fails.\n\n393\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.175\nAnd that's a great thing\nto have access too.\n\n394\n00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:10.807\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n395\n00:20:10.807 --> 00:20:14.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, I know we're running\nkind of short on time here.\n\n396\n00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.030\nSo just a few more things that we\nwant to mention in this episode and\n\n397\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.760\nwe will wrap it up.\n\n398\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.840\nWe wanna talk about remote file access.\n\n399\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.612\nNow when we talk about remote file access,\nwe've got some options.\n\n400\n00:20:23.612 --> 00:20:29.420\nAll right, when I say options,\nit really depends on the commonality or\n\n401\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.659\nsupport, vendor support, between these\ndifferent protocols that we'll talk about.\n\n402\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:39.847\nOne they mention is FTP and\nFTPS, all right?\n\n403\n00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:43.825\nWe've gotta worry about file\ntransfer protocol by itself,\n\n404\n00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:48.349\nbecause FTP is a plain text protocol,\nit sends things in clear text,\n\n405\n00:20:48.349 --> 00:20:53.278\nplain text communications that somebody\ncould eavesdrop on, all right?\n\n406\n00:20:53.278 --> 00:20:54.970\nThe other one is FTPS.\n\n407\n00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.454\nBe careful with this one because\ndepending on where the S is positioned,\n\n408\n00:20:58.454 --> 00:21:01.036\nit's a completely different protocol,\nall right?\n\n409\n00:21:01.036 --> 00:21:05.904\nFTPS could be, now,\nrightly said, FTP over SSL,\n\n410\n00:21:05.904 --> 00:21:08.860\nsecure socket layer, right?\n\n411\n00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.710\nWe bind a certificate to the FTP server\nand that's what you use this server\n\n412\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.150\nidentification and\nauthentication, if you will.\n\n413\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.330\nThere's a problem with that.\n\n414\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.800\nLet me show you at my Windows 10 machine.\n\n415\n00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.220\nFirst of all, it's not heavily supported.\n\n416\n00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:26.740\nThe other thing is, if we,\nlet me use something like I believe\n\n417\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.610\nI have WinSCP, secure copy protocol.\n\n418\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.020\nSo this little program allows\nme to make a secure connect.\n\n419\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.042\nAnd Zach, you can see on here,\nwe'll talk about this one next.\n\n420\n00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:38.835\nThis is SFTP.\n\n421\n00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:40.488\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n422\n00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:45.630\nif we switch over to FTP,\nnotice that it's no encryption, right?\n\n423\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.880\nPlain text, that's the base FTP protocol.\n\n424\n00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:56.490\nHowever, you can do HTTP over TLS/SSL,\nbut here's the problem with it.\n\n425\n00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.830\nNotice there's an explicit,\nand an implicit.\n\n426\n00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n427\n00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.460\n&gt;&gt; You shouldn't have the option, right?\n\n428\n00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.388\nAs an administrator, you want to make sure\nthat, hey, if you're gonna connect to our\n\n429\n00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:11.790\nfiles, our precious information,\nI want to require you to use encryption.\n\n430\n00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:12.885\nImplicit says, yeah, try it.\n\n431\n00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:15.962\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't work.\n\n432\n00:22:15.962 --> 00:22:17.410\nDoesn't connect.\n\n433\n00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.410\nAnd that's why we don't want it.\n\n434\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:25.705\nSo FTP over SSL, while it is there\ngives you the ability to potentially\n\n435\n00:22:25.705 --> 00:22:28.970\nencrypt information, because of the fact\nthat you can fall back on a non-encrypted\n\n436\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.660\ncommunication, it's not really something\nthat you're going to use commonly, right?\n\n437\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.306\nNow, on the other hand,\nlet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n438\n00:22:38.306 --> 00:22:42.587\nYou can do what's known as SFTP.\n\n439\n00:22:42.587 --> 00:22:48.634\nAll right, when we talk about SFTP,\nwhat we're talking about is,\n\n440\n00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:53.010\nessentially, SSH and FTP combined.\n\n441\n00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:58.002\nI could basically say, this is making\nan FTP connection through an SSH tunnel,\n\n442\n00:22:58.002 --> 00:22:59.652\nthen we get SFTP, right?\n\n443\n00:22:59.652 --> 00:23:01.130\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n444\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.270\n&gt;&gt; Is that safe file transfer protocol?\n\n445\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.145\n&gt;&gt; That is secure.\n\n446\n00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:06.650\nGreat, define the acronym.\n\n447\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.340\nVery good, right?\n\n448\n00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.430\nThat is secure file transfer protocol.\n\n449\n00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.850\nWhat's the secure part?\n\n450\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.420\nIt's a secure shell, it's SSH\nconnection to an FTP server, right?\n\n451\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.580\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n452\n00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.730\nSo we'll go back and I've got another\nprogram here, a very cool program,\n\n453\n00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.480\nactually it's on my taskbar here.\n\n454\n00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.460\nAnd this is called FileZilla.\n\n455\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.220\nWe'll do the same thing.\n\n456\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.615\nWe're going to go ahead and\nFire up Wireshark.\n\n457\n00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n458\n00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.920\n&gt;&gt; And we'll capture some information here\nand see if we can tell what's going on.\n\n459\n00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.741\nI'm gonna do a filter here real quick,\n\n460\n00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:38.507\njust because we don't need to\nsee all of this information.\n\n461\n00:23:38.507 --> 00:23:40.955\nJust the information we're worried about,\nright?\n\n462\n00:23:40.955 --> 00:23:43.136\nSame thing your hacker would do, right?\n\n463\n00:23:43.136 --> 00:23:45.525\n&gt;&gt; Once again WireShark, that is a free?\n\n464\n00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:46.576\n&gt;&gt; It is, it's open-source.\n\n465\n00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:49.513\n&gt;&gt; I would recommend if you\nneed a protocol analyzer and\n\n466\n00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:53.452\nyou're getting trained in this and\nmaybe going to study for the exam,\n\n467\n00:23:53.452 --> 00:23:55.404\nget in these protocol analyzers.\n\n468\n00:23:55.404 --> 00:23:57.096\nYou can see what's going on,\n\n469\n00:23:57.096 --> 00:24:00.482\nyou can start to understand\nthe layers of the US side model,\n\n470\n00:24:00.482 --> 00:24:05.172\nthe layers of TSPAP model, right, you can\nstar to see how this protocol works so.\n\n471\n00:24:05.172 --> 00:24:10.510\nLet's go ahead and\nwe'll take FileZilla here, all right?\n\n472\n00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.760\nAnd what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n473\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.968\nI'm gonna do a 10.10.10.1.29, all right?\n\n474\n00:24:18.968 --> 00:24:22.733\nAnd I've got an FTP user called,\n\n475\n00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:28.280\nwell, FTP user [LAUGH] that's creative.\n\n476\n00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.970\nAnd we're gonna do Port 22, all right?\n\n477\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.131\nLet's go ahead and do a quick connect.\n\n478\n00:24:33.131 --> 00:24:36.042\nNow you might see in the background\nin real time, boy, that thing,\n\n479\n00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:37.665\nthat wire shark just lit up, right?\n\n480\n00:24:37.665 --> 00:24:39.392\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And here it is, right?\n\n481\n00:24:39.392 --> 00:24:42.438\nI can get down into FTP user if I want.\n\n482\n00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:47.377\nI can right-click, I can create a\ndirectory, New directory might be called,\n\n483\n00:24:47.377 --> 00:24:51.818\nsecret, maybe I want it to be secret,\nand I'll choose OK, all right?\n\n484\n00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:56.532\nSo notice that I do have a connection,\nall right, let me go ahead and\n\n485\n00:24:56.532 --> 00:24:58.870\nstop this here real quick.\n\n486\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.100\nAnd I'll tell you what, let's go ahead,\n\n487\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.710\nwe'll do the same thing,\nthis is good to see in the background.\n\n488\n00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.130\nAll right, so\nnotice what I got going on here.\n\n489\n00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:13.810\nFrom my local machine 128 is the source\ndot 129 is the sendoff server,\n\n490\n00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.620\nI've got an SSH connection going,\nand I just created a directory.\n\n491\n00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.002\nLet's go ahead and do the same thing.\n\n492\n00:25:19.002 --> 00:25:21.130\nLet's right-click on it and\nchoose follow TCP screen.\n\n493\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.740\nKind of interesting.\n\n494\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.931\nNotice the same thing that\nwas going on before with SSH?\n\n495\n00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:29.711\nI can see what the encryption, right,\nthe encryption, the security protocols,\n\n496\n00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.818\nwhat's going to be used for\nthe key exchange.\n\n497\n00:25:31.818 --> 00:25:34.860\nOur server is saying, hey,\nhere's what I support.\n\n498\n00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.565\nMy client is saying, well,\nhere's what I'll use.\n\n499\n00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:37.545\nWe negotiate that part.\n\n500\n00:25:37.545 --> 00:25:42.810\nBut if you look through here,\nyou can't see any of the information.\n\n501\n00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.430\nRight, and it's all scrambled.\n\n502\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.160\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n503\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.710\nAnd that's what we want.\n\n504\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.640\nSo keep in mind that that's one of\nthe beauties of an SSH connection.\n\n505\n00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.880\nNotice that we have,\n\n506\n00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.330\nif we look at our protocol analyzer here,\njust pull out this packet.\n\n507\n00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.630\nHere we go, right?\n\n508\n00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.140\nWe have our network interface layer\nhere with our ethernet, right?\n\n509\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.660\nWe have out internet\nlayer here with the IP.\n\n510\n00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.300\nTransmission control protocol, right?\n\n511\n00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.392\nThat's the transport layer and\n\n512\n00:26:11.392 --> 00:26:15.274\npart of the application layer\nif you will in the TCIP model.\n\n513\n00:26:15.274 --> 00:26:17.730\nAnd notice when I open up SSH.\n\n514\n00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.910\nNotice that the encryption here.\n\n515\n00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.400\nIt's telling me what the encryption is.\n\n516\n00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:29.350\nAnd if I open up the packet,\nnotice it's an encrypted packet.\n\n517\n00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.260\nThis is your encrypted information and\nI can't tell what's going on here.\n\n518\n00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.780\nAnd I can see it's got\na message authentication code\n\n519\n00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.800\nto verify the integrity of\nthe information as well.\n\n520\n00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.560\nSo we're getting a confidentiality.\n\n521\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.370\nWe're getting the integrity and\nthe availability.\n\n522\n00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.500\nThat's CIA triad.\n\n523\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.000\nSo when I'm using something like SFTP,\nI created a directory?\n\n524\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.300\nWell, if you're not a part of\nthe communication, you don't know that.\n\n525\n00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.499\nThat's one of the beauties of\nusing something like SFTP.\n\n526\n00:26:53.499 --> 00:26:57.961\nIt's that you get the encrypted\ncommunications between your client,\n\n527\n00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:00.550\nyour FTP client and the FTP server.\n\n528\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:04.100\nAnd that encrypted tunnel makes to\nwhere you don't even really know.\n\n529\n00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:04.724\nIs it FTP?\n\n530\n00:27:04.724 --> 00:27:07.230\nI don't see FTP in the list.\n\n531\n00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.890\nNot a single thing tells me\nthat this is a FTP server.\n\n532\n00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n533\n00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.010\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we want.\n\n534\n00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.480\nI don't want you to know what's going on.\n\n535\n00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.140\nI don't want you to know that I'm creating\na directory called secret on an FTP\n\n536\n00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.080\nserver, right?\n\n537\n00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.130\nSo you can do that too.\n\n538\n00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.330\nThere's one more, and Zack, I know I've\ncompletely run out of time on this one,\n\n539\n00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.690\nbut there is one last one remote access\nmethod that I want to talk about, right?\n\n540\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.150\nWe've been mentioning FTP,\ndon't shy away from FTP.\n\n541\n00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.380\nIt's an excellent protocol for\nlarge file transfers.\n\n542\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.750\nOne of the reasons it's still around,\nit's been around, and\n\n543\n00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.190\nit's going to stay around for a long time.\n\n544\n00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.460\nJust secure it.\n\n545\n00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.980\nYou secure it, then the flaw that you\nwere worried about is gone, right?\n\n546\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.910\nBut there's also another type of FTP.\n\n547\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:52.929\nIf you don't need all the commands and\ncreating directories,\n\n548\n00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:57.096\ntraversing directories,\ngrabbing information,\n\n549\n00:27:57.096 --> 00:28:00.514\nputting information up on the FTP server.\n\n550\n00:28:00.514 --> 00:28:04.185\nLet's say you just need a little\nfirmware that needs to be downloaded or\n\n551\n00:28:04.185 --> 00:28:08.527\nmaybe you are a terminal and you connect\nto a client and you connect to a server\n\n552\n00:28:08.527 --> 00:28:12.101\nand you pull down and you pull down\nyour configuration information.\n\n553\n00:28:12.101 --> 00:28:16.725\nWell i don't need a dedicated\nconnection-oriented servers like TCP\n\n554\n00:28:16.725 --> 00:28:18.460\nhandling that.\n\n555\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.950\nWell, that's where something\nknown as TFTP comes in.\n\n556\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.961\nThe trivial file transfer protocol is\n\n557\n00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:29.582\nbasically FTP strip down center\nover UDP for small files.\n\n558\n00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:31.777\nYou still did that file exchange, but\n\n559\n00:28:31.777 --> 00:28:35.758\nyou do not get all the added bonuses\nof the commence structure that you\n\n560\n00:28:35.758 --> 00:28:40.900\nget with FTP being able to do a lot of\nstuff is just a need to pull down file.\n\n561\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.620\nI need to pull down a config file.\n\n562\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.290\nI need to pull down some configurations or\na firmware update, right?\n\n563\n00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.890\nYou might be doing that over your FTP.\n\n564\n00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.580\nOr TFTP,\nthat's trivial file transfer protocol,\n\n565\n00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.280\nstripped down version of\nFTP that runs over UDP.\n\n566\n00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.504\nSome of the remote access methods\nthat you have to be aware of,\n\n567\n00:28:58.504 --> 00:29:02.288\nknow some of the scenarios just in case\nthey ask you on that Net Plus exam.\n\n568\n00:29:02.288 --> 00:29:03.940\nYou're gonna be able to answer them.\n\n569\n00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.140\nAnd not only answer them,\n\n570\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.090\nyou'll understand why the right\nanswer is the right answer.\n\n571\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.110\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as always, Wes.\n\n572\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.784\nAnd this is Remote Access Methods\npart three, make sure you see\n\n573\n00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:15.811\nRemote Access Methods part one and\ntwo, and in fact see everything that\n\n574\n00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.897\nwill come to you in the Net Plus series\nthat Wes has put together for your.\n\n575\n00:29:18.897 --> 00:29:22.676\nAnd the course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos there and\n\n576\n00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:25.050\nthey are there to help you go further.\n\n577\n00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.560\nTo talk about you know about ITProTV,\nlove you.\n\n578\n00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.642\nVery glad you did.\n\n579\n00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:29.497\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n580\n00:29:29.497 -->

00:00:12.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.179\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.651\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.150\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.680\nAs we continue on with CompTee and\n\n8\n00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310\nNetPlus, the title of this episode\nis policies and best practises.\n\n9\n00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.290\nAnd the person who's gonna tell\nus all about that is Wes Bryan.\n\n10\n00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.080\nWes good to have you.\n\n11\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.650\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.490\nThanks for having me back.\n\n13\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.920\nThat's right.\nNow we get to get into more of the paper\n\n14\n00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.630\nwork, right?\n\n15\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.840\nWhen we talk about policies,\nprocedures, best practices, right?\n\n16\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.877\nSo we are going to be looking at,\nwell, documentation, really,\n\n17\n00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:40.030\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n18\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.730\nWhen we talk about policies,\n\n19\n00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.240\nin security we usually implement\nsome kind of layer defence system.\n\n20\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.660\nWe don't usually use\none type of technology.\n\n21\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.900\nWe use multiple technologies, right?\n\n22\n00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.160\nAnd one of those layers,\nthe very first layer, if you will,\n\n23\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.720\nis policies, procedure,\nand awareness, right?\n\n24\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.969\nSo that's really a major point in\nsecuring your infrastructure when\n\n25\n00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:10.410\nwe talk about networks, as well as\nkeeping things like your data safe.\n\n26\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.844\nSo we are going to be looking at\nsome best practices, and again,\n\n27\n00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:18.297\nsome common best practices, because keep\nin mind that everything changes a little\n\n28\n00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:22.051\nbit depending on what company you work for\nand one policy that works for\n\n29\n00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.914\nsome companies might not work for\nother companies and\n\n30\n00:01:24.914 --> 00:01:27.680\nbest practices again is\nmore of a generalization.\n\n31\n00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.310\nSo you need to be aware of these for\nthe exam.\n\n32\n00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.100\nSo one of the first things that\nwe're gonna dive in we're in,\n\n33\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.890\nwe're gonna talk about concept known\nas privileged user management.\n\n34\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.620\nAnd this is very, very important\ninside of your infrastructure.\n\n35\n00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.850\n&gt;&gt; And Wes, when you talk about\nprivileged user agreement here.\n\n36\n00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.150\nAre you talking about a manager or are you\ntalking about a system administrator?\n\n37\n00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.120\nIs that what we are talking about?\n\n38\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.810\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nYou know,\n\n39\n00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.140\nwhen you talk about a privileges or\nagreement you're talking,\n\n40\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.080\nfirst of all, documentation, right?\n\n41\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.250\nDocumentation that you have,\nthings like your systems administrators,\n\n42\n00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.250\nthat's exactly right, Zach.\n\n43\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.330\nSystems administrators, people who have\nessentially the keys to the kingdom,\n\n44\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.310\nI have heard it put before, right?\n\n45\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.100\nIf you have a powerful role, right,\n\n46\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.820\nthere is a potential for\nthat role to get or the access level,\n\n47\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.930\nright, we talk in other episodes we talk\nabout things like authentication and\n\n48\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.700\nauthorization, and with the privileged\nusers, they are typically authorized.\n\n49\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.370\nThey have the privileges,\nthey are authorized to do more\n\n50\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.460\nthings than just the average standard\nend user within our networks, right.\n\n51\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.750\nAnd you've heard that saying, with great\npower comes a lot of responsibility.\n\n52\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.550\nIt's a great responsibility.\n\n53\n00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.950\nAnd they say absolute power\ncorrupts absolutely, right?\n\n54\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.860\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n55\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n\n56\n00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.750\nwe'll see how many times we can say that\nword here inside of this episode today.\n\n57\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.030\nSo privileged user agreement,\n\n58\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.270\nthis again is just a policy that is put\ninto place that somebody like a system\n\n59\n00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.160\nadministrator, maybe even a C\nlevel employee has to sign, right?\n\n60\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.290\nBecause again, they have a level of access\nthat your standard users don't have.\n\n61\n00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.320\nA level of access, too, so why might\nyou need a policy like that, right?\n\n62\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.110\nWell, when we look at it,\nmalicious insiders,\n\n63\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.470\nwe talk about threat actors in other\nCompTee courses that we teach,\n\n64\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.760\nlike for instance,\ninside of security plus, right?\n\n65\n00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.880\nWe talk about the roles that different\nactors, bad actors, if you will,\n\n66\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.170\nthat we talk about an app\nwithin your company or\n\n67\n00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.250\nwe are just against your company,\nif you will.\n\n68\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.360\nAnd one of them\nare the malicious insiders.\n\n69\n00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.270\nMalicious insiders are a major treat or\n\n70\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.460\ncan be a major threat to any organization,\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.830\nWell, we have to worry about things like\nsystem sabotage, things like data theft.\n\n72\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.640\nTheft of your systems too.\n\n73\n00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.380\nIntroduction of bad code.\n\n74\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.520\nYou got somebody who says hey,\nknows they're gonna be fired.\n\n75\n00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.016\nWell, we also talk about on-boarding and\noff-boarding procedures.\n\n76\n00:03:51.016 --> 00:03:54.190\nOn-boarding is that systematic\napproach to hiring somebody and\n\n77\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910\nbringing him into your network, a lot of\nthe documentation that we're talking about\n\n78\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.640\nthey might have to sign as part\nof the on-boarding process.\n\n79\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.460\nWell part of the good off-boarding\nprocess too is when you\n\n80\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.280\nhave somebody like a privileged user, they\nknow or your company knows that they're\n\n81\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.920\ngonna be terminated, then there has to be\nan appropriate systematic off-boarding\n\n82\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.650\nprocess to make sure that they can't do\nthings like sabotage your systems, right?\n\n83\n00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.690\nIntroduction, bad code, you've got\na developer that's on the way out and\n\n84\n00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.180\nthey slipstream in some bad code,\nmaybe in software that you're developing,\n\n85\n00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.190\ncauses some kind of undesired effect,\nif you will, and\n\n86\n00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.880\nmaybe causes some kind of damage to\na product that you're working with.\n\n87\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.140\nSlip streaming things like malware into\nyour code or into your systems too, or\n\n88\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.260\njust introducing things like unauthorized\nhardware and unauthorized software, right?\n\n89\n00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.190\nWe also have a licensing restrictions\nthat we have to worry about too.\n\n90\n00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.630\nAnd if we put a piece\nof software into play,\n\n91\n00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.180\ncompany have the license for it right?\n\n92\n00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.030\nSo privileged users, again,\nwe have to manage them appropriately and\n\n93\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.390\naccording to your\nprivileged user agreement.\n\n94\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.790\nYou might have things like certain\nlevels of responsibility and\n\n95\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.590\nways that not only does that\nperson meet that agreement, but\n\n96\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.450\nthen what are some ways that we\nenforce that agreement right?\n\n97\n00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.610\nThat's why we talk about things\nlike separation of duties, right?\n\n98\n00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.080\nTwo keys on the launchpad.\n\n99\n00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.090\nNot anyone person has all that power.\n\n100\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.320\nThere is some kind of accountability,\n\n101\n00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.070\naccountability could be things like\nmandatory vacation, all right.\n\n102\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.340\nYou're gonna take a week off here Zach,\n\n103\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.130\nbecause we know you're\nthe systems administrator.\n\n104\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.040\nWe just kinda want to\naudit what you're doing.\n\n105\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.170\nSo auditing, we talked about auditing and\nlogging and other episodes too, and\n\n106\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.930\nthat is tracking those events, right?\n\n107\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.070\nLeast privilege.\n\n108\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.440\nWe talk about the principle\nof least privilege, right?\n\n109\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.400\nYou give only the level of privilege\nthat a user needs to perform their job,\n\n110\n00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.390\nno more, no less.\n\n111\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.890\nNow, there's also called\nprivilege bracketing, too.\n\n112\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.410\nAnd that's another way\nthat you can do that.\n\n113\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.140\nWhich means if you need that privilege,\nI give it to you so\n\n114\n00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.300\nyou can accomplish your job.\n\n115\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.410\nAnd then once that's done,\nwe end up taking that privilege from you.\n\n116\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.260\nPrivilege user agreement might even\nbe somebody as simple as a contract\n\n117\n00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.950\nwhere they can get into a certain\narea that normally people,\n\n118\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.390\nthe average public,\nwouldn't have access to, right?\n\n119\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.880\nSo privilege bracketing says hey,\nwhile you are in this building,\n\n120\n00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.110\nwhile you are contracting and\ndoing a job for us,\n\n121\n00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.940\nyou have this level of privilege that you\ncan get into this maybe restricted area.\n\n122\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.020\nBut then once that job is done,\nprivilege bracketing says yeah,\n\n123\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.450\nI gave you those privileges but now\nthat it's done, we remove them from you.\n\n124\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.880\nSo job rotations are other\nways that you can do that.\n\n125\n00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.130\nAnd the big thing is\ntracking those activities.\n\n126\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.200\nNow the next thing that they talk about\nis what's known as a password policy.\n\n127\n00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.202\nAnd password policies are important\nbecause passwords, a lot of time,\n\n128\n00:06:36.202 --> 00:06:40.793\nare the very first line, attack vector,\nif you will, the first line of attack that\n\n129\n00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:43.941\nanybody that's on the outside\nof your organization, or\n\n130\n00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.310\nmaybe inside your organization,\nis going to try to attack.\n\n131\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.730\nSo password policies are important.\n\n132\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.550\nYou might have, and most likely will,\nhave some kind of documentation, that\n\n133\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.850\nlays out what the password policy and how\nthat you are going to adhere to a policy,\n\n134\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.062\nbut what does a password\npolicy help us to do?\n\n135\n00:07:02.062 --> 00:07:06.080\nAll right, well it helps to increase the\nresilience of our passwords to things like\n\n136\n00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.550\npassword attacks.\n\n137\n00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.000\nNow, you could see there's actually\ninside of your Windows Operating System.\n\n138\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.200\nI'm on a server right here.\n\n139\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.930\nWindows Server 2012 machine and\n\n140\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.670\nwe can say that we actually have\npassword policies in effect by default.\n\n141\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.470\nSo for instance if I just bring\nup our server manager dashboard.\n\n142\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.040\nWe go over here to tools and when you\nscroll down a little bit you're gonna see\n\n143\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.790\nthat well hey, there's Group Policy\nManagement Console, right, the GPMC.\n\n144\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.320\nNow the Group Policy Management Console is\nimportant because this is how we push out\n\n145\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:40.510\npolicies, but those polices define\nwhat is the computing environment.\n\n146\n00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.791\nHow is it going to affect the users?\n\n147\n00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:46.369\nCan be restrictive,\nare we gonna not allow certain things,\n\n148\n00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:51.141\nbut in the context of a password policy,\nwe have what's known as a default domain\n\n149\n00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:54.605\npolicy over here in our group\npolicy management console.\n\n150\n00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:56.267\nSo let me go ahead and just show you.\n\n151\n00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.681\nWe take a look at this, right?\n\n152\n00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:01.598\nAnd we can kind of define what makes\nup the components that make up password\n\n153\n00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:02.112\npolicy.\n\n154\n00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:05.032\nAnd if I basically just go ahead and\n\n155\n00:08:05.032 --> 00:08:08.969\nexpand out Policies &gt;\nWindow Settings here.\n\n156\n00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:11.430\nLet me go ahead and expand this so\nyou guys can see out there.\n\n157\n00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.052\nSecurity Settings and then notice\nwe have Account Policies, right?\n\n158\n00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:16.176\nWell, under Account Policies\nif I expand that out,\n\n159\n00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:18.890\nyou're gonna see something\ncalled Password Policy.\n\n160\n00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.900\nNow I could expand this out,\nit just makes the arrow go away.\n\n161\n00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.865\nSo I've always thought that was\nan interesting arrow there for sure.\n\n162\n00:08:23.865 --> 00:08:28.137\nBut notice that we have portions\nof our Password Policy, right?\n\n163\n00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:30.024\nYou can see that's what's\ngoing to be enforced.\n\n164\n00:08:30.024 --> 00:08:32.179\nAnd I'll show you that here in a second,\nbut\n\n165\n00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.520\nnotice that we have these properties,\nright?\n\n166\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.970\nThese things that make up, if I can get\nthat on the screen there, there we go,\n\n167\n00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.690\nthat make up our password policy, right?\n\n168\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.260\nWe have Enforce password history, right?\n\n169\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.760\nWell, how is that going to help\n\n170\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.070\nstrengthen our passwords when it\ncomes to password-based attacks?\n\n171\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.790\nWell, I want you to think about it.\n\n172\n00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.808\nA lot of people have a common\npassword that they like to use.\n\n173\n00:08:53.808 --> 00:08:56.027\nNow, Zach, I'm not gonna ask you for\nyour password.\n\n174\n00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:58.250\nThis isn't a social engineering class,\nfor sure.\n\n175\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.737\nBut I'm sure that you have one password,\nwe all do, I'm guilty, too.\n\n176\n00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:05.663\nWe've got one password that we\nmaybe use in more than one account.\n\n177\n00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:08.020\nDoesn't have to be multiple accounts.\n\n178\n00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.070\nI guess it does if it's more than one,\nbut it could be two accounts, right?\n\n179\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.690\nSome people have one password\nthat they like to use across\n\n180\n00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.598\nevery single account that they have,\ndoesn't matter where.\n\n181\n00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:20.772\nWell, if I always use that password,\nif I never change that password,\n\n182\n00:09:20.772 --> 00:09:25.575\nyou're giving the attackers all the time\nit takes to try to guess that password and\n\n183\n00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:28.440\nbrute force it because it never changes.\n\n184\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.262\nAll right, however,\nif I say, you know what?\n\n185\n00:09:31.262 --> 00:09:37.100\n24 passwords are gonna be basically\nbookmarked by this server, by this policy.\n\n186\n00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.880\nWe're gonna remember 24 passwords.\n\n187\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.298\nAnd if you used any one\nof those 24 passwords,\n\n188\n00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:45.651\ntry to use it again when it comes time to\nchange your password, we're gonna say, no,\n\n189\n00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:50.077\nno, no, no, no, no, no, no, you've\ngot to come up with something unique.\n\n190\n00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:54.737\nSo what this says is that you have\nto come up with 24 unique passwords\n\n191\n00:09:54.737 --> 00:09:56.080\nbefore you can ever re-use it.\n\n192\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.331\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; On the 25th time,\n\n193\n00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:01.995\nif your favorite password is I love my\ncats or whatever and we'll go a little bit\n\n194\n00:10:01.995 --> 00:10:06.195\nmore into that one more either,\nthen you can reuse that password.\n\n195\n00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:10.350\nAll right, now one of the things\nthat you can do inside,\n\n196\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.370\nlet's say that this is the only setting\nthat we were to enforce, all right?\n\n197\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.848\nWell, what would stop a user\nfrom coming over here,\n\n198\n00:10:17.848 --> 00:10:23.242\ndoing a Ctrl+Alt+Delete and changing\ntheir password right there 24 times.\n\n199\n00:10:23.242 --> 00:10:27.424\nJust rifle through all of those password\nhistories and then just go ahead and\n\n200\n00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.725\nchange it right back to the one they want.\n\n201\n00:10:29.725 --> 00:10:32.588\nWell, that's where some of\nthe other settings come in.\n\n202\n00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:36.595\nAnd what I've always thought is\ninteresting is notice the Minimum password\n\n203\n00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:38.750\nage this isn't enforced, all right?\n\n204\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.670\nBut if I right-click on it and I choose\nProperties, I can define the setting, and\n\n205\n00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.830\nlet's just say I say two days, all right?\n\n206\n00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.590\nAnd then, what I do is I go ahead and I\napply this password policy and choose OK.\n\n207\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.130\nNow, here's something that's kind of cool,\nZach.\n\n208\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.950\nNotice that it says minimum\npassword age is two days.\n\n209\n00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:00.020\nWell, if I go back to my machine here,\nand I say, you know what?\n\n210\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.180\nI think I'm gonna go ahead, here's my old\npassword, and I'm gonna go ahead, and\n\n211\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.130\nI'm gonna change this password, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.045\nAnd we'll see here what happens.\n\n213\n00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:14.509\nAll right, unable to update password.\n\n214\n00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:17.579\nNow it's giving me an option here, right?\n\n215\n00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:21.900\nIt says, unable to update password.\n\n216\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.913\nThe value provided for the new password\ndoes not meet length complexity,\n\n217\n00:11:25.913 --> 00:11:27.408\nor history requirements.\n\n218\n00:11:27.408 --> 00:11:29.216\nIt's not letting me\nchange to the same thing.\n\n219\n00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:33.578\nBut even more so, if I did change\nthis password to a new one,\n\n220\n00:11:33.578 --> 00:11:36.550\nit's now gonna be valid for two days.\n\n221\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.010\nAnd that's what that setting does.\n\n222\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.720\nThat setting says, okay,\nsure, change your password.\n\n223\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.130\nBut you're not gonna be able to rifle\nthrough 24 combinations because the moment\n\n224\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.670\nyou change it,\nyou have to use it for two days.\n\n225\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.743\nWhich if we look,\n24 times 2 what do we got, 48?\n\n226\n00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:50.527\nThat means,\n\n227\n00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:55.510\nit would take you 48 days to cycle back\nto these password histories based on\n\n228\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.540\nthe fact that we just enforced a minimum\ntime that you have to use that password.\n\n229\n00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.340\n&gt;&gt; It is great.\n\n230\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.990\n&gt;&gt; All right now,\nwe also have a maximum password age, and\n\n231\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.070\nthat's the other side of the track.\n\n232\n00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:09.367\nThat says, okay, well, if you don't like\nto change your password, that's okay,\n\n233\n00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:10.572\nyou've got 42 days.\n\n234\n00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:15.140\nBut then on that 43rd day, we're gonna\nrequire you to change your password.\n\n235\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.100\nNow I wanna go back to\nprivilege user agreement.\n\n236\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.160\nIn that privilege user agreement,\nfor administrators,\n\n237\n00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.360\nit might define it as\na smaller maximum time.\n\n238\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.670\nWe might say well, because you have access\nto a lot of these things, we wanna keep it\n\n239\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.140\na little bit more safe, and we're a little\nbit more strict with our password policy.\n\n240\n00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.720\nWe're gonna make you\nchange it every 15 days.\n\n241\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.020\nStandard users?\n\n242\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.060\nOkay, we'll make you\nchange it every 30 days or\n\n243\n00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.370\nmaybe we'll keep it at the default.\n\n244\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.250\nSo that's again,\nup to whatever the password policy is.\n\n245\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.470\nPassword length, how many characters?\n\n246\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.340\nAll right, seven characters, right?\n\n247\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.860\nSo I could change this if I want.\n\n248\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.068\nAnd again for administrators,\n\n249\n00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:53.265\nI might say, well, hey,\nyou got the keys to the kingdom.\n\n250\n00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:55.739\nNot only do you have to\nchange it every 15 days, but\n\n251\n00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:58.350\nyou're gonna have to use\na ten-character password.\n\n252\n00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.280\nThen we also have password must\nmeet complexity requirements, and\n\n253\n00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.070\nyou can see that it's enabled.\n\n254\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.620\nWe talk about password complexity,\n\n255\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.930\nthat means you have to use one of\neach of the four character sets.\n\n256\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:12.441\nYou have to use uppercase letters,\nlowercase letters, special characters, and\n\n257\n00:13:12.441 --> 00:13:14.240\nnumbers, right?\n\n258\n00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.193\nIt ensures that it\nincreases the resiliency of\n\n259\n00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:20.170\nthat password to password-based attacks.\n\n260\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.890\nSo it's all lowercase letters and\nit's a dictionary word.\n\n261\n00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.375\nRight, well there's automated attacks\nthat they can actually run it through\n\n262\n00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:28.325\na dictionary list and\n\n263\n00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:31.937\nthey can try to guess those password\nthrough automation software, if you will.\n\n264\n00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:35.520\nSo that's one of the reasons that we\nhave our password policies, right?\n\n265\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.135\nAnd once that's done, we can turn around\nand we can push that out to our domain.\n\n266\n00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:45.530\nCuz I just updated and now I can push\nthat out to the entire Windows domain,\n\n267\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.098\nor everybody that's within\nmy corporate network.\n\n268\n00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:49.500\nAnd we could come over here,\n\n269\n00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.440\nwe can do something like\nlaunching up our command prompt.\n\n270\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.306\nLet me just run this as an administrator,\nand I can run something like GP update,\n\n271\n00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:01.797\nAnd a space /force and when I run this,\n\n272\n00:14:01.797 --> 00:14:06.313\nwhat this computer is now doing is\nreaching out to that domain controller,\n\n273\n00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:11.200\nlooking at the policy and saying,\nthere's an update to the policy.\n\n274\n00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.071\nI need to go ahead and\napply those settings to this machine and\n\n275\n00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:15.440\nit now enforces it, right?\n\n276\n00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.970\nSo keep in mind that password\npolicies are very, very important.\n\n277\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.927\nAll right,\nnow we also mentioned just briefly,\n\n278\n00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:24.710\nwe mentioned things like onboarding and\noffboarding, if you will.\n\n279\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.360\nJust keep in mind that with onboarding and\noffboarding procedures, what we're talking\n\n280\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.070\nabout essentially is, how do you bring\nsomebody into your organization?\n\n281\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.262\nYou have to have a systematic approach and\na policy that allows you to do that,\n\n282\n00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:38.380\nall right, or\ndefines how you do that I should say.\n\n283\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.766\nRight, it might be, hey,\nyou need to bring your driver's license,\n\n284\n00:14:40.766 --> 00:14:42.309\nyou need to bring your\nSocial Security card.\n\n285\n00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:44.877\nIf you're looking for a security\nclearance or something like that,\n\n286\n00:14:44.877 --> 00:14:48.056\nsome kind of working with money, you might\nhave to have a security history, right?\n\n287\n00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:52.001\nWhere we could track that, we can see and\nfind out, maybe a background check, right?\n\n288\n00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:58.478\nOffboarding procedures,\nthey've got a technical term for\n\n289\n00:14:58.478 --> 00:15:01.796\nit when you part ways, right?\n\n290\n00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:05.716\nBut basically you're either firing or\nyou're letting somebody go, if you will,\n\n291\n00:15:05.716 --> 00:15:09.135\nor somebody is quitting, but\nwe have to have an appropriate procedure.\n\n292\n00:15:09.135 --> 00:15:13.136\nIt might be something like that, maybe\nthat it's a privileged user, where they're\n\n293\n00:15:13.136 --> 00:15:16.973\nquite literally, their passwords are\nchanged, their account is disabled, and\n\n294\n00:15:16.973 --> 00:15:19.491\nthen they're escorted out of the building,\nright?\n\n295\n00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:23.913\nI know that seems extreme, but when you\nhave certain like, in environments where\n\n296\n00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:28.658\nit's highly secure, you certainly don't\nwant that the disgruntled employee turning\n\n297\n00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:31.820\ninto a malicious insider that\nnow sabotages your system.\n\n298\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.600\nSo they're very,\nvery important, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.141\nNow they also talk about things\nlike licensing restrictions.\n\n300\n00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:39.951\nAnd when we mention\nlicensing restrictions,\n\n301\n00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:44.271\nI want you to know that this is a lot\nof times about things like software,\n\n302\n00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:47.530\ncould be warranties,\ncould be hardware as well.\n\n303\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.841\nBut I wanna just take it in the context\nof things like software, right?\n\n304\n00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:55.794\nPolicies and procedures, when it comes to\nsoftware, when you talk about licensing\n\n305\n00:15:55.794 --> 00:16:00.538\nrestrictions, you might have to understand\nthat Certain software that we use at\n\n306\n00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:03.980\nhome we can't use in\nan enterprise environment, right?\n\n307\n00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.800\nThere might be certain, and\nthere is certain software that is for\n\n308\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.130\npersonal private use, for home use But\nis it used for commercial use?\n\n309\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.180\nAnd you have to make sure that you follow\nwhatever the licensing restriction is.\n\n310\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.892\nIn fact, let me go ahead and show you,\ngot a couple examples here right?\n\n311\n00:16:19.892 --> 00:16:25.177\nWhen you have proprietary software on\nMicrosoft's website because I did work for\n\n312\n00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:28.241\na company that had volume\nlicense agreement and\n\n313\n00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:33.526\nthey use to have past 250 computers\noperating systems they needed per year, so\n\n314\n00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:38.987\nwe had a volume license agreement, or that\ncompany had a volume license agreement.\n\n315\n00:16:38.987 --> 00:16:42.626\nAnd we had to make sure that we followed\naccording to the licensing terms and\n\n316\n00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:43.510\ndocumentation.\n\n317\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.480\nI couldn't take one of those operating\nsystems and then take my home computer.\n\n318\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.830\nAnd apply the operating system\nto my home computer, why?\n\n319\n00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:56.748\nWell, it's a violation of the terms of\nagreement inside of whatever our licensing\n\n320\n00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:58.234\nrestrictions, right?\n\n321\n00:16:58.234 --> 00:17:01.080\nSo you might see that something like that.\n\n322\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.260\nThe other thing that we have or\n\n323\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.060\nmaybe you have open source software,\nwell that's okay.\n\n324\n00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.140\nYou have to be aware of open source\nsource software developed by and\n\n325\n00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.470\nfor the user community.\n\n326\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:18.250\nThis might not fall under\na proprietary licencing restriction,\n\n327\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.320\nyou have to be aware of that.\n\n328\n00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.955\nYou have to know where that starts and\nstops.\n\n329\n00:17:22.955 --> 00:17:25.975\nJust because you buy a personal license\ndoesn't mean you can turn around and\n\n330\n00:17:25.975 --> 00:17:28.715\nlet a hundred people use it\ninside of your organization.\n\n331\n00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:30.705\nThings like for\n\n332\n00:17:30.705 --> 00:17:34.505\ninstance again, non proprietary\nsoftware open source software right.\n\n333\n00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:37.993\nWe have things like the general,\nthe GNU general public license,\n\n334\n00:17:37.993 --> 00:17:39.945\nyou might hear it called the GPL right.\n\n335\n00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:44.460\nThis is the opposite of proprietary,\nopen source, right.\n\n336\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.095\nIt is,\nlet's see they tell you,right here we go.\n\n337\n00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:49.250\nEveryone is permitted.\n\n338\n00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.495\nThis is about the license itself to\ndistribute verbatim copies of this\n\n339\n00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:53.266\nlicense right.\n\n340\n00:17:53.266 --> 00:17:56.987\nNotice it tells us, it tells us that\nhey,here we go, that general public\n\n341\n00:17:56.987 --> 00:18:00.840\nlicensing is a free copy left license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n342\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.420\nNow, what portions of the software\n\n343\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.120\nfall under that free licence,\nnot everything bundle in it.\n\n344\n00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.110\nJust because you have a Linux operating\nsystem that you got a free distribution.\n\n345\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.305\nThere's portion of, and can be installed\n\n346\n00:18:16.305 --> 00:18:20.265\nwithin that operating system,\nproprietary software,\n\n347\n00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:24.505\nthat could get you in trouble if you're\nnot following those agreements, right?\n\n348\n00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:27.800\nSo it is important to keep that in mind,\nall right.\n\n349\n00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.170\nSo that is a little bit the licensing\nrestrictions keep in mind always\n\n350\n00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.885\nfollow things like end user\nlicense agreement, right?\n\n351\n00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:38.400\nThe end user license agreement, is when\nyou install the pieces software and\n\n352\n00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.920\nas you kind of next through\nthe installation of a piece of software,\n\n353\n00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.030\nit says,\nhey you got to agree to this terms.\n\n354\n00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.150\nWe see that before and\nwe install piece software, and\n\n355\n00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.590\nkeep in mind that you gonna\nbe bound into those terms.\n\n356\n00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.532\nAnd if anywhere inside of those,\nthe pieces of that agreement,\n\n357\n00:18:56.532 --> 00:19:01.496\nif you only use one License of agreement,\nthere might be little subsections that\n\n358\n00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:05.949\nsay hey, this is the way you can use it,\nthis is the way you can't use it.\n\n359\n00:19:05.949 --> 00:19:09.732\nThe company that is providing you\nthis software isn't liable for\n\n360\n00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:12.080\ndamages that might happen or data loss.\n\n361\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.232\nAnd that's something we also\nhave to keep in mind when it\n\n362\n00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:19.812\ncomes to the different pieces of software\nthat we use within our organizations.\n\n363\n00:19:19.812 --> 00:19:23.995\nSo, for instance when we talk about\nsoftware that one of the things they\n\n364\n00:19:23.995 --> 00:19:26.938\nmention here is international\nexport controls.\n\n365\n00:19:26.938 --> 00:19:31.772\nNow, we live here in Gainesville in the\nUnited States, and I know we got viewers\n\n366\n00:19:31.772 --> 00:19:34.812\nthat are all over the world here so this-\n&gt;&gt; It's really cool.\n\n367\n00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:39.220\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely awesome, right, but\nwe do have to keep in mind that there\n\n368\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.248\nare certain laws in place that say\nwhat we can send across seas or\n\n369\n00:19:43.248 --> 00:19:45.380\nwhat we can't send across seas.\n\n370\n00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.170\nSo let me give you an example,\n\n371\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.430\nthe Wassenaar agreement is\nan example of one of them.\n\n372\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.681\nI got the documentation here.\n\n373\n00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:53.380\nWell, actually the website if you will.\n\n374\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.538\nPulled up here right.\n\n375\n00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:58.808\nAnd this is controls if you will,export\ncontrols on conventional arms and\n\n376\n00:19:58.808 --> 00:20:00.650\ndual use goods and technology.\n\n377\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.340\nNow, we're not talking about\nthe net plus exam saying,\n\n378\n00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.600\nhey, you got to be aware of what\nthe international arms treaty is.\n\n379\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.028\nThat's not it, but\n\n380\n00:20:09.028 --> 00:20:14.156\nyou have to understand that this also\ndictates things like technology.\n\n381\n00:20:14.156 --> 00:20:17.859\nIn fact, in Nashville, you'll see national\npolicies here to, yeah, goods and\n\n382\n00:20:17.859 --> 00:20:18.510\ntechnology.\n\n383\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:22.551\nSo things like CPU Or\nencryption technologies, right?\n\n384\n00:20:22.551 --> 00:20:26.152\nSo if I am encrypting a piece of\ninformation with a certain level of\n\n385\n00:20:26.152 --> 00:20:29.610\nencryption, I am not allowed\nto send it across seas, right?\n\n386\n00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.409\nAnd into certain countries, and you don't\nhave to worry about what countries they\n\n387\n00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:35.808\nare, that's not relevant\nto the exam objectives.\n\n388\n00:20:35.808 --> 00:20:39.522\nBut just to understand that if you\nare an international company or\n\n389\n00:20:39.522 --> 00:20:44.116\nyou're dealing internationally,\nthere might be laws against using AES 256\n\n390\n00:20:44.116 --> 00:20:46.970\nencryption and\nsending it to a certain location.\n\n391\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.162\nBecause they don't want that country,\nthat location, that locale being able\n\n392\n00:20:51.162 --> 00:20:55.310\nto reverse engineer the technology and\nthen turn around and use is against us.\n\n393\n00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.799\nAll right, a little bit more strict here,\nUSS State Department,\n\n394\n00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.601\nright, they also have things\nlike ITAR in there, and\n\n395\n00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:05.240\nthat's more really more towards\ntraffic and arms and regulations.\n\n396\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.840\nBut again,\nit's international export control, right?\n\n397\n00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.895\nAnd you could be working for a business\nthat is a large international organization\n\n398\n00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:15.200\nthat sends information to different\nlocations across the world.\n\n399\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.076\nAnd you have to be careful on\nhow you export that information.\n\n400\n00:21:19.076 --> 00:21:23.515\nRemember that some of the technologies\nthat you use in order to secure that\n\n401\n00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:27.253\ninformation might not be allowed\nto be sent to foreign soils.\n\n402\n00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:30.632\nAnd again, so pay attention to\ninternational export controls.\n\n403\n00:21:30.632 --> 00:21:34.715\nAll right, moving on in the list,\nwe have things like for\n\n404\n00:21:34.715 --> 00:21:37.110\ninstance data loss prevention.\n\n405\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.180\nWe talked about things like DLP.\n\n406\n00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.473\nData loss prevention,\nthe main objective is essentially is to\n\n407\n00:21:44.473 --> 00:21:49.333\nminimize data loss and business impact\ndue to some kind of data breach or\n\n408\n00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:54.360\ndata leak if you will that results in\nan incident or an incidence, right?\n\n409\n00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.870\nWe'll get into incident response\npolicies here in a second.\n\n410\n00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.534\nSo how does data leak, right?\n\n411\n00:21:58.534 --> 00:22:01.580\nWhy is this so important, right?\n\n412\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.330\nWell, sensitive data that's sent\nover the wire and it's unencrypted.\n\n413\n00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.061\nI say, the wire and Zach,\nlike I had mentioned before we kinda,\n\n414\n00:22:08.061 --> 00:22:10.960\nwhen I say the wire, I mean\nfiguratively over the network, right?\n\n415\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.514\nDoesn't necessarily have to be\njust a wired communication,\n\n416\n00:22:13.514 --> 00:22:15.340\ncould be a wireless communication as well.\n\n417\n00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.098\nEven worse if that's\nwireless communication but,\n\n418\n00:22:18.098 --> 00:22:22.610\nsensitive data sent over a channel\nunencrypted, whether its wire or wireless.\n\n419\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.687\nEmails, without using things like SMIM.\n\n420\n00:22:25.687 --> 00:22:29.130\nThe Secured Multimedia Internet Mail\nlike extensions, right.\n\n421\n00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.585\nData, here's a big one and\nwe don't think about this one a lot.\n\n422\n00:22:34.585 --> 00:22:38.728\nHow about sense of information that's\nprint out on a printer and left there.\n\n423\n00:22:38.728 --> 00:22:42.413\nI'll go get that about an hour here,\nI just went ahead and printed it out or\n\n424\n00:22:42.413 --> 00:22:43.373\nI forgot about it.\n\n425\n00:22:43.373 --> 00:22:46.571\nRight, you get somebody that works over\nto the printer, turns over that piece of\n\n426\n00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:50.550\npaper, they're now looking at financial\ninformation from one of your customers.\n\n427\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.885\nAnd they're part of the front desk help.\n\n428\n00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:56.178\nAnd again, I'm not-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n429\n00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:57.111\n&gt;&gt; Or say yeah, absolutely.\n\n430\n00:22:57.111 --> 00:22:59.900\nThe malicious insider,\njust like we talked about, right.\n\n431\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.189\nSo there are certain things that\nyou have to keep in mind, and\n\n432\n00:23:03.189 --> 00:23:07.724\nyou've got to prevent, right, that data\nloss, that data leakage, if you will.\n\n433\n00:23:07.724 --> 00:23:10.330\nSo what are some of the ways\nthat we can do that, right.\n\n434\n00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.441\nWell, we have to understand that there's\ndifferent ways that you do data loss\n\n435\n00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:15.642\nprevention, right?\n\n436\n00:23:15.642 --> 00:23:17.470\nBecause we have three\ndifferent data states.\n\n437\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.247\nAnd I'm not sure if they're going\ntest you on data states but\n\n438\n00:23:20.247 --> 00:23:23.515\nyou have what's known as data in motion,\ndata at rest and data at use and\n\n439\n00:23:23.515 --> 00:23:26.204\nthe way that we protect each\none is a little bit different.\n\n440\n00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:29.450\nIf it's data in motion,\nwe use end to end encryption.\n\n441\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.000\nWe use some of the protocols that Zach and\n\n442\n00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.450\nI have talked about through\nthis whole entire series.\n\n443\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.640\n&gt;&gt; We use things like secure\nfile transfer protocol.\n\n444\n00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.225\nWe use SSH, Secure Copy Protocol.\n\n445\n00:23:40.225 --> 00:23:44.448\nWe use transport layer security and\ncertificates using asymmetric key\n\n446\n00:23:44.448 --> 00:23:49.050\nencryption in order to send that\ninformation across the wires is important.\n\n447\n00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:50.087\nData at rest.\n\n448\n00:23:50.087 --> 00:23:54.798\nThis is data that resides in a data\nbase and maybe isn't in use at the time.\n\n449\n00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:58.674\nData in use could be data bases cuz data\nbases are constantly writing information\n\n450\n00:23:58.674 --> 00:23:59.814\nin and out of database.\n\n451\n00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:01.480\nSo database is honestly an.\n\n452\n00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.743\nIn fairness might be data in use but\nfile systems, right?\n\n453\n00:24:05.743 --> 00:24:09.224\nData that's stored on a hard drive,\nyour archives, your backups, right.\n\n454\n00:24:09.224 --> 00:24:15.260\nWhat is your backups, your most crucial\nsensitive information sitting in a closet.\n\n455\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.590\nWell, how do you make sure that that\ninformation is protected, right?\n\n456\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.640\nWe have locked cabinets, right?\n\n457\n00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.450\nWe have tape rotation method, right?\n\n458\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.194\nWe separation of duties, right?\n\n459\n00:24:25.194 --> 00:24:27.953\nPrivilege user agreement, right?\n\n460\n00:24:27.953 --> 00:24:31.992\nOur backup operator isn't our restoration\noperator because we don't want the person\n\n461\n00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:34.924\nthat can take the sensitive\ninformation also being the one that\n\n462\n00:24:34.924 --> 00:24:39.140\ncan restore the information cuz now they\ncould potentially have access to it.\n\n463\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.360\nSo we use full drive encryption,\nwe use file encryption, right?\n\n464\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.750\nMaking sure that that\ninformation stays scrambled.\n\n465\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.940\nAll right, data in use.\n\n466\n00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.755\nWhen it's data that's in use,\nagain just the end points of\n\n467\n00:24:51.755 --> 00:24:55.586\nthe network where the data is\ncurrently being worked with.\n\n468\n00:24:55.586 --> 00:24:57.861\nThis is where password policies come in,\n\n469\n00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:01.501\nthis is where we ensure that we\nhave file permissions, where ACL,\n\n470\n00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:05.730\naccess control list, that are controlling\nthe level of access a person has.\n\n471\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.350\nAnd again remember your\nprinciple of least privilege\n\n472\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.090\nI give you what you need to do your job.\n\n473\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.178\nThe privileges, the rights, if you will.\n\n474\n00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:14.110\nThe access level that you need.\n\n475\n00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.300\nNo more, no less all right?\n\n476\n00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.710\nYour loss prevention might be part of\nthe employee on-boarding process, right.\n\n477\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.727\nWe don't leave sensitive data\nunattended in things like Desks, right?\n\n478\n00:25:24.727 --> 00:25:26.510\nThat's another thing.\n\n479\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.330\nClean desk policies are the way that we\nalso prevent things like data loss or\n\n480\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.850\ndo implement data loss prevention, right?\n\n481\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.360\nJust because you didn't leave it at the\nprinter, did you leave it at your desk?\n\n482\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.692\nWhere it's turned up and\neverybody can see?\n\n483\n00:25:37.692 --> 00:25:39.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That point is just location, and\n\n484\n00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:40.590\nit's no different, right.\n\n485\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.559\nThe end result could be the same, right?\n\n486\n00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:48.285\nUse things like, when it comes to\nsecuring your file cabinets, right,\n\n487\n00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:50.690\nuse secure shredding bins, right?\n\n488\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.210\nWe talk about data eradication.\n\n489\n00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.992\nIf it is something that you need to\neradicate you put in a lock bin and\n\n490\n00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:57.487\nyou have a company that's\nlicensed,bonded and insured.\n\n491\n00:25:57.487 --> 00:25:58.671\nThey show up on your web, or\n\n492\n00:25:58.671 --> 00:26:01.460\nnot your website if they show up\non our website you got problems.\n\n493\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.610\nSo you don't want them to\neradicate your website.\n\n494\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.539\nBut they show up on your job site right\nand they take that information and\n\n495\n00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:11.090\nthey put in a secure manner and\nthey eradicate it for you on site.\n\n496\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.110\nSo these are some of the things\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n497\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.290\nNow Zach, I am looking at it and\nit does look [LAUGH] like we've got quite\n\n498\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:23.000\na few more topics to go, but I don't know\nthat we have enough time in this episode.\n\n499\n00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.650\n&gt;&gt; Policies and best practices,\nthis has been episode one,\n\n500\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.150\nthere will be episode two.\n\n501\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.927\nWonderful episode, great job Wes.\n\n502\n00:26:28.927 --> 00:26:31.480\nAnd he does a wonderful job\nputting together everything in\n\n503\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.950\nthe CompTIA NetPlus series.\n\n504\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.080\nMake sure you watch all of them.\n\n505\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.530\nAnd when you're in the course library,\n\n506\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.490\ncheck out the hundreds\nof other videos there.\n\n507\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.510\nThey're all designed to do one thing.\n\n508\n00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.070\nTake you further.\n\n509\n00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.300\nAnd thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n510\n00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:44.030\nI'm Zack

00:00:08.341\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.592\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:13.878\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:15.694\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:20.170\nI'm your host Zach Bemis as we\ncontinue on with CompTia Net plus.\n\n8\n00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.152\nIn this episode physical\nsecurity devices and\n\n9\n00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:24.446\nwe've asked Wes Bryan to\nhelp us out with that again.\n\n10\n00:00:24.446 --> 00:00:26.411\nWes great to see you thanks for\nbeing here.\n\n11\n00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:28.566\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely Zach as always thank you for\nhaving me back.\n\n12\n00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:32.941\nThat's right we have a lot of fun\nhere behind the scenes at ITProTV and\n\n13\n00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:37.469\nhopefully, we're gonna exude some of\nthat fun here in this episode and\n\n14\n00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.580\nyou guys can kinda,\nglean from the excitement.\n\n15\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.820\nNo, just joking aside here, we are going\nto be looking at a line of defense, right,\n\n16\n00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.330\nin other security episodes we talk about a\nconcept known as defense in depth, right.\n\n17\n00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.310\nThis, actually started as a military\nterm and then things like the technology\n\n18\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.546\nthe information technology IT industry,\nthey kind of adopted it as well, right.\n\n19\n00:00:58.546 --> 00:01:03.056\nEven when we're talking about physical\nsecurity devices you have to understand\n\n20\n00:01:03.056 --> 00:01:06.310\nthat we don't just use one method, right.\n\n21\n00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.840\nYou have to use a layered defense system,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000\nThat's what defense in depth is,\nin fact I've got a little diagram here and\n\n23\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.180\nwe'll talk more about defense\nin depth in other episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.115\nBut I do just want to understand that,\nphysical security,\n\n25\n00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:21.965\nthat's in this chain here, right?\n\n26\n00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:26.173\nWe talk about being aware of policies,\nprocedures, and awareness.\n\n27\n00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:29.273\nI don't know what I have to defend from\nif I don't know what I don't know,\n\n28\n00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:30.785\nI've gotta be aware of that first.\n\n29\n00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:33.372\nSo that's your first\nline of defense right,\n\n30\n00:01:33.372 --> 00:01:35.202\nall the way leading up to data security.\n\n31\n00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:39.212\nBecause think about it in the end,\nwe've got things like access control list,\n\n32\n00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:43.352\npermissions if you will on our data,\nwe apply data encryption technologies.\n\n33\n00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:44.902\nSo that would be up\nthere to the top layer,\n\n34\n00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:49.011\nboy I tell you what, what a layers in\nthe theoreticals in network plus, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.571\nWell, [COUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead and what we're\n\n36\n00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.565\ngonna do is we're gonna focus on this\npart right here Physical Security, right?\n\n37\n00:01:55.565 --> 00:02:00.603\nI mistakenly sometimes cuz I wanna\nsay physical security your first line\n\n38\n00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:05.571\nof defense, well maybe from a technical\nstandpoint that's not true.\n\n39\n00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:11.377\nPolicies procedures and awareness is what\nis going to be your first line of defense,\n\n40\n00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:15.480\nso second line defense is\nphysical security, right?\n\n41\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.005\nAnd let's talk now some of the concepts\nwhen in it comes to physical security, and\n\n42\n00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.908\nthere's a whole bunch to different one,\nbut really what our objectives they\n\n43\n00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:27.890\nboil them down to two different\ncategories really detection.\n\n44\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.722\nDetection becoming aware that some\nkind of threat, some kind of,\n\n45\n00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:39.306\nsomething that could lead us into lost, to\ndamaged, to vandalism, theft, if you will.\n\n46\n00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:42.975\nLead us into things,\njust unavailability of our data,\n\n47\n00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:47.440\nphysical security, let's stop\nat security for a second, right.\n\n48\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.210\nWe talk about security, one thing in\nsecurity, we have those three principles\n\n49\n00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.740\nthat we kind of really push here,\nwhat's called the CIA triad.\n\n50\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.770\nConfidentiality integrity and\navailability, confidentiality,\n\n51\n00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.130\nwe encrypt our information we talk\nabout things like VPN communication.\n\n52\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.955\nSo if I'm sending communication\nbetween myself and\n\n53\n00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:09.495\nZach's on the internal,\nmaybe the work network, I'm at home.\n\n54\n00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:13.077\nWe can tunnel through that private\nnetwork, we can crypt the information and\n\n55\n00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:16.179\nsomebody that's trying to eavesdrop\non it can't see it, right.\n\n56\n00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:21.122\nConfidentiality ensuring that only the\nintended recipients of the information,\n\n57\n00:03:21.122 --> 00:03:25.510\nthe intended authorized users can\nconsume that information integrity.\n\n58\n00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.326\nMaking sure that the information isn't\nreceived in an altered state, right?\n\n59\n00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:36.664\nI want you think about it, if I send\nsome payment information to Zack,\n\n60\n00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:41.224\nZack if he was in accounting,\nhe'd wanna make sure that that information\n\n61\n00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:45.290\ndidn't get modified in any way,\nnot a single punctuation mark.\n\n62\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.966\nWe maintain integrity through things like\nfile hashing, we make sure that we run\n\n63\n00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:52.153\nalgorithms across our data so that Zack,\nwhen I send them that piece of\n\n64\n00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:55.848\ninformation, maybe that accounting\ndocument, he can run a little algorithm.\n\n65\n00:03:55.848 --> 00:03:58.945\nThe same algorithm across it as well and\ncompare the two values and\n\n66\n00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:00.588\nif they are the same, guess what?\n\n67\n00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:03.113\nThen the data has maintained\nit's integrity, right?\n\n68\n00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:06.768\nBut the last part of the CIA\ntriad is availability too, right?\n\n69\n00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:11.935\nSo physical security,\nnot only protecting information and\n\n70\n00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:17.920\nbuildings from damage, loss,\nleft the availability part, right?\n\n71\n00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.959\nWe actually suffered a couple of weeks\nago from a distributive DDOS attack,\n\n72\n00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:27.461\ndistributed denial service attack,\nwhere our website went down.\n\n73\n00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.030\nAnd you think that affects our business,\nright?\n\n74\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.970\nSo it's also about availability of\nthe information too that we gotta\n\n75\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.430\nkeep in mind, all right?\n\n76\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.555\nAnother security model that I\nlike is one that Microsoft has,\n\n77\n00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:39.489\nthe 10 Immutable Laws of Security.\n\n78\n00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:43.383\nIf you ever get a chance, go out there,\nGoogle it, check it out, all right, or,\n\n79\n00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:46.270\nif it's Microsoft technology\nmaybe I should say Bing it on.\n\n80\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.449\nBut,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One of those laws,\n\n82\n00:04:49.347 --> 00:04:52.907\none of those ten immutable laws says hey,\nif I can reach out and\n\n83\n00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:56.829\nI can touch your computer,\nit's no longer your computer, right?\n\n84\n00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:01.818\nSo we have to make sure that we have some\nkind of perimeter defense, physically.\n\n85\n00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:04.682\nNo, no we're not talking about DMZs,\nlogical defense,\n\n86\n00:05:04.682 --> 00:05:06.735\nwe're talking about physical defense.\n\n87\n00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:10.929\nFirst thing is detection,\nbeing made aware that something exists or\n\n88\n00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:13.325\nthat some kind of threat is happening.\n\n89\n00:05:13.325 --> 00:05:15.410\nThen the one is prevention, all right?\n\n90\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.830\nSo we have detection and prevention and,\nsometime we couple both of these together.\n\n91\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.512\nSometimes the technologies are, detection,\nand they prevent at the same time, right?\n\n92\n00:05:23.512 --> 00:05:28.951\nWe talk about IPS systems in other\nepisodes, an intrusion prevention system\n\n93\n00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.902\nmonitors, detects, alerts and\nthen implements counter measures.\n\n94\n00:05:33.902 --> 00:05:37.620\nSo it's doing detection and\nit's doing prevention as well, right.\n\n95\n00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.760\nSo sometimes you have these devices or\n\n96\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.480\nthese concepts but they kinda shake\nhands with each other, right.\n\n97\n00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.287\nAnd they're forming a bigger\npiece of security that you need.\n\n98\n00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:50.233\nSo let's go ahead and we're actually\ngonna jump into the first concept, and\n\n99\n00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.790\nthe very first concept is what is known as\nprevention right, or I'm sorry detection.\n\n100\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.101\nI almost got that one wrong right up\nhere at front, so detection, all right.\n\n101\n00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.021\nWhat are some of the ways of\nthat we can detect if the things\n\n102\n00:06:02.021 --> 00:06:07.014\nlike threats if you will are within\nthe vicinity, or location, right?\n\n103\n00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:10.102\nWell one of the first things that\nthey call out is motion detection.\n\n104\n00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:16.110\nMotion detection is something that maybe\nmost of you are probably already aware of.\n\n105\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.486\nEven if you're changing\nIndustries completely,\n\n106\n00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:23.104\nyou've heard of emotion detection devices,\nright?\n\n107\n00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:25.853\nMaybe if you haven't seen them or\nhave never implemented them that's\n\n108\n00:06:25.853 --> 00:06:29.224\na completely different subject, but you\nknow you've heard of them before, right?\n\n109\n00:06:29.224 --> 00:06:34.427\nBasically, they're used to\nsense the presence of some\n\n110\n00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:39.860\nunauthorized entity in a certain\nlocation or area right?\n\n111\n00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.960\nWe're talking a physical location here so\nit could be a residential area,\n\n112\n00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.630\nit could be commercial, it could be\ngovernment building if you will, right?\n\n113\n00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.020\nAnd it's typically set up and it's\nconnected to some kinda control panel,\n\n114\n00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.140\nall right?\n\n115\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.712\nNo, I'm not talking\nabout Windows here guys,\n\n116\n00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.102\nso take your Windows hat off for a second.\n\n117\n00:06:54.102 --> 00:06:58.705\nWe're talking about some kinda central\nnervous system control panel that,\n\n118\n00:06:58.705 --> 00:07:02.385\nWhen alerted, we could couple\nit with like security guards,\n\n119\n00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:04.241\nthat can respond in real time.\n\n120\n00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:06.925\nMaybe have a remote monitoring,\na company or\n\n121\n00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:11.391\nmaybe a third party maybe you've done\ntransference and outsourced that.\n\n122\n00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:15.602\nWe've got some company that's monitoring\nhey, we sense some motion towards\n\n123\n00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:19.259\nthe server closet area we need to\nget some to get over there, right?\n\n124\n00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.487\nNow, it can be set up speaking\nof things like server closets,\n\n125\n00:07:22.487 --> 00:07:26.293\nit could be set up in things like\nrestricted areas, unoccupied spaces.\n\n126\n00:07:26.293 --> 00:07:28.671\nIn fact, in this building,\nand not right now,\n\n127\n00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:32.655\nwe've actually got a pretty full, as far\nas the additional space we have here,\n\n128\n00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:35.600\nwe've got tenants pretty\nmuch filling up everything.\n\n129\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.060\nBut there was a time when\nwe first moved in that\n\n130\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.550\nwe didn't have tenants in certain\nspaces so that space was empty.\n\n131\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.426\nAnd that space should be empty, nobody's\nthere, nobody is renting the space,\n\n132\n00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.140\nnobody should be in there, right?\n\n133\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.629\nWell, how do we know if\nanybody is in there or not?\n\n134\n00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.645\nMy, that's where motion\nsensors come in handy,\n\n135\n00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.758\nwouldn't it be nice to put\nemotion sensor in there?\n\n136\n00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:58.549\nAnd if we detect the presence of\nan unauthorized entity in that area It\n\n137\n00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:01.530\ntriggers an alarm, or some kind of alert.\n\n138\n00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.130\nIt doesn't have to be an alarm.\n\n139\n00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.690\nIt can be very well just an email,\n\n140\n00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:10.100\nthat says hey detected presence\nzone such and such, right?\n\n141\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.370\nMotion detection can sense the presence\nof doors being opened, too.\n\n142\n00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.580\nThe fact that a door was opened.\n\n143\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.334\nHere's another one,\nwhen I worked with another company.\n\n144\n00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:23.040\n[LAUGH] The CEO of that\ncompany in his office,\n\n145\n00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.640\nwas actually, we had gone home for\nthe night I was teaching and stuff.\n\n146\n00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.050\nBut we had gone home for the evening.\n\n147\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.530\nWe were doing evening classes and we\ncome back the next morning and turn off,\n\n148\n00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.720\nthe alarm had been triggered.\n\n149\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.540\nWell we found out why.\n\n150\n00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.913\nThe CEO's office, he's ducks.\n\n151\n00:08:38.913 --> 00:08:43.200\nThese, if you guys aren't aware of\nthese ducks, their flight patterns,\n\n152\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.340\nthey're not the greatest and\ntheir radar isn't the greatest.\n\n153\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.810\n&gt;&gt; And they don't even walk that well.\n\n154\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right, they can't even\nwalk well, let alone fly well.\n\n155\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.620\nWell one, hit the glass.\n\n156\n00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.710\nI mean, it hit this window and\nit shattered this huge window,\n\n157\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:56.620\nbrought it to the ground.\n\n158\n00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.500\nI mean, nothing left.\n\n159\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.940\nWell it triggered a motion sensor,\n\n160\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.550\nthat in turn triggered an alarm that\nlead our local law enforcement here,\n\n161\n00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.290\nthis happened to be the ASO, and\nthe sheriff's deputy showed up, right.\n\n162\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.770\nSo great thing to have\nthese motion sensors, and\n\n163\n00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.238\nthey come in a couple of different types.\n\n164\n00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:14.612\nAll right.\n\n165\n00:09:14.612 --> 00:09:18.420\nNow I want you to understand that\nthey just call out motion sensors\n\n166\n00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.040\ngenerically for the exam, but I wanna\ngive you that there are quite a few\n\n167\n00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.740\ndifferent types that you\ncould potentially get.\n\n168\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.120\nCouple of the common ones that we see.\n\n169\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.890\nSome in residential, some in more of your\ncommercial buildings just because they're\n\n170\n00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.569\na little bit more to set up, all right.\n\n171\n00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:33.270\nAnd the first one is a little\nbit more expensive, right?\n\n172\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.922\nAnd this is what's known as microwave,\nall right, microwave motion sensing.\n\n173\n00:09:36.922 --> 00:09:40.280\nAll right, and essentially all it does is\nit sends out exactly what it sounds like,\n\n174\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.060\nmicrowaves, right, microwave emanations.\n\n175\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.960\nAnd it basically measures the reflection\nof those waves, you know,\n\n176\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.320\noff of any kind of moving object\nthat might be within the location.\n\n177\n00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.630\nThey can be costly.\n\n178\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.850\nAll right, and the other thing too is\nwith microwave, microwave in general is\n\n179\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.980\nit can be, it could be affected with\nelectrical interference, right.\n\n180\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.560\nAnd I want you to think of this, those of\nyou that have watched some of the episodes\n\n181\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.470\nwhen we talked about\nwireless communications and\n\n182\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:13.830\nwe've talked about the 2.4 gigahertz\nspectrum, the ISM band, right.\n\n183\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.760\nWell there's a problem with that band and\nthe fact microwaves can affect\n\n184\n00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.370\nthe transmission signals and\nbleed in electromagnetic interference or\n\n185\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.960\nmore in case this would be that\nradio frequency interference, right.\n\n186\n00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.450\nSo we have to worry about electricity,\n\n187\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.535\nelectrical interference can happen\nwith those, so that they're costly,\n\n188\n00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:31.985\nbut that is one thing that can\nimpede things like the signal.\n\n189\n00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:35.725\nAnd let's go ahead and look, in fact,\nwe'll go shopping like I always do.\n\n190\n00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:40.915\nLittle pick pocket I am, I took Zach's\ncredit card here and we're gonna buy some.\n\n191\n00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:41.460\n&gt;&gt; Again.\n\n192\n00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.659\nThat´s right, so we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna do micro, not Microsoft,\n\n193\n00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:49.160\nlet's do microwave sensors,\nthere we go got right up at the top here.\n\n194\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.800\nIt's almost like I've searched for\nthis before.\n\n195\n00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.950\nNow you can see the expense here and\nI want you to pay attention to the expense\n\n196\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.770\nversus the next one that we're gonna see,\ncuz you can see that the price is greatly\n\n197\n00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.920\nreduced which is why these are typically\ninside of a more of a commercial building\n\n198\n00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.580\nor government building versus the next\none up we are going to talk about right?\n\n199\n00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.350\nAnd you can see here is almost\nlike PTZ 360 degree camera,\n\n200\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.280\nyou can see a couple of other ones.\n\n201\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.775\nAnd some of these are just\nGeneric sensors for\n\n202\n00:11:13.775 --> 00:11:16.905\niot, but there's an example of\na couple of them right here.\n\n203\n00:11:16.905 --> 00:11:19.915\nAnd again, you can see uni-directional,\nbi-directional, and\n\n204\n00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:22.055\nagain microwave motion detection.\n\n205\n00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:23.115\nBut that isn't the only one.\n\n206\n00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:27.225\nThe other one that we have\nis what is known as pir or\n\n207\n00:11:27.225 --> 00:11:29.275\npassive infrared, all right?\n\n208\n00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:33.225\nAnd I tell you what, while we're here and\nwe've got our search engine up,\n\n209\n00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:33.765\nlets go ahead.\n\n210\n00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:38.430\nThese are pir sensors and\n\n211\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.800\nthat's something that we, actually let's\ngo ahead and put motion sensor in there,\n\n212\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.050\nbecause we're getting all kinds of, there\nwe go, you've probably seen these before.\n\n213\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.470\nI know that we've got a couple of them.\n\n214\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.990\nMaybe you see them outside of your garage\ndoor to trigger a light that turns\n\n215\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.140\nthe light on when it senses motion.\n\n216\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.110\nRight?\n\n217\n00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.620\nThat's a passive infrared motion sensor,\nright?\n\n218\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.680\nLook at the price-\n&gt;&gt; 8 bucks.\n\n219\n00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.660\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nAnd, again, you can see that, and\n\n220\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.355\nhere's another one, right?\n\n221\n00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:12.530\n$15, right?\nAnd that's why these, and, honestly,\n\n222\n00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.630\nthe one that detected that duck,\nit was a PIR sensor.\n\n223\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.890\nSo you can find these, because we can\nput a whole bunch of these throughout\n\n224\n00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.480\nthe entire building, and then we can\nconnect them all back to a central\n\n225\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.680\nnervous system or\na recording monitoring system.\n\n226\n00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.440\nSo they're good for if you have a lot\nof different areas that you've got to\n\n227\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:38.000\nmonitor, but\nagain you keep in mind the other one,\n\n228\n00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.830\nthe microwave one, it's going to\nbe a little bit more of a costly\n\n229\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.330\nimplementation, so\nthat's why you find it more in commercial.\n\n230\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:50.090\nNow because this not only being the most\ncommonly used home security type sensor,\n\n231\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:55.030\nkeep in mind that as the sensor warms up,\nessentially what it does is it detects\n\n232\n00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.230\nheat and movement in the surrounding\nareas of the sensor itself.\n\n233\n00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.000\nIt's a lot cheaper than the microwave.\n\n234\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.930\nNow, there are other ones out\nthere that I don't really have\n\n235\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.160\nwe're not gonna go shopping.\n\n236\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.230\nWe'll be easy on Zack's credit card.\n\n237\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.050\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; You're welcome, sir.\n\n238\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.660\nThere are some other ones that\nI want you to be aware of too.\n\n239\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.830\nThere's area reflective And this is kinda\ninteresting, cuz it still uses infrared.\n\n240\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.380\nBut they don't call it passive infrared.\n\n241\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:25.330\nIt uses LED's to mimic basically\ninfrared radiation, or infrared signals.\n\n242\n00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.140\nExcuse me.\nAnd\n\n243\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.950\nthen what it does is it measures\nthe distance of the object detected within\n\n244\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.900\nthat surrounding area.\n\n245\n00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.510\nThe other one that we have is ultrasonic,\nalright?\n\n246\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.670\nYou got any expecting mothers out\nthere that may be watching, or\n\n247\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.520\nmaybe an expecting father, or\nmaybe you have kids, absolutely.\n\n248\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.710\nGood pick up on that one,\nultrasonic ultrasound.\n\n249\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.910\nRight?\nUltrasonic waves.\n\n250\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.050\nultrasound waves, right?\n\n251\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.010\nTo detect the reflection of the waves of\nan object that moves within the sensor.\n\n252\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.470\nThen we have other ones too\nlike vibration sensors.\n\n253\n00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.440\nAll right vibration motion censors right,\nand this could be just simply maybe a tile\n\n254\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.155\nwithin the floor that you just happen to\nwalk on and when you do you've got a mass\n\n255\n00:14:02.155 --> 00:14:07.155\nthat;s hooked to a lever that when that\nmass moves it triggers an alert and again.\n\n256\n00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:11.235\nAlerts that can, you know,\nan alarm system a control panel, right?\n\n257\n00:14:11.235 --> 00:14:14.295\nBasically activating an alarm, right?\n\n258\n00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.895\nSo these are very basic,\nyou probably heard of this before and\n\n259\n00:14:17.895 --> 00:14:20.217\nyou know if you have it,\nat least you have it now.\n\n260\n00:14:20.217 --> 00:14:25.037\nOn the exam, know why we would\nuse motion sensors, right.\n\n261\n00:14:25.037 --> 00:14:28.397\nI don't know how technical\nthey're gonna be but\n\n262\n00:14:28.397 --> 00:14:34.137\ndo be aware of the different types,\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n263\n00:14:34.137 --> 00:14:37.567\nNow, that's one of the detection methods\nthat we have for physical security.\n\n264\n00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:41.097\nIf we have motion sensors,\nthen we have one of the most common ones.\n\n265\n00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:43.670\nAnd that's video surveillance, right.\n\n266\n00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.740\nVideo surveillance is great.\n\n267\n00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.980\nIt can be an effective deterrent.\n\n268\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.830\nIt's not always a deterrent.\n\n269\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:55.910\nThat's why we get awesome videos like\nthe World's Dumbest Criminals, you know.\n\n270\n00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.070\nThe guy that basically tries to go through\nthe roof into a liquor store that's got\n\n271\n00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:05.280\nboarded up or metal doors, locking doors,\nfall through Three shelves\n\n272\n00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.340\nof glass liquor bottles, knocks himself\nout and conveniently has to be let out\n\n273\n00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.500\nthe next day by law enforcement and\ngets two nice, shiny double bracelets.\n\n274\n00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.650\nThe one great\n\n275\n00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.390\nthing about video surveillance\nis even if it isn't a deterrent.\n\n276\n00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.640\nIt allows with coupled with\nthings like guards and staff.\n\n277\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.680\nIf you have guards that are present,\nit allows them to react in real time.\n\n278\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.530\nJust like an alarm.\n\n279\n00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.320\nAnd alarm could be triggered.\n\n280\n00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.410\nI'm sure you probably heard\nthis because we're so\n\n281\n00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.680\nused to hearing alarms that we\nkind of desensitize ourselves.\n\n282\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.870\nSo that's why when a car alarm goes off,\n\n283\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.389\nI don't know how effective\nthey are any more.\n\n284\n00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:48.055\nRight because you hear them all the time,\nbut\n\n285\n00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:53.037\nyou couple all these video surveillance, I\nsee video cameras all the time they might\n\n286\n00:15:53.037 --> 00:15:57.528\nnot be an affective when you couple\nthose with the presence of a guard\n\n287\n00:15:57.528 --> 00:16:01.774\nyou at least get real time monitoring And\nyou get real-time reaction.\n\n288\n00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:05.881\nThe other cool thing about video\nsurveillance is that it allows you not\n\n289\n00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.082\nonly on-premise monitoring,\non-prem as they say,\n\n290\n00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:13.270\non-premises monitoring you also\nget things like remote monitoring.\n\n291\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:18.860\nAnd it's even better when you talk about\ndigital, digital video surveillance.\n\n292\n00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.030\nWe talk about digital video surveillance.\n\n293\n00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.426\nIt allows us to capture and store more\nvideo over the earlier analog ones.\n\n294\n00:16:25.426 --> 00:16:27.010\nAnd we can get a better quality.\n\n295\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.890\nBut there's other things too about video\nsurveillance that maybe you haven't\n\n296\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:30.550\nthought about.\n\n297\n00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.521\nNow this might not be directly\nrelated to physical security.\n\n298\n00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:40.837\nBut I will tell you it can give, well I\nguess it can, a safer employee workplace.\n\n299\n00:16:40.837 --> 00:16:42.260\nI mean that's security of your employees.\n\n300\n00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.880\nSafety of your employees, right?\n\n301\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.060\nYou got cameras in place,\nmore productivity.\n\n302\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.770\nHow many of you work a little bit faster,\nor\n\n303\n00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.130\na little bit harder when the boss\nis standing over your shoulder?\n\n304\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.938\nWell, if you got an eye in the sky and\nthat eye in the sky is always being\n\n305\n00:16:53.938 --> 00:16:56.571\nchecked, essentially,\nyou have the boss over your shoulder.\n\n306\n00:16:56.571 --> 00:17:01.187\nSo, there are studies out there that\nhave been done that do kind of lead to\n\n307\n00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:05.955\nthe conclusion that video surveillance\nbeing present does boost maybe not\n\n308\n00:17:05.955 --> 00:17:09.987\nthe morale but definitely\nthe productivity of the employees.\n\n309\n00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:14.663\nThe other cool thing about this as well\nis when we have video surveillance,\n\n310\n00:17:14.663 --> 00:17:19.268\nwe can do video surveillance screening\nof the visitors that are coming and\n\n311\n00:17:19.268 --> 00:17:21.140\nleaving a location, right?\n\n312\n00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.560\nIt could be a public area.\n\n313\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.410\nIt could be a video that\nis actually in front of\n\n314\n00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.900\nsome kind of restricted area as well.\n\n315\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.110\n&gt;&gt; And with time codes,\nwe know exactly when it happened.\n\n316\n00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.440\n&gt;&gt; That's right, absolutely.\n\n317\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.787\nAnd you couple that.\n\n318\n00:17:31.787 --> 00:17:34.530\nAnd that's the other reason things like\ndigital is good because it's easy to do\n\n319\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.200\ntime stamping.\n\n320\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.270\nSo, again, the other thing about digital,\n\n321\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.310\nremember, we said that\nbetter video quality?\n\n322\n00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.830\nOne of the things that you can get\nis like high definition video.\n\n323\n00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.420\nAnd that's good when you have\nto scrutinize the video, right?\n\n324\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.960\nWhen we talk about data forensics,\nwe talk about data forensics one of\n\n325\n00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.110\nthe methods of data forensics\nis video surveillance.\n\n326\n00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.360\nAnd when we say video surveillance\nif somebody has broke into a certain\n\n327\n00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.160\narea we can scrutinize\nthe video after the fact and\n\n328\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.110\nscrutinizing the video well,\nyou said you didn't do it.\n\n329\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.170\nThe camera doesn't lie.\n\n330\n00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.003\nThe camera's seeing that you did it,\nright?\n\n331\n00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:12.497\nSo if we got high definition, good\nquality video, and it doesn't look like\n\n332\n00:18:12.497 --> 00:18:17.204\na 1970s video of Bigfoot doing a trot\nthrough the woods looking backwards,\n\n333\n00:18:17.204 --> 00:18:20.958\nwe can tell that was just Wes\nwithout a shave for a couple weeks.\n\n334\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.947\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The other cool thing about this too is\n\n335\n00:18:23.947 --> 00:18:28.270\nyou have the potential for wider viewing\nangles with digital video surveillance.\n\n336\n00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.710\nAnd the remote monitoring\n\n337\n00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.010\nis fairly simplistic because all\nyou need is an Internet connection.\n\n338\n00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.270\nWe can put IP based cameras on there and\nconnect over an IP based network so\n\n339\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.690\nthe installation gets a little easier,\ntoo.\n\n340\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.660\nBecause you don't have to\nrun things like extra power.\n\n341\n00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.080\nYou can slap on your network a POE,\na Power Over Ethernet injector.\n\n342\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.410\nAnd I don't have to make sure\nthat I have AC adapters for\n\n343\n00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.170\nevery camera within every location.\n\n344\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.425\nAll I gotta do is run power\nover an Ethernet cable.\n\n345\n00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:56.126\nAnd not only do I get the power, but\n\n346\n00:18:56.126 --> 00:18:59.210\nI also get the remote\nmonitoring capabilities too.\n\n347\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:00.950\nLess cabling, easier installation.\n\n348\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.496\nAnalog is also a viable solution.\n\n349\n00:19:04.496 --> 00:19:11.221\nBut it's a little more costly equipment,\na greater setup, if you will.\n\n350\n00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:16.588\nDoes have some of the downfalls but\nso digital really is the way to go.\n\n351\n00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.950\nThe next thing that we have\nwhen it comes to detection?\n\n352\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.011\nAsset tagging.\n\n353\n00:19:20.011 --> 00:19:24.494\nAll right, when we say tagging we're\nactually talking a way, a good way to\n\n354\n00:19:24.494 --> 00:19:29.638\ntrack the high dollar or high value assets\nthat you have within your company, right?\n\n355\n00:19:29.638 --> 00:19:34.359\nWe can use this, if you will,\nto track things like physical assets and\n\n356\n00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.840\nmovable assets.\n\n357\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.691\nSo for instance,\n\n358\n00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:40.568\nif you have projectors that maybe you\nhave a building that gives presentations.\n\n359\n00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:43.622\nAnd in your company you've got maybe\nmultiple conference areas where you're\n\n360\n00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:46.771\ngiving presentations and you've got\nmovable projectors for whatever reason,\n\n361\n00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:49.149\nwouldn't it be nice to know where\nthey are at any given time?\n\n362\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.220\nRight, things like your laptops.\n\n363\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.740\nAnd if it's fixed, it could be servers,\nit could be workstations as well, right?\n\n364\n00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.780\nSo it's not just things like that, right?\n\n365\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.620\nCould be machinery,\ncould be tools, all right?\n\n366\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.190\nI know that our director team that\nyou can't see that does all the magic\n\n367\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:09.080\nbehind the scenes, they're\nconstantly out over the road, right?\n\n368\n00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.590\nThey've got cases of their equipment,\nright?\n\n369\n00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.110\nAnd we monitor and\ntrack that stuff, right?\n\n370\n00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:19.350\nYou put an asset tag on that and you\ncan find out who's got it, where is it.\n\n371\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.910\nAnd here's another thing,\nwhat's its maintenance schedule?\n\n372\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.280\nWhen's the last time it was serviced?\n\n373\n00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.440\nIs it scheduled for maintenance?\n\n374\n00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.900\nDo we need to schedule for maintenance?\n\n375\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.460\nWe've got five pieces of video equipment.\n\n376\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.670\nOne of them needs a repair.\n\n377\n00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.097\nWell, wouldn't it be nice just to have\nthat tag and you have that, again,\n\n378\n00:20:36.097 --> 00:20:38.984\nthat centralized location that you\ncan see all of these things and\n\n379\n00:20:38.984 --> 00:20:41.040\nit becomes visual for you, right?\n\n380\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:46.940\nAnd you can acquiesce that data at any\npoint and know what's going on with it,\n\n381\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.720\nbasically allowing your company,\nif you will, to just easily gather data\n\n382\n00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.360\nabout these assets, and quickly\npinpoint things like their locations.\n\n383\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.716\nAll right, not only monitoring\nthings like the physical location.\n\n384\n00:20:57.716 --> 00:21:00.086\nWe can automate the inventory\nside of things,\n\n385\n00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:03.917\nstreamline our maintenance schedules,\nas well as preventing the loss and\n\n386\n00:21:03.917 --> 00:21:07.600\nregulate management and\ncompliance of these devices as well.\n\n387\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.060\nWhy do we manage compliance,\nyou might say.\n\n388\n00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.710\nWell, if I've got a server that's storing\nthings like personally identifiable\n\n389\n00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:19.890\ninformation or payment card industry, PCI,\ndata security standard based information,\n\n390\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.640\nHIPAA compliance, I might have to\nknow what's the state of that server.\n\n391\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.280\nWhat's the state of the storage device?\n\n392\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.690\nWhere's the hard drive.\n\n393\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.670\nSo, again, this a good way to track.\n\n394\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.231\nAll right, so Zach, one of the last\nthings we have as far as tamper,\n\n395\n00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:35.419\nor as far as prevention goes is,\ndetection.\n\n396\n00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.678\nI'll get it right eventually, detection.\n\n397\n00:21:36.678 --> 00:21:38.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Three strikes you're out [LAUGH].\n\n398\n00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:41.295\nAs far as detection goes is\nwhat's known as tamper detection.\n\n399\n00:21:41.295 --> 00:21:45.720\nNow you've probably seen this before,\ntamper detection.\n\n400\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.800\nNow, tamper detection,\n\n401\n00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.360\none of the examples I have is like\nif you've ever opened up a computer.\n\n402\n00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.760\nAnd you've got a warranty on it, right?\n\n403\n00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.680\nMaybe you've got a really good warranty on\nit but you got this little sticker that's\n\n404\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.400\nacross this one piece that says if this\nseal's broken, you void your warranty.\n\n405\n00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.700\nWell, that's tamper detection, all right?\n\n406\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.975\nYou return that computer and\nsay, it's broke.\n\n407\n00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:07.595\nSo, well, did you fix it?\n\n408\n00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:09.625\nNo.\nWell, yes you did according to what\n\n409\n00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:11.435\nthat sticker looks like it's broke.\n\n410\n00:22:11.435 --> 00:22:14.495\nIt looks like you removed it cuz\nonly we're supposed to remove it.\n\n411\n00:22:14.495 --> 00:22:16.945\nWhen we do, we remove the sticker and\nwe replace it with a new one.\n\n412\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.300\nNow, Zach, you have a good example\nof tampered detection, right?\n\n413\n00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.768\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like the security tapes\non a gas pump for instance.\n\n414\n00:22:23.768 --> 00:22:25.460\n&gt;&gt; That is a great example.\n\n415\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.462\nAnd I didn't even think about that one.\n\n416\n00:22:27.462 --> 00:22:29.824\nAnd that's one we see almost\non a daily basis, well,\n\n417\n00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:33.182\ndepending on how fast you drive, and\nhow much gas I guess your car takes, but\n\n418\n00:22:33.182 --> 00:22:34.940\ndefinitely on a weekly basis, right?\n\n419\n00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.954\n&gt;&gt; We got to fill up every week.\n\n420\n00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:39.630\nAnd how many times you been to the pump\nand you got that little sticker or\n\n421\n00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.747\nstamp that's across it that's\nletting you know that hey,\n\n422\n00:22:42.747 --> 00:22:45.489\nthis was serviced by somebody\ninside the building,\n\n423\n00:22:45.489 --> 00:22:50.595\nrather than the hacker that's in the\ncreeper van, stealing your information.\n\n424\n00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:51.715\nGreat example right?\n\n425\n00:22:53.645 --> 00:22:54.426\nThere's other ones.\n\n426\n00:22:54.426 --> 00:22:58.521\nBut what it boils down to is it gives\nyou the ability of a company or business\n\n427\n00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:02.749\nbasically through sensors to detect\na compromise of any device, a system or\n\n428\n00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:07.523\nlike we're talking about hard drives the\ndata associated with the specific device.\n\n429\n00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:08.712\n&gt;&gt; And I've got another crazy one too.\n\n430\n00:23:08.712 --> 00:23:13.384\nBack in the day the emperor's seal, the\nwax seal with the stamp on the envelope,\n\n431\n00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:15.204\nI mean that's-\n&gt;&gt; That's where we get-\n\n432\n00:23:15.204 --> 00:23:16.252\n&gt;&gt; Early tamper detection.\n\n433\n00:23:16.252 --> 00:23:18.420\n&gt;&gt; That's where we get\nthe seal of approval, right?\n\n434\n00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.300\nIt's the seal of approval from the king.\n\n435\n00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.153\nYou better believe it,\nit's another good one.\n\n436\n00:23:22.153 --> 00:23:24.280\nAnd again, wow, that's awesome, man.\n\n437\n00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.444\nThere's other cool things too.\n\n438\n00:23:25.444 --> 00:23:28.016\nLike for\ninstance in certain electronic systems,\n\n439\n00:23:28.016 --> 00:23:30.946\nelectrical systems,\nthey put certain sensors in there,\n\n440\n00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:34.020\ncertain pins that detect\nan electrical variation, right?\n\n441\n00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.590\nAnd if that variation,\nif it's not constant or\n\n442\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:42.640\nthey see the variation they know that\nsomebody's messing with that device.\n\n443\n00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.155\nOr, if you're talking about networks,\nyou have a fiber optic run and\n\n444\n00:23:46.155 --> 00:23:49.850\nwe talk about in our fiber shows we\ntalk about how they're wavelengths and\n\n445\n00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.835\nthere's a wave pattern, a waveform.\n\n446\n00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:56.315\nWell, you can put a cable in there that\nhooks to an alert system that monitors\n\n447\n00:23:56.315 --> 00:23:57.368\nthe wavelength.\n\n448\n00:23:57.368 --> 00:23:59.612\nAnd if it sees a variation\nin the wavelength,\n\n449\n00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:03.511\nthe passive cable that's on the outside\nsends an alert, triggers a monitor,\n\n450\n00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:06.780\ntriggers an alert to a monitoring\nsystem and lets you know, hey.\n\n451\n00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.879\nSomething's going on with\nyour fiber optic cable.\n\n452\n00:24:09.879 --> 00:24:14.365\nBecause fiber optic cables,\nit's not so easy to splice-and-dice.\n\n453\n00:24:14.365 --> 00:24:15.718\nYou need a lot of equipment.\n\n454\n00:24:15.718 --> 00:24:17.990\nYou need some expensive\nequipment to get in there.\n\n455\n00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.710\nAnd if that waveform varies at all,\nthere's detecting,\n\n456\n00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:26.420\nit allows you to detect\nsome tampering might go on.\n\n457\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.910\nAll right, basically,\ndisruption of the wave form.\n\n458\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.277\nThere's other things too, tamper\ndetection where they have, for instance,\n\n459\n00:24:32.277 --> 00:24:34.120\non the end of F connectors.\n\n460\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.909\nWhere they can put a little lock and\na latch and\n\n461\n00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:39.712\nthey can tell if it's been unplugged or\nnot.\n\n462\n00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:43.310\nOther then the obvious sign of it,\ndangling, right?\n\n463\n00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.243\n&gt;&gt; The dangling.\n\n464\n00:24:44.243 --> 00:24:49.150\n&gt;&gt; Again so, those are some of\nthe ones that we have for detection.\n\n465\n00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.430\nNow, we've got a handful of them that\nare also for prevention too, right?\n\n466\n00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.567\nAnd this isn't a completely exhaustive\nobjective list either because there\n\n467\n00:24:56.567 --> 00:24:57.402\nare many more.\n\n468\n00:24:57.402 --> 00:25:00.860\nBut here at NetPlus, they want you to\nunderstand some of the basics, right?\n\n469\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.480\nWe talked about badges.\n\n470\n00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.220\nAll right, boy I can tell you,\nZach, we talked-\n\n471\n00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.490\n&gt;&gt; We don't need no stinking badges!\n\n472\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:06.722\n&gt;&gt; I was going to say,\nhe beat me to the punch.\n\n473\n00:25:06.722 --> 00:25:09.450\nI'm thinking man,\nI can think of a movie line on that one.\n\n474\n00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.759\nBut badges are a good thing.\n\n475\n00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:14.518\nAnd in some of the technologies\nthat we're gonna talk about,\n\n476\n00:25:14.518 --> 00:25:16.940\nsome of them are fairly expensive.\n\n477\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.550\nAnd when they're fairly expensive,\n\n478\n00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.280\nthat means small businesses might not\nbe able to benefit from them, right?\n\n479\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.350\nSo you want something that hey, even small\nbusinesses can benefit from as well.\n\n480\n00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.610\nSo badges are a great thing.\n\n481\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:36.340\nBadges are a way that we could easily\nidentify employees, guests if you will.\n\n482\n00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.350\nVisitors to any business or\nfacility, it's great to have.\n\n483\n00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.370\nSmall businesses get the benefit because,\na simple ID badge, right?\n\n484\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.270\nIt doesn't take a lot to make.\n\n485\n00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.620\nIn fact I've got one, all right?\n\n486\n00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.033\nI use this one on a daily basis,\nall right?\n\n487\n00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:54.090\nAnd not everybody wears ID badges.\n\n488\n00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:58.400\nI know I do, and I think our chief\nfinancial officer, she does as well.\n\n489\n00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.510\nShe wears her badge all the time,\nall right?\n\n490\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:06.060\nAnd again, it gives, if you couple this\nwith things like entry access rosters\n\n491\n00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.640\nyou get a greater\naccountability with the badge.\n\n492\n00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.306\nAnd the badges can get sophisticated.\n\n493\n00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:13.861\nYou put a photo identifier on it right\nnow and it identifies a face with a name,\n\n494\n00:26:13.861 --> 00:26:15.180\na name with a face.\n\n495\n00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.457\nBut it's also cool with the badges too.\n\n496\n00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:20.487\nBecause one of the reasons I started\nwearing this is after our grand opening,\n\n497\n00:26:20.487 --> 00:26:24.331\nthe night of our grand opening there\nwere hundreds of people here that I had\n\n498\n00:26:24.331 --> 00:26:25.520\nno clue who they were.\n\n499\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.040\nWe love to have, and by the way it\ndoesn't have to be grand opening.\n\n500\n00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.280\nWe love having people over here.\n\n501\n00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.976\nWe're in the Gainesville area.\n\n502\n00:26:30.976 --> 00:26:34.380\nVisit us, but what I didn't want is\n\n503\n00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.990\nI don't want people that visit\nITProTV here not to know who I am.\n\n504\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.520\nNow if you're a viewer you know.\n\n505\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.000\nWell, I hope you know, right?\n\n506\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.850\nBut if you're somebody that's just coming\ninto the building to maybe do business\n\n507\n00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.660\nwith ITProTV or just coming and\nstopping by the facilities,\n\n508\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.080\nhow about the customer-employee\nrelationship, right?\n\n509\n00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.670\nWow, okay, that's Wes Bryan.\n\n510\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.410\nWell, I could tell because\nI got the badge, right?\n\n511\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.690\nI've got the badge on me.\n\n512\n00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.190\nAgain, it basically puts\nyour face to names.\n\n513\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.523\nNow, you can couple that as well,\nwith what I've got on the backside of this\n\n514\n00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:09.038\nbadge, boy,\nthis is a high tech badge here, right?\n\n515\n00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:10.283\nIt's kinda like Mini-Wheats.\n\n516\n00:27:10.283 --> 00:27:13.510\nOn one side, [LAUGH] and\nthen on other sides the frosted coating.\n\n517\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.850\nBut, on this side,\n&gt;&gt; That's my favorite side.\n\n518\n00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.850\n&gt;&gt; There we go [LAUGH].\n\n519\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.690\nOn this side we have what's\nknow as RFID card, right?\n\n520\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.490\nOr you can have smart card.\n\n521\n00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.450\nThis just happens to be an RFID card.\n\n522\n00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.120\nYou could have a smart card type thing\nwhere it actually has a little chip\n\n523\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.070\non it, right?\n\n524\n00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.120\nLike our military brothers and\nsisters out there, or our vets out there.\n\n525\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.410\nProbably you had and know more so\nthan I would ever would.\n\n526\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.102\nA common access card,\nyour CAC card, right?\n\n527\n00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:38.790\nYour CAC card has all of\nyour military information.\n\n528\n00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.250\nThat little chip that's on it.\n\n529\n00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:45.487\nSo these cards are good,\nespecially an RFID card, if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:45.487 --> 00:27:46.829\nZach, we both have one here.\n\n531\n00:27:46.829 --> 00:27:50.198\nAnd what we do is we touch it to\na security sensor on any one of the entry\n\n532\n00:27:50.198 --> 00:27:51.690\npoints within the building.\n\n533\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.630\nAnd it either allows us access or\nit denies us access.\n\n534\n00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.480\nPrevention, it allows us\naccess if we're authorized.\n\n535\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.726\nIt prevents access if we're not\nsupposed to be there, right?\n\n536\n00:28:00.726 --> 00:28:06.030\nThe other thing coupled along with\nthat I would say too, are key fobs.\n\n537\n00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.930\nNow, I don't have any key fobs.\n\n538\n00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.070\nBut the last company that I worked for\nwhen I was teaching, we had key fobs.\n\n539\n00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.590\nAnd again the concept is\nexactly the same as the card.\n\n540\n00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.800\nIt's just a little plastic circle, right?\n\n541\n00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.570\nAnd you do the same thing.\n\n542\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.770\nYou just touch it to\nan authenticating door.\n\n543\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.150\nSends a little bit of information\nup to a security control system.\n\n544\n00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.940\nAnd it says, hey, who is this?\n\n545\n00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.400\nIs this key fob activated and\nwhat kind of access do they have?\n\n546\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.960\nAnd the door either opens or\nit prevents people from going in, right?\n\n547\n00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.220\nYour door is one of your\nfirst lines of defense.\n\n548\n00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.180\nAnd I gotta be careful.\n\n549\n00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.252\nThat's why I went ahead and prefaced this\nwith defense indepth because policies and\n\n550\n00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.044\nawareness are technically.\n\n551\n00:28:42.044 --> 00:28:44.935\nThe other thing is to get a lock.\n\n552\n00:28:44.935 --> 00:28:47.915\nAnd in fact we couple this with locks too.\n\n553\n00:28:47.915 --> 00:28:51.805\nNow we've got, and that's why I said,\nsome of these they shake hands with here.\n\n554\n00:28:51.805 --> 00:28:54.185\nWe're doing multiple\nprevention techniques.\n\n555\n00:28:54.185 --> 00:28:55.575\nWe've got badge.\n\n556\n00:28:55.575 --> 00:28:58.352\nWe've got RFID key fob.\n\n557\n00:28:58.352 --> 00:29:04.547\nAnd then we also got the doors that have\nthe locks on them that these trigger.\n\n558\n00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:08.498\nBut don't put it outside of just\nthe old traditional key and\n\n559\n00:29:08.498 --> 00:29:12.222\nlock, lock and key, or\npinlock entries with a little.\n\n560\n00:29:12.222 --> 00:29:15.165\nI worked for a restaurant that if you\nwanted to get into the employee area,\n\n561\n00:29:15.165 --> 00:29:16.317\nit had a little pin pad on it.\n\n562\n00:29:16.317 --> 00:29:19.670\nYou just dial the four digits and\nyou open the door.\n\n563\n00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.200\nYou make your way in.\n\n564\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.820\nBut if you really want to get fancy,\nthat's when you go with biometrics.\n\n565\n00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.740\nNow biometrics is also\na prevention method.\n\n566\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.670\nBut this works on\nthe authentication factors,\n\n567\n00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.530\nthat we also talk about\nin another episode.\n\n568\n00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:37.421\nBut lets go ahead, review just those\nthree authentication factors, right?\n\n569\n00:29:37.421 --> 00:29:40.798\nThe most common three authentication\nfactors are something you know,\n\n570\n00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:43.450\nsomething you have and something you are.\n\n571\n00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.920\nSomething you know is the username and\npassword, a pin, security question, right?\n\n572\n00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.840\nSomething you have is kinda like the card\nthat I have, right, or a key fob.\n\n573\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.710\nSomething you are is some physical or\nsociological characteristic of yourself,\n\n574\n00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.197\na fingerprint, voice recognition,\nretinal pattern, hand geometry.\n\n575\n00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.900\nThat's something that's unique to me,\nright?\n\n576\n00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.520\nWell, if you use that as\nyour form of authentication,\n\n577\n00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.720\nthat's where you get biometrics, right?\n\n578\n00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.970\nThat's biometrics,\nis that something you are.\n\n579\n00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.340\nAnd this, if you would have been asking\nme when I started teaching about a decade\n\n580\n00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.020\nago, I would have said man,\nthis is mission impossible stuff.\n\n581\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.398\nThis is expensive as all get out.\n\n582\n00:30:21.398 --> 00:30:23.633\nAnd well, it can still be.\n\n583\n00:30:23.633 --> 00:30:27.298\nBut they got these integrated into our\nsmartphones now and basic devices.\n\n584\n00:30:27.298 --> 00:30:32.835\nAn all out biometric security system\ncan get very expensive, right?\n\n585\n00:30:32.835 --> 00:30:36.507\nAnd that's why you're typically only\ngonna see this in highly secure areas or\n\n586\n00:30:36.507 --> 00:30:39.731\nthe companies that when they say there\nis a problem we just throw money\n\n587\n00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:40.479\nat it, right?\n\n588\n00:30:40.479 --> 00:30:43.290\nIf you just throw money at it\nthen you're just fine, right?\n\n589\n00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:48.022\nSo biometrics, again using some\nkind of physical characteristic of\n\n590\n00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:51.693\nyourself to prevent access\nto some kind of restricted\n\n591\n00:30:51.693 --> 00:30:55.217\narea that only authorized\npersonnel should be in.\n\n592\n00:30:55.217 --> 00:30:58.766\nSo these are a handful of the devices\nthat you should be aware of,\n\n593\n00:30:58.766 --> 00:31:00.620\nthe physical security devices.\n\n594\n00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:04.690\nUnderstand that this is\nthe second line of defense.\n\n595\n00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:07.090\nMake sure I get that right\nin the defense indepth.\n\n596\n00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.940\nKeep in mind that they break\ndown into a couple of concepts.\n\n597\n00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.220\nDetection, prevention, right?\n\n598\n00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.270\nNow I don't know which side\nof the tracks you're on.\n\n599\n00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.610\nYou could say well,\nshouldn't we prevent before we detect, or\n\n600\n00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.890\ndetect before we prevent.\n\n601\n00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.690\nThere's no right way or wrong way, right?\n\n602\n00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:25.010\nThere's never one way fits all,\none size fits all for security.\n\n603\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.006\nRemember when it comes to security, it's\nreally never a destination to be reached.\n\n604\n00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:31.141\nIt's only a journey to be traveled upon.\n\n605\n00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:32.320\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Wes.\n\n606\n00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.910\nThere's levels of security\nwe all need to be aware of.\n\n607\n00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.807\nSo, physical security devices\nis the name of this episode.\n\n608\n00:31:37.807 --> 00:31:38.910\nHopefully you enjoyed that.\n\n609\n00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.960\nI'm sure you did.\n\n610\n00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.152\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of the CompTIA Net+ series\n\n611\n00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:45.880\nthat Wes has put together for\nyou, it will help you.\n\n612\n00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.350\nAnd while you're in the course library,\n\n613\n00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.380\nthere's hundreds of other videos all\ndesigned to help you go further.\n\n614\n00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.890\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n615\n00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.440\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n616\n00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.930\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n617\n00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.780\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n618\n00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:05.041\n&gt;&gt; And

you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.970\nI'm your host, Zach Memos, as we continue\non with CompTIA Net+ Authentication and\n\n7\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.520\nAccess Control, the name of this episode.\n\n8\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.089\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to help us out,\nshow us the way.\n\n9\n00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.420\nWes, great to have you here, thanks.\n\n10\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.820\n&gt;&gt; Hey Zach, thanks for having me back.\n\n11\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.790\nThat's right, we're gonna be looking at,\nwell Zach's already told you, right.\n\n12\n00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.710\nWe're gonna be looking at\nauthentication and access control, and\n\n13\n00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.920\nsome of the components\nthat you find within it.\n\n14\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.251\nAnd we're definitely gonna be hitting\nyou with some more acronyms and\n\n15\n00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.745\nsome specifications\nstandardization if you will.\n\n16\n00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:44.545\nAnd you're gonna need to know this for\n\n17\n00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.470\nthe Net+ exam when it comes to sitting\nthe hot seat, that's right, in the exam.\n\n18\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.804\nSo let's go ahead and let's dive\nright into some of those topics.\n\n19\n00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:54.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Now go under the exam objectives here,\n\n20\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.120\nthey talk about three concepts,\nright and they mention authorization,\n\n21\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.480\nauthentication, and accounting.\n\n22\n00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.770\nI'm gonna kinda move this around a little\nbit here and describe what those are and\n\n23\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.770\nthen talk about some of the technologies\nthat we have to perform\n\n24\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.626\nthose three things.\n\n25\n00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:12.040\nSo, let's go ahead, and instead of\ntalking about authorization first,\n\n26\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.470\nlet's talk about authentication,\nall right?\n\n27\n00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.670\nBecause with those three concepts,\nyou might hear a AAA, right?\n\n28\n00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060\nYou might hear and\nI'm not talking about insurance, right?\n\n29\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.963\nWe're talking about AAAs and\nauthentication, authorization, and\n\n30\n00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:25.690\nthen accounting, all right?\n\n31\n00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.350\nSometimes accounting you might even hear\nit called auditing as well too, right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.350\nSo what is authentication?\n\n33\n00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.110\nWell, authentication is proving\nyou are who you say you are.\n\n34\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.550\nWho are you, all right?\n\n35\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.510\nAnd then we have well, authorization and\nauthorization is about what can you do,\n\n36\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.425\nand then accounting is about\ntracking those activities.\n\n37\n00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:48.048\nAnd if you want a really\nbasic way to understand it,\n\n38\n00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:49.885\nI wish I could take credit for this.\n\n39\n00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:54.623\nBut some another instructor that I was\nsitting there watching one of the things\n\n40\n00:01:54.623 --> 00:01:59.072\nthat they were doing said, it really\nboils down to these three concepts,\n\n41\n00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:03.060\nwho are you, what can you do,\nand then, what did you do?\n\n42\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.360\nIf you look at right, authentication.\n\n43\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.150\nWho are you, right?\n\n44\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.300\nZach, I know it's Zach.\n\n45\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.730\nWell, how do I know it's Zach?\n\n46\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.964\nWell, on the onboarding process,\nhe provided his identification, right?\n\n47\n00:02:13.964 --> 00:02:16.298\nOnce he had his identification proven and\n\n48\n00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:20.150\nthen came on the onboarding\nprocess he was given a keycard.\n\n49\n00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.050\nThat keycard is the way he authenticates,\nhe touches it to the door.\n\n50\n00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.780\nWe've got one, I've got one in my\nback pocket right here, right,\n\n51\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.690\nwe prove we are who we say we are.\n\n52\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.230\nThen, we have to determine what\nlevel of access do you have?\n\n53\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.190\nWhat can you do?\n\n54\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.770\nThat's the authorization part.\n\n55\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.443\nI can't authorize you to do something or\n\n56\n00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:42.147\neven not do something until\nwe've authenticated you.\n\n57\n00:02:42.147 --> 00:02:45.236\nAnd then once that's done, once we've\ndetermined, well, Zach, you know what,\n\n58\n00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:47.990\nyou've got these seven, and\nI'm just throwing these numbers out there.\n\n59\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.400\nYou've got these seven doors that\nyou're allowed to enter and access.\n\n60\n00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.810\nWe've got some other tenants that\nare within this building, and\n\n61\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.740\nhere at ITProTV and those doors are for\nthose businesses, right?\n\n62\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.822\nAnd if Zach touches his keycard to those\ndoors, it's gonna get an access denied,\n\n63\n00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:05.400\nright, because he's not authorized.\n\n64\n00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.893\nThat's not part of what\nhe's allowed to do.\n\n65\n00:03:07.893 --> 00:03:09.490\nAnd same thing with me,\nI mean I'm not picking.\n\n66\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.710\nThank you for\nletting me pick on you, Zach.\n\n67\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.706\nBut same thing for me as well, right.\n\n68\n00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:18.939\nAnd then finally, we need a mechanism\nthat says, well Zach, what did you do?\n\n69\n00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.410\nWhen you were in the building,\nif I needed to check out,\n\n70\n00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.480\nwhat doors did you go through?\n\n71\n00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.140\nWell, I need a way to track that.\n\n72\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.030\nAnd that's accounting or\nauditing, if you will.\n\n73\n00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.290\nIt's tracking system-wide\nevents that happen, all right?\n\n74\n00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.880\nSo, who are you, what can you do,\nand then what did you do?\n\n75\n00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.080\nAnd you have to understand too,\nthat identification and\n\n76\n00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520\nauthentication are a little bit different.\n\n77\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.690\nA lot of people say, well, identification.\n\n78\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.239\nNow notice I said,\nit didn't tell me the keycard, right.\n\n79\n00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.810\nIt doesn't tell me Zach\nis who he says he is,\n\n80\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.610\nit just means that he's got a keycard,\nright.\n\n81\n00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.610\nAuthentication is actually\npreceded by identification, right.\n\n82\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.400\nThat ensures that the person who they say\nthey are is truly who they say they are,\n\n83\n00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.060\nthat's identification and\n\n84\n00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.840\nthat's usually the predecessor\nto being authenticated, right.\n\n85\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.997\nI have to prove that I'm supposed\nto be on this network, right?\n\n86\n00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:11.430\nAnd one of the ways I do that is\npart of the onboarding process.\n\n87\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.635\nI fill out my application for employment,\nI provide my Social Security card and\n\n88\n00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:20.612\nI provide my drivers license,\nstate issued id, all right.\n\n89\n00:04:20.612 --> 00:04:24.490\nAnd then once that's done, now I get\na keycard and I can authenticate.\n\n90\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.990\nRight, identification is about proving\nthat a person that has credentials\n\n91\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.870\nis the person that should\nown those credentials.\n\n92\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.870\nAnd then once that's done,\nI can now be authorized.\n\n93\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.710\nNow, the other thing too\nis an unauthorized person,\n\n94\n00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.560\nthey need to try to authenticate as well.\n\n95\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.560\nAnd let me tell you why then,\ncuz authorization is after authentication,\n\n96\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.800\nand let me give you an example.\n\n97\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.002\nLet's say Zach, okay, you're gonna\ngo into the conference room, right.\n\n98\n00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:52.479\nYour authentication is you touch\nthe key fob to the door or\n\n99\n00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.510\nthe card to the door and\nit opens, all right.\n\n100\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.900\nSo that says, hey, we know it's Zach,\nwe know that he's authorized, right,\n\n101\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.860\nallowed to be in there.\n\n102\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.370\nAnd then we also have a system\nthat's tracking that fact that he\n\n103\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.090\ndid enter that room.\n\n104\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.710\nBut you're allowed in there, we also have\nto determine what level of access you have\n\n105\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.460\nto, right, what level of authorization.\n\n106\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.471\nBecause you might be able to sit in\nthe room but that doesn't necessarily mean\n\n107\n00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.640\nthat you can go over and you can adjust\nthe thermostat on the wall, right?\n\n108\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.940\nI have to authenticate you before\nI can even deny you access, right?\n\n109\n00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.670\nHow do we do that?\n\n110\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.460\nWell, if you're not\nan employee here at ITProTV,\n\n111\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.370\nyou don't come back here on the floor.\n\n112\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.726\nNow, except for our members,\nalways stop by the Gainesville studios.\n\n113\n00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:33.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But the point is,\n\n114\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.536\nif you're unauthorized, you try to\nauthenticate, can't prove who you are,\n\n115\n00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.452\nright, then you're not authorized.\n\n116\n00:05:39.452 --> 00:05:44.820\nSo you also have to authenticate\neven to deny somebody authorization.\n\n117\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.400\nRight, what level of access do you have?\n\n118\n00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.910\nYou might not have\naccess to this resource,\n\n119\n00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.450\nyou might have access to that resource,\nall right.\n\n120\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.820\nSo, authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n121\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.790\nKeep in mind that authentication is\nalways preceded by identification first.\n\n122\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.480\nWe have to make sure that\nthe person that has credentials\n\n123\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.745\nis that person they say they are.\n\n124\n00:06:04.745 --> 00:06:06.520\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's dive in, and\n\n125\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.150\ntalk about some of the authentication\nmechanisms that we have.\n\n126\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.910\nThe very first one they talk about is\nthe remote access dial-in user service.\n\n127\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.680\nThat's right, radius.\n\n128\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.180\nRadius has long been a common standard for\nauthentication of remote access.\n\n129\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.770\nAll right, what we mean by remote access?\n\n130\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.590\nIn fact, I've got a little diagram here,\nand we've quite a few components here.\n\n131\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.785\nBut it's really the radius server and\nthis process that we're focusing on.\n\n132\n00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:34.310\nNow understand,\nthis is an enterprise-level technology.\n\n133\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.490\nThis is typically something you don't\ndo in a normal home environment, right.\n\n134\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.634\nYou could see, because there's\na lot of infrastructure behind it.\n\n135\n00:06:40.634 --> 00:06:45.024\nBut if I've got somebody that, let's\nsay somebody's working from home, and\n\n136\n00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:47.860\nthey're on the outside of my network.\n\n137\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:54.230\nI need a standardized way for\nauthenticating who they are, who are you.\n\n138\n00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.530\nFor determining what level of access\nthey have, their authorization, and\n\n139\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.690\nthen finally,\nhow we can track their activities.\n\n140\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.100\nDid you access something?\n\n141\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.220\nSo again, who are you,\nwhat can you do, what did you do?\n\n142\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.460\nAnd radius is a standard mechanism for\ndoing that.\n\n143\n00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.266\nSo when a remote access client needs to\nmake access over a public network back\n\n144\n00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.840\ninto our internal network,\nthey hit what are known as RAS, all right.\n\n145\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.948\nAnd you might even hear it called RAS\nServer but RAS Server's kinda redundant,\n\n146\n00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:24.700\nit's Remote Access Services Server,\nor Remote Access Server Server.\n\n147\n00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.756\nDepending on- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n148\n00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Redundancy on that one, right?\n\n149\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.045\nAnd then once they hit the remote access\nservers, depending on the technology used\n\n150\n00:07:32.045 --> 00:07:37.945\nwhether it's a VPN server, dial-up server,\nor an 802.1X wireless access point,\n\n151\n00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:41.285\nthese devices are what\nare known as radius client.\n\n152\n00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:44.265\nNow, be careful with that term cuz I\nremember when I first started this,\n\n153\n00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:45.455\nI said, well, okay,\n\n154\n00:07:45.455 --> 00:07:50.460\nif I'm requesting this service of a radius\nserver, aren't I the client, right?\n\n155\n00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.748\nWe talked about the client-server\narchitecture, right?\n\n156\n00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:55.951\nA client requests resources,\nthe server provides the resources.\n\n157\n00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:58.217\nBut RADIUS is interesting.\n\n158\n00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:04.120\nBecause a remote access client cannot\ncommunicate directly with a RADIUS server.\n\n159\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.630\nThe reason they call these servers, and\nthis access point, a RADIUS client,\n\n160\n00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.440\nis because what they do, is they become\nkind of like the middle man, all right,\n\n161\n00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.950\nor middle person, if you would.\n\n162\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.430\nDon't forget the ladies out there, right?\n\n163\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.370\nAnd what they do,\nis when a remote access request is made,\n\n164\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.990\nthey take that authentication request,\nand they wrap it into,\n\n165\n00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.530\nencapsulate it if you will, wrap it up\ninto what's known as a RADIUS message.\n\n166\n00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.390\nAnd the reason these devices\nare called RADIUS clients is,\n\n167\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.500\nthey talk to the RADIUS server.\n\n168\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.160\nThey're making a request, a client,\non your behalf, all right?\n\n169\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.090\nAnd betting on success or failure, what\nthey do is they take the RADIUS message,\n\n170\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.160\nthey receive it,\nthey decapsulate it, right?\n\n171\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.860\nThey remove the layer\nof the onion off of it.\n\n172\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.570\nWhat's left is the success or fail, and\nthey pass it off to the remote client.\n\n173\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.300\nThey're the doorway,\nthey're the gatekeepers, right?\n\n174\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.160\nUltimately, who says\nyou can have access or\n\n175\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.760\ncan't have access against\nthe RADIUS server?\n\n176\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.560\nAnd then,\na lot of times when they do this,\n\n177\n00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.450\nthey don't authenticate\non the RADIUS server.\n\n178\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.960\nYou can, in fact in Windows,\nif you set it up in Windows server,\n\n179\n00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.640\nyou can authenticate right on the RADIUS\nserver, but sometimes what we do and a lot\n\n180\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.820\nof times what we do is we use a directory\nservices, right, like Active Directory.\n\n181\n00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.180\nWe let that be the centralized\nmanagement of your user accounts.\n\n182\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.600\nSo the RADIUS server says, all right, I\nsee the username and password, in fact I'm\n\n183\n00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.000\nnot even gonna authenticate this, I'll\nhand this over to the Active Directory\n\n184\n00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.850\nserver, and it can say whether your\nusername and password is correct, right?\n\n185\n00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.052\nSo a lot of times we'll couple\nit with an LDAP server.\n\n186\n00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:34.640\nAll right, now I want you to understand\nthat RADIUS combines the authentication.\n\n187\n00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.370\nWho are you?\n\n188\n00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.120\nWith the authorization,\nwhat level of access do you have?\n\n189\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.910\nWhat can you do?\n\n190\n00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.710\nAnd as well as the accounting side too.\n\n191\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.790\nAnd it's been the common standard for\n\n192\n00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.982\na very long time for\ndoing remote access authentication.\n\n193\n00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:50.300\nAll right, now, I will tell you that\ncommonly today, what you're gonna see,\n\n194\n00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.690\nand we gotta mention some ports here,\nright?\n\n195\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.690\nJust like we talked about our ports and\nprotocols.\n\n196\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.310\nWell, RADIUS protocol uses a specific or\n\n197\n00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.970\ncouple of them that we\nwant you to be aware of.\n\n198\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.730\nAnd I'm actually going to do some retro\nport naming to here because today,\n\n199\n00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:05.760\nwe use UDP.\n\n200\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.980\nAnd by the way, this uses a connection\nwith service just bookmark\n\n201\n00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.630\nthat in your mind here because we're going\nto come back to why that's important when\n\n202\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.688\nwe talk about another combination\nof these components, right?\n\n203\n00:10:16.688 --> 00:10:23.240\nSo a NASS server, if you will,\nagain the Network Access Service Server,\n\n204\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.510\nis going to use port 1812 for\nthe RADIUS authentication message, right?\n\n205\n00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.590\nIf we go back to the slide here,\nwhen these RADIUS clients, when they go\n\n206\n00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.640\nto encapsulate that authentication request\nin a RADIUS message, and they pass it off\n\n207\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.090\nto the RADIUS server, the RADIUS server\nis listening out on UDP on port 1812.\n\n208\n00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.880\nAnd now, for the accounting part.\n\n209\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.820\nWhere do we have the accounting messages,\nright, they call them accounting messages,\n\n210\n00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:57.320\nbut for argument purposes, well,\nthat's actually over UDP port 1813.\n\n211\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.250\nAnd let me make sure I got that\nright because I think I said, 1812.\n\n212\n00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.490\nIt's 1812 and 1813.\n\n213\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.722\nGot to make sure I get those right for\nyou.\n\n214\n00:11:04.722 --> 00:11:09.814\nRADIUS authentication messages on\nUDP Port 1812, the accounting messages,\n\n215\n00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:13.464\nRADIUS accounting messages,\nare going to be on 1813.\n\n216\n00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:17.564\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and give you\nsome of the older ports that it used to\n\n217\n00:11:17.564 --> 00:11:21.299\nbe the earlier RADIUS servers,\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n218\n00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.099\nI'm not sure which one, but\nin the earlier days, older network access\n\n219\n00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:31.393\nservers might use UDP port 1645 for\nthe RADIUS authentication messages.\n\n220\n00:11:31.393 --> 00:11:35.373\nAnd for the accounting messages 1646,\nall right?\n\n221\n00:11:35.373 --> 00:11:37.936\nAgain, these are some of the older ports,\ncommon ports are different now.\n\n222\n00:11:37.936 --> 00:11:41.056\nAnd in fact, you might see if\nyou go on to Windows server or\n\n223\n00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:43.461\nmaybe you're setting up or RADIUS server,\n\n224\n00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.632\nyou might see that you do have the ability\nto use either/or, but know that.\n\n225\n00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.584\nNow, the next one is also a way that\nwe can implement a, if you will,\n\n226\n00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:58.050\nan authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n227\n00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.430\nHowever, I will tell you\nwith this next component,\n\n228\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:05.550\nit actually separates into two components,\nthe authentication and the authorization.\n\n229\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.010\nThat is something known as TACACS+.\n\n230\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.245\nNow, TACACS, again, the acronym there,\n\n231\n00:12:12.245 --> 00:12:17.690\nT-A-C-A-C-S, and its successor,\nTACACS+ are Cisco proprietary.\n\n232\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.796\nAll right, so one is an industry-wide\nstandard RADIUS, right?\n\n233\n00:12:20.796 --> 00:12:25.520\nTACACS and TACACS+, however,\nare the same type of communication,\n\n234\n00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.420\nclose, because they're allowing\nyou to do the authentication.\n\n235\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.900\nAnd again, they separate the authorization\ninto two separate components, all right?\n\n236\n00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.980\nIt, on the other hand,\nI do want you to know,\n\n237\n00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.620\nit uses Transmission Control Protocol,\nall right?\n\n238\n00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.610\nIt uses TCP.\n\n239\n00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.620\nRather than UDP, all right?\n\n240\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.340\nSo what's better about that?\n\n241\n00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.490\nWell, remember what\nTransmission Control Protocol is.\n\n242\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.960\nIt's a connection oriented service.\n\n243\n00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.750\nIt's a reliability protocol.\n\n244\n00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.830\nIt's reliable,\nit's more reliable than UDP.\n\n245\n00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:02.490\nSo it's considered TACACS+,\nthe successor, right?\n\n246\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.210\nThe TACACS is the oldest rendition of it,\nif you will.\n\n247\n00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.549\nCisco, when they came and they did,\nand they kinda manipulated it, and\n\n248\n00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:12.627\nthey made it, upgraded it,\nif you will, and\n\n249\n00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:15.970\ntheir not backwards compatible with\neach other, TACACS and TACACS+,\n\n250\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.850\nthey're different enough that they're\nnot compatible with each other.\n\n251\n00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.030\nThat is what is the common standard today.\n\n252\n00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:32.264\nTACACS+ is considered more\nreliable than RADIUS, if you will.\n\n253\n00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:36.598\nIt uses TCP Port 49, all right?\n\n254\n00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:38.741\nNow, let's kinda look\nat the RADIUS process.\n\n255\n00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:40.050\nLet's go back to RADIUS here.\n\n256\n00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.903\nNow, remember I have my RADIUS slide,\nhere.\n\n257\n00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:44.008\nI want you to understand what's going on,\nall right?\n\n258\n00:13:44.008 --> 00:13:46.632\nSo want you to keep in mind that,\n\n259\n00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:52.579\nlet's say if we're doing an 802.1X\nbased RADIUS client, right?\n\n260\n00:13:52.579 --> 00:13:54.450\nI'll use this as an example.\n\n261\n00:13:54.450 --> 00:14:02.405\nAnd 802.1X by the way, this is the IEEEs\nstandard for port based authentication.\n\n262\n00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:05.925\nAll right, what this means is that when\nthe client, the remote access client\n\n263\n00:14:05.925 --> 00:14:10.805\ngoes to request authentication\nof the RADIUS server itself,\n\n264\n00:14:10.805 --> 00:14:15.290\nit means that the wireless device or\nwired switch, but\n\n265\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.460\nits not contingent on whether your wired\nconnection really make sure I say that.\n\n266\n00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.830\nI know a lot of time in contacts that\nuse it with wireless, but its wired or\n\n267\n00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:22.846\nwireless.\n\n268\n00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:24.450\nAnd it support 802.1X,\n\n269\n00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:29.060\nIt means if that port can be\nphysically shut down on the switch.\n\n270\n00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.310\nAnd it says, we shut the port down,\nyou're not allowed access to this network.\n\n271\n00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.890\nAnd I'll go send your RADIUS message on\nyour behalf over to the RADIUS server.\n\n272\n00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.370\nAll right, so just understand 802.1X.\n\n273\n00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.400\nAnd I'm gonna take a second here and\ngo off the beaten path on this one, Zach.\n\n274\n00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.990\nAnd there's a reason,\nbecause you might get\n\n275\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.910\nthese wrong on the exam if you're not\npaying close attention to the designation.\n\n276\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.770\nAnd I'm gonna put something else up here.\n\n277\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.320\nAnd I want you to notice, Zach, could you\ntell is the difference between these two?\n\n278\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.910\nAll right,\ndon't you noticed that there just a slight\n\n279\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.885\ndifference between these two, and it's\nobvious when you're looking at it right?\n\n280\n00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:05.250\n&gt;&gt; You got a 0.11X and 0.1X.\n\n281\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.040\n&gt;&gt; You got it, all right?\n\n282\n00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.580\nSo why is that important?\n\n283\n00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.480\nOkay.\nAnd why do I point that out?\n\n284\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.143\nRight, we've talked\nabout in other episodes,\n\n285\n00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:12.528\nwe talked about like our ports, right?\n\n286\n00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:16.385\nWe say port 389 is LDAP, which we're going\nto talk a little bit more about LDAP here\n\n287\n00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:18.439\nin this one, conveniently as well,\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n288\n00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:20.074\n&gt;&gt; But we've also talked about RDP.\n\n289\n00:15:20.074 --> 00:15:24.672\nOne's port 389 for LDAP,\nRemote Desktop Protocol is 3389.\n\n290\n00:15:24.672 --> 00:15:26.012\nSee how close they are?\n\n291\n00:15:26.012 --> 00:15:30.125\nAnd it's easy to get it right on the exam,\nbut it's just as easy if you just kind of\n\n292\n00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:34.190\nbreeze on through the question, not\npaying attention to it, to get it wrong.\n\n293\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.650\n802.1X is typically an umbrella\nterm in documentation for\n\n294\n00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.550\nthe entire wireless standard.\n\n295\n00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.820\nLike A, B, G, N, AC, and they don't want\nto sit there and write all that out.\n\n296\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.860\nSo like a variable,\nthey just put a little x there and\n\n297\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.990\nthat means just everything in the 802.11\nstandard, all the standard, right?\n\n298\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.429\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; 802.1X, like you pointed out, Zach,\n\n299\n00:15:54.429 --> 00:15:58.475\nmissing that extra one,\nthat is port based authentication.\n\n300\n00:15:58.475 --> 00:15:59.698\nThey are not the same.\n\n301\n00:15:59.698 --> 00:16:00.915\nDo not let it confuse you.\n\n302\n00:16:00.915 --> 00:16:02.869\nIt's not that they're trying to trick you.\n\n303\n00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:07.570\nIt's right there, the answer's there,\njust pay attention.\n\n304\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.010\nSo, I know it kind of got off\nthe beaten path, here, but\n\n305\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.265\nit is something that is important.\n\n306\n00:16:12.265 --> 00:16:14.960\n&gt;&gt; That will help you on the exam.\n\n307\n00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.630\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's go back and kind of\nunderstand what's happening, right?\n\n308\n00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.600\nThere's an access request that comes in.\n\n309\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.370\nAccess, remote access,\nI want access to the network, all right?\n\n310\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:30.207\nWell, what we'll see here first is then,\nthere's an identity request, right?\n\n311\n00:16:30.207 --> 00:16:32.226\nAnd that means who are you?\n\n312\n00:16:32.226 --> 00:16:35.915\nAll right,\nsounds like Alice in Wonderland's here.\n\n313\n00:16:35.915 --> 00:16:36.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n314\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.670\nSo who are you?\n\n315\n00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.084\nAll right, well I'm this person,\nall right?\n\n316\n00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:48.160\nSo we could say all right, I am-\n&gt;&gt; The March hare.\n\n317\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.123\n&gt;&gt; Supposed to be here, right?\n\n318\n00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:55.170\nI'm supposed to be here.\n\n319\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.953\nThat's the claim that's made, right?\n\n320\n00:16:57.953 --> 00:17:01.780\nSo the client says,\nI'm supposed to be here.\n\n321\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.260\nWell, then there's\nan authentication challenge.\n\n322\n00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.770\nAnd what the server is doing is says,\nyeah?\n\n323\n00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.350\nProve it.\n\n324\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.910\nThat's what the server's gonna say,\nthe authentication challenge.\n\n325\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.220\nSends a radius authentication challenge.\n\n326\n00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.250\nYou're saying, I'm supposed to be here.\n\n327\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.920\nThe server says, yeah, you are.\n\n328\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.910\nWell, prove it to me.\n\n329\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.110\nProve it to me that you're\nsupposed to be here, right?\n\n330\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.790\nAnd then what happens?\n\n331\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:30.385\nWell, there's a proof to the challenge.\n\n332\n00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:33.890\nThe proof,\nyou claim that I'm supposed to be here.\n\n333\n00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.310\nThe server challenges you, and\nyou make good on that challenge.\n\n334\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:44.450\nAnd you say I am, and\nthen you provide a username and password.\n\n335\n00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.020\nAll right, does that make sense?\n\n336\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.300\nSo far you say I am, and then again,\nyou provide the username and\n\n337\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.420\npassword, all of this is going back and\nforth between the radius clients.\n\n338\n00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.550\nAnd then the server does what?\n\n339\n00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.190\nAuthentication.\n\n340\n00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.950\nIt says, if you are who you say you are,\nthen when I look in my database,\n\n341\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.390\nyour username and\npassword should match, right?\n\n342\n00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.920\nAnd that's why I say\nauthentication success.\n\n343\n00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.350\nAuthentication success\nis really contingent on.\n\n344\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.910\nDo you know the username and password?\n\n345\n00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.910\nDid you type it right?\n\n346\n00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.130\nBecause I could say, authentication is\ndenied if we type our password wrong,\n\n347\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.792\nif it's like Wes on\nthe keyboard on Monday,\n\n348\n00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:21.940\nmight take me several [LAUGH]\nauthentication attempts, right?\n\n349\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.320\nBut notice that the authentication\nis successful, and\n\n350\n00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.300\nonce that happens,\nyou're granted remote access.\n\n351\n00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.250\nThat is a high level overview\nof the radius process\n\n352\n00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.500\nwhen you are making\na remote access request.\n\n353\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.580\nRemember, this is about access control.\n\n354\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.221\nAll right, so the next technology\nthat we also need to be aware of,\n\n355\n00:18:39.221 --> 00:18:41.766\nis something known as Kerberos,\nor Ceberus.\n\n356\n00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:45.260\nI've heard it said a couple\nof different ways.\n\n357\n00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.060\nWe're talking about a three-headed\ndog that guards the gates to Hades.\n\n358\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.945\nNot really, but what is that dog doing,\nright, other than being very scary.\n\n359\n00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:58.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It is guarding access to a location.\n\n360\n00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.650\nIn this case, in a mythological belief.\n\n361\n00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.610\nIt's guarding the access to Hades.\n\n362\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.830\nWell guess what?\n\n363\n00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.240\nAlright.\nKerberos is an authentication protocol\n\n364\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.850\nthat we use very, very heavily.\n\n365\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.800\nIt's a standard authentication mechanism\nthat was actually created by MIT.\n\n366\n00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.770\nMassachusetts Institute for\nTechnology, and\n\n367\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.480\nreally been adopted by a lot\nincluding active directory.\n\n368\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:28.240\nWindows authentication mechanism is\nthe Kerberos authentication mechanism, and\n\n369\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.160\nit uses port 88 by the way.\n\n370\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.840\nJust as a heads up in case\nthey ask you that on the exam.\n\n371\n00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.178\nYou might see another port too\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n372\n00:19:34.178 --> 00:19:37.375\n&gt;&gt; I believe it's port 464, and\nthat's just the active directory for\n\n373\n00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:38.610\nactive changes and stuff.\n\n374\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.550\nBut the default port is port 88.\n\n375\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.980\nAll right, so what is Kerberos doing?\n\n376\n00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.080\nYou will hear Kerberos\nexplained as a time sensitive\n\n377\n00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.690\nticket granting authentication mechanism.\n\n378\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.800\nWow, what does that mean?\n\n379\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.490\nAll right,\nwell let's see if we can help you.\n\n380\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.570\nI got a little, just basic diagram here\nof what's going on with Kerberosl, okay?\n\n381\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.770\nWhen you go to authenticate with Kerberos,\nagainst a Kerberos server, right?\n\n382\n00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.730\nIf you're in a Windows domain your\nKerberos servers actually the active\n\n383\n00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:10.920\ndirectory domain controller.\n\n384\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.520\nWhen I type in my user name and password,\n\n385\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:19.230\nI'm actually gonna send a Kerberos\nauthentication message up to that server.\n\n386\n00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.730\nHere's what the server's gonna do.\n\n387\n00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.570\nIt's kind of interesting.\n\n388\n00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.060\nIt's going to inspect its database.\n\n389\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.300\nIt's got to have a database\nof usernames and passwords,\n\n390\n00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.450\nverifying you are who you say you are, at\nleast you have that balid credentials, but\n\n391\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.580\nthen instead of just granting\nyou access to the network,\n\n392\n00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.460\nwhat it does is it issues\nyou a timestamped TGT.\n\n393\n00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.990\nTGT is just short for\nticket granting ticket, all right.\n\n394\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.070\nSo what does that, get you access to?\n\n395\n00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.270\nNothing, [LAUGH] all right.\n\n396\n00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.810\nWhat that does, cuz that's\nactually stored on your computer.\n\n397\n00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.390\nAt least, I'll throw a caveat to that.\n\n398\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.890\nThe timestamped TGT, or ticket granted\nticket, is actually cast on your computer.\n\n399\n00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.490\nAnd when your computer, or\n\n400\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:05.230\nyou go to browse across that Windows\ndomain, and you go to access a resource.\n\n401\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.950\nHere's what's interesting.\n\n402\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:11.320\nInstead of to the resource that\nyou are trying to gain access.\n\n403\n00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.730\nLet's say it's a file share\nout there on the network.\n\n404\n00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.300\nInstead of taking the TGT, and\n\n405\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.460\npresenting that to the resource server,\nyou actually take your TGT,\n\n406\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:25.020\nyour ticket granting ticket, and\npass it back to the Kerberos server.\n\n407\n00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.620\nNow what is a Kerberos Server?\n\n408\n00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.120\nInspects the timestamp.\n\n409\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.820\nWe'll talk about why that timestamp\nis important here in a second.\n\n410\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.870\nInspects the timestamp,\nit inspects the validity of the ticket.\n\n411\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.790\nAnd then, if it's valid it\nissues you another ticket.\n\n412\n00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.200\nThat's why we said,\nticket granting system, right?\n\n413\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.500\nIt issues you a service ticket.\n\n414\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.290\nAnd then when you access the resource\nthat resource server, let's say it's\n\n415\n00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.330\na file server within your domain,\nis going to inspect the service ticket.\n\n416\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.440\nWell, the service ticket\nis automatically trusted.\n\n417\n00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.100\nAnd why is it trusted?\n\n418\n00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.930\nBecause the resource server\ntrusts the Kerberos server.\n\n419\n00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.310\nIt trusts the service ticket,\n\n420\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:13.510\nbecause the only entity on your network\nthat could have issued that service ticket\n\n421\n00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.920\nwas a Kerberos server that\nbeforehand validated your TGT.\n\n422\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.510\nPretty cool, right?\n\n423\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.170\nSo little bit of a process here.\n\n424\n00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.510\nNow, why is the time stamping important?\n\n425\n00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.830\nWell time-stamping is important,\n\n426\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.670\nbecause it guards against\nthings like replay attacks.\n\n427\n00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.430\nAll right, if I can gain your information,\n\n428\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.260\nif I can grab your information,\nlet's say with a protocol analyzer and\n\n429\n00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.810\nif it was the TGT was all I needed,\nthen I could steal your TGT, and\n\n430\n00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.410\nI could present it to the resource server,\nand I could do a replay attack, right?\n\n431\n00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.700\nSpoofing myself as hey, being Zach,\nacting, you know, Zach's authorized,\n\n432\n00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.210\nI'm the hacker here,\nI just grab Zach's TGT and\n\n433\n00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.628\nI present it to the resource server,\ndoing a man in the middle attack, and\n\n434\n00:22:52.628 --> 00:22:56.260\nguess what,\nI'm accessing your resources, right?\n\n435\n00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.750\nBut it doesn't work that way.\n\n436\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.260\nAll right?\n\n437\n00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:03.430\nIf I grab the TGT, all right,\nand I let some time go by,\n\n438\n00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.050\nthen I present that back to the Kerberos\nserver, the Kerberos server says no.\n\n439\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.980\nI don't know,\nthe timestamps varies by five minutes.\n\n440\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.630\nYou can actually lose your\ntrust with the domain.\n\n441\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.600\nIt says no, no, no,\nthat's not you and just discards it.\n\n442\n00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.830\nDoesn't even consider it.\n\n443\n00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.650\nAnd that's why your devices\ndon't consider it a TGT either,\n\n444\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.570\nbecause it's the resource servers\nresponding to a service ticket, and\n\n445\n00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.100\nonly the Kerberos server\ncan issue a service ticket.\n\n446\n00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.680\nSo again, very, very complex yet\nreally cool process.\n\n447\n00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.760\nSo that is your Kerberos\nauthentication protocol.\n\n448\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.980\nNow, be aware of what these are.\n\n449\n00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.120\nBe aware of Radius.\n\n450\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.930\nBe aware of the ports in Radius too.\n\n451\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:44.532\nAnd again, as a recap, the major ones,\nthe newer ones 18-12 for\n\n452\n00:23:44.532 --> 00:23:47.574\nRadius authentication mechanism messages,\n\n453\n00:23:47.574 --> 00:23:51.874\n1813 for accounting messages,\nI keep on saying mechanism.\n\n454\n00:23:51.874 --> 00:23:57.275\n[LAUGH] And 1645 for radius,\nthe older radius authentication messages,\n\n455\n00:23:57.275 --> 00:24:01.100\n1646 for the accounting messages.\n\n456\n00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.890\nKeep in mind that it uses UDP,\nand it's considered less reliable\n\n457\n00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.470\nthan tech X plus which is a Cisco\nproprietary authentication and\n\n458\n00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.910\nauthorization mechanism,\nthat uses 49 over transmission\n\n459\n00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:17.120\ncontrol protocol in such it's\na connection or it's a service.\n\n460\n00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.270\nAnd I didn't even mention the fact that\nit could be an encrypted wide process.\n\n461\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.740\nThe whole authentication\nprocess is encrypted, right?\n\n462\n00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.940\nSo the whole authentication process\nbeginning in the end could be encrypted.\n\n463\n00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.830\nAnd again, because it's\ntransmission control protocol,\n\n464\n00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.500\nit is considered more reliable.\n\n465\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.070\nAlso, know what Kerberos is, right?\n\n466\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:39.550\nAnd again, it's used in your\nactive directory environments, and\n\n467\n00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.300\nyou can see UDP or TCP Port 88.\n\n468\n00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.080\nAnd then again, an active directory\nenvironment you might even see port 640 or\n\n469\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.560\n464 just in case.\n\n470\n00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.770\nThese are some of the mechanisms\nthat you have to be aware of, but\n\n471\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.120\nwe've still got more to go.\n\n472\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.680\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Wes.\n\n473\n00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.930\nAuthentication and Access Control\npart one, there will be a part two,\n\n474\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.960\nwatch them both.\n\n475\n00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.090\nAnd watch everything in the CompTIA Net+\nseries that Wes is putting\n\n476\n00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:02.630\ntogether for you.\n\n477\n00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.780\nHe's doing a wonderful job,\n\n478\n00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.540\nand he wants to make sure that\nno stone is left unturned.\n\n479\n00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.110\nAnd you know something,\n\n480\n00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:10.090\nwhen you're in that course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos.\n\n481\n00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.760\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n482\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.680\nCheck them out.\n\n483\n00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.890\nAnd tell everyone you know about ITPRO TV.\n\n484\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.600\nITPro TV is binge-worth.\n\n485\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.830\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n486\n00:25:17.830 -->

00:00:08.358\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.504\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:16.520\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.880\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.420\nAs we continue on with and net plus,\nthis is going to be authentication and\n\n9\n00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.560\naccess control part two.\n\n10\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.810\nThere is a part one,\nmake sure you see that.\n\n11\n00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.850\nAnd Wes Bryan is here to, once again,\ntake us through these waters.\n\n12\n00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.750\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nlet's hope they're not too murky.\n\n13\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.470\n&gt;&gt; Let's go, Captain.\n\n14\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.180\n&gt;&gt; That's right, ludicrous speed, go!\n\n15\n00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.880\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\nwe're jumping in with a part two here.\n\n16\n00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770\nRemember in the first part we talked about\njust the basics, again, of authentication,\n\n17\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.430\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n18\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.480\nAnd we looked at things like radius and\n\n19\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.170\nwe also finished off with a Kerberos\nprotocol or a Kerberos, if you will.\n\n20\n00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.250\nRemember, as a recap,\n\n21\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.600\nwhen we talk about authentication\nthat is proving who you are.\n\n22\n00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.750\nAuthorization is determining what level of\naccess you have, as well as accounting,\n\n23\n00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680\nsometimes called auditing,\nthat's basically tracking activity.\n\n24\n00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.130\nSo again, like I've heard it said before,\nwho are you, that's the authentication.\n\n25\n00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.110\nWhat can you do is the authorization.\n\n26\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.400\nLast but not least, is, well,\nwhat did you do, right?\n\n27\n00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.350\nThat's the accounting part.\n\n28\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.600\nSo those are-\n&gt;&gt; Three A's.\n\n29\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.030\n&gt;&gt; Some basics, that's right,\nthe three A's that we need to be aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.420\nNow, one of the things that I didn't\nmention when we were talking about\n\n31\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.160\nKerberos, right?\n\n32\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.397\nWe talked about that\nbeing a ticket granting,\n\n33\n00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:29.800\ntime sensitive authentication protocol.\n\n34\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.040\nWhat does it allow us to do?\n\n35\n00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.060\nWell it's interesting,\n\n36\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.360\nwhat it allows us to do is perform\nsomething known as a single sign on.\n\n37\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.550\nAnd what we mean by that is the fact that\nI can enter a set of credentials one time,\n\n38\n00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.540\nbe authenticated, have my authorization\napplied to my my user account, if\n\n39\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.300\nyou will, and I don't have to reenter my\ncredentials if you think about it, right.\n\n40\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.840\nEspecially with today we got so\nmany different services out there.\n\n41\n00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.140\nCan you imagine having to enter your\ncredentials every time you wanted to\n\n42\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.780\naccess an additional resource?\n\n43\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.620\n&gt;&gt; It would get a little bit tricky right?\n\n44\n00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.340\nAnd one of the things good is that when\nit comes to single sign on, and in fact,\n\n45\n00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.320\nlet me show you here.\n\n46\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.610\nYou've probably been using this and\nmaybe you didn't even notice.\n\n47\n00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.230\nI use Google because they have such as\nwide range of services that they offer,\n\n48\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.480\nbut no different than if\nyou're using Office 365.\n\n49\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.840\nIf you ever logged in with Facebook,\nright.\n\n50\n00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.790\nAnd it says log in with your\nFacebook account, right.\n\n51\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.510\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I've already put in my Facebook\n\n52\n00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.100\ncredentials.\n\n53\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.310\nSo all I got to do is hit a button and\n\n54\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.860\nI don't really have to enter\nthose credentials again.\n\n55\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.230\nNow that goes a little bit farther.\n\n56\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.640\nThat's called federated services but\nit allows us that single sign on.\n\n57\n00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.350\nEntering credentials once and\n\n58\n00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.760\nnot having to enter them again\nto access additional resources.\n\n59\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.640\nSo we have some basic stuff.\n\n60\n00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.120\nMaybe you've used Google services before,\nright?\n\n61\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.370\nMaybe you use Hangout, Gmail, right?\n\n62\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.700\nGoogle Drive or YouTube.\n\n63\n00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.610\nLog in one time, and\nthen you can access those resources and\n\n64\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.730\nyou don't have to reenter that\nuser name and password, right?\n\n65\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.120\nThat's a great convenience.\n\n66\n00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.940\nIt's convenience in a couple of ways,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.820\nMost of the times we're\ntalking about security, right.\n\n68\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.720\nAccess control a lot of\ntimes is about security.\n\n69\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.800\nAnd when we say you increase security,\nyou usually decrease convenience,\n\n70\n00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.320\nthe more secure something is sometimes\nit's harder to gain access to it right.\n\n71\n00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.890\nOr the opposite side of the tracks right.\n\n72\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.210\nIf we say well that's a little too\ndifficult, you know you've got to enter\n\n73\n00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.460\nall these different passwords or we're\nmaking the passwords astronomically huge.\n\n74\n00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.340\nAgain as we're more secure, we're talking\n\n75\n00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.150\nabout convenience starts to get a little\nbit less, but if we say you know what,\n\n76\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.230\nwe don't want to make it so hard,\nyou don't have to have a big password.\n\n77\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.290\nIn fact,\nyou can have a really small password and\n\n78\n00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.530\nwe're not going to make you change it.\n\n79\n00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.060\nWell, now we've introduced\na greater convenience but\n\n80\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.300\nwe've also decreased some of our security.\n\n81\n00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.913\nAnd one of the great things about single\nsign on is it kinda helps you kinda\n\n82\n00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:51.820\nbalance the middle of the road there.\n\n83\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.590\nNow I'm not sure where, you know, the\nmiddle of the road is because if you tell\n\n84\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.941\nme to show you a secure network,\nI'll show you one that doesn't exist.\n\n85\n00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.281\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the benefit is the user gets,\n\n86\n00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:05.680\nfrom the end user experience is you get\nthe convenience of entering one set of\n\n87\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.330\ncredentials and you can access all the\nresources that you are allowed to access,\n\n88\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.070\nthat you have authorization for.\n\n89\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.610\nThat single sign on, we get that inside\nthings like active directory domains,\n\n90\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.660\nwhere I can logon to a domain\ncomputer one time and then if I'm\n\n91\n00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.280\naccessing a resource within the domain,\nprovided I have the permissions to, right,\n\n92\n00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.620\nI mean you can't access something\nyou're not authorized to.\n\n93\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.590\nBut provided I can,\nI don't have to reenter my password.\n\n94\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.270\nWe'll show you an example\nof that coming up.\n\n95\n00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.630\nAnd that actually leads us in to our\nnext concept, and that's known as LDAP.\n\n96\n00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.590\nWe look at LDAP, that's the lightweight\ndirectory access protocol.\n\n97\n00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.908\nWe talk about things like and I've been\nmentioning Kerberos and active directory,\n\n98\n00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:47.590\nwell LDAP is essentially the way you\naccess a directory service's database.\n\n99\n00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.230\nWell, why would I want something\nlike a directory service's database?\n\n100\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.230\nWhat does that make,\nwhat does that do for us?\n\n101\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.690\nWell that's a centralized\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n102\n00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.100\nI want you to think about local login,\nright?\n\n103\n00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.050\nLocal access.\n\n104\n00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.480\nIf I've got a work group and\nI want somebody to be able to access\n\n105\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.540\na resource across ten different\ncomputers within a work group, then I\n\n106\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.480\nhave to create them ten different user\naccounts on each one of those computers.\n\n107\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.250\nBecause each one of those computers\nare managing their own user account\n\n108\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.910\ndatabase, right?\n\n109\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.120\nAnd they don't trust each other's user\naccounts across different computers.\n\n110\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.070\nBut if I put them in\nan active directory domain,\n\n111\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.502\nif I put them in a directory service, then\nwhat you do is you log on one time and\n\n112\n00:05:27.502 --> 00:05:32.440\nprovided you have the resources, you can\naccess all the different domain computers,\n\n113\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.360\nif you will,\nthat are also a part of that domain.\n\n114\n00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.120\nSo it also gives you the ability\nto have single sign on as well.\n\n115\n00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.470\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean by that.\n\n116\n00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.980\nI've got a Windows 10 machine here,\nand let's go ahead and\n\n117\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.250\nlet's log into this machine right now.\n\n118\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.090\nThis computer is not a part of a domain,\nright?\n\n119\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.360\nI want to kind of show you the protocol in\nthe background, so that you can see how\n\n120\n00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.290\nthis is actually kind of coming into play,\nand where we can actually see LDAP.\n\n121\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.860\nI also have a domain controller over here,\nand\n\n122\n00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.610\nin the domain controller,\nwe have administrative shares.\n\n123\n00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.180\nAnd if you're coming over from A plus,\nthen you probably remember this.\n\n124\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.390\nRemember, administrative shares are how\nI can get access to, for instance,\n\n125\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.380\nthe local hard drive here\nin this domain controller.\n\n126\n00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.670\nBut I need to be in the domain.\n\n127\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.750\nI can't be logged in locally, and\n\n128\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.770\nthat's what I just did with this machine,\nI logged in locally.\n\n129\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.020\nAnd what that means is\nthat the user accounts\n\n130\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.690\nare actually being stored\non this local machine.\n\n131\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.160\nAnd if I go to computer management and\nwe look at local users in groups,\n\n132\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.670\nwell I have this list, and\nI'm actually logged in as Administrator01.\n\n133\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.270\nWell, the domain controller\ndoesn't trust this user account.\n\n134\n00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.650\nWhy?\nBecause it's stored in the same file,\n\n135\n00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.820\nthat stored on the hard\ndrive of this local machine,\n\n136\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.740\nactive directory is isn't aware of it.\n\n137\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.900\nSo if I was to try to browse to some kind\nof resource out there with the domain,\n\n138\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.735\nmaybe I do something like \\\\,\nwe'll type in UNC path here.\n\n139\n00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:56.460\n10.10.10.100, and I do a C$, right,\n\n140\n00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.108\nthat is the administrator share\nthat's within that domain controller.\n\n141\n00:07:00.108 --> 00:07:04.600\nI'm trying to communicate with it's\nlocal hard drive and I hit enter, well,\n\n142\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.596\nnothing's really happening, and there's\na reason because this local machine,\n\n143\n00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:16.305\nI'm using its credentials\nin order to authenticate,\n\n144\n00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:22.056\nwithin the domain I have to use a domain\naccount that's stored within that server.\n\n145\n00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:26.750\nAll right, so it's asking me to\npresent my credentials again.\n\n146\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.280\nSo sure.\n\n147\n00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.695\nI can if I want,\nI can type them again and I'll just do\n\n148\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:38.500\ndemo\\administrator and\nwe'll go ahead and let's see.\n\n149\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.330\nHopefully I typed that password right.\n\n150\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.390\nAnd sure enough, there we go, right?\n\n151\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.690\nSo I can see that I'm on\nthis domain controller.\n\n152\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.636\nAnd if I open it up I can see\nactive directory federate services,\n\n153\n00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.690\nactive directory web services.\n\n154\n00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.462\nSo I can see that I am in the domain\ncontroller by those active\n\n155\n00:07:53.462 --> 00:07:56.440\ndirectory folders, or\ndirectories that are present.\n\n156\n00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.832\nBut I had to enter the password twice.\n\n157\n00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:01.510\nThat isn't single sign on, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.930\nNow let's go ahead and\nkinda tie a couple of these together.\n\n159\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.070\nLet's look at single sign on and\nlet's look at LDAP.\n\n160\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.470\nAnd what I'm gonna do here is,\n\n161\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.970\nI'm actually gonna join this\ncomputer to the domain.\n\n162\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.450\nAnd I want you to see how\nthe computers also authenticate.\n\n163\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.030\nNot only does your username.\n\n164\n00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.850\nWhen you type in your username and\npassword.\n\n165\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.660\nThen you send the credentials over\nLDAP the directory services server.\n\n166\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.070\nYour computer has to prove\nit is who it says it is.\n\n167\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.640\nRight?\nSo and\n\n168\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.560\nwe can actually see that process here.\n\n169\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.880\nSo I'm gonna ahead and\nI'm gonna fire up WireShark.\n\n170\n00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.850\nAll right, our protocol analyzer,\n\n171\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.380\nwe're gonna kinda look under\nthe hood if the network protocol.\n\n172\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.210\nAnd see if we can spot any LDAP traffic.\n\n173\n00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.270\nSo the first thing I wanna do is,\nI'm gonna pick the network adaptor.\n\n174\n00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.240\nThat we're gonna reach out with the\nlightweight directory access protocol and\n\n175\n00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.970\ncommunicate with that server.\n\n176\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.100\nAll right.\n\n177\n00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.360\nAnd it's gonna ask me\nto authenticate here.\n\n178\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.470\nAnd that's my Mac here saying, hey.\n\n179\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.590\nDo you really want to allow\nthis computer to sniff traffic?\n\n180\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.660\nAnd I'm gonna say, okay.\n\n181\n00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.210\nAnd I can see some protocols that\nare going, DNS and everything right here.\n\n182\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.140\nI'm not worried about those.\n\n183\n00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.380\nBut I'm gonna put a filter here and\nI'm just going to put a filter of LDAP.\n\n184\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.826\nRight up there in the filter dialogue box.\n\n185\n00:09:06.826 --> 00:09:07.900\nAnd we're going to run it.\n\n186\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.570\nBoy, that's anticlimactic.\n\n187\n00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.730\nNot really much happening here too, right?\n\n188\n00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.490\nBut we'll let this run in the background.\n\n189\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.350\nAnd what I'm going to do here is,\nI'm going to go ahead.\n\n190\n00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.420\nAnd I'm going to use our system info\noption by going into our settings.\n\n191\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.680\nAnd I'm going to choose\nover here System Info.\n\n192\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.780\nAnd I'm going to go ahead,\nthough advanced system settings.\n\n193\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.960\nAnd I'm going to join this\ncomputer to the known main.\n\n194\n00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.220\nWe're going to use our system properties.\n\n195\n00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.890\nAnd what I'm going to do here is, I'm\ngoing to choose rename this computer or\n\n196\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.350\nchange it's domain or workgroup.\n\n197\n00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.100\nThat's what I want.\n\n198\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.580\nAnd I'm going to say, you know what?\n\n199\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.630\nWe're going to go ahead and we're going\nto reach out to that domain controller.\n\n200\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.510\nAnd we're going to join\nit as part of the domain.\n\n201\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.530\nWell, I'm going to also need an account\nthat's part of the domain as well.\n\n202\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.240\nWe'll see both.\n\n203\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.420\nWe'll see that LDAP in action here.\n\n204\n00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.970\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsay there's the domain.\n\n205\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.040\nIt's challenging me.\n\n206\n00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.260\nIt's saying I still don't have\nmy single sign on quite yet.\n\n207\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.830\nRight?\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and say all right.\n\n208\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.600\nDemo administrator.\n\n209\n00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.240\nAnd I'll go ahead and authenticate.\n\n210\n00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.430\nAnd hopefully it will join the domain.\n\n211\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.050\nAll right?\nNow, actually I noticed something here.\n\n212\n00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.990\nWe'll give it a second here because\nit's trying to figure out are you\n\n213\n00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.040\nsuppose to be a part of this domain?\n\n214\n00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.380\nAre you a valid user on this domain?\n\n215\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.160\nNow, if you're a valid\nuser on this domain.\n\n216\n00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.340\nI'm gonna let the computer start,\n\n217\n00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.600\nstart communicating with\nthe directory services server.\n\n218\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.750\nSo what do we end up seeing?\n\n219\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.270\nLet's see if I've got\na successful authentication here.\n\n220\n00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.620\nI can tell that by, it still hasn't.\n\n221\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.550\nUsername and password is incorrect.\n\n222\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.160\nLet's try that again.\n\n223\n00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.130\nBut you can see the LDAP is happening.\n\n224\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.390\nI want to take this to completion and\nactually join the domain.\n\n225\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.770\nBecause I want you to be able\nto see the single sign on.\n\n226\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.470\nSo lets try that one more time.\n\n227\n00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.280\nAnd Wes apparently wasn't holding his\nmouse right when he type the password.\n\n228\n00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.900\nSo we'll try this again.\n\n229\n00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.575\nAnd let's see what happens here.\n\n230\n00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:00.835\nAnd it took a second there, but\n\n231\n00:11:00.835 --> 00:11:04.505\nlet's hope we get a successful\njoin of the domain here.\n\n232\n00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:06.835\nAnd I can see that we do have some LDAP.\n\n233\n00:11:06.835 --> 00:11:10.650\nI didn't see a 404 there, search request\nand that's always not found, right?\n\n234\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.675\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, hopefully,\n\n235\n00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:14.175\nwhat we'll see here in a second,\nis that we'll start the.\n\n236\n00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:16.065\nThere we go, that's what we want.\n\n237\n00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:17.465\nNotice there's a lot more.\n\n238\n00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:19.595\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I can almost tell you that we're\n\n239\n00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.240\ngonna get a success here.\n\n240\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.430\nAnd if I take a second here, we should\nsee successfully joined the demo domain.\n\n241\n00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.330\nAnd you can see that it's reaching\nout to that domain controller, right.\n\n242\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.190\nAnd there we go.\n\n243\n00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.060\nSo it's telling me, hey,\nwelcome to the domain.\n\n244\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.827\nAnd we can see in the background\nif I look down here.\n\n245\n00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:40.735\nI can see that we have some lightweight\ndirectory access protocol communications\n\n246\n00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:41.780\ngoing on here.\n\n247\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.090\nAnd if I have to look\nat the TCP port here.\n\n248\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.760\nWe can see the destination port.\n\n249\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.540\nRemember we talked about ports and\nprotocols.\n\n250\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.630\nPort 389,\nthere we can see it with Wireshark here.\n\n251\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.110\nWe'll go ahead and we'll close this down.\n\n252\n00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.460\nWe're not going to save anything here.\n\n253\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.840\nI just wanted to show you that\nLDAP is working in the background.\n\n254\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.690\nAnd we're going to let this computer\ngo ahead and restart itself.\n\n255\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.602\nAnd when it restarts itself, instead of\nlogging on with local authentication.\n\n256\n00:12:06.602 --> 00:12:08.910\nWe're going to log on with\ndomain authentication.\n\n257\n00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.290\nAnd see if we get an example\nof that single sign on.\n\n258\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.800\nWhere one site Enter my, in this case it's\ngonna be the administrative credentials.\n\n259\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.490\nOnce I enter my\nadministrative credentials.\n\n260\n00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.705\nLet's browse to that same\nshare that we just did before.\n\n261\n00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:26.080\nAnd let's see if it challenges again and\ngives us another authentication screen.\n\n262\n00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.370\nOr it does single sign on.\n\n263\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.270\nAnd that's one of the goals.\n\n264\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.310\nAnd that kind of shows you,\n\n265\n00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.600\nthat we do get the ability if we\njoin a computer to the domain.\n\n266\n00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.260\nAnd we have a domain account as a user.\n\n267\n00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.300\nWe get the,\nwe can see single sign on in action.\n\n268\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.256\nNow let me go ahead and\nwe're going to authenticate.\n\n269\n00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:42.213\nAnd I'm going to choose\nother user this time,\n\n270\n00:12:42.213 --> 00:12:44.040\nbecause I don't want to log on locally.\n\n271\n00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.050\nEssentially right back where we started.\n\n272\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.900\nSo I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to\nsay I'm going to log on to the domain.\n\n273\n00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.150\nSo I'm going to put demo there and\nthen I'm going to type in administrator.\n\n274\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.170\nAnd then we're going to type\nour super secret password.\n\n275\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.339\nNow again hopefully the goal is you might\nhave to sit here and build a profile.\n\n276\n00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:03.900\nIf it's the first time you've logged in.\n\n277\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.030\nSo that might take a second.\n\n278\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.480\nAgain, what it's doing,\nit's now doing a couple of things.\n\n279\n00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.703\nAll right, one of those was\na communication over LDAP.\n\n280\n00:13:11.703 --> 00:13:15.287\nRemember what we said that\nthe authentication mechanism that was used\n\n281\n00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:16.822\ninside of active directory?\n\n282\n00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:17.402\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n283\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n284\n00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.810\nSo now we can see a couple of these\nprotocals that are in action.\n\n285\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.820\nAnd it'll take a second\nhere to build this profile.\n\n286\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.310\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nwe'll wait for it to do that.\n\n287\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.050\nSo remember that light weight\ndirectory access protocol is\n\n288\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.130\nhow you communicate with\na directory service's server.\n\n289\n00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:38.390\nIn this case we're using it to communicate\nwith our active directory domain computer.\n\n290\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.150\nAnd if I go into the user database here.\n\n291\n00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.530\nSo we're in active directory\nusers in computers.\n\n292\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.200\nAnd I come up to computers.\n\n293\n00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.300\nI don't see one yet.\n\n294\n00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.190\nLet's refresh it.\n\n295\n00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:48.990\nThere we go.\n\n296\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.110\nAnd we did a refresh now.\n\n297\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.970\nAnd we now have a computer in here\nthat is a part of the domain.\n\n298\n00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.290\nAnd because the computers are part of\nthe domain, when it first boots up.\n\n299\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.470\nIt actually talks to the domain\ncontroller and says, here I am.\n\n300\n00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.330\nThis is me and we verify,\n\n301\n00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.660\nwell Active Directory verifies\nthat inside of it's database.\n\n302\n00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.660\nAll right, now let's go ahead and\ncancel this.\n\n303\n00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.803\nI don't need vmware\ntalking to me right now.\n\n304\n00:14:13.803 --> 00:14:16.740\nAnd what we can do is, I'll tell you what.\n\n305\n00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:21.520\nWe will drop down to our command\nprompt and let's type in, who am I?\n\n306\n00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.010\nAll right, and we can see that we're\nno longer on the local database.\n\n307\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.190\nThis doesn't say client 01\\admin01.\n\n308\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.226\nIt actually says and\nwe can see, demo\\administrator.\n\n309\n00:14:33.226 --> 00:14:38.880\nSo that lets me know that,\nyes I am logged in with a domain account.\n\n310\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.970\nAnd we're gonna do the same thing.\n\n311\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.024\nWe're gonna type that UNC path that\nwe typed before, 10.10.10.100/c$.\n\n312\n00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:48.260\nAnd notice what happened.\n\n313\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.050\nNotice I got an instant icon I\ndon't know if you seen that.\n\n314\n00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.820\nBut past we didn't get an icon, right.\n\n315\n00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.305\nNotice it just said run command when I\nactually type this in before Zack, right.\n\n316\n00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:00.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And now what I see is,\n\n317\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.730\nI actually before I even hit enter.\n\n318\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.530\nI see an icon.\n\n319\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.988\nSo it's over SMB, right.\n\n320\n00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:08.180\nServer Message Blockage,\nit's reaching out.\n\n321\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.100\nIt's already checked my credentials\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n322\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.330\n&gt;&gt; It knows who I am,\nwho I say I am and when I hit enter.\n\n323\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.077\nNotice that I didn't get challenged.\n\n324\n00:15:16.077 --> 00:15:19.330\nI didn't get a second\nauthentication dialog box, right?\n\n325\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.560\nSingle sign on, and\nthat's one of the benefits.\n\n326\n00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.420\nIt's a benefit and this blends a lot of\nthe topics together when you're talking\n\n327\n00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.080\nabout active directory.\n\n328\n00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.770\nBecause it's using Kerberos or\nKerberos if you will.\n\n329\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:30.920\nAs it's authentication\nprotocol with the TGTs,\n\n330\n00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.470\nas well as our computer's\ncommunicating back and\n\n331\n00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.920\nforth With the lightweight directory\naccess protocol over port 389.\n\n332\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.026\nNow, we can go a little bit farther with\nsome of our authentication mechanisms.\n\n333\n00:15:45.026 --> 00:15:48.408\nOne of the things that we can use\nare what are known as certificate based\n\n334\n00:15:48.408 --> 00:15:50.280\nauthentication mechanisms.\n\n335\n00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.290\nAnd when we look at a certificate\nbased authentication mechanism,\n\n336\n00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.253\nwhat we mean by that.\n\n337\n00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:58.006\nIs that you can use digital certificates.\n\n338\n00:15:58.006 --> 00:16:03.265\nA digital certificate is really just\na little bit of information that\n\n339\n00:16:03.265 --> 00:16:08.720\nassociates an identity with that\ndigital stamp, if you will, right?\n\n340\n00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.270\nThe certificate, if you will,\n\n341\n00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.380\nis one of the pretty much one of\nthe secure forms of authentication.\n\n342\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.070\nSo rather than using usernames and\npasswords,\n\n343\n00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.170\nwe can go through a process of\nactually assigning a certificate.\n\n344\n00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.410\nAnd we can assign them not just to users,\nwe can assign them to computers,\n\n345\n00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.630\nwe can assign them,\nif you will to our devices.\n\n346\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.750\nSo users, computers, and devices.\n\n347\n00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.610\nLet me kind of show you the process.\n\n348\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.250\nWhen you go for a certificate,\nthe first thing that happens is you\n\n349\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.170\nhave to identify who you are, that's\nalways part of your onboarding process.\n\n350\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.380\nI'm providing my drivers license, my\nSocial Security card, I get hired, right?\n\n351\n00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.480\nBut then the next thing I have to do is I\nhave to go to a registration authority.\n\n352\n00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.650\nAnd a registration authority\nlooks at my certificate request.\n\n353\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.430\nI make a certificate request.\n\n354\n00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.850\nI need a certificate, right?\n\n355\n00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.780\nRegistration authority says, okay.\n\n356\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.870\nThe request is valid.\n\n357\n00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.870\nLet me turn around and\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n358\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.630\nI'm gonna send this off to what's\nknown as a certificate authority.\n\n359\n00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.680\nAll right, the certificate authority,\nCAs if you will, they're responsible for\n\n360\n00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.980\nissuing the CAs, or\nthe certificate, excuse me.\n\n361\n00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.410\nBut there's typically a hierarchy.\n\n362\n00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.190\nYou have what's known as\npublic infrastructure.\n\n363\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:20.320\nThat's where certificates come from,\nfrom a public key infrastructure.\n\n364\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.880\nAnd what you have is typically you have a\nmulti-level, you don't always have to, but\n\n365\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.190\nyou have what's known as a tiered\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n366\n00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.508\nAnd you have what's known as the highest\nportion of the certificate hierarchy,\n\n367\n00:17:33.508 --> 00:17:34.532\nknown as a root CA.\n\n368\n00:17:34.532 --> 00:17:40.190\nAnd then what it does is it issues\na self signed certificate to itself.\n\n369\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.850\nAnd what we mean by that is it says,\n\n370\n00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.000\nhey, I'm the highest part\nof this trust hierarchy.\n\n371\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.820\nAnd then what it does is it endorses\nlower level certificate authorities\n\n372\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:54.230\ncalled issuing CAs, or subordinate CAs,\nand they become the work horse.\n\n373\n00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.350\nThey're the ones that actually issue\nthe certificate to the user, all right?\n\n374\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.330\nOr the device, or\nthe computer, if you will.\n\n375\n00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:08.070\nAnd what the certificate does, is\nthe certificate actually has a key pair.\n\n376\n00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.330\nTwo keys, if you will,\nthat are associated with this certificate,\n\n377\n00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.580\nand it's how we get asymmetric encryption,\nall right?\n\n378\n00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:20.800\nNow, that key pair with that certificate\nis then installed on the local computer,\n\n379\n00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.050\nor assigned to the end user.\n\n380\n00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.685\nAnd now instead of having to type in\na user name or password when you go to\n\n381\n00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:33.344\nauthenticate against a resource instead of\nagain typing the user name and password,\n\n382\n00:18:33.344 --> 00:18:38.399\nyou're computer hands the certificate\nto that resource, whatever it is.\n\n383\n00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:39.560\nSo I want you to think of it this way,\nright?\n\n384\n00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.355\nIf I go into a bank and\nI want to get access to my account, data,\n\n385\n00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:47.048\nand my money, what do I have to do?\n\n386\n00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:49.072\nWell, I have to present them with my ID.\n\n387\n00:18:49.072 --> 00:18:50.570\nI have to give them my driver's license.\n\n388\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:53.050\nOr if your military out there,\nyour CAC card.\n\n389\n00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.741\nYou military vets out there probably\nknow the Common Access Card that you\n\n390\n00:18:56.741 --> 00:18:57.719\npresent, right?\n\n391\n00:18:57.719 --> 00:19:00.080\nAnd in that has all your\nidentifying information.\n\n392\n00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.580\nWell, that's kind of\nthe way certificates work.\n\n393\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.590\nIt's like a digital identity, if you will.\n\n394\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.720\nAnd in fact,\nwe can kinda see that in action here if,\n\n395\n00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.600\nlet's say, so for instance,\nI'm on Google's website.\n\n396\n00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.450\nThis is a certificate\nbased authentication.\n\n397\n00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.220\nNow the difference is,\n\n398\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.190\nis when I connected to the web server,\nthe web server said here's my certificate.\n\n399\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.280\nHere's my digital driver's license,\nif you will.\n\n400\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.500\nSo you can prove I am who I say I am.\n\n401\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.645\nWe can actually see some of that\ninformation and it lets me know your\n\n402\n00:19:26.645 --> 00:19:29.576\ninformation is private when\nit's sent to this site, right?\n\n403\n00:19:29.576 --> 00:19:33.726\nIt's the way that we can keep,\nnot only authentication but\n\n404\n00:19:33.726 --> 00:19:39.210\nmake it more stronger but it allows us\nto do encryption between two end points.\n\n405\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.495\nSo, certificate based authentication\nis a very good thing.\n\n406\n00:19:44.495 --> 00:19:50.096\nAgain, you end up having to put\na lot of infrastructure in place.\n\n407\n00:19:50.096 --> 00:19:53.626\nIn fact, let me go ahead and see if we can\nlook at some of the security information\n\n408\n00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:55.760\non this certificate here real quick.\n\n409\n00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.370\nOkay.\nSo, notice it says its\n\n410\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.790\na valid certificate, right?\n\n411\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.810\nAnd if I view the certificate,\nwe can see that this was issued to Google.\n\n412\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.020\nAnd if Google server is presenting\nthis back to my web browser,\n\n413\n00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.020\nit's saying here's my identifier,\nyou can trust me.\n\n414\n00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:12.990\nSo, why do we trust it?\n\n415\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.710\nWell, remember the hierarchy\nI told you about, right?\n\n416\n00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.480\nA certificate is issued to a device or\na user and\n\n417\n00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:26.330\nyou can see that this has been issued\nto google.com by an issuing CA.\n\n418\n00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.230\nNow this is interesting\nbecause Google is so big,\n\n419\n00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.990\nthat they're also a subordinate CA.\n\n420\n00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.780\nSo they've issued their own certificate,\n\n421\n00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.440\nbut their certificate was\nendorsed by the root CA.\n\n422\n00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.130\nAnd these are some of the roots CAs that\nyou can see out there on the Internet.\n\n423\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.760\nAnd the roots CAs are essentially\npublic entities, they're businesses.\n\n424\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.231\nThey issue certificates to other CAs,\nif you will.\n\n425\n00:20:49.231 --> 00:20:54.140\nIn this case, if they're a subordinate CA,\nsecond in that chain, they'll issue it\n\n426\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:59.900\nto servers or identities, and again,\nthat's part of that public key hierarchy.\n\n427\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.950\nKeep in mind that these companies, again,\n\n428\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.290\nare publicly endorsed and\nit's all based on a trust model.\n\n429\n00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.281\nSo that's a little bit about\ncertificate authentication,\n\n430\n00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:13.031\ncertificate based authentication,\nI do want you to know just for the exam,\n\n431\n00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:15.846\nif you're gonna do certificate\nbased authentication,\n\n432\n00:21:15.846 --> 00:21:18.680\nthe authentication mechanism\nthat you use is EAP-TLS.\n\n433\n00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.706\nThat's the Extensible Authentication\nProtocol with Transport Layer Security.\n\n434\n00:21:22.706 --> 00:21:26.699\nAs you go on a more advanced training, you\nmight learn a little bit more about that,\n\n435\n00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:30.353\nbut know that that's the way you do\ncertificate-based authentication out\n\n436\n00:21:30.353 --> 00:21:33.172\nthere when we're talking\nabout mutual authentication.\n\n437\n00:21:33.172 --> 00:21:34.833\nAnd that's something that\nwe should mention too.\n\n438\n00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.610\nMutual authentication is both parties,\nright?\n\n439\n00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.850\nIt's not single-ended authentication,\nright?\n\n440\n00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.980\nThat's me saying Zach, here's who I am and\nI present Zach with my driver's license.\n\n441\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.170\nWell, Zach says, now I know who you are.\n\n442\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.150\nHere, let me present you\nwith my driver's license.\n\n443\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.090\nAnd we kinda now both\nknow who each other are.\n\n444\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.060\nThat's mutual authentication and it works\non both sides of that communication.\n\n445\n00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.570\n&gt;&gt; And then I keep Wes's driver's\nlicense because, why not.\n\n446\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, because I've\nspend a lot of your money through this\n\n447\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.450\nepisode on your credit cards, right?\n\n448\n00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n449\n00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.460\nTit for tat there.\n\n450\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.800\n&gt;&gt; That's right, all right.\n\n451\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.140\nSo a couple of the other things that\nwe wanna just kind of round off here.\n\n452\n00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.180\nWe talked about the accounting part.\n\n453\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.250\nThe accounting part is where we get\nauditing, and auditing and logging.\n\n454\n00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.060\nLogging is actually\nthe result of auditing,\n\n455\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.540\nAuditing is tracking those system-wide\nactivities that produces logs, and\n\n456\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.250\nthen we can go back and we can scrutinize\nthe logs for just being able to track what\n\n457\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.130\npeople are doing within your networks or\non your devices.\n\n458\n00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:37.220\nIn fact, I can kinda show you that if we\ndive down into our Windows 10 machine\n\n459\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.980\nhere, and we go back to Event Viewer, I'm\njust right-clicking on the Windows charm,\n\n460\n00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.950\nif I go to Event Viewer, and\nwe pull up Event Viewer.\n\n461\n00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.260\nYou're gonna see that Windows,\nby default, has some logs.\n\n462\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.430\nAnd one of the logs that we have is\nthe security log right here, and\n\n463\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.470\nthis security log is how we're\nactually tracking events.\n\n464\n00:22:55.470 --> 00:23:02.040\nAnd they're certain events, by default,\nthat are tracked, and some that are not.\n\n465\n00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.280\nBut you can always adjust this too.\n\n466\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.540\nBut notice we have the auditing going on.\n\n467\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.810\nSo audit success produced this log.\n\n468\n00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.310\nIt says the account was\nsuccessfully logged on, right.\n\n469\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.630\nSo the accounting,\nwe're auditing is tracking, right?\n\n470\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.525\nThe logs are what we can go back and\nscrutinize as a,\n\n471\n00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:26.600\nthe after effect if you will, of auditing.\n\n472\n00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.310\nRight now.\n\n473\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.810\nI will tell you be careful with auditing,\n\n474\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.870\nbecause you might say well why\ndon't we just track everything?\n\n475\n00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.213\nWell, you can track everything, but if\nyou're not gonna be scrutinizing the logs,\n\n476\n00:23:36.213 --> 00:23:39.350\nyou really shouldn't be,\nbecause in auditing everything,\n\n477\n00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.727\nyou can actually use up\na lot of storage space.\n\n478\n00:23:41.727 --> 00:23:42.297\n&gt;&gt; I imagine you could.\n\n479\n00:23:42.297 --> 00:23:43.820\n&gt;&gt; And it could cause performance issues.\n\n480\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:50.336\nIf you're not going to Check the logs,\ndon’t audit it, right?\n\n481\n00:23:50.336 --> 00:23:52.670\nSo just make sure you don’t\nwant to audit everything.\n\n482\n00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.515\nJust audit the information specifically\nthat you’re going to check the logs for,\n\n483\n00:23:56.515 --> 00:23:57.570\nyeah that is important.\n\n484\n00:23:58.678 --> 00:24:02.820\nAll right, so a couple of the last\nthings that I kinda need to talk about,\n\n485\n00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.010\nI need to talk about what is known\nas a captive portal, all right?\n\n486\n00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:10.430\nCaptive portal is a great way to\nstop somebody from just getting\n\n487\n00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.900\ninstant public access.\n\n488\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.416\nYou see this a lot of times in hotels and\nstuff, and public hot spots, right?\n\n489\n00:24:16.416 --> 00:24:19.270\nLike a Wi-Fi hot spot, where they've\ngot a coffee shop, if you will,\n\n490\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.330\nthat's going to allow you free and\npublic access.\n\n491\n00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:25.990\nLet me go ahead and show you, I'm up\nhere on Wikimedia, Wiki commons here.\n\n492\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:29.340\nAnd you've probably seen one of these\nbefore if you've ever been to a hotel\n\n493\n00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.330\nwhere they say, hey, you get free Wi-Fi,\nbut we'll give you a hotel user name,\n\n494\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.520\nor a user name and\npassword a lot of times.\n\n495\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.970\nUser name will just be your room number\nand whatever password they might have or\n\n496\n00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.680\nmaybe even an access code.\n\n497\n00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.809\nAnd then what they do is they tell you,\nhey, you've got an AUP, right?\n\n498\n00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:49.663\nAn acceptable use policy that says, hey,\nif you're gonna connect to this network,\n\n499\n00:24:49.663 --> 00:24:52.552\nguess what, you have certain things\nthat you need to abide by for\n\n500\n00:24:52.552 --> 00:24:54.556\nthe acceptable use of our network, right?\n\n501\n00:24:54.556 --> 00:24:55.360\nThat's a captive portal.\n\n502\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.050\nWhat it means is that, yeah, we're gonna\nallow potential public access to this\n\n503\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.800\nnetwork, but you're gonna have to come and\nget some information for us.\n\n504\n00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.870\nWe're not going to just allow free\nrun-of-the-mill and anybody can access it.\n\n505\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.625\nThat's captive portal.\n\n506\n00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:10.860\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n507\n00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.740\nThe other thing that we also have to\nmention are some authentication factors\n\n508\n00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.050\nbecause we really haven't,\nwe talked about authentication but\n\n509\n00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.020\nwe really haven't talked about\nthe authentication factors, all right?\n\n510\n00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.770\nAnd these are the authentication factors.\n\n511\n00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.915\nI've got a little diagram here.\n\n512\n00:25:22.915 --> 00:25:25.460\nAnd the ones that you need to know for\nthe exam, right?\n\n513\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.590\nNow, the most common ones\nare these three right here.\n\n514\n00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.360\nAll right,\nthese long have been the common ones.\n\n515\n00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.790\nSomething you know, something you have,\nand something you are.\n\n516\n00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.880\nAll right, let's stop right there and\ntalk about those and\n\n517\n00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.550\nthen we'll come back to these that\nare a little bit newer, right?\n\n518\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.690\nSomething you know,\na username and password, right?\n\n519\n00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.130\nThat's an authentication factor that you\nprobably use almost on a daily basis.\n\n520\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.301\nUsername and password, a PIN,\nPersonal Identification Number.\n\n521\n00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:52.300\nIf you've ever logged into your phone with\na four digit code, it's a PIN, right?\n\n522\n00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.540\nThat's something you know.\n\n523\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.530\nA security question, right?\n\n524\n00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.410\nIf you've ever been challenged\nwith a security question.\n\n525\n00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.520\nWhat's your mother's maiden name?\n\n526\n00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.020\nWhat's your favorite pet?\n\n527\n00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.170\nWhat high school did you go to?\n\n528\n00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.420\nWhat, I don't know,\ncity did you meet your spouse?\n\n529\n00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.480\nThese are all things you know, right?\n\n530\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.670\nThat’s one of the authentication factors.\n\n531\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.450\nThe next one is,\nsomething you have, all right?\n\n532\n00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:13.460\nWhen we talk about something you have,\nwell, we’ve talked kind of about them,\n\n533\n00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.460\nI’ve been picking on Zach\nabout his ID badge for a bit.\n\n534\n00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.350\nWell this is something you have, right?\n\n535\n00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.000\nThis is a card,\nit’s something that you possess, right?\n\n536\n00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.110\nIt could be a card, it could be a key fob,\nthat is something you have.\n\n537\n00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.170\nNow, something you are boils down to\nreally one thing, that's biometrics.\n\n538\n00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:29.740\nSomething you are.\n\n539\n00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.350\nSome physical characteristic of yourself.\n\n540\n00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.150\nLike voice recognition system,\nfingerprint, scanner,\n\n541\n00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:39.400\nhand geometry scanner, retinal scanner,\nif you will, maybe even more.\n\n542\n00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.904\nRetinal scanners, now we're now\ntalking about some fancy technology.\n\n543\n00:26:42.904 --> 00:26:45.840\nEven iris scanners, likewise, too.\n\n544\n00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.860\nAgain, biometrics is something you are.\n\n545\n00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.670\nNow if you have ever heard of the term\ngeolocation and geofencing, right?\n\n546\n00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.620\nGeofencing is,\n\n547\n00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.101\nI could provide someone a level of access\nbased on where they are located, right?\n\n548\n00:26:58.101 --> 00:27:01.420\nSo if you’re within our networks\nyou have this set of access,\n\n549\n00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.360\nright, this set of authorization.\n\n550\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.010\nYou move outside of that, somewhere you\nare, move outside of that location,\n\n551\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.560\nnow you have this level of access or\nno access at all, right?\n\n552\n00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.670\nThat's somewhere you are.\n\n553\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.360\nThe last one here that we've in\nthe list is something you do.\n\n554\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.130\nAnd again, this wasn't one that is newer.\n\n555\n00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.750\nAnd I say just newer in relationship\nto the CompTIA exams, right?\n\n556\n00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.710\nThe first three are the most common,\nright?\n\n557\n00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.370\nSomething you do is keystroke patterns,\nright?\n\n558\n00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.523\nAll they'd have to do is look at me and\nhow many times I hit the delete button or\n\n559\n00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:33.525\nthe backspace button.\n\n560\n00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:35.503\nThat's like my electronic whiteout, right?\n\n561\n00:27:35.503 --> 00:27:38.305\nBecause I can't spell worth a darn.\n\n562\n00:27:38.305 --> 00:27:41.210\nHere's another one that and\nyou'll probably see this and\n\n563\n00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.646\nI'm just kind of guessing here,\ngait, right?\n\n564\n00:27:43.646 --> 00:27:44.910\nHow you walk.\n\n565\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.357\nThat's kind of interesting too.\n\n566\n00:27:46.357 --> 00:27:51.540\nLooking at gate like how you stride,\nright, and that can authenticate you.\n\n567\n00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.680\nSo something you do is some action that\nyou perform that uniquely identifies you.\n\n568\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.360\nThese are authentication factors.\n\n569\n00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.510\nNow, I also want you to know what\na multi-factor authentication is, and\n\n570\n00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:07.330\nit is more than one of any\nof these factors, all right?\n\n571\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.910\nSomething you know with\nsomething you have.\n\n572\n00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.390\nI got my key card and I've got a PIN.\n\n573\n00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.696\nI've gotta enter the PIN, the Personal\nIdentification Number or a password and\n\n574\n00:28:15.696 --> 00:28:16.828\nI've gotta swipe my card.\n\n575\n00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:21.200\nIt's multi-factored, combine something I\nknow with something I have, all right?\n\n576\n00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.210\nOr I've got a key fob or a key card.\n\n577\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.770\nI swipe it across an electronic lock and\nthen I turn around and\n\n578\n00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.410\nI put my finger on the finger\nprint scanner, right?\n\n579\n00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.630\nThat's combining something you\nhave with something you are.\n\n580\n00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.455\nThat's multi-factor, all right?\n\n581\n00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:38.337\nMaybe it's geolocation and\na password, all right?\n\n582\n00:28:38.337 --> 00:28:41.705\nNow you're in the building,\nthat's somewhere you are.\n\n583\n00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:42.945\nGo ahead and enter your password.\n\n584\n00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:46.155\nYou still have to authenticate because we\ndon't somebody that just stole your device\n\n585\n00:28:46.155 --> 00:28:47.195\nto walk into the building.\n\n586\n00:28:47.195 --> 00:28:51.325\nAnd now that they're located inside of\nthe building, they gain access, right?\n\n587\n00:28:51.325 --> 00:28:53.380\nThat wouldn't really be safe.\n\n588\n00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.464\nSo what do we do?\n\n589\n00:28:54.464 --> 00:28:55.956\nYour phone's locked with a PIN and\n\n590\n00:28:55.956 --> 00:28:58.590\nyou have to be inside of\nthe building to gain access, right?\n\n591\n00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:03.150\nNow, we have something you know with the\nPIN, and the location, somewhere you are.\n\n592\n00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.110\nIt's multi-factor authentication.\n\n593\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.757\nSometimes you'll hear\nit called one factor,\n\n594\n00:29:06.757 --> 00:29:10.040\nwhich isn't multi-factored,\nit's just any one of these.\n\n595\n00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.010\nTwo, three, and even four factor\nauthentication, now that we've got so\n\n596\n00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.150\nmany options.\n\n597\n00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.130\nThese are some of the things\nthat I would keep in mind.\n\n598\n00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.240\nA couple of the other things that they\ntalk about are more generic terms, for\n\n599\n00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.210\ninstance, Network Access Control.\n\n600\n00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.900\nNetwork Access Control is really\njust a set of policies, procedures,\n\n601\n00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.840\nand technologies that you put together\nin order to govern what devices and\n\n602\n00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.880\nwhat level of access people\nhave on into your network.\n\n603\n00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.700\nYou have, for instance, inside of the\nserver, Windows Server operating system.\n\n604\n00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.840\nYou had Network Access Protection, that\nhad a lot of components in it, that would.\n\n605\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.080\nYou'd have a health\nregistration authority and\n\n606\n00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.050\nwhen your computer joined to a network,\nfirst thing that would happen,\n\n607\n00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.560\nis it would take a system\nhealth validator,\n\n608\n00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.860\nlike is your firewall on,\nare your Windows updates installed?\n\n609\n00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.970\nAnd you would take that\nstatement of health,\n\n610\n00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.570\nright, and you'd hand it off to a health\nregistration authority and inspect it and\n\n611\n00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.940\nsay, all right policy says,\nyou have to have your firewall turned on,\n\n612\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.670\nyou have to have antivirus software turned\non, you have to have your updates done.\n\n613\n00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.400\nIf you meet the health requirement\nbased on your statement of health,\n\n614\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.880\nthen you gain access to the network.\n\n615\n00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.740\nIn fact,\nlet me show you what I mean here, right?\n\n616\n00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.430\nAnd then if you don't,\n\n617\n00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.620\nif you hand off that information, you\ngot a remote access client, if you will,\n\n618\n00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.500\nhands off that information to\nthe Health Registration Authority and\n\n619\n00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.240\nsays, all right, well, I see that you\nhave a valid statement of health.\n\n620\n00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.230\nLet's check against the policy server and\nsay,\n\n621\n00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.470\nnow that we know that you're okay,\nwhat can you do?\n\n622\n00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.890\nAnd they couple this in with\nthings like Active Directory.\n\n623\n00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.480\nAnd if you meet the policy that the server\nstates, required by the administrator,\n\n624\n00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.830\nthen you gain access to\nthe resource server.\n\n625\n00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.880\nIf you don't meet the health policy,\n\n626\n00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.740\nthen what they do is they put\nyou onto an isolation network.\n\n627\n00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.840\nAnd that isolation network is\nwhere we have some kind of\n\n628\n00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.510\nremediation server that says,\nyou're not up to date, but guess what?\n\n629\n00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.600\nWe got a WSUS server that's in\nthe isolation network that will allow you\n\n630\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.050\nto update your computer.\n\n631\n00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.270\nAnd when it's updated,\n\n632\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.950\njust pass your statement of health back\noff to the registration authority.\n\n633\n00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.192\nWe go through this process again.\n\n634\n00:31:09.192 --> 00:31:14.105\nIf you've met the network policy, now\nyou gain access to the resources, right?\n\n635\n00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:18.165\nYou also have CISCO has network access\ncontrol too, but again generically,\n\n636\n00:31:18.165 --> 00:31:20.755\nnetwork access control are those\ntechnologies, policies and\n\n637\n00:31:20.755 --> 00:31:25.245\nprocedures that you implement in order\nto govern and control what users or\n\n638\n00:31:25.245 --> 00:31:28.810\ndevices have access to your network.\n\n639\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.415\nLast but not the least,\naccess control list.\n\n640\n00:31:31.415 --> 00:31:33.390\nWe've already talked about\nthese in other episodes.\n\n641\n00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.623\nKeep in mind an ACL is just\na way that you can govern,\n\n642\n00:31:37.623 --> 00:31:42.653\nbased on identity,\nwhat level of access that somebody has.\n\n643\n00:31:42.653 --> 00:31:45.950\nMAC filtering, we've talked about\nMAC filtering in other episodes too.\n\n644\n00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.640\nKeep in mind this is just a list of\napproved, or allowed, or denied MAC\n\n645\n00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.800\naddresses to computers that are allowed\nagain or denied access to your network.\n\n646\n00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.528\nPort security,\nwe've seen some examples of it, right,\n\n647\n00:31:58.528 --> 00:32:00.830\n802.1X port based authentication.\n\n648\n00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:05.257\nAs well as port security based on a MAC\naddress too where the switch says, hey,\n\n649\n00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:09.550\nI only expect to see a source MAC address\ncoming from this computer that I know\n\n650\n00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.055\nis authorized to be\nconnected to that port.\n\n651\n00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:15.736\nif I see any other Mac address,\nsending information on that port,\n\n652\n00:32:15.736 --> 00:32:18.250\nwe close it down,\nno access for that device.\n\n653\n00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.050\nSo few of the different things\nthat I would be aware of when it\n\n654\n00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:21.870\ncomes to this exam.\n\n655\n00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.334\nSo if they ask you about things\nlike RADIUS and TACACS plus,\n\n656\n00:32:25.334 --> 00:32:27.250\nyou're gonna be doing well.\n\n657\n00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.260\nKnow the ports, know the technologies for\nthe next time you sit the Net Plus exam.\n\n658\n00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, authentication and\naccess control, part two.\n\n659\n00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.775\nThere was a part one,\nmake sure you watch them both.\n\n660\n00:32:35.775 --> 00:32:37.180\nWes is doing a wonderful job, and\n\n661\n00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.190\nhe's done a great job putting together\nthe CompTOIA Net Plus series of videos.\n\n662\n00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.140\nMake sure you watch all of them,\n\n663\n00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.720\nand when you're in that course library,\nthere's all kinds of other videos there.\n\n664\n00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.760\nAnd they're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n665\n00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.799\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n666\n00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:52.690\nITProTV is binge-worthy.\n\n667\n00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.110\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n668\n00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n669\n00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.165\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you very soon.\n\n670\n00:32:57.732 --> 00:33:03.650\n[MUSIC]\n\n671\n00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.607\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.670\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.890\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n5\n00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.050\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.990\nAs we continue on with compt and net+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.770\nIn this episode,\nbasic wireless network security.\n\n8\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.510\nI want to hear about this.\n\n9\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.770\nI know you do too and\nWes Bryan is gonna help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.650\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.180\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, great to see you too.\n\n12\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.200\nThat's right, good to be back and\nthat's right.\n\n13\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.520\nWe are moving into well,\nsome basic wireless security.\n\n14\n00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.070\nLike Zach already said, we will dive\nright into the technologies that\n\n15\n00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.930\nwe need to be aware of to help secure,\nwell, those unbounded networks, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.890\nAnd you might say well, why do we\nneed security in wireless networks?\n\n17\n00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.220\nWell, it's exactly that.\n\n18\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.590\nIf you think about it, with a physical,\nbounded media, right, transmission media.\n\n19\n00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.790\nIn order to gain access to it you have\nto physically plug into the network and\n\n20\n00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.930\nthat's certainly not to say\nthat it's impossible but\n\n21\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740\nit's where we get that\nterm wiretapping from.\n\n22\n00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.290\nMaybe not so easy on our fiber optic\nnetworks because of the fact what it\n\n23\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.090\ntakes to terminate a fiber optic cable,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.610\nBut with Copper Networks, right?\n\n25\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.650\nOur twisted pair implementations,\ncut the cable, put an RJ-45 jack on it,\n\n26\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.250\nslap it right into the network adapter and\nnow you're in, right?\n\n27\n00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.302\nAnd I know it's not quite that easy, but\n\n28\n00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:30.340\na lot easier when you're talking about\nwireless communication and why is that?\n\n29\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.450\nWell we have radios, right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.600\nWe have antennas if you will,\nthey're giving off a signal.\n\n31\n00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.650\nAll we have to do, is we gotta\nbe in proximity of that signal,\n\n32\n00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.300\nin order to gain access to it and\nif the data isn't secure.\n\n33\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.720\nWell, then we could\ngain access to the data\n\n34\n00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.190\nthat's traversing that network as well.\n\n35\n00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.240\nSo we're gonna talk up a little\nbit about some of the different,\n\n36\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.590\nwireless Encryption technologies and\n\n37\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.200\nsome of the components that\nare surrounding them here in this episode.\n\n38\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.720\nAll right so let's go ahead and I'm gonna\nmention one, in fact let's look at some of\n\n39\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.710\nthe cryptographic protocols that we\nhave here for wireless communications.\n\n40\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.350\nNow I will tell you ladies and\n\n41\n00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.090\ngentlemen one that isn't on the exam is\nthe very first one on the list, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.830\nI went ahead and decided that it would be\nbeneficial to our viewers, whether this is\n\n43\n00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.000\non the exam or not, it would be beneficial\nto our users to put it within the list.\n\n44\n00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.200\nThe reason I say that is I do believe\nthat it's good to know where the wireless\n\n45\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.010\nsecurities technologies has come from\nto kinda give you that timeline of\n\n46\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.790\nwhere we are now.\n\n47\n00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.440\nAnd the very first one on the list\nis what's know as WEP, all right?\n\n48\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.950\nNow, WEP we kinda wanna stay away from,\nall right?\n\n49\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.210\nThere's a reason maybe that it's\nnot in the objectives anymore but\n\n50\n00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.410\nwe wanna raise awareness nonetheless,\nokay?\n\n51\n00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.440\nWEP is called Wired Equivalent Privacy,\nalright?\n\n52\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.650\nNow when we talk about\nWired Equivalent Privacy,\n\n53\n00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.720\nremember what I said\nwhen we started the show?\n\n54\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.690\nI said when you have a wireless network,\nright?\n\n55\n00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.360\nIn order to gain access to that network or\na wired network.\n\n56\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.158\nWhen you have a wired network, in order\nto gain access to that wired network\n\n57\n00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:06.748\nyou have to be able to physically\nplug into the network.\n\n58\n00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:12.023\nWhen wireless networks first came out,\nsome of the very first 802.11 protocols,\n\n59\n00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:16.802\na and b, when they were released back\nin 1999, understand that if we didn't\n\n60\n00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:21.233\nhave security, people could get to\nthe proximity of a wireless network and\n\n61\n00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.275\nif they did some manipulations to\ntheir network adapters, right.\n\n62\n00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.420\nThey put it in ad hoc mode or\npromiscuous mode,\n\n63\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.240\nthey could start to read all\nthe information coming off that network.\n\n64\n00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.010\nAll right, so the IEEE and a consortium\nof people called the Wi-Fi Alliance,\n\n65\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.910\nwhich is basically a consortium\nof wireless manufacturers that\n\n66\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.080\npromote their standards and\nspecifications, said you know what?\n\n67\n00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.475\nWe need to put some basic level\nsecurity on wireless network.\n\n68\n00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:48.810\nSo they came out with WEP.\n\n69\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.658\nAgain, Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n70\n00:03:50.658 --> 00:03:55.760\nNow you gotta understand that you don't\nreally have privacy on a wired network.\n\n71\n00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.040\nThe only way you have privacy on\na network is to make sure that, like\n\n72\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.170\nwe've talked about, you have encryption\nprotocols that encrypt the communications\n\n73\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.580\nas they transverse the network\nbetween the source and destination.\n\n74\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.890\nSo essentially what wire equivalent\nprivacy did when it came out,\n\n75\n00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.040\nagain we're talking about released\nas a security standard back in 1999,\n\n76\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.330\nis it basically pulled the blinds\ndown right, in the living room.\n\n77\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.630\nI want you to think about that.\n\n78\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.270\nWhat I mean by that is imagine if\nsomebody's just walking their dog at night\n\n79\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.910\noutside of your house, and\nyou have all the windows open.\n\n80\n00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.110\nPeople can see in but if you take\nthe blinds and you just close them up.\n\n81\n00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.530\nYou close the windows down.\n\n82\n00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.640\nIt's not so easy to see what's\ngoing on in your network.\n\n83\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.300\nHowever, for a trained professional,\nlike a professional thief, if you will.\n\n84\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.300\nWhat are those blinds,\n\n85\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.420\nwhat are shutting those windows going\nto do for the professional thief?\n\n86\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.800\nNot much.\n\n87\n00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.203\nAnd that is the problem right there\nwith wired equivalent privacy.\n\n88\n00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:57.070\nAll right,\nWEP gives you that wired privacy of\n\n89\n00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.490\nI at least have to plug into the network,\nbut it doesn't go far enough.\n\n90\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.330\nIn fact, the initial release, at the time\nthat it was released to the public was\n\n91\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.580\nonly 64 bit encryption, and\neven in those days when it first came out\n\n92\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.510\neven given the computational power of\ncomputers that wasn't very strong.\n\n93\n00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.760\nThere were some issues with\nthe government there, and\n\n94\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.860\nit wasn't until later revisions that they\nwould bump up the key length, right?\n\n95\n00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.080\nRemember what a key is.\n\n96\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.930\nWe'll talk more about encryption and\nstuff in other episodes but\n\n97\n00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.920\nwe're talking about it enough.\n\n98\n00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.743\nJust remember encryption, that's\na mathematical operation that we apply to\n\n99\n00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:33.760\nthe data that makes sure that\nit's scrambled all right?\n\n100\n00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.630\nThe other thing I want you to understand\nis that the encryption algorithm\n\n101\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.680\nagain is just that mathematical operation.\n\n102\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.640\nHowever we make it unique to you and\nI right?\n\n103\n00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.530\nI can tell you 1 + 1 = 2 all right?\n\n104\n00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.260\nThat would be the encryption algorithm.\n\n105\n00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.500\nNow they're a lot more\nadvanced than that but,\n\n106\n00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.090\nif I say 1+1 is 2 and then you're\ngonna multiply that times 3 and\n\n107\n00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.890\nput a square, exponential on it,\nand that's the key.\n\n108\n00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.200\nThat makes that mathematical operation\nunique now to you and I, right.\n\n109\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.210\nSomebody's not gonna understand how\n1+1 equals some crazy long number.\n\n110\n00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.880\nThey're gonna say well wait a second,\nwhat kind of math are you doing?\n\n111\n00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.720\nWell, that's because we applied a modifier\nto it and that's what the keys do.\n\n112\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.470\nThe greater the modifier,\nthe greater the key if you will,\n\n113\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:25.090\nlength in bits makes it a greater\ncomplexity to try to break that key.\n\n114\n00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.770\nWell, with 64 bits, that wasn't much.\n\n115\n00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.460\nThe other problem is agin once\nit bumped up to 128 and 256,\n\n116\n00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.730\ncomputers started to get stronger and\nstronger and\n\n117\n00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.800\neven on 128 bit which was the most common\nand widely used deployment in WEEP.\n\n118\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.930\nBy the end of 2005 the FBI had\nproof of concept that WEP was weak.\n\n119\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.650\nThey could break a WEP encryption\nkey in about two minutes.\n\n120\n00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.190\nAll right so WEP I want you to understand\nwas the initial security release.\n\n121\n00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.170\nIt was never meant to be\na one size fits all and\n\n122\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.080\na stop gap for everything that\nwould need security in general.\n\n123\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.860\nSo we had to move away from it and,\n\n124\n00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.065\neventually, WEP became\na thing of the past.\n\n125\n00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Does anyone ever still use WEP?\n\n126\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, some people, I've asked before.\n\n127\n00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.350\nSometimes you need due diligence and\npeople don't really care about how secret\n\n128\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.760\nthe information is, so they're not\nnecessarily doing it to be secretive.\n\n129\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.700\nBut they're just doing it to,\nagain pull the blinds down so\n\n130\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.810\nsomebody walking past the street\ncan't casually look in, right?\n\n131\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.260\n&gt;&gt; That's a great analogy.\n\n132\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.450\n&gt;&gt; It's not done for the purposes\nof keeping your data confidential,\n\n133\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.660\nit's just keeping the average\nperson off the network.\n\n134\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.050\nHowever-\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n135\n00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.910\n&gt;&gt; It certainly isn't going to stop\nanybody from getting into their\n\n136\n00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.730\nnetwork, all right?\n\n137\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.820\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nsome of these things coming up as well.\n\n138\n00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.970\nSo in 2003 interestingly before WEP\nwas officially even retired, right?\n\n139\n00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.112\nIt was that important.\n\n140\n00:07:50.112 --> 00:07:53.520\nBefore WEP was officially retired in 2003,\n\n141\n00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.767\nthe Wi-Fi Alliance would go to\nthe IEEE and they'd say hey.\n\n142\n00:07:57.767 --> 00:07:59.190\nWe need the next standard.\n\n143\n00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.623\nThis WEP is horrible.\n\n144\n00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:05.374\nI mean, it's gonna cause some problems or\nit already has caused some problems.\n\n145\n00:08:05.374 --> 00:08:09.290\nSo the IEEE was working on the next\nstandard, the next encryption protocol,\n\n146\n00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.650\nbut they hadn't completely\nfinished it yet.\n\n147\n00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.890\nSo they're like, okay, we'll give you\na subset of the features right now,\n\n148\n00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.250\nwhat we have,\ncuz it's a lot better than the WEP.\n\n149\n00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.268\nAnd the Wi-Fi Alliance promotes it and\n\n150\n00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:23.130\npushes it out under the name\nWi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n151\n00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.696\nIn fact, in our list here that's\nthe second one on the list WPA.\n\n152\n00:08:26.696 --> 00:08:30.990\nAll right, now Wi-Fi protected access,\nthis would do some interesting things.\n\n153\n00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.812\nThis would couple in message\nintegrity checks for every frame.\n\n154\n00:08:34.812 --> 00:08:36.095\nI'm gonna call it a data packet.\n\n155\n00:08:36.095 --> 00:08:39.350\nWe'll talk about protocol data units\nin another episode cuz technically,\n\n156\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.970\nhere at 802.11 we are talking frames.\n\n157\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.566\nBut just generically I'm\nsaying data packet, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:50.700\nWhat WPA would do is it would introduce\nmessage integrity checks, right?\n\n159\n00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.754\nThese message authentication\ncodes that said hey,\n\n160\n00:08:54.754 --> 00:08:59.645\ncan we determine if a frame has\nbeen maliciously manipulated?\n\n161\n00:08:59.645 --> 00:09:01.083\nBoy, I couldn't say that ten times.\n\n162\n00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:01.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, if\n\n163\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.060\nit's been altered, all right.\n\n164\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.500\nIf it's been altered, then we can\ndetect that, we discard it, all right.\n\n165\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.960\nThe other thing that would be a major\nadvancement over a static WEP key.\n\n166\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.910\nSee WEP, one of the problems that it had\nis the encryption keys it would use,\n\n167\n00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.900\nthey weren't ephemeral.\n\n168\n00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.390\nThey weren't temporal.\n\n169\n00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:26.541\nAnd any key that never\nchanges gives an attacker\n\n170\n00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:31.531\nall the time they need to try\nto figure out how to break in.\n\n171\n00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.520\nBut if we can take that WEP key,\nall right, or that WEP protocol.\n\n172\n00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.390\nIt used a stream cypher\ncalled RC4 Rivest code, or\n\n173\n00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.340\na Ron's code, RC4 stream cypher,\nwhich was weak in of itself.\n\n174\n00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.710\nWe don't really use it much anymore\nat all because it's also been broken.\n\n175\n00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:53.050\nSo what they said is let's use\nthe existing WEP architecture and\n\n176\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.360\nwe'll put a wrapper around it, all right.\n\n177\n00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.791\nAnd that wrapper was something known as,\nand it's in the list here and I'm gonna go\n\n178\n00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:03.924\nahead and kinda of jump out of the list\nbecause it's directly related to WPA.\n\n179\n00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:06.070\nSomething known as TKIP, all right?\n\n180\n00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.880\nTKIP is called\nthe Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n181\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.720\nSo the theory was if we use\nunderlying WEP architecture,\n\n182\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.650\nit's a couple of things,\nthen existing devices can be upgraded.\n\n183\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.260\nWe don't have to change the hardware,\nbut at the same time, if we can make\n\n184\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.300\nevery single frame or data packet\nthat goes across a wireless network,\n\n185\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.730\ngive it its own unique encryption key,\ntemporal, right, ephemeral.\n\n186\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.140\nIt's only gonna be temporary.\n\n187\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.860\nEvery data frame will have a unique key,\n\n188\n00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.500\nthen it's gonna constantly change right,\nthat's the temporal part.\n\n189\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.390\nKey integrity is that it changes,\nand if Zach happened,\n\n190\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.780\nI'm gonna pick on you here, Zach.\n\n191\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.990\nZach has his black hat on, and\nhe's trying to attack the network,\n\n192\n00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.600\nsure, he gains the first key.\n\n193\n00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.630\nIn fact let me show you here.\n\n194\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.470\nI've got a little diagram, right?\n\n195\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.370\nWe'll come back to a little bit more\nto WEP here in a bit, but TKIP-WPA.\n\n196\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.520\nSo it takes that WEP protocol and\nthat RC4 stream cipher.\n\n197\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.270\nAnd it says, let's wrap it into a new key.\n\n198\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.617\nAnd then we'll use another key and\nthen we'll use another key and so\n\n199\n00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:08.950\non and so forth.\n\n200\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.822\nAll right, and then over time\nthe thought process is you might gain\n\n201\n00:11:13.822 --> 00:11:16.608\naccess to the very first key, maybe.\n\n202\n00:11:16.608 --> 00:11:18.968\nAnd if you gain access to\nthe first key I don't really care.\n\n203\n00:11:18.968 --> 00:11:22.445\nWhy, because the next data packet\nthat comes across is gonna\n\n204\n00:11:22.445 --> 00:11:26.481\nhave a completely different key,\nand we keep running through those.\n\n205\n00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:29.917\nAll right, so it has a rekeying\nalgorithm in it, all right.\n\n206\n00:11:29.917 --> 00:11:34.074\nAnd that was one of\nthe great things about WPA.\n\n207\n00:11:34.074 --> 00:11:39.950\nIt was a major advancement over the WEP\nprotocol, but it still had flaws.\n\n208\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:46.225\nAnd one of the flaws that it had, is this\nvery weak RC4 stream cypher, all right?\n\n209\n00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:50.168\nNow what would end up happening was,\nin 2006,\n\n210\n00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:55.520\nthey would say, we need to get\naway from this RC stream cycling.\n\n211\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:01.608\nWe need access to advanced\nencryption algorithms, all right?\n\n212\n00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:09.700\nWell, that's where finally the IEEE would\nstandardize the next security standard.\n\n213\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.084\nNow when the IEEE released it,\n\n214\n00:12:12.084 --> 00:12:16.768\nthey released it under\na term called 802.11i, okay?\n\n215\n00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:21.175\nBut the Wi-Fi Alliance already had\nthe marketing name of WPA when they\n\n216\n00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:23.720\nreleased WPA Wi-Fi Protected Access.\n\n217\n00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.646\nSo they said you know what?\n\n218\n00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:27.530\nAll right, Wi-Fi Alliance,\nwe're going to call it so\n\n219\n00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.070\npeople recognize it as\nthe successor to WPA.\n\n220\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.080\nWe'll call it WPA2.\n\n221\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.609\nIEEE according to the 802 standards,\njust like they've been following, and\n\n222\n00:12:36.609 --> 00:12:39.634\nmore specifically in\nwireless 802.11 standards,\n\n223\n00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.163\nwe're going to standardize\nthe specification as 802.11i.\n\n224\n00:12:43.163 --> 00:12:46.390\nI want you to know they're one and\nthe same.\n\n225\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.850\nOne's a marketing name because the Wi-Fi\nAlliance had already released a subset of\n\n226\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.040\nthe features under WPA.\n\n227\n00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.495\nThey released it under WPA2.\n\n228\n00:12:54.495 --> 00:12:58.795\nAll right, now WPA2 would introduce\nsomething completely different than\n\n229\n00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:04.190\nTKIP because TKIP was known to have its\nflaws, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.\n\n230\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:09.420\nAnd what they would introduce\nwas something known as CCMP, and\n\n231\n00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.650\nwe would do away with\nthe RC4 stream cycle.\n\n232\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.470\nIn fact, what would end up happening is\nthey would release something that would\n\n233\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:24.845\nend up having AES in the mix, all right,\nAdvanced Encryption Standard.\n\n234\n00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:27.968\nThe Advanced Encryption Standard\nright now, for those of you\n\n235\n00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:32.231\nthat maybe haven't heard about it before,\nis what the Department of Defense here in\n\n236\n00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:36.212\nthe United States, at 256-bit key link\nuse for the top secret documents.\n\n237\n00:13:36.212 --> 00:13:39.325\nIt's DOD standard for top secret,\nconfidential information.\n\n238\n00:13:39.325 --> 00:13:43.190\nSo now we're no longer\nusing a weak stream cypher.\n\n239\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:49.020\nAnd through things like CCMP,\nwe have access to AES encryption.\n\n240\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:54.140\nNow for those of you that are maybe,\nlike me and like acronyms,\n\n241\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.520\nyou don't have to know this for\nthe exam, but I will tell you it anyway.\n\n242\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.770\nCCMP, don't try to say\nthis ten times fast.\n\n243\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.480\nI'm gonna be doing good\njust trying to say it once.\n\n244\n00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.451\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because it adds a mode and\n\n245\n00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:06.140\nan authentication protocol.\n\n246\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.250\nEven though it's CCMP,\n\n247\n00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.350\njust a very little name,\nit's actually the Counter Cypher Mode with\n\n248\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.302\nBlock Chaining Message\nAuthentication Code Protocol.\n\n249\n00:14:13.302 --> 00:14:13.863\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n250\n00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:14.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely,\nit rolls right off the tongue.\n\n251\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.840\nYou don't have to know that for\nthe exam, but understand that, again,\n\n252\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.210\nit replaces the earlier TKIP, all right?\n\n253\n00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.257\nNow TKIP, I want you to understand,\nit's still in place.\n\n254\n00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:31.920\nTKIP is kept for backwards compatibility\nfor earlier devices as a fallback.\n\n255\n00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.210\nIt's not part of the WPA2 standard, but\n\n256\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.080\nthey do include it so\nthat you can use it if you need to for\n\n257\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.568\ndevices that are a little bit older,\nall right?\n\n258\n00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:47.633\nNow that takes care of some of\ncryptographic protocols that we need to be\n\n259\n00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:52.306\naware of, but the other thing that we also\nhave to be aware of is authentication and\n\n260\n00:14:52.306 --> 00:14:53.822\nauthorization, right?\n\n261\n00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:58.106\nUp until this point, we're talking about\nhow do we scramble the information, right?\n\n262\n00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:01.097\nHow do we protect that network,\nthat information that is traversing\n\n263\n00:15:01.097 --> 00:15:04.360\nthe network, if you will,\nand make it confidential?\n\n264\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.470\nBut then there are also ways\nthat we prove our identity.\n\n265\n00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.340\nWe prove that we should be on this network\nthrough authentication mechanisms.\n\n266\n00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.350\nAnd there's a few different\nkinds that we have here,\n\n267\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.550\nthat we kind of have to talk about.\n\n268\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.490\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's look at this list.\n\n269\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.970\nThe very first one is called EAP.\n\n270\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.310\nNow I want you to\nunderstand that EAP in and\n\n271\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:28.480\nof itself isn't an authentication\nmechanism, all right?\n\n272\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.030\nEAP is a framework.\n\n273\n00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:35.410\nIn fact, I want to you to think of it as\nan authentication transport framework,\n\n274\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.470\nall right?\n\n275\n00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.940\nIt allows me to pass\nauthentication information.\n\n276\n00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.669\nIt uses the characteristics\nof what we would use for\n\n277\n00:15:44.669 --> 00:15:49.278\nserial and point-to-point leaks,\nsomething known as PPP.\n\n278\n00:15:49.278 --> 00:15:53.852\nThey would take the functionality of that\nand they would make it a framework that\n\n279\n00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:57.334\nnow you can add authentication\nmechanisms to it if you want,\n\n280\n00:15:57.334 --> 00:16:01.384\nright, the various authentication\nmechanisms they call EAP types.\n\n281\n00:16:01.384 --> 00:16:03.316\nIn fact you can see some of\nthe types right here in the list.\n\n282\n00:16:03.316 --> 00:16:05.980\nYou can see EAP-FAST,\nwhich we'll get to in a second.\n\n283\n00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.690\nEAP-TLS alright.\n\n284\n00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:14.050\nSo the authentication mechanism is here in\nthe back, EAP is the framework that allows\n\n285\n00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:19.930\nus to pass that authentication\nmechanism or data over the network.\n\n286\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.060\nSo let me give you an example,\nfor instance,\n\n287\n00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.040\nHTTPS Typically today we're\nusing transport layer security.\n\n288\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.000\nWe're using certificates for\nthings like mutual authentication, but\n\n289\n00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.370\nthe transport protocol that made https\nuses, is TCP, connection oriented service.\n\n290\n00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.830\nSo I want you to think of transmitting\nthat authentication information, but\n\n291\n00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:44.130\nthe transport protocol is going to be the\nextensible authentication protocol, EAP.\n\n292\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:44.630\nAlright.\n\n293\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.100\nNow, one of the most common\n\n294\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.570\nEAPs that you see on wireless\nnetworks is something known as EPUL.\n\n295\n00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.120\nEPUL and some of these actually sound kind\nof funny like I'm making them up as I go,\n\n296\n00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.848\nbut that's actually EAP over local\narea network, or EAP over LAN.\n\n297\n00:17:01.848 --> 00:17:07.110\nAlright, now, one of the things that\n\n298\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:13.170\nEAP doesn't do, is it doesn't encrypt\nthe authentication information.\n\n299\n00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:18.390\nAlright, so there was a way and one of the\nmost common EAP flavors if you will today,\n\n300\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:24.090\nis to create a tunnel between, a secure\ntunnel, between source and end point and\n\n301\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:30.970\nsend the authentication data through\nthe authenticated tunnel, if you will.\n\n302\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.240\nAnd that is something known as PEAP.\n\n303\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.770\nAnd it's in the list here,\nsecond one on the list.\n\n304\n00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.690\nThis is Protected Extensible\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n305\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:43.240\nNow PEAP, what it does again is it's,\n\n306\n00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.790\nit allows for the secure transfer\nof that authentication data.\n\n307\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.650\nAnd it create a tunnel between\nthe pip clients if you will and\n\n308\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.490\nthe authentication server themselves.\n\n309\n00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.430\nSo its a added layer of security.\n\n310\n00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.870\nNow the next one we have in the list, so\nwe've got, so far we've talked about EAP\n\n311\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:06.086\nand protected extensible authentication\nprotocol With also have EAP-FAST.\n\n312\n00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:10.050\nNow EAP-FAST is flexible\nauthentication via secure tunneling.\n\n313\n00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.860\nIt's actually a big old long acronym\nhere and I'm gonna torture you guys.\n\n314\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.450\nExtensible Authentication Protocol,\n\n315\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.460\nFlexible Authentication authentication\nvis secure tunnelling is much faster.\n\n316\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Do that again.\n\n317\n00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.160\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not gonna try it,\nI did it once.\n\n318\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.700\nDon't make me look bad in here because I'm\ngonna, I will trip all over that next one.\n\n319\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.440\n&gt;&gt; Impressive.\n\n320\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.300\nImpressive.\n\n321\n00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.070\n&gt;&gt; So we've got two.\n\n322\n00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.410\nAnd in fact, let me kind of talk\nabout two of them at the same time.\n\n323\n00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.090\nI'm gonna talk EAEPTLS2.\n\n324\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.670\nIt kind of lets you know\nwhy we would use fast,\n\n325\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.630\nEAPTLS is one of the most common EAP\ntypes that are implemented today.\n\n326\n00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.710\nRight, transport layer security.\n\n327\n00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.920\nEssentially, think about what TLS is,\nright?\n\n328\n00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.150\nTransport layer security.we're\nusing public key cryptology, right?\n\n329\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.890\nA server's public key is what's going to\nbe used to encrypt your information and\n\n330\n00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.960\nsent back to the server.\n\n331\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.750\nThe server's gonna use it's\nprivate key to decrypt it.\n\n332\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.140\nOnly the server has the private\nkey that can decrypt the encrypted\n\n333\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.720\ninformation right?\n\n334\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.670\nNow EAP if you will is doing\npretty much the same thing right?\n\n335\n00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:16.040\nIt is using the extensible authentication\nprotocol as the transport framework\n\n336\n00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.180\nTransport TLS communications if you will.\n\n337\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.400\nIt allows for\nthings like mutual authentication, right.\n\n338\n00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.250\nAnd what's mutual authentication?\n\n339\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:29.350\nWell usually when you wanna connect to a\nserver that you wanna verify is it secure,\n\n340\n00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.440\nso let's say that I'm the server\nright here, and Zach is the client.\n\n341\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.380\nZach connects to a resource,\nwants a resource that I have.\n\n342\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.320\nThat's the server, right?\n\n343\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.390\nWell, what do I do?\n\n344\n00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.840\nI hand him my drivers license.\n\n345\n00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.750\nI hand him my digital certificate and\nI say, \"Zach, you can trust me.\n\n346\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.900\nThis is who I am.\" Right?\n\n347\n00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.090\nWell after that fact what happens is\nI say, well, you know what, Zach?\n\n348\n00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.990\nNow that I have said who I\nam why don't you prove to me\n\n349\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.970\nyou are who you say you are.\n\n350\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.060\nSo what does that do, Zach?\n\n351\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.270\nWell, I've got a certificate here.\n\n352\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.340\nHere, look at my certificate.\n\n353\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.390\nSo basically we're looking at drivers\nlicense, digital certificates.\n\n354\n00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.560\nWe're looking at each\nother's digital certificates.\n\n355\n00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.260\nWe're going through a process\nthat verifies on both ends.\n\n356\n00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:13.620\nHe is who he says he is and I'm the server\nthat I said I am, speech authentication.\n\n357\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.070\nIt also allows for\nthings like smart card authentication.\n\n358\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.790\nAnd that's a key point for\nabout EAP-TLS, for your Network+ exam.\n\n359\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:25.565\nKnow that EAP-TLS is how we do\ntoken-based smart card authentication,\n\n360\n00:20:25.565 --> 00:20:27.490\nbut here's the thing.\n\n361\n00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:34.780\nWith TLS, it requires Zach has\na certificate and I have a certificate.\n\n362\n00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.770\nEAPTLS requires that the user that's\nusing EAPTLS has a certificate,\n\n363\n00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.110\nand that the server has a certificate.\n\n364\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.160\nYou'll probably say, well, Wes,\nwhat's the big deal about that?\n\n365\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.340\nIt's not really a big deal, but it's two\ncertificates that need to be present,\n\n366\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.620\nvalid, validated for\nauthentication to happen.\n\n367\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.760\nAnd while that is secure, on a large scale\nnetwork, those are a lot of certificates,\n\n368\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.960\na lot of certificates that we\ncan have to be managed, right?\n\n369\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.120\nThat's why we have public infrastructure,\nright?\n\n370\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.300\nIt's a whole entire infrastructure\nthat's gotta be managed and\n\n371\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.824\nmaintained to use EAP-TLS.\n\n372\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.600\nThat takes us back to flexible\nauthentication vie secure tunnelling\n\n373\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.440\nEAP FAST.\n\n374\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.420\nBecause EAP FAST allows, if you will,\nfor the mutual authentication.\n\n375\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.220\nBut what's great about it is it only\nrequires a server-side certificate.\n\n376\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:30.640\nAlright when an EAP fast client\nconnects to an authentication server,\n\n377\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.420\njust like I said, Zack if I was\nthe server connecting to me I'm gonna\n\n378\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.160\npass him over my digital certificate,\nidentifying who I am.\n\n379\n00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.930\nWell that same process still happens,\nbut the difference is,\n\n380\n00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:45.360\nnow we're using what's known as\nProtected Authentication Credentials.\n\n381\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.930\nPACs that are generated by\nthe authentication server, not by public.\n\n382\n00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.030\nSo that the server can do\nall before us for us and\n\n383\n00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:59.000\nit saves a little of the complexities and\nthat's one of the benefits of EAP Fast.\n\n384\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.290\nEAPTLS is still one of\nthe most highly used.\n\n385\n00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:07.389\nIn fact, today you'll see\nthings like PEEP and MSChap,\n\n386\n00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:11.340\nversion two being used for\nthe authentication protocol,\n\n387\n00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:17.580\nyou'll see EAPTLS being used, but again,\nkeep in mind those other ones as well.\n\n388\n00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.990\nNow we've got a few other ones that I\nwanna kinda talk about here that are on\n\n389\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.570\nthis screen.\n\n390\n00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:27.170\nWe have what's known as PSK and\nPSK is interesting.\n\n391\n00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.030\nAll right, when we look at PSK,\nthat's what's known as a pre-shared key,\n\n392\n00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.420\nall right, a pre-shared key is\na pass phrase, a password, right?\n\n393\n00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.900\nYou might see things like for\n\n394\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.700\ninstance, if I modify my diagram on\nthe fly, cuz that always works well.\n\n395\n00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.180\nYou might see WPA-PSK.\n\n396\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.240\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n397\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.340\nIt means we're using the WPA, the Wi-Fi\nprotected alliance cryptographic protocol,\n\n398\n00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.970\nbut the way we're doing\nit is through a password.\n\n399\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.820\nThis is probably one of the most\ncommon implementations on your home\n\n400\n00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.360\nnetwork, right?\n\n401\n00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.110\nEver go to somebody's home network, or\nmaybe even in your company, and said hey,\n\n402\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.920\nwhat's the Wi-fi password?\n\n403\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.250\nIt's a pre-shared key.\n\n404\n00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.480\nThink about what a password is, all right?\n\n405\n00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.570\nIf I want Zach to join\nmy wireless network,\n\n406\n00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:15.440\nthe wireless network has to already\nknow what the pass phrase is, right?\n\n407\n00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.260\nThe access point has to verify it,\nso it has to know it's pre-shared.\n\n408\n00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.020\nZack has to know it before he could\neven connect to the network, so\n\n409\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.250\nit's a preshared key.\n\n410\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.324\nDon't let that fool you,\nit's essentially a password, right?\n\n411\n00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:31.820\nThe other one here\n\n412\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.220\nthat we have on the list is lack\nof authentication, open or shared.\n\n413\n00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.310\nWhen you talk about an open system like\nthis what you're talking about is one that\n\n414\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.320\ndoesn't require a password to join.\n\n415\n00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.920\nYou should not be setting\nany network up like this.\n\n416\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.901\nEven most networks that allow public\naccess have some kind of captive portal\n\n417\n00:23:48.901 --> 00:23:50.019\nthat you have go to and\n\n418\n00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:53.636\nyou have to login before you can\ngain access to the wireless network.\n\n419\n00:23:53.636 --> 00:23:58.485\nOpen network like this the Open/Shared\nthat just means that when my computer's\n\n420\n00:23:58.485 --> 00:24:00.707\ngoing to say I need to authenticate.\n\n421\n00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:03.580\nThe access point says,\nyeah, you're authenticated.\n\n422\n00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.360\nBut I didn't do anything.\n\n423\n00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.170\nWell, that's why it's open.\n\n424\n00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.206\nIt doesn't require authentication.\n\n425\n00:24:09.206 --> 00:24:13.730\nAll right.\nThe other one we have, is, MAC filtering.\n\n426\n00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:14.610\nAll right.\nNow Mac\n\n427\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.610\nfiltering is an interesting concept,\nbecause when we talk about Mac filtering,\n\n428\n00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:22.250\nMac filtering is a way that I can say,\nallow or deny, whitelist or blacklist,\n\n429\n00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:26.735\nwhitelist means only these are allowed,\neverybody else is denied.\n\n430\n00:24:26.735 --> 00:24:30.825\nBlacklist says all of these are denied,\nand so\n\n431\n00:24:30.825 --> 00:24:33.865\nblacklisting essentially\njust you're denying people.\n\n432\n00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:35.710\nWhitelisting means you're\njust allowing people.\n\n433\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:41.300\nSo you can filter people off of your\nnetwork based on their Mac Address.\n\n434\n00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.720\nAnd again it can be an allow\nlist which is a whitelist.\n\n435\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.580\nAll right and it can also be\na denial list which is a blacklist,\n\n436\n00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.620\nand that's really all about filtering is.\n\n437\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.400\nKeep in mind that Mac filtering\nby itself doesn't really do much.\n\n438\n00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.170\nBecause with virtualization\ntechnologies and\n\n439\n00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:57.750\nsoftware I can change a Mac\naddress to anything I want,\n\n440\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.900\nand my operating system'll say whatever\nMac address I want to put on it.\n\n441\n00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.890\nAnd it isn't very hard to do,\nto get close to a wireless network,\n\n442\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.670\nput your computer in a promiscuous mode.\n\n443\n00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.920\nSo that you're gathering all the traffic,\nwhether it's addressed to you or not.\n\n444\n00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.540\nFind one of the Mac addresses of\na legitimate computer on your network, and\n\n445\n00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.610\nthen I manipulate mine in\nsoftware to match that one.\n\n446\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.210\nAnd now it looks to the access point as\n\n447\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.360\nI'm the Mac address that\n's supposed to be there.\n\n448\n00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.380\nSo you don't use them by them by yourself,\n\n449\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.920\nyou use some of these\nother techniques as well,\n\n450\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.620\nand you can add Mac filtering\nto the list likewise, all right?\n\n451\n00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.840\nSo those are a couple of the technologies\nthat you need to be aware\n\n452\n00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.110\nof when it comes to your\nwireless networking.\n\n453\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.610\nIt is important.\n\n454\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:41.720\nIt's important to remember that\nagain it's not a one size fits all,\n\n455\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.330\nwe do have to keep that in mind.\n\n456\n00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.140\nWhen it comes down to it you\nhave to be prepared to implement\n\n457\n00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.950\nmore than one thing when you\nare setting up your wireless network.\n\n458\n00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:57.530\nDon't just be satisfied\nwith one individual thing.\n\n459\n00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:01.100\nRemember we have been promoting\nDefensive depth, right?\n\n460\n00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.630\nDefensive depth is very,\nvery important, and\n\n461\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.780\nwe can kinda show you where\nyou'll see some of these things.\n\n462\n00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.640\nIn fact, if I log into my wireless\nrouter's interface here and, no,\n\n463\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.050\nnot now, last pass, and I go ahead and\nclose this down What we're gonna be\n\n464\n00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.240\nlooking at is the wireless, and remember\nevery network's a little different.\n\n465\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.650\nSo I just happen to be using\na Linksys router here.\n\n466\n00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:27.290\nIf I go to wireless wi-fi protected\nsetup is one that has an issue.\n\n467\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:34.470\nI'll just briefly mention this one WPS\nhas a security vulnerability in it.\n\n468\n00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.580\nAnd, even though it's kept around WPA,\nWPA2,\n\n469\n00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.640\nyou should disable it and do not allow\nit to run on your networks again.\n\n470\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.400\nIt has some pretty good vulnerabilities.\n\n471\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.860\nBut, notice that there's this\nwireless security section.\n\n472\n00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.770\nIf I go to the wireless security section,\nyou can see that the security mode for\n\n473\n00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.310\nthis one is disabled, all right?\n\n474\n00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.270\nNow, if I take the 5 GHz network,\n\n475\n00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.100\nnotice that I've got some options here,\nall right?\n\n476\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:06.520\nNotice that I have things like, for\ninstance, WPA Personal and WPA2 Personal.\n\n477\n00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.060\nWhat does that mean when we say personal?\n\n478\n00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.820\nWell that's where your\npre-share key comes in.\n\n479\n00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.970\nAll right when you say WPA2 personal or\nWPA personal what it's going to\n\n480\n00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:19.900\ndo when you chose one of these is it's\ngonna say hey, I need your pass phrase.\n\n481\n00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.790\nAnd then this is where we put in,\nhey this is.\n\n482\n00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.230\nMaybe not spaces, this is my password.\n\n483\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.420\nNow I wouldn't obviously use this,\nit's not complex in any way.\n\n484\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.990\nIt certainly isn't a strong password but\nthis is the pre-shared key, all right?\n\n485\n00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.760\nEnterprise is a little bit different,\n\n486\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.140\nif we do Enterprise this is\nexactly what it sounds like.\n\n487\n00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.390\nEnterprise is where you start\ngetting these EAP types and\n\n488\n00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.450\nyou couple it with 802.1x\nport based authentication.\n\n489\n00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:51.020\nThey call it Enterprise because it\ntypically is a corporate environment with\n\n490\n00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.430\na lot of extra technologies to\nbe able to support this, right?\n\n491\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.740\nAnd this is where we're coupling in things\nlike we've also talked about in other\n\n492\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.990\nepisodes RADIUS, right?\n\n493\n00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:00.980\nThe remote access dial-in user service.\n\n494\n00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.810\nAnd essentially what happens\nis this access point\n\n495\n00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.930\nwill no longer be authenticating you.\n\n496\n00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.520\nIt'll become a pass-through.\n\n497\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.670\nIt'll become the archway to the network,\nand what'll happen is your client will\n\n498\n00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.190\nconnect to it, and this access point\nwill say, it'll challenge you.\n\n499\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.780\nIt'll say, hey,\nI need an authentication here.\n\n500\n00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.670\nYou'll authenticate, and it'll say, okay,\nthere's your authentication information.\n\n501\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.580\nI'm not even looking at it.\n\n502\n00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.210\nAnd I'm gonna pass it\nto the RADIUS server.\n\n503\n00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.170\nAnd the RADIUS sever's gonna say\nwhether you're authenticated or not.\n\n504\n00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.480\nIf the RADIUS Server says\nyou're authenticated,\n\n505\n00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.370\nI'll take that response from the RADIUS\nServer, pass it back through me,\n\n506\n00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.370\npass it back to you and\nestablish communication.\n\n507\n00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.394\nBut keep in mind,\ntakes a lot more setup and\n\n508\n00:28:37.394 --> 00:28:40.840\nthat's why you typically only see\nthis in the corporate environments.\n\n509\n00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.130\nBut this is where I would choose\nwhich one I am going to implement.\n\n510\n00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.900\nNow remember, you say, well,\nwait a second then, what is RADIUS?\n\n511\n00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.598\nWell, RADIUS is by itself\nEnterprise couples in.\n\n512\n00:28:51.598 --> 00:28:55.390\nThings like 802.1X,\nwhich is port based authentication.\n\n513\n00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.720\nUntil you authenticate,\nI'm gonna shut it down at the port level.\n\n514\n00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.000\nAnd I'll communicate with\nthe authentication server.\n\n515\n00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.720\nOnce you're authenticated,\nI'll turn the port back on.\n\n516\n00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.190\nWe also get access to things\nlike EAP types there too.\n\n517\n00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.970\nAll right, so those are a little things.\n\n518\n00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.170\nAnd then another one that I\ndo wanna mention here too\n\n519\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.760\nis your wireless Mac Filter.\n\n520\n00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.420\nRemember we were just\ntalking about MAC Filtering?\n\n521\n00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.310\nSo if I go into here, you're going to\nsee that I have prevent these PCs,\n\n522\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.750\nright, that's your blacklists.\n\n523\n00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.370\nAll right.\n\n524\n00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.210\nThat says, Zach,\nyou are not allowed on this network.\n\n525\n00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.553\nAll right, versus Permit,\nwhich says I see Zak's MAC address and\n\n526\n00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:34.190\nyes, you are allowed,\nbased on your MAC address.\n\n527\n00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:36.850\nSo it's allow versus deny, all right?\n\n528\n00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.520\nAnd basically if we enabled\nthis we could turn around then,\n\n529\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.319\nsee if it'll let me enable it,\nmight not let me enable it, yes.\n\n530\n00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.880\nYeah, I don't care about Wi-Fi,\nits warning me by the way there that hey,\n\n531\n00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.570\nif you enable this it will turn\noff wi-fi protected set up.\n\n532\n00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.602\nWell its like, you didn't hear me talking,\nwe should do that anyways.\n\n533\n00:29:53.602 --> 00:29:54.414\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n534\n00:29:54.414 --> 00:29:55.935\n&gt;&gt; And then this is where I could you know\n\n535\n00:29:55.935 --> 00:29:58.695\n&gt;&gt; I could set up the wireless MAC\n\n536\n00:29:58.695 --> 00:29:59.785\nclient list, if you will.\n\n537\n00:29:59.785 --> 00:30:02.935\nAnd then you would just put the list,\nwhether it's allow or deny.\n\n538\n00:30:02.935 --> 00:30:05.965\nYou just put the MAC addresses of\nthe systems that you either want\n\n539\n00:30:05.965 --> 00:30:09.075\non your network or\nyou want to keep off of your network.\n\n540\n00:30:09.075 --> 00:30:11.835\nBut those are a couple of places that you\ncould see some of the things that we've\n\n541\n00:30:11.835 --> 00:30:13.060\nbeen talking about.\n\n542\n00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.370\nHere in this episode.\n\n543\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.770\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic job as usual Wes.\n\n544\n00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:20.340\nCommon wirelessly network security.\n\n545\n00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.390\nGreat episode.\n\n546\n00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.950\nReview it as many times as you need and\nwant to and you should actually and\n\n547\n00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.190\nin fact in our course library,\nwe have hundreds of other videos,\n\n548\n00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.250\nand they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n549\n00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.566\nWes is there anything\nelse you like to say?\n\n550\n00:30:31.566 --> 00:30:36.038\n&gt;&gt; There is one more thing, I appreciate\nit, there's one more thing that I wanted\n\n551\n00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:40.445\nto mention that I didn't mention here\nbecause it's not a new technology, but\n\n552\n00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:44.490\nit is one that's becoming more and\nmore popular, so it might seem new.\n\n553\n00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.110\nThat's Geofencing.\n\n554\n00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.950\nOne of the last things,\nI'm looking at this.\n\n555\n00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.602\nWhat is Geofencing?\n\n556\n00:30:50.602 --> 00:30:55.150\nWhile Geofencing is actually\na way in wireless communications,\n\n557\n00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.350\nI can apply access control lists.\n\n558\n00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.880\nControlling what you have access\nto based on your location itself.\n\n559\n00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.080\nThat's why it's called Geofencing.\n\n560\n00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.755\nWe can put this imaginary\nboundary around this location and\n\n561\n00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:09.375\nyou either are maybe allowed access.\n\n562\n00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.925\nMaybe for instance you're\nwithin the wireless network,\n\n563\n00:31:11.925 --> 00:31:17.045\nwithin the range of this network, or\nmaybe you've got a few networks right?\n\n564\n00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:20.955\nAnd when you get within the certain\nlocation, you're allowed access.\n\n565\n00:31:20.955 --> 00:31:23.595\nSo when you're outside of the location,\nyou don't gain access.\n\n566\n00:31:23.595 --> 00:31:24.475\nThat was geofencing.\n\n567\n00:31:24.475 --> 00:31:27.820\nIt is one more last thing That I wanted\nto make sure you guys are aware of.\n\n568\n00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.090\nBecause there is way that you can restrict\naccess to different resources within your\n\n569\n00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.670\nwireless network.\n\n570\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.150\nThis just happens to deal with the GPS and\nagain,\n\n571\n00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.500\nthe location of the fencing\noff of those resources.\n\n572\n00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.490\n&gt;&gt; And in fact Wes there is actually\na broad definition of that too.\n\n573\n00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.190\nThere was an enterprise I worked for and\n\n574\n00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.610\nwe used geofencing as a selling tool,\nall right?\n\n575\n00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.140\nAnd it was like, well here's your area.\n\n576\n00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.290\nAnd it would be geo-fenced into\nthis geography or metropolis or\n\n577\n00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.410\nwhatever it might be, so-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n578\n00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, here you go.\n\n579\n00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.690\nWes is determined to make sure\nthat no stone is unturned.\n\n580\n00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.820\nAnd you wanna see every single episode of\nCompTIA Net+ because they're fantastic.\n\n581\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.950\nAnd

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.500\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.768\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.700\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.620\nhelping you to learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.300\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA and Net+.\n\n8\n00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.710\nIn this episode,\ncommon networking attacks.\n\n9\n00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.548\nAnd we've asked Wes Bryan to\ncome along and show us the way.\n\n10\n00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:27.470\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.970\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, thanks for having me back,\nthat's right, great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.790\nAnd yes, this is going to be one\nof those episodes, I have to say,\n\n13\n00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.147\nthat's gonna lend itself to a tin\nfoil hat by the time you are done.\n\n14\n00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:37.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n15\n00:00:37.084 --> 00:00:40.649\nthat's because we're gonna be talking\nabout a lot of the different attack types\n\n16\n00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.760\nthat you, hopefully, will never encounter.\n\n17\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.353\nBut at least need to be aware of for\nthe Net+ exam.\n\n18\n00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:49.270\nAnd also as you transition into\nyour networking careers, right?\n\n19\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.468\nOne of the things that I've\nheard said before is can you\n\n20\n00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:57.400\nshow me an example of\na completely secure network?\n\n21\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.170\nAnd a lot of people will tell you, well,\nthat's the one that doesn't exist.\n\n22\n00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.060\nSo it is important to understand.\n\n23\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.150\nAnd remember, like we've talked\nto you in other episodes,\n\n24\n00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.110\nwe mentioned the concept\nof defense in depth, right?\n\n25\n00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.046\nA layered defense system,\nphysical security is that second layer.\n\n26\n00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:13.930\nAnd that very first layer is policies,\nprocedures, and awareness.\n\n27\n00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.040\nSo you have to be aware\nthat things exist and\n\n28\n00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.440\nsome of the things that might\nhappen on your network so\n\n29\n00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.550\nthat you can be prepared to better\ndefend against them, all right?\n\n30\n00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.180\nSo let's go ahead and\nlet's dive right into networking attacks.\n\n31\n00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.840\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\n\n32\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.410\nset the stage by talking about\nsome of the basic concepts.\n\n33\n00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.870\nCuz one of the things that they mention\nin the exam objectives is, well,\n\n34\n00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.470\nexploits versus vulnerabilities.\n\n35\n00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.210\nNow I'm gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna split these up.\n\n36\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.960\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout them individually.\n\n37\n00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.810\nLet's go ahead and\nstart by talking about an exploit.\n\n38\n00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.590\nAn exploit, essentially, is nothing\nmore than an attack, if you will,\n\n39\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.530\nthat takes advantage of some weakness.\n\n40\n00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.780\nSome weakness in a device, system,\nor within a network, all right?\n\n41\n00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.740\nNow that's the exploit,\nall right, what's the weakness?\n\n42\n00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.550\nWell, the weakness is actually where\nthe vulnerability comes into play.\n\n43\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.900\nWe say that an exploit is\nan attack of some weakness.\n\n44\n00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.638\nWell, the weakness,\n\n45\n00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:08.675\nwe could also say the exploit is\nan attack on some vulnerability.\n\n46\n00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:12.867\nAnd the vulnerability is the weakness in\nthe system, or device, or network, if you\n\n47\n00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:17.237\nwill, that will, essentially, lead to some\nkind of compromise in confidentiality,\n\n48\n00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:21.452\nintegrity, and availability of the system,\nthe data that resides on that system.\n\n49\n00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:24.880\nAnd that's important to\nunderstand the difference, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.360\nNow an attack, right?\n\n51\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.390\nAn attack is just the method that we used,\nfollow me here, the attacke\n\n52\n00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.970\nis the method that we used to exploit\nthe vulnerability, if that make sense.\n\n53\n00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.158\nAnd they don't really call out attack\nas a definition, but let's go ahead and\n\n54\n00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:42.882\njust define it for you, right?\n\n55\n00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:47.601\nNow the next thing I wanna talk about,\nbecause we are gonna mentioned pretty\n\n56\n00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.392\nheavily through the different types of\nattacks another concept that, in and\n\n57\n00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:54.860\nof itself, it can be an attack.\n\n58\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.150\nBut it also forms the basis for\nother types of attacks that we talk about.\n\n59\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.660\nAnd that's something known as spoofing,\nall right?\n\n60\n00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.292\nWhen we talk about spoofing, spoofing is\njust the attacker manipulates data, right?\n\n61\n00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:13.839\nMaliciously manipulates data, falsifying\nthat data to basically impersonate or\n\n62\n00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:19.190\nto represent themselves as someone or\nsomething else, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.213\nSo it's a misrepresentation.\n\n64\n00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:24.700\nIt could be, for instance, an IP address.\n\n65\n00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.640\nIf I wanna make it look like I'm\nsupposed to be on this network, and\n\n66\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.790\nI'm sending information from\ninside of this network,\n\n67\n00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.930\nthen if I spoofed the IP address,\nas an attacker, it's not my IP address.\n\n68\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.450\nBut it's a completely different\nIP address, I've spoofed it.\n\n69\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.520\nAnd it makes it look, I'm impersonating,\nI'm falsifying the information within that\n\n70\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.970\ndata packet to masquerade as being\nsomething or someone completely different.\n\n71\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.710\nSo it's important to\nunderstand what spoofing is.\n\n72\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.380\nSpoofing, itself, could be things\nlike impersonation, all right?\n\n73\n00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.959\nHere's a spoof attack that lends itself\nto social engineering that really\n\n74\n00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.478\ndoesn't have to deal with\nthe more technical side.\n\n75\n00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:07.810\nWe're talking about protocols and\nstuff like that, impersonation, right?\n\n76\n00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.520\nI call up the help desk, I'm on the phone,\nand I call up the help desk.\n\n77\n00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.010\nAnd I say, hey, we're part of the,\nactually, I impersonate the help desk.\n\n78\n00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.141\nLet's be a little more clear here.\n\n79\n00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:19.571\nAnd I call somebody,\nmaybe the receptionist or\n\n80\n00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:23.500\nsomebody that's a little bit more\nvulnerable, maybe not so tech-savvy.\n\n81\n00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.547\nAnd I say, hey, at the end of the day,\nwe've got X, Y, Z, lay it on thick.\n\n82\n00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:30.600\nWe got this upgrade that needs to happen.\n\n83\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.326\nAnd maybe earlier that day in our social\nengineering attack we kinda found out\n\n84\n00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:37.299\nwhat the name of the person was.\n\n85\n00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:39.720\nAnd we found out a little\nbit of information.\n\n86\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.602\nAnd we say, hey, we're part of help desk,\nwe need your username and password.\n\n87\n00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:45.670\nAnd if the person isn't aware,\nthey give you the username and\n\n88\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.584\npassword over the phone, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.537\nNow it's social engineering,\nbut what am I doing?\n\n90\n00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:53.290\nI'm an impersonator, and\na probably a bad one at that.\n\n91\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.060\nBut I'm impersonating somebody else.\n\n92\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.900\nI'm masquerading as somebody that I'm not\nfor the purposes of exploiting a system.\n\n93\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.855\nVery basically, that could be spoofing.\n\n94\n00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.960\nIt's a social engineering attack\ncalled impersonation, but\n\n95\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.350\nit's still a form of spoofing.\n\n96\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.544\n&gt;&gt; Is another form of spoofing, could that\nbe like when you receive an email that it\n\n97\n00:05:10.544 --> 00:05:11.795\nmight say this is from PayPal?\n\n98\n00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:14.434\nAnd you you open it up, and\nit's not really from PayPal?\n\n99\n00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:16.830\nIt kinda looks like it's from PayPal,\nbut it's not necessarily?\n\n100\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.282\n&gt;&gt; I could see that, but that's more\ncommonly what they call phishing.\n\n101\n00:05:19.282 --> 00:05:21.073\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's called a phishing scam,\n\n102\n00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:21.630\nall right?\n\n103\n00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.500\nNow the underlying technique\nis almost the same.\n\n104\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.560\nCuz you're making it look like it came\nfrom a legitimate source, absolutely.\n\n105\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.383\nSo I understand that, but that's\ntechnically what they call phishing.\n\n106\n00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:33.480\n&gt;&gt; And I'm glad you mentioned it because\nit's one of the things on the list.\n\n107\n00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.868\nSo either way, we need to talk about it.\n\n108\n00:05:35.868 --> 00:05:36.843\n&gt;&gt; We will.\n\n109\n00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:41.669\n&gt;&gt; And you will see as we go through\nthis list that some of these\n\n110\n00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.660\ndifferent attack types do\nrequire some bit of spoofing.\n\n111\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.670\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n112\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.920\nNow on the first one that we talk about,\nattack type,\n\n113\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.540\nis something known as a denial of service,\nall right?\n\n114\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.910\nAnd when I talk about a denial of service\nattack, a denial of service, at its very\n\n115\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.610\nbasic nature, is just you require service,\nand you don't get it, all right?\n\n116\n00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.380\nYou require access to some data,\nand you don't get it.\n\n117\n00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.660\nYou require communication across\nthe network, and you don't get it.\n\n118\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.448\nYou require access to a Wi-Fi network,\nand you don't get it, right?\n\n119\n00:06:14.448 --> 00:06:15.800\nDenial of service, right?\n\n120\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.560\nThink that, whatever service is\nacross the network that you rely on,\n\n121\n00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.010\nyou don't have access to it, all right?\n\n122\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.636\nNow when it comes to denial of service,\nthere are few different types, all right?\n\n123\n00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:30.033\nThere are three different types\nthat they call out in the exam.\n\n124\n00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:31.584\nThere's what's known as distributed.\n\n125\n00:06:31.584 --> 00:06:34.893\nThere's what's known as amplified and\nreflective, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:34.893 --> 00:06:39.180\nThe first one, distributed,\nsometimes I heard it called DDoS.\n\n127\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.030\nSometimes I've heard it called DDOS,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.550\nI call it DDOS more often than not, but I\nactually hear people call it DDoS, right?\n\n129\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.439\nThis is a distributed\ndenial of service attack.\n\n130\n00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.840\nAnd what do we mean by distributed,\nall right?\n\n131\n00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.721\nWell, a basic DoS attack,\ndenial of service, right,\n\n132\n00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:03.272\nis typically a single attacker\nagainst an endpoint, all right?\n\n133\n00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:05.980\nWhatever the target is.\n\n134\n00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.640\nSo I walk over, and I pull the power, if I\nhave physical access to your access point.\n\n135\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.823\nAnd I pull the power on it,\nnow your wireless network goes down.\n\n136\n00:07:13.823 --> 00:07:17.110\nWell, that's a denial of service attack.\n\n137\n00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.230\nIf we do a distributed\ndenial of service attack,\n\n138\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.480\nit means that the attack vector, right?\n\n139\n00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.000\nThe point that the attack is being\nmade is coming from multiple sources.\n\n140\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.770\nAnd they do this for specific reasons, in\nfact, I got a little example here, right?\n\n141\n00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.974\nNow there's a couple of things that\nhappened to propagate a distributed denial\n\n142\n00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:38.946\nof service attack.\n\n143\n00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:42.397\nAnd it's one that they don't call out on\nthe objectives, but I want you to know for\n\n144\n00:07:42.397 --> 00:07:43.467\nthe exam, just in case.\n\n145\n00:07:43.467 --> 00:07:47.703\nAnd it's usually, a distributed denial of\nservice attack is accomplished through\n\n146\n00:07:47.703 --> 00:07:49.680\nwhat's known as a botnet, all right?\n\n147\n00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.673\nA botnet is when an attacker, so\nour attacker right here, basically,\n\n148\n00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:59.432\nspreads a piece of malicious code,\npiece of software, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:02.372\nSends it out through phishing\nscams like we were talking about,\n\n150\n00:08:02.372 --> 00:08:05.918\nan email that looks like it came from\na legitimate source with an attachment.\n\n151\n00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.637\nYou download the attachment,\nyou open it up.\n\n152\n00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:12.114\nAnd it installs a piece of\nsoftware called a drone software,\n\n153\n00:08:12.114 --> 00:08:14.774\nzombie software that\nseats on your computer,\n\n154\n00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:18.540\ninstalls itself and then quietly waits for\nsome kind of command.\n\n155\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.970\nThen that propagates through\nout maybe an email system,\n\n156\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:30.240\nmaybe a social media if you will and then\nit infects more than one computer, right?\n\n157\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.920\nSo what's happening?\n\n158\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.160\nHere's the distribution.\n\n159\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.090\nA distribution of that bot and\nit's spreading that malware across to all\n\n160\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.660\nof these computers and then the attacker\nissues some kind of command.\n\n161\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:46.450\nMaybe the software has all of these\nmachines attached to one of the old\n\n162\n00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.350\nIRC the Internet Relay Chatrooms.\n\n163\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.712\nThe attacker hits that chatroom,\nenters the command, and then all of these\n\n164\n00:08:53.712 --> 00:08:58.430\ncomputers distributed simultaneously hit\na single target bringing in offline.\n\n165\n00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.870\nAnd why do you have to do that?\n\n166\n00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.720\nWell, because in some network attacks,\nremember that in a denial service attack,\n\n167\n00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.670\nif you're using network protocols\nyou have to overwhelmed the target.\n\n168\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.480\nTo bring it offline, to keep it busy\nanswering to bogus service requests so\n\n169\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.050\nthat it can't answer the service\nrequests of other people.\n\n170\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.940\nSo for instance you've got a web server\nout there and it's serving up your\n\n171\n00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.640\ncompany's website and your company's\nwebsite sells stuff and makes money.\n\n172\n00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.140\nWell if you have one of these distributed\ndenial of service attacks and\n\n173\n00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.310\nit's attacking that web server, and\nit might not even be bringing it offline.\n\n174\n00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.170\nIt's making bogus web request.\n\n175\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.754\nSo here your poor web servers now sending\nback these responses to the web request to\n\n176\n00:09:36.754 --> 00:09:39.744\nall the infected machines and\nit's keeping itself so\n\n177\n00:09:39.744 --> 00:09:43.070\nbusy that now Zach this time\nyou get your credit card.\n\n178\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.080\nZach comes to this credit card he wants to\npurchase a product from that website but\n\n179\n00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.890\nthat websites to busy right now,\n\n180\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.290\nit's to busy trying to respond to all\nthese bogus requests it's denial of\n\n181\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:59.230\nservice it's distributed because it's\ndistributed across all of these computers.\n\n182\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.170\nNow you also have another one\nthat they don't call out but\n\n183\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.552\nit's a form of distributed or\nDDOS but it's a coordinated attack.\n\n184\n00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:12.940\nAll right, and that's where,\nmaybe what I do, is I don't have,\n\n185\n00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:19.680\na botnet per say but what I do here is,\nI have multiple people,\n\n186\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.500\nlet me just replace these, these,\napparently with a circle there.\n\n187\n00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.670\nLet me replace that code with\nmultiple attackers, right?\n\n188\n00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.260\nThis is still a distributed denial\nof service attack because it\n\n189\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.180\nis distributing the attack\namongst multiple computers here.\n\n190\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.390\nIf I can do that without\ncreating all these crazy lines.\n\n191\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.300\nWhat we see is going on here though is\nthat it is coordinated in the fact that\n\n192\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.120\nthere's more than one person orchestrating\nthe attack against the target.\n\n193\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.338\nThat's still a distributed\ndenial of service attack, but\n\n194\n00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:57.647\nit is called a coordinated attack again\nbecause it is more than one attacker that\n\n195\n00:10:57.647 --> 00:11:01.407\nare working in tandem, working\ntogether to bring a target offline.\n\n196\n00:11:01.407 --> 00:11:06.097\nNow, typically, another reason you have\nto do a distributed denial of service\n\n197\n00:11:06.097 --> 00:11:10.297\nattack is because anyone of these\nmachines by themselves would not have\n\n198\n00:11:10.297 --> 00:11:15.127\nthe computational power and be able to\nmake the request fast enough to overwhelm,\n\n199\n00:11:15.127 --> 00:11:19.750\nor make the resource so busy that it\ncan't respond or it crashes the computer.\n\n200\n00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.515\nSo you have to up the ante a little bit.\n\n201\n00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:27.210\nYou've gotta basically overwhelm the\ntarget with more resource requests than\n\n202\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.610\nit can handle.\n\n203\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.850\nYou've got to hit it with more information\nessentially than the network can handle.\n\n204\n00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.180\nYou're exceeding the bandwidth\ncapabilities of the network.\n\n205\n00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.800\nThat's why we do distributed\ndenial service attacks.\n\n206\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.100\nI say we, but not we.\n\n207\n00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.880\nThe attackers do but\nthen there's other ones too.\n\n208\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.610\nThere's what's known as reflected and\namplified and they are not the same.\n\n209\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:54.590\nOkay, let's go ahead and\nlet's talk about first I'll go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:55.420\ntake this out of here.\n\n211\n00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.210\nWe'll talk about the reflective first.\n\n212\n00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.000\nAll right, here's where\nspoofing comes back into play.\n\n213\n00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.050\nAll right, notice it for\nthe most part our diagram looks the same.\n\n214\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.990\nAll right, but\n\n215\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.500\nyou notice the packet internet grouper\nthe pane utility that we used, right?\n\n216\n00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.980\nThe pane utility is interesting\nbecause what do we do?\n\n217\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.190\nWe send out a little bit of information,\nright?\n\n218\n00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.630\nAnd we request a little\nbit of information back.\n\n219\n00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.460\nWell, what if I could multiply that\ndistributor across multiple computers,\n\n220\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.270\nbut what I do is I send a request,\n\n221\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.519\na ping request up to broadcast address.\n\n222\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.890\nIt's technically we shouldn't do, right?\n\n223\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.380\nI set a ping request to\nthe broadcast address.\n\n224\n00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.050\nEverybody hears it, and\n\n225\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.110\nI spoof the source IP address to\nlike the IP address of the target.\n\n226\n00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.680\nNow, we've manipulated the source address,\nand the attacker has put the target as\n\n227\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:57.730\nwanting to response that's coming back\nfrom all of the ICMP ping requests.\n\n228\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.780\nAnd all of these computers simultaneously\nsend the request back to the target,\n\n229\n00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.860\nbringing it offline.\n\n230\n00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.880\nThat's a reflective attack.\n\n231\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.170\nNow there's other ones too that work\na little more advanced right because\n\n232\n00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:16.800\nthings like reflective attacks and\nthat used to be called a smurf attack\n\n233\n00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:23.300\nsome of these reflective attacks are easy\nto stop because you're routers and\n\n234\n00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.690\nstuff they can see excessive control, icmp\ncontrol messages and we just block it.\n\n235\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.790\nJust block ping stops it in its tracks.\n\n236\n00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:36.415\nWe don't have to worry about it but when\nit's legitimate traffic, when it's traffic\n\n237\n00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:42.058\nthat isn't excessive just controlled type\nmanagement traffic how do you block that?\n\n238\n00:13:42.058 --> 00:13:44.915\nAnd that's when the amplified\nattack comes in, all right?\n\n239\n00:13:44.915 --> 00:13:47.568\nBecause if we take all of this out,\n\n240\n00:13:47.568 --> 00:13:53.162\nwe'll take all of this information out and\nlet's just say, all right?\n\n241\n00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:58.429\nLet's just say that I only have\na few machines here, right,\n\n242\n00:13:58.429 --> 00:14:05.159\nand let's say I, I don't know,\nwe'll put another server in here, right?\n\n243\n00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:08.072\nAnd this server is an NTP server and\n\n244\n00:14:08.072 --> 00:14:12.410\nspoofing is gonna come into play here,\nall right?\n\n245\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:17.650\nIf I do NTP amplified DDOS,\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n246\n00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:18.700\nAll right.\n\n247\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.400\nWell, what I'm gonna do as an attacker is,\n\n248\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.460\nI'm going to tell this network\nTime Protocol Server, all right.\n\n249\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.370\nI'm gonna issue it a command.\n\n250\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.750\nThat says, I need.\n\n251\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.450\nLet's say Zack's the NTP server, right?\n\n252\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.280\nI need a list.\n\n253\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.420\nI'm gonna issue him a command and I'm\ngonna say, I need a list of the last 600\n\n254\n00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.430\nclients that have connected to you and\non a time-synchronization.\n\n255\n00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.705\nWell, what's the NTP server gonna do,\nis gonna respond back to me, right?\n\n256\n00:14:44.705 --> 00:14:47.755\nThat's what is supposed to happen,\nthat's what it does.\n\n257\n00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:53.155\nBut if I spoof it and tell that NTP server\nthat it's actually the target here,\n\n258\n00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:57.915\nthat it wants that list of the last 600\ndevices that have connected to it for\n\n259\n00:14:57.915 --> 00:15:02.440\ntime synchronization, and it across\nevery single one of these computers now.\n\n260\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.565\nNow we have tens of thousands\nof those single requests and\n\n261\n00:15:07.565 --> 00:15:11.310\nI say that it was the target that asked.\n\n262\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.360\nIt wouldn't be Zach that asked me that\nquestion it was that person over there.\n\n263\n00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.640\nSo Zach responds 10,000\ntimes to that person with\n\n264\n00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.780\na list of the last 600 computers that\nhave connected to him and synchronized.\n\n265\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.810\nGuess what, that's a lot of information.\n\n266\n00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.290\nA lot more information than you\nreally should get off the NTP.\n\n267\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.100\nNTP should be very,\nvery low bandwidth, right?\n\n268\n00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.740\nIt should be a very small data\npacket as I need to synchronize.\n\n269\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.400\nThat's all I need.\n\n270\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.040\nEven worse so the reason it's harder to\nget around these is because when we have\n\n271\n00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.770\ntransmission into protocol that's being\nused we can do stateful packet inspection,\n\n272\n00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.470\nand we can see the sessions\nthat are going.\n\n273\n00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.800\nAnd say well wait a second.\n\n274\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.650\nYou've already got a session that's going.\n\n275\n00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.630\nI'm not gonna let you create another\nsession and then create another session.\n\n276\n00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.362\nI'm gonna stop it and\nthose routers can be smart enough,\n\n277\n00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:58.952\nfirewalls can be smart enough\nto stop that in its path.\n\n278\n00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:02.682\nBut when its UDP traffic,\nand it's connectionless,\n\n279\n00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:05.936\nthere is no state information\nto keep track of.\n\n280\n00:16:05.936 --> 00:16:08.055\nIt's just a request.\n\n281\n00:16:08.055 --> 00:16:10.655\nSo you can't trace it back to it's source.\n\n282\n00:16:10.655 --> 00:16:12.820\nAnd it looks like legitimate traffic.\n\n283\n00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.760\nSo it makes its way though.\n\n284\n00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.061\nSo that's an amplified attack.\n\n285\n00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:19.441\nAn amplified attack is when\nyou send a request for\n\n286\n00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:25.047\na service that generally doesn't have\nuse too much information in the payload,\n\n287\n00:16:25.047 --> 00:16:28.015\nor doesn't return a lot of information and\n\n288\n00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:32.980\nyou essentially add more data to\nthe payload than is expected, right?\n\n289\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.670\nSo those are the few of the different\ntypes of denial service attacks.\n\n290\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.250\nNow the other thing that we have to\nlook at is social engineering and\n\n291\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.350\none of the social\nengineering attempts was or\n\n292\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.970\ntypes was already asked about, and\nZack I'm glad you asked about this because\n\n293\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.295\nwhat's the first one on the list is\nthe one that we have to talk about.\n\n294\n00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:51.972\nAll right?\n\n295\n00:16:51.972 --> 00:16:57.760\nNow, when we talk about phishing\nscams we're talking about\n\n296\n00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.870\na fraudulent email comes in looks like its\nfrom a legitimate source like your bank.\n\n297\n00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.250\nAll right or from your one and\n\n298\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.760\nonly brother from a third world country\nthat's a prince now and would love to give\n\n299\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.820\na gazillion dollars provided you\ngive him your banking information.\n\n300\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.060\nI don't know if you've got that email too.\n\n301\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.941\nBut I would say it all-\n&gt;&gt; I did actually.\n\n302\n00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:16.188\n&gt;&gt; Did you get that one Zack?\n\n303\n00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:20.070\n[LAUGH] We all seem to have\nthat same relative, right?\n\n304\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.550\nThat's a phishing scam, all right?\n\n305\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.040\nNow you also have speared phishing.\n\n306\n00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.058\nAnd spear phishing is interesting because\nspear phishing, what you're doing now,\n\n307\n00:17:28.058 --> 00:17:32.580\nyou're essentially it's\na targeting phishing attack.\n\n308\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.620\nIt makes it look like it's\ncoming from a legitimate source\n\n309\n00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.150\nlike maybe somebody within your company.\n\n310\n00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.660\nSo you put your guard down, right?\n\n311\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.335\nWell if I know about that fishing\nscam that is again my one and\n\n312\n00:17:43.335 --> 00:17:48.262\nonly brother from another mother in a\nthird world country that's a prince right\n\n313\n00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:49.820\nnow, I know about that.\n\n314\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.120\nI know right away that this is coming\nfrom somebody, I shouldn't even open it.\n\n315\n00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.780\nBut if it looks like it comes\nfrom the CEO of the company,\n\n316\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.005\nnow I might put my guard down and\ntrust it a little bit more.\n\n317\n00:17:59.005 --> 00:17:59.630\nRight?\n\n318\n00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.140\nAnd then there's whaling.\n\n319\n00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.240\nIf we talk about whaling that's\nsearching for the big fish and\n\n320\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.010\nI like to think of it that way.\n\n321\n00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:05.900\nWhaling big fish.\n\n322\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.870\nNot saying that you should whale or go\nout and go whaling or anything like that.\n\n323\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.265\nBut searching for the big fish.\n\n324\n00:18:10.265 --> 00:18:12.310\nRight?\n\n325\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.520\nNow we're targeting the CEO,\n\n326\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.690\nwe're targeting the person that\nhas a lot of money, right?\n\n327\n00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.533\nThe if we get into those system we\ncould blackmail whatever we want to do\n\n328\n00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:22.444\nfrom there.\n\n329\n00:18:22.444 --> 00:18:25.250\nPhishing is a voice over IP phishing scam.\n\n330\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.460\nThis is getting information\nout of a voice over IP system.\n\n331\n00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.400\nImpersonation, we've already talked\nabout is kinda form of spoofing.\n\n332\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.030\nRight?\nI'm trying to act like I'm somebody\n\n333\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.380\nthat I'm not.\n\n334\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.369\nAll right, tailgating attack is where you\nhave one person that authenticates through\n\n335\n00:18:43.369 --> 00:18:47.741\na secure area, and instead of that\nauthorized person being the only one that\n\n336\n00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:52.410\ngoes through that authenticated door,\nsomebody else makes their way through.\n\n337\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:54.290\nShoulder surfing.\n\n338\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.120\nThat's a type of social\nengineering attack,\n\n339\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.410\nthat's exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n340\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.970\nZach, sitting there typing in some\ninformation that I think is sensitive,\n\n341\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.270\nI'm kind of doing one of these numbers.\n\n342\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.490\nI'm literally looking\nover his shoulder and\n\n343\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.950\nI'm trying to say maybe I\ncan see the keyboard, right?\n\n344\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.980\nShoulder surfing.\n\n345\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.470\nNow impersonation folks if you will it's\n\n346\n00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.090\njust some kind of misleading information\nthat makes its way out, right?\n\n347\n00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.650\nMaybe an email that says you know the boss\nlooks like it comes from the boss and\n\n348\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.260\nit says hey everybody you can go home for\ntoday.\n\n349\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.290\nBoss comes out and\nsays where did everybody go?\n\n350\n00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.080\nWe received an email from you\nthat says we can go home.\n\n351\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.570\nWell that's a hoaxed.\n\n352\n00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.340\nRight watering hole attack,\nthis is interesting,\n\n353\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.180\nthink about what\nthe watering hole is right?\n\n354\n00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.860\nEvery animal comes down\nto the watering hole.\n\n355\n00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.272\nWell if I can find a way to do\na social engineering type in a common\n\n356\n00:19:45.272 --> 00:19:49.368\ngathering spots,\nit's the watering hole attack right?\n\n357\n00:19:49.368 --> 00:19:52.099\nSo these are some of the social\nengineering types as well that you have to\n\n358\n00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:52.609\nbe aware of.\n\n359\n00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.230\nNow the next one I really\ndon't have a slide for.\n\n360\n00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:01.140\nAnd they only call one thing up,\nthey say insider threat.\n\n361\n00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:06.090\nWell, I want to kind of step of\nthe beaten path here because\n\n362\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.640\ninsider threat is on the objectives,\n\n363\n00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.020\nbut I want you to know that these are what\nis know as threat actors, all right.\n\n364\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.690\nThey don't call out in these\nobjectives here threat actors.\n\n365\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.540\nBut to understand why they\ncall it an insider threat,\n\n366\n00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.300\nyou have to understand what\na threat actor is right?\n\n367\n00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.180\nThere are four common threat actors.\n\n368\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.950\nAnd you'll see here in a second, right?\n\n369\n00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:30.390\nThe thread actor types that we have, who\ndo we have to worry about when it comes\n\n370\n00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.140\nto technical savvy people\ngaining access to our systems or\n\n371\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.660\ndoing cyber crime against us?\n\n372\n00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.410\nAlright well we gat the cyber criminal,\ncyber criminals are the ones that's\n\n373\n00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:44.620\ntechnical, they have the know how,\nthey know what they're doing,\n\n374\n00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.732\nthey know exactly how to exploit the\nsystem for the purposes of their own gain.\n\n375\n00:20:48.732 --> 00:20:50.470\nAll right.\n\n376\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.950\nThen we have another threat actor\ntype that's called the activist I\n\n377\n00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.850\nhope you never have to deal with them but\nthere are plenty of hactivists out there,\n\n378\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.410\nanonymous is one of the biggest hactivist\norganizations that are out there, and\n\n379\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:06.007\nthen they've got little side groups and\nstuff that are just as big,\n\n380\n00:21:06.007 --> 00:21:11.530\nright, and a hactivist is a threat actor,\n\n381\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.570\nthat tries to basically make some\nkind of political statement,\n\n382\n00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.340\nsome social change in the world right?\n\n383\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.590\nThey think they're doing good,\nthey're attacking systems for\n\n384\n00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.670\nthe purpose of what they believe in\ntheir own mind whether it's twisted or\n\n385\n00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.600\nnot that they're doing something for\nthe good, right?\n\n386\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.200\nWhether is doing something for\nbad, for the purpose of good.\n\n387\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.870\nWhatever the justification\nis they think is good.\n\n388\n00:21:39.013 --> 00:21:39.533\nRight?\n\n389\n00:21:39.533 --> 00:21:40.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mmh.\n\n390\n00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.190\n&gt;&gt; Then we have what's\nknown as states sponsored.\n\n391\n00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.190\nA state sponsor is what you\nhave to worry about, why?\n\n392\n00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.503\nState sponsors have two things.\n\n393\n00:21:49.503 --> 00:21:55.607\nA endless amount of money within reason\nit can have millions of dollars and\n\n394\n00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:56.797\na lot of time.\n\n395\n00:21:56.797 --> 00:22:01.475\nThey're called state sponsored\nbecause these are underground\n\n396\n00:22:01.475 --> 00:22:06.411\nthat are hired by countries,\nto sit there with a financial means and\n\n397\n00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:10.150\npatience to wait and\nexploit the system right?\n\n398\n00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.500\nAnd again they're called state\nsponsored because they're sponsored\n\n399\n00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.110\nby the governments, all right?\n\n400\n00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.670\nThen there is script kiddies, and\n\n401\n00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.060\nscript kiddies are that UVR\nare watching us out there and\n\n402\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.970\nmaybe you've you are already a white hat\nor maybe you go to hacker conventions.\n\n403\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.200\nThe Script kiddies are the ones that\ndon't have any technical knowhow,\n\n404\n00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.860\nthey rely on the cyber criminals,\nthe hacktivist, and what they do is,\n\n405\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.440\nthey use the programs that\nthe true hackers make,\n\n406\n00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.570\nto automate the hacking process so\nthat they can get in there and\n\n407\n00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:45.130\njust push buttons, or copy and paste some\nkind of script into a search engine, or\n\n408\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.420\ninto some kind of system that causes\nsome kind of disruption, just so\n\n409\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.780\nthey can get their name on a pluck,\non some kind of website.\n\n410\n00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.060\nBut they don't have the technical knowhow.\n\n411\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.450\nThat's why I call them script kidis.\n\n412\n00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.580\nIt's actually a pretty derogatory term\nlike commands in the hacking community.\n\n413\n00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.100\nAnd that leads us to our last one, and\nthe one that's actually on the exam.\n\n414\n00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.599\nI know a long side road here.\n\n415\n00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.990\nAnd that's the insider threat.\n\n416\n00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.080\nAnd that's what they call out.\n\n417\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.390\nThey call out the insider threat, but I\nthink it's important to understand threat\n\n418\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.180\nactor types to understand what does it\nmean to be the insider threat, right?\n\n419\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.850\nWhy do they call it insider threat?\n\n420\n00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.490\nThese are threat actors, right?\n\n421\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.660\nThe insider,\nis exactly what it sounds like, right?\n\n422\n00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.200\nIt's the attack from within.\n\n423\n00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.150\nYou got somebody that is a disgruntled\nemployee who thinks somebody should have\n\n424\n00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.810\nbeen promoted, you know along the\ncorporate ladder got overlooked for a job\n\n425\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.330\nand is now in a basement with the red\nstapler or maybe missing the red stapler.\n\n426\n00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:46.100\nAnd they decide to attack the company,\nwhether it be for a game, whether it\n\n427\n00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.290\nbe to disrupt the company because they've\nbeen overlooked for that promotion or\n\n428\n00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.630\nmaybe it is just that they don't like\nthe boss, or maybe it is just because they\n\n429\n00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:56.270\ndon't like Sally's hair the day down\nthere in the receptionist's office.\n\n430\n00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.090\nSorry, Sally.\n\n431\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.500\n&gt;&gt; I like Sally's hair.\n\n432\n00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.000\n&gt;&gt; I have no problem with Sally's hair but\nmaybe the insider threat does.\n\n433\n00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.050\nSo this is the attack from within, right.\n\n434\n00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.150\nAll right, so those are a little\nbit about some of the, you know,\n\n435\n00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.460\nthe attack types we have.\n\n436\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.490\nBut Zack, I'm looking at my list and\nwe've got quite a few more.\n\n437\n00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.119\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n438\n00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:18.450\nwe don't have a quite a few\nmore minutes in this episode.\n\n439\n00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.230\n&gt;&gt; Well, Wes,\nyou did a wonderful job, as usual.\n\n440\n00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.100\nCommon networking attacks,\nthis has been part one.\n\n441\n00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.690\nThere will be a part two.\n\n442\n00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.560\nMake sure you see that one, as well.\n\n443\n00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.050\nAnd see everything inside\nthe CompTIA Net+ series.\n\n444\n00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.560\nYou'll be so happy that you did.\n\n445\n00:24:30.560 -->

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.322\nWelcome to ITProTV, I am your host,\nDon Pezet [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:05.822\n&gt;&gt; Coming at you live from San Francisco,\n\n3\n00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:06.742\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:07.872\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n5\n00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:08.524\n[MUSIC]\n\n6\n00:00:08.524 --> 00:00:10.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.010\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n8\n00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.640\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n9\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.470\nI'm Zach Memos, and I'm your host as\nwe continue on with Comptia Net Plus.\n\n10\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.430\nThis is common networking attacks,\npart two.\n\n11\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.940\nAnd bringing us all the information we\nneed is the one and only Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.590\nWes, good to see you, sir.\n\n13\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.890\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back, Zach.\n\n14\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.770\nThat's right,\nwe're going back to our tinfoil episode.\n\n15\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.670\nWe talked a little bit\nabout In the first part\n\n16\n00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.030\nabout some of the attacks\nthat you could see.\n\n17\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.040\nAnd we really touched base with\njust some basic terms, if you will.\n\n18\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.950\nFor instance,\nthings like spoofing, as well\n\n19\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.725\nas the different between an exploit and\na vulnerability, as well as attacks, too.\n\n20\n00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:53.155\nIf you are not aware of those,\ngo back and watch part one.\n\n21\n00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:55.495\nAnd then we'll come back, and\nwe'll see you in part two.\n\n22\n00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:56.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just because you're paranoid,\n\n23\n00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:58.270\ndoesn't mean they're\nreally not out to get you.\n\n24\n00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.575\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's true, that's true.\n\n25\n00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.520\nJust because I don't believe people\nare after me, doesn't mean they're not.\n\n26\n00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.120\nThat is right, so\nwe are going to go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.640\nwe are going to pick up where we left off,\nand one of the things we left off with,\n\n28\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.400\nwe were just about ready\nto talk about logic bombs.\n\n29\n00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.320\nThat's the next one in the list here,\nbut I didn't mention it and\n\n30\n00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020\nwe had to put a comma in that episode, so\n\n31\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.690\nthat's where we are going to pick up here,\nand logic bombs.\n\n32\n00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.200\nWhen we look at a logic bomb, a logic bomb\nis really any kind of malicious code that\n\n33\n00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.250\nsits on your computer and it usually sits\nidle for a while, or dormant if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.450\nAnd it doesn't perform any action\nuntil a certain trigger event happens.\n\n35\n00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280\nIn fact, when we talk about things like\nbotnets, we talk about distributed\n\n36\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.870\ndenial of services attacks,\nthat's one that we did talk about.\n\n37\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.580\n&gt;&gt; DDoS.\n\n38\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.260\n&gt;&gt; In the first episode there.\n\n39\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.300\nKeep in mind that that, to create\na distributed denial of service attack,\n\n40\n00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.150\nyou have to make sure that the malware\nthat's gonna control the computers,\n\n41\n00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.950\nthe zombies, the drones if you will,\nthat's going to infect them\n\n42\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.780\nHas a chance to propagate through\nall of these thousand and thousands,\n\n43\n00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.400\nif not tens of thousands, of computers.\n\n44\n00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.150\nSo how do we do that?\n\n45\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.127\nAlright, well, logic bombs are the way\nthat we can spread things like botnets, or\n\n46\n00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:10.920\nattackers.\n\n47\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.350\nNot necessarily us, alright,\nlet's put our white hat on and\n\n48\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.220\ntake the black hat off for a little bit.\n\n49\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.790\nAnd it's a way that we can propagate\nthe malware across tens of\n\n50\n00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.780\nthousands of computers.\n\n51\n00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.290\nAnd what happens is,\nafter a certain amount of time, the logic\n\n52\n00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.210\nbomb will wait for that trigger event,\nand then when the trigger event happens,\n\n53\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.079\nit performs some kind of malicious action,\nall right.\n\n54\n00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.470\nSo for instance, if you look at a botnet,\n\n55\n00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.350\nthe way it just kinda affects\nmultiple computers, what happens is,\n\n56\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.840\nthe logic bomb that becomes the botnet,\nwill wait for a trigger event.\n\n57\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.730\nAnd maybe everyone on the the computers\nwill simultaneously hit\n\n58\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.220\na signal target at the endpoint.\n\n59\n00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.540\nKeep in mind that a logic bomb is\nnothing more than a piece of malware,\n\n60\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.010\nsits on your computer waiting for\nthat kind of trigger event.\n\n61\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.820\nThe trigger event could be, when it sees\nthings like Internet Explorer open up.\n\n62\n00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.930\nOr when you go to access the file system.\n\n63\n00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.060\nOr when a certain executable is launched,\nwhen a certain utility is launched.\n\n64\n00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.210\nOr a time, could be a time as well.\n\n65\n00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact I was just gonna\nask that, like an alarm clock?\n\n66\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.020\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And set it for a time and a date.\n\n67\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.864\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely, you know,\nfor instance, a Wow,\n\n68\n00:03:21.864 --> 00:03:24.835\nwell, over a decade if\nI could spit this out.\n\n69\n00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:26.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well over a decade ago.\n\n70\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.790\n&gt;&gt; It's overwhelming.\n\n71\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690\n&gt;&gt; We had things like, for instance,\nthe 9-11 thing happen, and\n\n72\n00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.620\npeople might be waiting, their code might\nbe waiting for something like that, wait\n\n73\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.180\nuntil the clock strikes 9, 11 and then\nimplement whatever the attack might be.\n\n74\n00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.620\nSo again, logic bombs, just a piece of\nmalware waiting for a trigger event.\n\n75\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.960\nNow, there are a couple other things that\nwe also need to talk about when we look at\n\n76\n00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.050\ndifferent types of attacks.\n\n77\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.820\nOne of the things we need to worry about\nis, and I kind of lump these together,\n\n78\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.850\neven though they're\ntechnically not the same.\n\n79\n00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.660\nThey're both wireless attacks, right?\n\n80\n00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.840\nThey talk about what's known\nas a rogue access point and\n\n81\n00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.640\nthey also talk about what's\nknown as an evil twin.\n\n82\n00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.360\nAll right, now, let's start with\nthe rogue access point, all right?\n\n83\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.330\nA rogue access point, so when we look\nat our wireless infrastructure, right?\n\n84\n00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.070\nWe have our stations,\nwe have our access points.\n\n85\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.540\nThe access points are those devices that\nare managing all the wireless devices on\n\n86\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.130\nthe network, right?\n\n87\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.260\nWe've talked about them in\nour wireless architecture.\n\n88\n00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.290\nNow, what would happen if I would just\ngrab a wireless access point, not yours,\n\n89\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.880\nin your business, and I bring it online?\n\n90\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.650\nAnd I put it in the proximity\nof your wireless network.\n\n91\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.640\nWell, here's what might happen.\n\n92\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.186\nWhat might happen is, people could start\nto connect to that rogue access point and\n\n93\n00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.760\nat very basic, it could give\nthem a denial of service attack.\n\n94\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.350\nBecause they're expecting to connect\nto the wireless network, your users,\n\n95\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.330\nif you will,\nlet's say it's a business, right?\n\n96\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.380\nThey're expecting to connect\nto the wireless network and\n\n97\n00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.220\nhave access to whether it's the internal\nnetwork or the internet, right?\n\n98\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.990\nMaybe even more so\nsocial media and YouTube.\n\n99\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.090\nAll the great things we have\nour wireless devices for.\n\n100\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.650\nWell, when they connect to\nthat rogue access point,\n\n101\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.580\nthe rogue access point doesn't\nhave internet connection.\n\n102\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.640\nIt's quite literally just an access\npoint that I brought online and put in\n\n103\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.700\nthe proximity of your wireless network, so\nthat people will no longer connect to your\n\n104\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.510\naccess point, they're gonna connect and\njump back over to this rogue access point.\n\n105\n00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.360\nNow, when that happens, your users cease\n\n106\n00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.050\nto have the normal functionality that\nthey would on the wireless network.\n\n107\n00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.720\nNow, if we take a look here,\nwe could couple this now, and\n\n108\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.350\nthis is what I call an evil twin attack.\n\n109\n00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.980\nAll right, see, a rogue access point is\njust an unauthorized wireless access point\n\n110\n00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.720\nin the proximity to your network\nthat starts handing out, or\n\n111\n00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.110\nallowing people to connect to it.\n\n112\n00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.430\nAnd, again, the purposes could\nbe to scrape your information.\n\n113\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.100\nIt could be just simply to bring people\noff of your wireless network and\n\n114\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.730\ndisrupt your day-to-day productivity.\n\n115\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.300\nHowever, if we go a little bit\nfarther than that, and what we do,\n\n116\n00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.090\nis we have an access point that\nstarts to broadcast an SSID,\n\n117\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.620\nthe service set identifier\nthat identifies the network,\n\n118\n00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.000\njust generically a string of\ncharacters that we call a network name.\n\n119\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.620\nNow, if I end up bringing up an access\npoint online and I configure that\n\n120\n00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.140\nSSID to look just like the one at your\ncompany or maybe the coffee company.\n\n121\n00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.800\nI put the coffee shop up here, right?\n\n122\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.360\nAnd the SSID looks identical,\nwell now it's an evil twin attack.\n\n123\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.470\nNow keep in mind that I accomplished\nit through a rogue access point.\n\n124\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.870\nWe went a little bit farther there, and\n\n125\n00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.420\nwe configured it to look like\nit's the authorized network.\n\n126\n00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.440\nWhen really, it's an unauthorized access\npoint that's broadcasting an SSID that\n\n127\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.650\nlooks identical to the one that is\ncoming off of your legitimate network.\n\n128\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.480\nThat's why we call it an evil twin, right?\n\n129\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.450\nMwah, hah, hah, hah.\n\n130\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.760\nAnd it looks like it's a benign network,\nlike it's an authorized network.\n\n131\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.900\nAgain, but it's not.\n\n132\n00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.310\nIt's a rogue access point with\nyour server set identifier,\n\n133\n00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.520\nbasically broadcasting out\nan SSID that's identical.\n\n134\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.390\nNow what happens is pretty\nmuch the same thing.\n\n135\n00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.440\nPeople start connecting to it because\nthey believe that it's a legitimate\n\n136\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.340\nnetwork for whatever the intent and\npurpose is.\n\n137\n00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.590\nIt might be, again,\nto scrape your information, right?\n\n138\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.360\nPutting a wireless network adapter in\npromiscuous mode, you start to see that\n\n139\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.210\ninformation as it traverses the rogue\naccess point's evil twin-based network.\n\n140\n00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.910\nAll right?\nSo, know that these concepts are pretty\n\n141\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.900\nclose to the same thing.\n\n142\n00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.320\nOne is accomplished with the other.\n\n143\n00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.080\nRogue access point can just be\nsomething that, again, just an AP\n\n144\n00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.190\nthat's brought online but within\nthe proximity of the wireless network,\n\n145\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.600\nand users start to connect\nto the unauthorized network.\n\n146\n00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.015\nAn evil twin goes a little\nbit farther than that.\n\n147\n00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:37.465\nSame process, where now we're\nconfiguring the SSID to broadcast out,\n\n148\n00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:42.535\nor the access point to broadcast out\nan SSID that is going to be the same one,\n\n149\n00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:46.550\nor close to the same as the one\nthat is the legitimate network for\n\n150\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.190\nthe purposes of having\npeople connect to it.\n\n151\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.377\nAll right so, those are a couple of things\nthat we need to worry about as well.\n\n152\n00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.602\nNow, there are a couple of things\nthat are associated with, well,\n\n153\n00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:59.223\none thing that I can think of that's\nassociated with your wireless networks\n\n154\n00:07:59.223 --> 00:08:00.710\nthat we need to be aware of too.\n\n155\n00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.779\nAnd this is something\nknown as war driving.\n\n156\n00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:07.191\nAll right, war driving and\nI've heard many different terminology,\n\n157\n00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:12.198\nit all starts with war if you will, but\nit's the mode of transportation that can\n\n158\n00:08:12.198 --> 00:08:18.720\ndiffer a little bit, for instance, you'll\nsee war driving, war flying, war boating.\n\n159\n00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.390\nIt just basically means what\nwe do is we have a laptop and\n\n160\n00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.720\nits wireless adapter is turned on,\nand what we're doing is we're going\n\n161\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.980\nthrough different locations trying to find\nopen access points that we can connect to.\n\n162\n00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.470\nAnd maybe they're an open system, right,\nwe'll talk about basic wireless security\n\n163\n00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.200\nin another episode, but basically an open\nsystem is one that doesn't pass or\n\n164\n00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.060\ndoesn't require a password,\nanybody can connect to it.\n\n165\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.025\nNow when I find that, when I'm let's\nsay driving around, war driving, and\n\n166\n00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:51.870\nI do find an open access point, I can\nthen do whatever it is that I need to do.\n\n167\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.230\nWhether it's maliciously,\nwhether it's scrape your information,\n\n168\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.366\nwhether it's do something\nmaliciously through your network, so\n\n169\n00:08:58.366 --> 00:09:00.550\nI don't get charged for\nwhatever it might be.\n\n170\n00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.677\nWar walking I've heard, same thing,\nagain think of a metropolitan type area\n\n171\n00:09:05.677 --> 00:09:09.447\nwhere you're walking around,\nmaybe even with your cellular device and\n\n172\n00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:12.691\nyou've got the Wi-Fi network on and\nyour Wi-Fi scanner on.\n\n173\n00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:16.930\nThen you're just trying to find open\naccess points, maybe a coffee shop,\n\n174\n00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.180\nmaybe a business down in\nthe metropolitan area network.\n\n175\n00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.740\nYou find one,\nI said metropolitan area network,\n\n176\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.260\ndoesn't necessarily have to be a man,\nbut you know around the city.\n\n177\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.735\nAnd then, it goes even farther than that,\nthat when I do find one of these\n\n178\n00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:34.425\nwireless networks with my device, I go and\nI do what's known as warchalking.\n\n179\n00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:35.985\nWarchalking, you just\ngrab a piece of chalk and\n\n180\n00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:38.655\non the sidewalk you mark a little\nsymbol that lets other people know\n\n181\n00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:43.745\nthat if they have a wireless device and\nthey stand right in this spot.\n\n182\n00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:46.925\nThey turn their wireless adapter on,\nthey can find this network and\n\n183\n00:09:46.925 --> 00:09:48.425\nthey can connect to it as well.\n\n184\n00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:50.375\nYou've basically done the work for\nother people so\n\n185\n00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:54.400\nthat they can identify open networks\nlikewise, that's called warchalking.\n\n186\n00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.747\nNow war boating, same thing, now that's\nprobably got a little bit of limitations\n\n187\n00:09:58.747 --> 00:10:02.510\ntoo it, you're got to be the water but\nwar flying doesn't.\n\n188\n00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.197\nNow I used to say, well you know that's an\ninteresting concept because of the range\n\n189\n00:10:06.197 --> 00:10:07.290\nof wireless networks.\n\n190\n00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.249\nBoy, you'd have to get close and you'd\nhave to have a pretty important network\n\n191\n00:10:11.249 --> 00:10:13.922\nfor a helicopter hovering\noutside of your building.\n\n192\n00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:21.220\nBut I want you to think smarter, drone\ntechnology and internet of things, IoT.\n\n193\n00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.190\nIt doesn't take much to put one little\nwireless module on the back of a drone and\n\n194\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.410\nfly it next to a building and\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n195\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:34.063\nSo war flying isn't necessarily anymore\nsophisticated as it might sound,\n\n196\n00:10:34.063 --> 00:10:37.180\nit doesn't mean you have\nto get up in a helicopter,\n\n197\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.680\nit doesn't mean you have\nto be inside of a plane.\n\n198\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.690\nIt quite literally means that you\nhave some radio controlled drone\n\n199\n00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.670\nthat you can start to find\nopen access points as well.\n\n200\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.120\nSo ward driving is the one that they call\nout, and remember for the most part,\n\n201\n00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.395\neverything is the same, you're trying\nto find them an open access point.\n\n202\n00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:58.920\nYou're doing this with war walking,\nyou couple it with war chalking,\n\n203\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.910\nyou're marking some kind of symbol\nthat lets people know that if we stem\n\n204\n00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.552\nthat location, they can gain access\nto the wireless network as well.\n\n205\n00:11:05.552 --> 00:11:09.290\nAll right, so a couple other things that\nwe have, that I don't really have any\n\n206\n00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.542\nslides for, one is ransomware,\nransomware is interesting.\n\n207\n00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:17.602\nAll right, I want you to think of\nthe term ransom, right, somebody grab,\n\n208\n00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:18.898\nin the movies, right?\n\n209\n00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:21.824\nSomebody steals, I don't know, a CEO and\n\n210\n00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:23.960\nholds him for ransom or-\n&gt;&gt; Kidnapping.\n\n211\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.630\n&gt;&gt; Steals a kid.\n\n212\n00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.610\nYeah, exactly, kidnapping,\nsteals the, takes the child and\n\n213\n00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.840\nthen is holding that person ransom\nunless they pay some kind of money or\n\n214\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.920\nsome kind of monetary fee\nto get that person back.\n\n215\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.640\nAll right,\nnow I want you to think of your data, and\n\n216\n00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.070\nput your data into that spot that has\nbeen kidnapped if you will, right?\n\n217\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.188\nWhere you get some kind of virus and\nwhat it does is it takes for\n\n218\n00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:49.894\ninstance things like public ecryptology,\nright?\n\n219\n00:11:49.894 --> 00:11:54.444\nAnd it encrypts your information, and\nthe only way that you can gain access to\n\n220\n00:11:54.444 --> 00:11:58.650\nthat information again obviously is\nto have access to the private key.\n\n221\n00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:03.122\nThe associated private key that will allow\nthe decryption of that information note so\n\n222\n00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:06.228\nthat it's no longer in ciphertext,\nit's in clear text and\n\n223\n00:12:06.228 --> 00:12:07.798\nyou can read your data again.\n\n224\n00:12:07.798 --> 00:12:12.487\nWell, ransomware does this in which\nit encrypts your information and\n\n225\n00:12:12.487 --> 00:12:17.810\nin order to decrypt it or unencrypt that\ninformation, you got to pay somebody,\n\n226\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.545\nsome malicious third party\nsome kind of compensation,\n\n227\n00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:24.103\nsome kind of monetary fee if you will.\n\n228\n00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:27.273\nSo either pay them money and\nthey'll give you the private key and\n\n229\n00:12:27.273 --> 00:12:29.930\nthey'll allow you to\ndecrypt the information.\n\n230\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:33.120\n&gt;&gt; So I have a question for\nyou as layperson.\n\n231\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.280\nHow do you not know who that person is?\n\n232\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280\nSo are going to pay the ransom somebody or\n\n233\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.360\nsomething, could you then\ntrace where they are?\n\n234\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah absolutely you can,\n\n235\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.450\na lot of times what they do is they like\nto get paid in things like money orders.\n\n236\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.580\nWhere at the end of it\nit's gonna be laundered or\n\n237\n00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.650\nsomehow that these operations\nthey move around fast.\n\n238\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.620\nAnd again with the fact that we've\ngot things like BitCoin today.\n\n239\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.712\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say BitCoin yeah.\n\n240\n00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:04.087\n&gt;&gt; You know if you've got any kind of\nintermediary in between that money and\n\n241\n00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:05.760\nstuff, it might not be traceable.\n\n242\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.062\nOr it'll be traceable to a certain point\nand that's where, you know the detective\n\n243\n00:13:09.062 --> 00:13:11.675\ntrying to trail whose called and\nyou don't actually find again.\n\n244\n00:13:11.675 --> 00:13:16.652\nBecause keep in mind, if a company or an\norganization, a criminal organization if\n\n245\n00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:21.070\nyou will, puts out ransomware and\nthey hit a million computers, right?\n\n246\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.210\nAnd let's say the average cost is about,\nlet's just say 250 US Dollars.\n\n247\n00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.980\nWell if they get 10,000 people,\nthey've made some money, right?\n\n248\n00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.300\nIf they get 100,000 people that have\nfallen for it out of a couple million,\n\n249\n00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.410\nthen they've made some money, right?\n\n250\n00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.430\nSo again, the level of complexity\nof the attack is really\n\n251\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.610\njust based on the actual\npiece of ransomware.\n\n252\n00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:44.480\nSo ransomware again is about locking down\nyour information and encrypting it so\n\n253\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.330\nthat you can't gain access to it until you\npay them to typically to give some kind of\n\n254\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.630\ndecryption capabilities so\nyou can unencrypt the information.\n\n255\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:59.020\nAnd then it brings back to clear text and\nyou can recover it, that's why backups,\n\n256\n00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.750\nbackups in your data, timely backups\nin your data are very, very important.\n\n257\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.768\nBecause while you might be able to, maybe\nyou're not able to run the risk of a total\n\n258\n00:14:08.768 --> 00:14:13.885\ndata loss you might be able to stand maybe\na 6 hour data loss or a 12 hour data loss.\n\n259\n00:14:13.885 --> 00:14:17.149\nLet's just theoretically since the last\ntime you've done a full backup of your\n\n260\n00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:17.790\ninformation.\n\n261\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:24.220\nSo backups, that helps to keep that\ninformation in a way that somebody\n\n262\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.030\nelse can encrypt it.\n\n263\n00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.750\nIf you can restore that information\nto an earlier point in time,\n\n264\n00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.560\nthen they don't get their money.\n\n265\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.592\nOther things that we have,\nbrute force, brute force attack.\n\n266\n00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:39.080\nAll right, now brute force\nattack is really just about,\n\n267\n00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.350\nit's kind of like a password\nattack if you will.\n\n268\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.750\nWhen you talk about brute force you\nhave things like encryption keys,\n\n269\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.598\nyou have things like passwords that\npeople try to, they want to gain access,\n\n270\n00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:52.703\nmore so like passwords, right?\n\n271\n00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:59.164\nAnd if I can run your password through\nall the possible combinations that I can,\n\n272\n00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:03.986\njust over and over and over and\nover again, hopefully, for\n\n273\n00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:07.590\nthe purposes of maybe guessing it, right?\n\n274\n00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.725\nAnd a lot of times, it could just\nbe things like hashing collisions,\n\n275\n00:15:10.725 --> 00:15:15.485\nwe're not actually attacking\nthe plain text password,\n\n276\n00:15:15.485 --> 00:15:21.640\nwe're attacking the mathematical\noperations output called a hash function.\n\n277\n00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.390\nSo, brute force is just about guessing\nevery single alphanumeric combination on\n\n278\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:31.150\nthe keyboard with the purposes of\nhopefully you'll get the password right,\n\n279\n00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.910\nand you can break into a system.\n\n280\n00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.990\nThis is where they have things like lock\nout periods, lock out thresholds on things\n\n281\n00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:43.820\nlike computers where I put a threshold\nthat says, hey five invalid attempts\n\n282\n00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.770\nat a password on a computer you're\ngoing to be locked out for 15 minutes.\n\n283\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:52.440\nAnd then after 15 minutes, it unlocks,\nyou do it five more times and\n\n284\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.710\nit's gonna lock out again.\n\n285\n00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.266\nOr it could lock out and require\nan administrator to unlock the account,\n\n286\n00:15:58.266 --> 00:15:58.798\nright?\n\n287\n00:15:58.798 --> 00:16:00.652\nIn things like ActiveDirectory, so\n\n288\n00:16:00.652 --> 00:16:03.357\na good way that we can stop\nthose brute force attacks.\n\n289\n00:16:03.357 --> 00:16:09.141\nThe other things too, like for instance\nWPS, Wi-Fi protected set up, was kind\n\n290\n00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:14.940\nof Susceptible to a brute force attack on\nthe eight digit PIN that was being used.\n\n291\n00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.810\nYou just keep guessing, keep guessing,\nkeep guessing, and then eventually you\n\n292\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:24.210\nhope that you guess what the answer\nmight be and you get into a system.\n\n293\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.730\nAll right, so\nthose are a couple of things.\n\n294\n00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.120\nAnd again, like I said,\nI don't really have any slides for those.\n\n295\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.010\nThose are some more kinda generic\nattacks that you have to worry about.\n\n296\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.510\nNow there is one that's a little,\nthere are some attacks that what they\n\n297\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.500\ndo is they prey on our services that we've\ntalked about in other episodes, right?\n\n298\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.260\nWe've got services that provide\nus access to the network.\n\n299\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.570\nThey allow our data to access the network.\n\n300\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.110\nThey help to move our information,\nif you will, along the network.\n\n301\n00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.930\nWell, when attackers get crafty enough,\nthen what they can do is they can actually\n\n302\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.950\nstart to manipulate these services that we\nrely on to communicate across networks.\n\n303\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.970\nAnd they can use them for their own gain.\n\n304\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.890\nOne of the first ones I'm talking\nabout is something known as an ARP\n\n305\n00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.790\npoisoning attack, all right?\n\n306\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.640\nNow, understand what the acronym means.\n\n307\n00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.659\nARP, it's Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n308\n00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:18.879\nAll right, and we kinda got to\nunderstand what's going on normally with\n\n309\n00:17:18.879 --> 00:17:22.825\nAddress Resolution Protocol to\nkinda understand what the hacker or\n\n310\n00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:27.116\nthe attacker's gonna do to try to\nmaliciously manipulate that process,\n\n311\n00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:27.840\nall right?\n\n312\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.138\nSo I've got a little diagram here, and\n\n313\n00:17:30.138 --> 00:17:34.467\nthis is just a very basic diagram of\nwhat's going on with ARP, all right?\n\n314\n00:17:34.467 --> 00:17:38.870\nRemember the Address Resolution Protocol,\nit sits in between the IP layer, right.\n\n315\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.901\nWe talk about the network layer and the\ndata link layer, because Internet protocol\n\n316\n00:17:42.901 --> 00:17:45.907\ndoesn't understand anything\nabout MAC addresses, right.\n\n317\n00:17:45.907 --> 00:17:47.710\nThere's two different\nlayers of the OSI models.\n\n318\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.847\nRouters understand IPs.\n\n319\n00:17:48.847 --> 00:17:50.860\nSwitches understand MAC addresses.\n\n320\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.750\nSo when IP knows that it's\ngot the destination network,\n\n321\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:18:00.140\nit's delivered that data packet across\nthe routing, the routers if you will.\n\n322\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.575\nAnd it finally hits the local\narea network, all right?\n\n323\n00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:05.500\nIP is pretty dumb as to\nwhat a MAC address is.\n\n324\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.280\nBut MAC addresses are how\nwe deliver information to\n\n325\n00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.440\nend points on physical LANs and\nethernet based networks.\n\n326\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.690\nSo what does IP rely on?\n\n327\n00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.440\nWell, Internet Protocol relies on ARP.\n\n328\n00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.970\nAnd what happens is, when that information\ngets to the destination network,\n\n329\n00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.216\nIP doesn't understand MAC addresses.\n\n330\n00:18:24.216 --> 00:18:26.900\nSo it says, okay here,\nAddress Resolution Protocol,\n\n331\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.040\nI'm gonna hand the IP address to you,\nand I need you to help me with it.\n\n332\n00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.146\nAnd then what ARP does, is ARP actually\nsends a broadcast on the local\n\n333\n00:18:36.146 --> 00:18:40.734\narea network and it says,\nwho has 10.10.10.10?\n\n334\n00:18:40.734 --> 00:18:42.176\nYou got to tell IP, or the router.\n\n335\n00:18:42.176 --> 00:18:44.247\nYou got to tell the router,\nthe router's pretty dumb,\n\n336\n00:18:44.247 --> 00:18:45.799\nit doesn't understand the MAC address.\n\n337\n00:18:45.799 --> 00:18:46.680\nWell, what happens?\n\n338\n00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.050\nAll right, it's a broadcast communication\nlike we've talked about in other episodes,\n\n339\n00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.700\nso everybody on the network,\nall these computers hear.\n\n340\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.901\nAll of them hear that ARP broadcast,\n\n341\n00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:59.530\ncuz it broadcast one to\neverybody on the network.\n\n342\n00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.601\nBut the interesting thing is, these two\ncomputers are gonna ignore it, right?\n\n343\n00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.501\nThey hear it, but\n\n344\n00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:08.114\nthey don't process the information\ncuz that isn't their IP address.\n\n345\n00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:13.740\nNow notice that this computer here\nhas the IP address of 10.10.10.10.\n\n346\n00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.410\nSo, it's actually gonna respond back.\n\n347\n00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.200\nIt's gonna give an ARP Reply Message,\nright?\n\n348\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.170\nThe ARP Reply Message is basically, this\ncomputer communicating back with ARP and\n\n349\n00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.360\nsaying, hey that's my IP address.\n\n350\n00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.310\nI have 10.10.10.10, and you can find me,\nand it says, at this MAC address.\n\n351\n00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.920\nWell, ARP says, okay, thank you very much.\n\n352\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.300\nThis computer actually caches, or\neven the router, this would happen to,\n\n353\n00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.900\nI've got a computer here,\nI'm not really dealing with routers,\n\n354\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.060\nbut computers on a local\nnetwork do this too.\n\n355\n00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.250\nThey need to find out,\nI've got an IP address,\n\n356\n00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.540\nI need to deliver information here,\nlet me go ahead and call out with ARP.\n\n357\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.710\nI don't need to send it to\nthe router cuz it's on this network.\n\n358\n00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.500\nLet me call out with ARP and\nI'll find out whose MAC address that is.\n\n359\n00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.475\nWhen the response comes back,\nand that computer has said,\n\n360\n00:20:04.475 --> 00:20:08.360\nhey yeah, that's my IP address,\nyou can find me at this MAC address.\n\n361\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:13.210\nThis computer is gonna basically cache\nthat information in an ARP cache and\n\n362\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.640\ndeliver the information\nto that MAC address.\n\n363\n00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.940\nBasically, one of the last processes\nthat we have going down that stack in\n\n364\n00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.460\nthe OSI model, delivering that to\nthe end point based on its MAC address.\n\n365\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.150\nNow what's interesting is the ARP cache,\nall right,\n\n366\n00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.000\ncache is no different than anything\nelse we've been talking about.\n\n367\n00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.960\nWhen we talk about web cache, we talk\nabout DNS cache, the local resolver cache.\n\n368\n00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.060\nIt means that I'm going to cache\nthis information so that later,\n\n369\n00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.800\nif I have to deliver\na packet to 10.10.10.10,\n\n370\n00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.860\nyou just checked the cache, I don't need\nto send it out on a broadcast, right?\n\n371\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.300\nWhy waste that time broadcasting and\nputting more unnecessary traffic\n\n372\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.120\non the network if I could\njust look at the cache and\n\n373\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.280\nI can find that IP map to its MAC address,\nright?\n\n374\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.370\nSo that's the normal process of\nAddress Resolution Protocol.\n\n375\n00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.200\nGot an IP address,\ndon't know where the MAC address is?\n\n376\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.880\nCall out to the local broadcast and\nlisten for the computer that responds.\n\n377\n00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.425\nWhen that computer responds you put\nthat in a little database called\n\n378\n00:21:10.425 --> 00:21:14.030\nthe ARP cache and the next time if\nyou deliver into the same location,\n\n379\n00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:17.469\nyou just find it in the cache and\nyou don't broadcast after that.\n\n380\n00:21:17.469 --> 00:21:20.507\nWell, what if we could\nmanipulate that cache?\n\n381\n00:21:20.507 --> 00:21:24.673\nWhat if I knew that I would never send out\na broadcast if I've got an entry already\n\n382\n00:21:24.673 --> 00:21:25.490\nin that cache?\n\n383\n00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.280\nWell this is where ARP spoofing comes in.\n\n384\n00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.275\nARP spoofing says the attacker,\nall right, this computer now,\n\n385\n00:21:33.275 --> 00:21:35.890\nprocess is gonna start the same,\nall right.\n\n386\n00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.181\nThis computer is gonna send\nout an ARP Request Message.\n\n387\n00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:40.932\nHey, who has 10.10.10.10?\n\n388\n00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:45.858\nBut this time, rather than it being\nthe legitimate computer that responds,\n\n389\n00:21:45.858 --> 00:21:51.920\nit's the hacker, that says, you can\nfind 10.10.10.10 at this MAC address,\n\n390\n00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.143\nand in this case it's\nthe hacker's MAC address.\n\n391\n00:21:55.143 --> 00:21:56.950\nWell, ARP is gonna work\nthe same exact way.\n\n392\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:58.500\nGuess what's gonna happen, right?\n\n393\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.480\nThat information is gonna go back to\nthe very first computer that did the ARP\n\n394\n00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.800\nrequest message, basically the same way.\n\n395\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.423\nBut this time, what's gonna make its\nway in the cache, you'll notice here,\n\n396\n00:22:09.423 --> 00:22:10.820\nis a little different.\n\n397\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.668\nIt's not gonna be\nthe legitimate MAC address.\n\n398\n00:22:13.668 --> 00:22:16.749\nIt's not gonna be the MAC\naddress like we set in\n\n399\n00:22:16.749 --> 00:22:20.869\nthe first point that is actually\nthis computer here, right?\n\n400\n00:22:20.869 --> 00:22:24.920\nIt is the attacker's MAC\naddress that has now responded.\n\n401\n00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.746\nAnd my computer, unknowingly,\nits cache has been poisoned.\n\n402\n00:22:29.746 --> 00:22:32.930\nBecause it's a bogus entry,\nit's a malicious entry.\n\n403\n00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:38.000\nNow, according to my, if I've already got\nthe answer, I'm not gonna try to fix it.\n\n404\n00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.280\nI've got the answer in the ARP cache.\n\n405\n00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.180\nBut the attacker poisoned\nthe cache with a false entry.\n\n406\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:49.076\nAnd now what this attacker can do is,\nevery time something is going to be sent\n\n407\n00:22:49.076 --> 00:22:54.969\nto 10.10.10.10, instead of making its\nway to this legitimate computer, this\n\n408\n00:22:54.969 --> 00:22:59.810\nlegitimate computer now gets basically\njust cut out of the conversation.\n\n409\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.341\nAnd the hacker can redirect\nthe information anyway they want, and\n\n410\n00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.910\nthat's ARP poisoning.\n\n411\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.060\nAgain, it's taking advantage of a protocol\nthat we already use on our networks and\n\n412\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.340\nwe need to deliver information\nwhen we're using IP and\n\n413\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.800\ngoing from IP down to that\ndata link later, if you will.\n\n414\n00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.080\nAnd delivering to the final\ndestination based on its MAC address.\n\n415\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.810\nThat's ARP poisoning.\n\n416\n00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.210\nNow that's not the only poisoning\nwe have that's going on, all right?\n\n417\n00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.370\nWe also have what's known as\nDNS poisoning, all right?\n\n418\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.071\nNow, let's understand a little bit about,\nagain,\n\n419\n00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:33.321\nwe've talked about DNS service\nin other episodes, all right?\n\n420\n00:23:33.321 --> 00:23:35.109\nBut I want you to just kinda recap, so\n\n421\n00:23:35.109 --> 00:23:38.550\nyou can understand what's gonna\nhappen with the attack, right?\n\n422\n00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.749\nSo we take a look at my screen here.\n\n423\n00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:44.200\nWe have these UDP DNS queries, right?\n\n424\n00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.667\nAnd what's happening here, is we have\nnon-authoritative lookups, right?\n\n425\n00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:50.140\nWe've got a recursive DNS server.\n\n426\n00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:55.010\nAnd what that's doing, that DNS server\nis basically these three employees,\n\n427\n00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:59.313\nthey might just at any point in their day,\none's looking up Google.\n\n428\n00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:00.174\nWell, what happens?\n\n429\n00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:04.470\nThe computer,\nthis DNS server goes out to Google.\n\n430\n00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.834\nThe authoritative server and says hey,\njust like we talked about in DNS.\n\n431\n00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:13.020\nDo you know where www.google.com is\nafter it goes through that hierarchy?\n\n432\n00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:18.010\nGoogle returns that entry, and it's now\nplaced in the DNS cache on this machine.\n\n433\n00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.270\nSame thing though different if we're\nlooking for Microsoft process just goes\n\n434\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.610\nthrough the hierarchy, and\nthen the response comes back.\n\n435\n00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.670\nRemember DNS Servers cache\ntheir responses too, so\n\n436\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:37.080\nnow we've got three legitimate responses,\nright this is normal, normal DNS.\n\n437\n00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.177\nNow anytime, anyone of these,\nthis lady, this man or\n\n438\n00:24:41.177 --> 00:24:47.253\nthis younger kid here asks for Google or\nasks for Microsoft or asks for Facebook.\n\n439\n00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:50.752\nNow it's in the cache of the DNS\nserver just return the response,\n\n440\n00:24:50.752 --> 00:24:53.180\nspeeds up the process, right?\n\n441\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.832\nWell, what if, all right,\nwe could poison that cache?\n\n442\n00:24:58.832 --> 00:25:05.440\nWhat if I could, when a request comes\nout to, where's www.google.com and\n\n443\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.740\nthe IP address we return is\nsomething completely different.\n\n444\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.552\nNow understand any of you that\nare watching out there have these domains,\n\n445\n00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:17.190\nI made them up on the fly.\n\n446\n00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:20.523\nSo if you've got something called\nyou've just got hacked.net, sorry.\n\n447\n00:25:20.523 --> 00:25:22.288\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, but\n\n448\n00:25:22.288 --> 00:25:26.451\nthe point is it takes you to,\nnow what happens is,\n\n449\n00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:30.831\nwhen we're asking for\nwww.google.com, right?\n\n450\n00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:34.427\nInstead of giving us a legitimate IP\naddress, it goes to an IP address of,\n\n451\n00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:36.400\nlet's just say something completely.\n\n452\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.773\nAnd I'm using private IP addresses,\njust so\n\n453\n00:25:38.773 --> 00:25:43.280\nI'm not using anybody's public IP address\nout there I don't wanna do that, right?\n\n454\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:48.310\nBut we return an IP address of this right\nhere and what that's actually going to\n\n455\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.090\nis not Google,\nit's going to a completely other website.\n\n456\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.820\nIt redirects you to a website that you\nprobably don't wanna be at, right,\n\n457\n00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.520\nthat's DNS poisoning.\n\n458\n00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.060\nBecause if the hacker can\npoison the cache, right and\n\n459\n00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.350\nwe can put an entry that says,\ngoogle maps to this IP address, and\n\n460\n00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.260\nthat IP address is being used by\na malicious attacker at that time,\n\n461\n00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.920\nthey can redirect you to\nany IP address you want.\n\n462\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.000\nRemember what DNS does, I got a name,\nI need to find the IP address.\n\n463\n00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.313\nNormally, non-maliciously we\ncan return the IP address\n\n464\n00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:25.843\nof the legitimate website's domain,\nthe owner right, Google, Microsoft,\n\n465\n00:26:25.843 --> 00:26:29.670\nFacebook, right these\nare legitimate websites.\n\n466\n00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:35.320\nBut if my response comes back and\nit's got a poisoned DNS entry,\n\n467\n00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.040\nagain, same process as ARP,\nor same concept as ARP.\n\n468\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.320\nI've got IP addresses now in the cache\nthat actually map the malicious websites,\n\n469\n00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.930\nit redirects you there.\n\n470\n00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:52.490\nOr even worse, it redirects you to\na domain that doesn't even exist,\n\n471\n00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.660\ndon't even care if the address is real,\nwhy?\n\n472\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.190\nBecause now we've got another\ndenial of service attack.\n\n473\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.770\nIf you can't find the website cuz you\ncan't find its IP address you can't get\n\n474\n00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.530\nthere, that's denial of service.\n\n475\n00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:10.236\nBut remember the process here is\nessentially, To cut out the authorized\n\n476\n00:27:10.236 --> 00:27:15.252\nDNS server so\nthat that process never goes any farther.\n\n477\n00:27:15.252 --> 00:27:18.969\nYou infect the cache and\nI ask that DNS server,\n\n478\n00:27:18.969 --> 00:27:22.760\nwhat is the DNS record I'm looking for?\n\n479\n00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.832\nAnd it gives me a bogus record, we can\nredirect that information anywhere we\n\n480\n00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:27.710\nneed, all right, so that's DNS poisoning.\n\n481\n00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:33.007\nA couple more there, Zach, I know\nwe're running a little short on time\n\n482\n00:27:33.007 --> 00:27:38.410\non this one, but I do wanna mention\njust two more attack types all right.\n\n483\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.962\nNow remember that we've talked\nabout spoofing in the last episode\n\n484\n00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:46.649\nthe very first part we talked about\nspoofing and I wanted to set spoofing\n\n485\n00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:49.986\nahead of everything else because\nwe talked about DNS spoofing.\n\n486\n00:27:49.986 --> 00:27:53.415\nYou can say DNS spoofing,\nDNS poisoning right,\n\n487\n00:27:53.415 --> 00:27:58.346\na DNS spoofing just means that I could\nput a fake server in between there\n\n488\n00:27:58.346 --> 00:28:03.130\nthat looks like it's a DNS server,\nbut it's actually malicious.\n\n489\n00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:09.040\nWe talked about ARP poisoning it uses\nspoofing right, because what am I doing?\n\n490\n00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.690\nI'm responding back to ARP, and\nI'm pretending to be somebody I'm not.\n\n491\n00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.233\nAnd I'm saying that's my IP\naddress when it really isn't, and\n\n492\n00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:19.510\nit maps to my MAC address rather than the\nlegitimate MAC address, that's spoofing.\n\n493\n00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:23.515\nWell, this next concept forms the basis\nfor a lot of different attacks, and\n\n494\n00:28:23.515 --> 00:28:25.216\nit's called the MITM, right?\n\n495\n00:28:25.216 --> 00:28:27.122\nNope, we're not talking\nabout a university, and\n\n496\n00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.029\nwe're not talking about\na technical school here,\n\n497\n00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:31.670\nwe're talking about\nthe man-in-the-middle attack, all right.\n\n498\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.470\nAnd if we could take a look at this,\nman-in-the-middle attack attack could be\n\n499\n00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.620\nused as the basis for\nmany other attacks, right.\n\n500\n00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.877\nWe talk about session hijacking attack or\na replay attack where I,\n\n501\n00:28:39.877 --> 00:28:43.307\nget in between the source and\nthe destination in the communication and\n\n502\n00:28:43.307 --> 00:28:45.343\nI steal some information and\nI replay it or\n\n503\n00:28:45.343 --> 00:28:48.974\nI send it back to the server later as\nI'm spoofing like it's you, right?\n\n504\n00:28:48.974 --> 00:28:52.090\nNow we're pulling them all together,\nall right.\n\n505\n00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:55.000\nAnd session hijacking\nattack where you currently\n\n506\n00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.300\nhave an active session between you and\nlet's say a web server,\n\n507\n00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.420\nand I steal the session cookie because I'm\nin between the source and destination.\n\n508\n00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.880\nAnd now I can present your session\ncookie to the web server, and\n\n509\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.460\nit thinks I'm you and I could take\nyou completely out of the mix, right?\n\n510\n00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.180\nSo man in the middle all right, is you\nhave a victim Whatever the target is and\n\n511\n00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.570\nthere's a resource, some kinda\nservice that's being provided and\n\n512\n00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.550\nyou have somebody that sits in\nbetween that communication.\n\n513\n00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.895\nNow, why they do it,\ncould be different reasons,\n\n514\n00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:26.870\nall right and I put just some\nof the basic reasons right.\n\n515\n00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.650\nIntercepting your information,\neaves dropping all right and\n\n516\n00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.540\nthis is why we use encryption protocols.\n\n517\n00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:36.427\nThat's why we use HTTPS With TLS 2.0 and\nhigher, right?\n\n518\n00:29:36.427 --> 00:29:41.122\nThat's why we use things like Secure File\nTransfer protocol because I want encrypted\n\n519\n00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:45.164\ninformation so that if I'm sending or\npulling a file from an FTP server and\n\n520\n00:29:45.164 --> 00:29:47.789\nsomebody sits in between\nthat communication.\n\n521\n00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:51.710\nThat information is scrambled so\nthey can not read it, right?\n\n522\n00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.934\nThat's man in the middle, right could\nbe redirecting information again,\n\n523\n00:29:55.934 --> 00:30:00.630\ncould be modifying that information could\nform the basis for a lot of other attacks.\n\n524\n00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:06.959\nAll right, last one,\nis what's known as VLAN hopping.\n\n525\n00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.990\nAll right, why do we set up\nvirtual local area networks?\n\n526\n00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.826\nWe setup VLANs so that we can isolate a\nsegment or a group of computers together,\n\n527\n00:30:15.826 --> 00:30:19.520\nand they can't communicate\nwith other computers, right?\n\n528\n00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.988\nIt basically allows us to take a physical\nswitch, and logically divide it up, and\n\n529\n00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:26.190\nmake it multiple switches.\n\n530\n00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.720\nAnd the only way that these computers\ncan talk to one another is if\n\n531\n00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.530\nyou put a layer of re-routing in there,\nright?\n\n532\n00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.229\nWe do it for network security purposes,\nagain segmentation,\n\n533\n00:30:35.229 --> 00:30:38.176\nI can put a set of crucial\nservers within one VLAN.\n\n534\n00:30:38.176 --> 00:30:41.495\nI can put voice of IP phones\nwithin another VLAN, right and\n\n535\n00:30:41.495 --> 00:30:43.340\nthe communication separates.\n\n536\n00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.630\nWell here's the problem, all right.\n\n537\n00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.830\nAttackers can manipulate\nthe Ethernet frames, and they can\n\n538\n00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.760\nmanipulate things like, for instance,\ntrunks, as well as the tag itself.\n\n539\n00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.211\nAnd they can actually hop\nfrom one VLAN to the next,\n\n540\n00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:00.548\nwhen they really shouldn't be able to,\nright?\n\n541\n00:31:00.548 --> 00:31:03.579\nOne of the ways, and\nthey don't call them out individually,\n\n542\n00:31:03.579 --> 00:31:07.950\nbut there's a couple of different types\nof VLAN hopping I just wanna mention.\n\n543\n00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:12.573\nOne is where the attacker\nbasically leverages\n\n544\n00:31:12.573 --> 00:31:18.390\nthe 802.1Q trunk,\nremember what a trunk is, okay.\n\n545\n00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.089\nA trunk basically a switchboard that\n\n546\n00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:26.750\nmultiple VLANs can use as their port,\nright?\n\n547\n00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:30.361\nSo if I've got information that's\ngoing to a certain location,\n\n548\n00:31:30.361 --> 00:31:33.615\nI can trunk the port together,\nand all VLANs can use that.\n\n549\n00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:35.740\nOr if I can manipulate that trunk,\n\n550\n00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.380\nthat means not only can all the VLANs\nuse it but the attacker can gain\n\n551\n00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.760\naccess to all the VLANs through that trunk\nport because they are all sharing it.\n\n552\n00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.322\nAll right, the other one is\nthe manipulation of the VLAN tag itself,\n\n553\n00:31:49.322 --> 00:31:53.976\nand this is called a double tagging\nVLAN hopping attack, if you will.\n\n554\n00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:58.081\nAll right, so the attacker is part\nof one VLAN all right, and and\n\n555\n00:31:58.081 --> 00:32:00.755\nthat's the very first VLAN, all right?\n\n556\n00:32:00.755 --> 00:32:03.680\nSo this is the VLAN that\nthe computer is a part of, but\n\n557\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.488\nthere's an extra tag that's in there and\nthe tag, that extra tag, double tagging.\n\n558\n00:32:08.488 --> 00:32:15.203\nThat second tag is actually the VLAN\nthat the attacker wants to access.\n\n559\n00:32:15.203 --> 00:32:20.802\nSo what happens is the very first\nswitch receives that VLAN tag,\n\n560\n00:32:20.802 --> 00:32:26.711\nsees it as part of that VLAN,\nremoves it and reveals the second tag,\n\n561\n00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:31.080\nand then that's handed\noff to the second switch.\n\n562\n00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.072\nAnd the second switch says, yeah I see\nthe VLAN tag here, the second tag here,\n\n563\n00:32:35.072 --> 00:32:37.510\nyou're supposed to have\naccess to this VLAN.\n\n564\n00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.990\nAnd now what's happened,\nthrough manipulation of the tagging,\n\n565\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.221\nis that the attacker has now\ngained access to the second VLAN,\n\n566\n00:32:44.221 --> 00:32:47.037\nthat they weren't originally a part of,\nall right?\n\n567\n00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:52.074\nThat's VLAN hopping, VLAN basically,\ninstead of being isolated like\n\n568\n00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:57.290\nthose virtual local area networks\nshould give us that network isolation.\n\n569\n00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.070\nThey actually manipulate\nthings like the trunks and\n\n570\n00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:05.170\nthings like the VLAN tag\nwithin the Ethernet frame, and\n\n571\n00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:10.558\nessentially make their way on\nunauthorized on to another VLAN.\n\n572\n00:33:10.558 --> 00:33:15.410\nAll right Zach so that does look\nlike it wraps everything up keep in\n\n573\n00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.280\nmind be aware of some of these\nnetwork attacks for the exam.\n\n574\n00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.494\nIf they put you in a scenario,\n\n575\n00:33:19.494 --> 00:33:21.883\nwhere you just have to know\nthe characteristics, right?\n\n576\n00:33:21.883 --> 00:33:26.011\nWe want you to be aware of them keep in\nmind, there are many more out there, so\n\n577\n00:33:26.011 --> 00:33:29.171\nkeep studying, and\nthe next time you sit that Net+ exam,\n\n578\n00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:30.931\nwe think you'll be doing well.\n\n579\n00:33:30.931 --> 00:33:34.620\n&gt;&gt; Great episode as usual,\nWes Common Networking Attacks, Part 2.\n\n580\n00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.568\nMake sure you see Part 1 and\nsee everything in the CompTIA Net+ series,\n\n581\n00:33:38.568 --> 00:33:41.104\nthat Wes and\nITProTV had put together for you.\n\n582\n00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:44.844\nAnd while your in the course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos there,\n\n583\n00:33:44.844 --> 00:33:47.822\nand they're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n584\n00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:50.575\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be really glad you did.\n\n585\n00:33:50.575 --> 00:33:52.500\nThanks for

but\n\n14\n00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:40.212\nit definitely relates to security.\n\n15\n00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:42.880\nSo we're gonna have to know\na little bit about how\n\n16\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.110\nwe make our network devices\na little bit more secure.\n\n17\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.978\nBut before we do that, I kinda want to set\nthe stage for this term hardening, right?\n\n18\n00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:53.490\nYou heard Zach say it a couple of times,\nwhat the heck does hardening mean?\n\n19\n00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.120\nWell, I want you to know that it doesn't\nmatter if we're talking about a network\n\n20\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.910\ndevice, it doesn't matter if we're talking\nabout an application, an operating system\n\n21\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.910\nif you will, any kind of piece of software\nor component embedded system, right?\n\n22\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.440\nWhen we talk about the term hardening\nthen, what we're talking about is\n\n23\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.370\nreducing our attack surface, making\nthe device a little bit more secure.\n\n24\n00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.820\nAgain, or the application or\nthe operating system, right?\n\n25\n00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.550\nWe say,\nreducing our attack surface, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.570\nI want you to think of it this way.\n\n27\n00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.050\nThe more vulnerabilities you have in a\nsystem, whether it is a misconfiguration,\n\n28\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.770\na lack of configuration,\nmaybe misuse of certain protocols, right?\n\n29\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.090\nAny kind of weakness that you\nbasically have inside of that system,\n\n30\n00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.740\nmeans you're gonna be more susceptible\nto different types of attacks.\n\n31\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.030\nThe more attacks you're susceptible too,\nor vulnerabilities and the exploits or\n\n32\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.160\nthe attacks that go wrong\nwith those vulnerabilities,\n\n33\n00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.950\nthe greater the bull's\neye on your chest right.\n\n34\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.790\nSo what we wanna do is we want to,\n\n35\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.720\nwe wanna basically secure\nthe components within a system or\n\n36\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.760\ndifferent configurations within our\nnetwork devices so that we can reduce\n\n37\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.940\nthe size of that bull's eye or\nreduce the size of the attack surface,\n\n38\n00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.420\nthereby strengthening our system's\nresiliency to these vulnerabilities or\n\n39\n00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.670\nthe attacks that could\nexploit the vulnerabilities.\n\n40\n00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.280\nSo that's what hardening is and\n\n41\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.420\nthat's what we're gonna be\nlooking at in this episode.\n\n42\n00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.680\n&gt;&gt; I was a little dyslexic\nabout the way I said that but\n\n43\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.390\nit's network device hardening not\nhardening network devices but\n\n44\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.100\nit's basically the same thing and in fact\nwhat I wanted to ask you Wes is defaults.\n\n45\n00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.760\nAre not defaults enough?\n\n46\n00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.190\nLets talk about defaults.\n\n47\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Defaults are something that we all have\nto deal with when we are configuring or\n\n48\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.350\nwhen we are buy a device.\n\n49\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.682\nAnd again,\nwe're looking at network devices, but\n\n50\n00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:39.598\nit might be the same thing when you\ninstall an operating system for\n\n51\n00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:41.894\nthe very first time and\nyou have not done anything.\n\n52\n00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.509\nPost installation,\nyou can see your desktop for\n\n53\n00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.580\ninstance in Windows you can log in,\nyou can work with the machine right?\n\n54\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.700\nCould be an application that maybe you've\ninstalled for the very first time and\n\n55\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960\nit's just fresh out of the box right?\n\n56\n00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.900\nWell, with default, it usually means that\nthere's some kind of configuration or\n\n57\n00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.130\nlack thereof,\nit might be no configuration.\n\n58\n00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.670\nThat again is, just straight out of\nthe box, right, and the problem is that\n\n59\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.090\ndefault introduces a weakness in\nthe system, a vulnerability if you will.\n\n60\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.560\nAnd again remember, this is about reducing\nthe vulnerabilities there by reducing\n\n61\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.240\nthe attack surface of the vectors that\nthey use in order to attack your system.\n\n62\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.080\nCan't really be all eliminated but\n\n63\n00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.070\nwe can definitely reduce it down\nto an acceptable level, right.\n\n64\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.550\nSo when we talk about defaults this again\nis just standard normal configuration.\n\n65\n00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.050\nLet me give you an example for instance.\n\n66\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.841\nSo Zach and I we buy the same\nlet's say home router right.\n\n67\n00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:43.442\nIt could be the same access point, right,\nit could be the all in one device,\n\n68\n00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:46.900\nnot only is it a wireless access point,\nit's got switch ports on it too.\n\n69\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.798\nAnd it allows us to communicate off\nof our local networks, right so\n\n70\n00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:51.056\nit's doing a lot of things.\n\n71\n00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:53.732\nBut if we buy the same device,\nall right, and\n\n72\n00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:58.101\nwe do nothing to configure it at all\nwe turn it on, we plug some devices in,\n\n73\n00:03:58.101 --> 00:04:02.370\nwell it's going to have a series\nof preconfigured settings.\n\n74\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.570\nAnd these preconfigured settings might\nbe available to just anyone to find out.\n\n75\n00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.560\nAnd that presents a problem for us, right?\n\n76\n00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.430\nLet me tell you one classic example,\ncredentials.\n\n77\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.400\nWhen you buy something like a home\nrouter for the very first time,\n\n78\n00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.980\nyou typically have, in between devices and\nmodels, sometimes it's even crazier.\n\n79\n00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.320\nIt doesn't matter if it's a different\nmodel, if it's a family of products\n\n80\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.420\nthe different models might even have\na default username and password.\n\n81\n00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.790\nWell, the default username and\n\n82\n00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.230\npassword the default credentials\npresents a problem because guess what?\n\n83\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.020\nWhen Zach turned his device on and\n\n84\n00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.000\nI turned my device on we could be\nin completely separate networks and\n\n85\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000\nnot even know each other, but\nwe have the same set of credentials.\n\n86\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.960\nAnd even worse than that is that if people\ncan find out what kind of device model\n\n87\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.900\nyou might have, they might also be able\nto gain access to that device, right,\n\n88\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.330\njust through the default.\n\n89\n00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.210\nLet me give you an example\nof what I mean here.\n\n90\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.159\nSee, we have been using\na Linksys 8350 interface for\n\n91\n00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.810\nour wireless configurations\nin some of those shows.\n\n92\n00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.150\nI've got a web interface here.\n\n93\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.140\nLet's go and check that out.\n\n94\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.827\nI say web interface, just a little\nsearch engine we got Google here.\n\n95\n00:05:15.827 --> 00:05:21.110\nAnd let's say that I decide that\nI'm gonna type in linksys, right?\n\n96\n00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.750\nAnd I've already kind of done a search for\nthis.\n\n97\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.072\nNotice I have linksys 8350\ndefault username and password.\n\n98\n00:05:27.072 --> 00:05:30.410\nAll right, well,\nif I check that out Look here,\n\n99\n00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.460\nLinksys man they're really good\nwith their support, right.\n\n100\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.670\nSo good with their support that they're\ntelling me not only what the username and\n\n101\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.680\nthe password might be,\n\n102\n00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.650\nthey even tell me what IP address\nit is that I need to connect.\n\n103\n00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.380\n&gt;&gt; So, the bad actors could at this point,\nthey could presume or assume that,\n\n104\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.980\nthat might be the way in.\n\n105\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.590\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, because again if we've\ngot two of the same components,\n\n106\n00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.667\nnotice I didn't say Wes' E8350,\nor Zach's 8350.\n\n107\n00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:02.250\nI just wanted it an 8350 in general,\nright.\n\n108\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.890\nAnd I can see that look at the username,\nthe username is blank.\n\n109\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.495\nWell, I don't even need a username.\n\n110\n00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:11.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then the admin is the default\n\n111\n00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.350\npassword, right.\n\n112\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.300\nSo there's a problem with that.\n\n113\n00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.300\n&gt;&gt; If we can find that information, so\ncan the bad actors that you are talking\n\n114\n00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.640\nabout that are sitting outside of your\nnetwork and even worse, default SSID.\n\n115\n00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.690\nNow they don't talk about default SSID.\n\n116\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.340\nWe'll probably talk a little more\nabout that in other episodes,\n\n117\n00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.700\nbut that also lends itself to a problem,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.120\nBecause an SSID, you will see,\nsometimes will broadcast, you know,\n\n119\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.870\nthe network name.\n\n120\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.920\nBroadcast, I can fire\nup a wireless analyzer.\n\n121\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.470\nI can find what your SSIDs are, the\nservice that identify the network name.\n\n122\n00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.050\nAnd if I've left the defaults, a lot of\ntimes what you'll see Is that the default\n\n123\n00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.080\nSSID actually has what's the model\nmight be inside of the SSID,\n\n124\n00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.030\nor at least it'll start to\nnarrow it down for me, and\n\n125\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.410\nif I'm doing some kind of passive\nreconnaissance attack, right?\n\n126\n00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.530\nWhere I'm just trying to scrape as\nmuch information as I can, right?\n\n127\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.560\nAll I need is a WiFi analyzer and I can\ntell what the model is and I can plug it\n\n128\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.720\ninto a search engine and I can find out\nthings like your default credentials.\n\n129\n00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.490\nLet me give your an example here, because\nI actually have on my network I have\n\n130\n00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.020\nan Asus N66 AC router, right.\n\n131\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.380\nAnd if I come in here and\nI do something like this and\n\n132\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.240\nI type in asus n66 default password.\n\n133\n00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.700\nWell, look at this, I've got a lot of\ndifferent websites that are telling me hey\n\n134\n00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.850\nhere's how you login to this,\nhere's the default settings.\n\n135\n00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.706\nThis goes as far as just telling you\nthese are default settings right.\n\n136\n00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:41.897\nAnd I can end up seeing that here's\nthe IP address, here's the username and\n\n137\n00:07:41.897 --> 00:07:43.930\nthe password, admin, admin.\n\n138\n00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.060\nAnd notice that we have some\npreconfigured defaults, WiFi settings.\n\n139\n00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.840\nAnd it tells me, hey,\nit starts with ASUS and the password?\n\n140\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.287\nDon't even have a password, all right?\n\n141\n00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:56.909\nSo now it makes it very,\nvery easy to get onto your network.\n\n142\n00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.771\nSo that's why the defaults are horrible.\n\n143\n00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.536\nNow, another thing that I\nkinda wanna talk about,\n\n144\n00:08:02.536 --> 00:08:07.486\neven though they don't really mentioned it\nhere in the objectives, right, is there's,\n\n145\n00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:11.816\nand I guess Zach, this can kinda fall\nunder things like unnecessary services.\n\n146\n00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.709\nThey do call out disabling\nunnecessary services and\n\n147\n00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:19.706\nwe'll get into that a little bit more, but\nwhile we're talking about defaults, right,\n\n148\n00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:22.024\nthings for instance remote management.\n\n149\n00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:25.899\nIf you don't need more management,\nif you don't need to connect from\n\n150\n00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:30.301\nyour WAN interface, let's say from your\nwork network back over the Internet,\n\n151\n00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.520\nback into your home to manage\nyour wireless access point,\n\n152\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.165\nthen you shouldn't have it turned on,\nright.\n\n153\n00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:38.965\nBecause, and again,\nit expands that target,\n\n154\n00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:41.700\nit increases the size\nof that attack surface.\n\n155\n00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.650\nIn fact, let me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean.\n\n156\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.310\nIf we log in to our router here, and\nwe'll just go ahead and we'll log in and\n\n157\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.340\nwe'll, no not now, LastPass.\n\n158\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.300\nWe'll go ahead and say don't show\nthis to me, let's go ahead and\n\n159\n00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.470\nget out of there,\ngo ahead and say OK to this.\n\n160\n00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.713\nEventually, I will click the right button,\nall right, and\n\n161\n00:08:58.713 --> 00:09:02.858\nwe have this Administration option\nright here, notice, Administration.\n\n162\n00:09:02.858 --> 00:09:07.712\nAnd if I click that, I want you to notice\nhere, now this is disabled by default,\n\n163\n00:09:07.712 --> 00:09:10.834\nand this is a good default configuration,\nright.\n\n164\n00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:15.652\nBut if you don't need this,\ndisable it, don't turn it on, and\n\n165\n00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:19.489\nif you do turn it on don't\nuse insecure protocols,\n\n166\n00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:24.370\nuse secure protocols,\nright, HTTPS, all right.\n\n167\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.640\nNow you can lock it down, but\n\n168\n00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.700\nagain keep in mind that defaults sometimes\naren't always the best type of setting.\n\n169\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.020\nEspecially when it comes to,\nlet me go ahead and Cancel out of that,\n\n170\n00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.140\nespecially when it comes down to\nthings like Remote Management.\n\n171\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.188\nDon't need the service, don't turn it on,\nthat's very, very important.\n\n172\n00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:43.912\n&gt;&gt; It's another doorway in isn't it?\n\n173\n00:09:43.912 --> 00:09:46.550\n&gt;&gt; That's right, it just gives\nthem another avenue that they can\n\n174\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.430\nget into your network, right, and\npotentially without your knowledge.\n\n175\n00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:56.200\nNow the next topic, I wanna talk about is\nanother thing that we have to worry about,\n\n176\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.290\nand that is a common passwords.\n\n177\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.260\nAll right,\nwhen we talked about common passwords,\n\n178\n00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.170\ncommon passwords are essentially,\nobviously past words that\n\n179\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.620\nyou see people using a lot, right,\nin different networks, right?\n\n180\n00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.750\nWell, why do we wanna stay\naway from common passwords?\n\n181\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.280\nWell, because if you know it, somebody\nelse knows it, somebody else uses it,\n\n182\n00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.260\neventually what happens is,\nit gets very, very easy for\n\n183\n00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.880\nthem to do things like password attacks\nagainst common passwords, all right.\n\n184\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.120\nAnd what I mean by that is, if they\nhave a list, in fact let me go ahead and\n\n185\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.349\nshow you, I've typed in right here and\n[COUGH] there are a few,\n\n186\n00:10:33.349 --> 00:10:34.790\nthis is The Huffington Post.\n\n187\n00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.710\nBut let's go ahead and go up to, yeah,\nWikipedia has got some common passwords.\n\n188\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.830\nIn 2013, actually,\nthey've got quite a few, all right, and\n\n189\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.940\nyou could see some of the common\npasswords, all right.\n\n190\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.927\nWell, one of the reasons that we\ndon't wanna use strings like this,\n\n191\n00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:51.050\nthese are called forbidden\ncharacter strings.\n\n192\n00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.766\nCommon passwords are forbidden character\nstring is because your passwords,\n\n193\n00:10:54.766 --> 00:10:58.647\nwhen they get stored, they actually get\nstored as what's known as an hash value,\n\n194\n00:10:58.647 --> 00:10:59.226\nall right.\n\n195\n00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:03.871\nAnd again a mathematical operation that\nis just a applied to any kind of data\n\n196\n00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.761\nthat produces a fixed link value,\nall right.\n\n197\n00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:11.691\nWell, they have different types of\npassword attacks that rather than actually\n\n198\n00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:15.811\nhaving to compute the hash, right,\nto get that fixed link value,\n\n199\n00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.330\nthey've already got it pretty loaded\nup in the database, all right.\n\n200\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.760\nAnd they have hash values of\nthese common passwords, right.\n\n201\n00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.060\nAnd if we're using these then it's\ngonna make it very, very easy for\n\n202\n00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.865\nthe attacker to just load up that\ndatabase of common passwords or\n\n203\n00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:35.150\nthe hash values associated with it.\n\n204\n00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.872\nAnd run it through this list,\nautomate the process,\n\n205\n00:11:37.872 --> 00:11:41.089\nreally very little computational\npower is gonna be required.\n\n206\n00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:45.752\nAnd sometimes, I've seen them with common\npasswords crack in less than 14 seconds.\n\n207\n00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:51.410\nSo you got to be careful, be very careful,\ndon't use these common strings, right.\n\n208\n00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.532\nWell, what makes these common strings so\ncommon?\n\n209\n00:11:54.532 --> 00:11:59.012\nPeople get lazy, right, now,\nI don't wanna say so much lazy, all right,\n\n210\n00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:01.676\nthat might be a little bit too harsh,\nright.\n\n211\n00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:06.226\nWhat they might be doing is they need more\nconvenience, right, and any time we talk\n\n212\n00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:10.783\nabout security, you increase convenience,\nyou decrease how secure a system is.\n\n213\n00:12:10.783 --> 00:12:13.008\nAny time you increase the security,\n\n214\n00:12:13.008 --> 00:12:17.545\nyou sometimes decease how convenient\nit is to get into the system, right.\n\n215\n00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:21.029\nI could tell you I could implement\nsomething like a password policy and\n\n216\n00:12:21.029 --> 00:12:24.512\ntell you, you have to have a 15\ncharacter password, use all one, or\n\n217\n00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.655\nno you use all of\nthe four characters sets.\n\n218\n00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:30.441\nUppercase, lowercase, letters,\nnumbers and special characters, and\n\n219\n00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:34.285\nwhile my security is going up, my\nconvenience is kinda waning a little bit,\n\n220\n00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:35.705\nit's going down, right?\n\n221\n00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:40.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let me show you another thing too,\n\n222\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.155\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll do a keyboard layout.\n\n223\n00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:48.955\nAnd let me show you how these kind of come\nup, and why they kinda come up, here, so,\n\n224\n00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:50.735\ncommon keyboard layout.\n\n225\n00:12:50.735 --> 00:12:54.185\nI'm sure that some of you probably\nhave different keyboards than this,\n\n226\n00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:56.935\nbut this is your basic keyboards, right.\n\n227\n00:12:56.935 --> 00:13:02.045\nNow, if we were to look at some of those\npasswords you'd see QWERTY comes up\n\n228\n00:13:02.045 --> 00:13:02.775\na lot, right.\n\n229\n00:13:02.775 --> 00:13:03.570\nWhy?\n\n230\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.860\nWell it's just running your\nfinger across the board.\n\n231\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.852\nYou'll see things like Z, X,\nC, V, B, N, M in there, why?\n\n232\n00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:15.730\nIt's easy to just run your\nhands across the keyboard or\n\n233\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.850\nyou'll see 1 all the way to 0, right.\n\n234\n00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.190\nAnd if we look at some of this strings,\nyou'll start to see that,\n\n235\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:27.140\nright, you'll see there's qwerty,\nright, abc123, right, 12345678,\n\n236\n00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.140\nright, we could see things like that too.\n\n237\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.850\nAnd there are other ones too,\nright, but these are common, well,\n\n238\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:40.190\nmonkey, now here's another one,\nall right, notice that these names here.\n\n239\n00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.660\nThese names are also called forbidden\ncharacter strings because of the fact that\n\n240\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.370\nthey contain dictionary words.\n\n241\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.640\nThere's dictionary attacks,\nall I do, load up a database of\n\n242\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.237\nthe Merriam Webster's dictionary,\nand run I your password against it.\n\n243\n00:13:55.237 --> 00:13:58.050\nAnd eventually,\nwe're gonna come up with master,\n\n244\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.520\neventually in that dictionary\nwe'll hit master and guess what?\n\n245\n00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.556\nWe got a password match now\nwe're into your system, so\n\n246\n00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:07.008\nyou wanna avoid common character strings.\n\n247\n00:14:07.008 --> 00:14:10.869\nI call them character strings,\nagain, because the passwords, again,\n\n248\n00:14:10.869 --> 00:14:13.312\ncan be all different kinds of things,\nright.\n\n249\n00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:17.258\nThere we go, zag1zag1 or zaq1zaq1,\nright, no pun intended there, Zach.\n\n250\n00:14:17.258 --> 00:14:18.988\n[LAUGH] But you can see,\n\n251\n00:14:18.988 --> 00:14:24.188\nthat's what they're doing here\nthey're essentially saying,\n\n252\n00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:29.108\nI got 1, 2, 3 QWERTY, right,\nand again it doesn't make for\n\n253\n00:14:29.108 --> 00:14:34.614\na very strong password, and\nin fact quite the opposite so avoid those.\n\n254\n00:14:34.614 --> 00:14:35.911\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was laughing about password,\n\n255\n00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:37.497\nthe word password was\nactually in there often.\n\n256\n00:14:37.497 --> 00:14:41.500\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not is one of the most\ncommon passwords there that we have.\n\n257\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.060\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n258\n00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.890\n&gt;&gt; All right now, moving on,\nwe've got some other things that we\n\n259\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.820\nneed to look at as well, and\nthat is firmware upgrades, all right.\n\n260\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.350\nWhen it comes to firmware upgrades,\nyou have to keep in mind that\n\n261\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.570\nwhen somebody releases a device, all\nright, there might be bugs in the system.\n\n262\n00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.600\nAnd a lot of times,\nit's not if there are bugs in the system,\n\n263\n00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.820\nit's just where are the bugs.\n\n264\n00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.970\nAnd even the best developers,\nthey find things, and it's not bad coding.\n\n265\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.320\nIt's not necessarily anything problem,\nlike developer or\n\n266\n00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.180\nengineer's doing on purpose.\n\n267\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.520\nBut sometimes you have this piece of code,\n[COUGH] works just fine,\n\n268\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.120\ndoes exactly what the developer wants.\n\n269\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.233\nThis piece of code does exactly\nwhat the developer wants but\n\n270\n00:15:15.233 --> 00:15:19.040\nyou put them together and you get\nsome kind of undesired effect, right.\n\n271\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.561\nThat's why we do testing and stuff, but\nsometimes when you have thousands and\n\n272\n00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:24.692\nthousands, tens of\nthousands of line of code,\n\n273\n00:15:24.692 --> 00:15:26.525\nit can slip through the cracks, right.\n\n274\n00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:30.747\nSo when vendors release devices, remember\nwith the firmware, it's gonna control that\n\n275\n00:15:30.747 --> 00:15:34.196\nhardware device, sometimes they'll find,\nand a lot of times they do.\n\n276\n00:15:34.196 --> 00:15:39.046\nThey'll find that there are functionality\nflaws, there are security weaknesses,\n\n277\n00:15:39.046 --> 00:15:41.870\nthere are bugs, and\nwhat they do is they patch it,\n\n278\n00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.721\nright, they patch it\nthrough firmware updates.\n\n279\n00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:48.549\nWell, you have to make sure that\nyou are doing your updates, right,\n\n280\n00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:50.160\nyour upgrades if you will.\n\n281\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.272\nIt's synonymous terms,\nupgrading the firmware,\n\n282\n00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:53.956\nupdating the firmware is the same thing.\n\n283\n00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:57.667\nSo you wanna pay attention to your\ndevice's firmware version that\n\n284\n00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:01.918\nyou're using, and when you do that what\nyou are gonna end up seeing is that.\n\n285\n00:16:01.918 --> 00:16:06.610\nYou can go out to like for instance, your\nvendor's website and you can find out.\n\n286\n00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.440\nWell, what is the current version\nof the firmware that you are on?\n\n287\n00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.570\nWell, that really is contingent\non on the device itself.\n\n288\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.480\nIn fact, let me show you here.\n\n289\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.480\nSo we've got that 8350 up here and I can\ntell that the firmware version, right?\n\n290\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.700\nIt tells me right now, That is 1.0.0.0,\nis this the latest firmware?\n\n291\n00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.930\nI don't know, it really depends on how and\n\n292\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.220\nwhen devices are released, now I can tell\nyou this device was released a while ago.\n\n293\n00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.980\nSo if I ever log into a device that\nI've seen, that's already been out for\n\n294\n00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.570\na couple of years, like years,\nsometimes even six months,\n\n295\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.502\nthree to six months, a year and\nwe're still on 1.0.00,\n\n296\n00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:47.830\nchances are they're not doing their\nupgrades of the firmware, right?\n\n297\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.770\nSo what you need to do here and I believe,\nyep, under Administration here and again,\n\n298\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.840\nit's gonna be unique to every device, but\n\n299\n00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.270\nthis is where you're gonna do\nyour firmware upgrades, right?\n\n300\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.210\nAnd then this is where you\nchoose the file, all right and\n\n301\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.050\nI don't have a file so\nI'm not gonna upload anything.\n\n302\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.700\nAnd then you start the upgrade.\n\n303\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.520\nI will tell you be careful because in\nupgrading your firmware do not interrupt\n\n304\n00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.170\nthe firmware update or you could do\nwhat's called bricking a device.\n\n305\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:18.390\nIf The firmware update is interrupted\nit could corrupt the code in it and\n\n306\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.760\nit could permanently ruin the device.\n\n307\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.970\nSo in upgrading your firmware,\nlet's be careful, a little disclaimer.\n\n308\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.180\nDon't do it when you run the risk\nof the power being lost, all right?\n\n309\n00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.490\nMake sure whatever device it is,\nyou know you got power, you know it's on\n\n310\n00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.040\nsome kind of redundant system maybe or\nit's a very mission critical devices, so\n\n311\n00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:41.430\nthat when you do your upgrades, firmware\nupgrades, it doesn't cause a problem.\n\n312\n00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.150\nNow the other thing that you also have\nto do, we're talking about files, right?\n\n313\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:51.160\nSo if I choose a file, how do I know that\nthis file is actually a valid good file?\n\n314\n00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.160\nAll right, how can I manage and\nmaintain the integrity of the file?\n\n315\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.530\nWell that's where something goes called\nfile hashing come into play for us, right.\n\n316\n00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.360\nWhen I download a piece of software,\nin this case when I\n\n317\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.920\nchoose the file that I'm going to\ndo the firmware upgrade, right.\n\n318\n00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.520\nI can actually go to the manufacture's\nwebsite, I could find out what my version\n\n319\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.290\nis here, and in this case it's 1.0.0\n1.0.00 if I can get that right.\n\n320\n00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:21.780\nThen I go to the manufacturer's website\nand I download the firmware file.\n\n321\n00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.950\nWell, understand, just like we've\nbeen talking about in all network\n\n322\n00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.920\ncommunications, there we\ndo run the risk of errors.\n\n323\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.520\nA lot of times when\nwe're downloading files,\n\n324\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.390\nwe have transmission control protocol and\nit is going to manage and\n\n325\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.790\nmaintain to the segmenting and\nsequencing and it's connection orientated,\n\n326\n00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.490\nit's gonna make sure that our packages\nare delivered in the right order.\n\n327\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.410\nBut when you talk about something that's\nso important, I tell you, be careful.\n\n328\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.560\nMake sure that the firmware\nfile isn't corrupted and\n\n329\n00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.480\ndon't interrupt the firmware upgrade.\n\n330\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.190\nHow can I tell that that\nfile is in corrupted?\n\n331\n00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.640\nWell that's where file\nhashes come into play.\n\n332\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.380\nSo when you have configurations\nthat you have to do,\n\n333\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.060\nwhen you have firmware\nupgrades that you need to do.\n\n334\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.500\nYou need to find out a piece of\nsoftware that you just downloaded.\n\n335\n00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.530\nHas it been modified?\n\n336\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.846\nWell, you look at what it's known as\nthe checksum, the output of the file or\n\n337\n00:19:08.846 --> 00:19:13.598\nthe file hashing is called a message\ndigest so we wanna verify that.\n\n338\n00:19:13.598 --> 00:19:16.517\nLet me go ahead and show you what I mean.\n\n339\n00:19:16.517 --> 00:19:20.870\nSo let me go ahead and we're gonna\nget into our Windows 10 machine,\n\n340\n00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.134\nit looks like it kinda paused on me.\n\n341\n00:19:23.134 --> 00:19:26.606\nBut let's go ahead and we will get\ninto our Windows 10 machine and\n\n342\n00:19:26.606 --> 00:19:29.580\nI'll show you exactly what I mean,\nall right.\n\n343\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.570\nSo I've got this little quick\nhash program, all right.\n\n344\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.700\nAnd let's go ahead, I'll tell you what,\nwe'll create a document here on\n\n345\n00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:44.020\nthe desktop, all right, and\nlet's say this is my FirmwareCode.\n\n346\n00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.980\nThe name on the file isn't,\nwe don't need to worry about that.\n\n347\n00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.894\nBut I'm gonna say This is amazing\n\n348\n00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:57.970\ndev code right, so all you\n\n349\n00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.220\nprogrammers out there can see that I know\nabsolutely nothing about programming.\n\n350\n00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.930\nBut we can say okay, so here is\nthe information that's in that file,\n\n351\n00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.180\nall right?\n\n352\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.550\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna save it I'm gonna close it down.\n\n353\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.770\nNow, when we talk about file hashing we've\ngot a certain set of algorithms that we\n\n354\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.350\ncan use right, like message digest,\nsecure hashing algorithm.\n\n355\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.318\nBut, you also have to be careful on\nwhich one you use, the greater the bit\n\n356\n00:20:24.318 --> 00:20:28.000\nlength on it, the harder it is\nto reverse engineer it, right.\n\n357\n00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.670\nSo I´m gonna ahead and\n\n358\n00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.090\nuse SHA256, that´s a secure hashing\nalgorithm at 256 bit length.\n\n359\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.320\nAnd then,\nwhat I´m gonna go ahead and do is,\n\n360\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.970\nI'm gonna essentially say, all right,\nyou know what, I'll select the file.\n\n361\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.110\nIn this case, let´s just go down\nthe imaginary road of make believe,\n\n362\n00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.028\nand let´s just say this is my first\nfirmware upgrade that I just downloaded.\n\n363\n00:20:46.028 --> 00:20:48.840\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well I go ahead and\n\n364\n00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:56.530\nI open it and notice that we get\nthis value right here, right.\n\n365\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.709\nWell, when the manufacturer\nreleases a firmware upgrade or\n\n366\n00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:03.571\neven pieces of software, what they'll\ndo is they'll take this value and\n\n367\n00:21:03.571 --> 00:21:07.965\nthen they'll put it up on their website up\nto the file that you're gonna download.\n\n368\n00:21:07.965 --> 00:21:10.580\nThey're gonna say, here's the fixed\nlink value or here's the hash value.\n\n369\n00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.860\nA lot of times it'll just\nsay here's a checksum.\n\n370\n00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:18.308\nand they will let you know\nthat it was created with MD5,\n\n371\n00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:22.660\nSHA-1, SHA256, again, greater bit lengths\ntypically mean longer fixed values.\n\n372\n00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.150\nLonger fixed values mean a little\nbit more secure for us so\n\n373\n00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.500\nit's a little bit harder to reverse\nengineer how they got that value or\n\n374\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.020\ncaused what's called\na hashing collision right?\n\n375\n00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.150\nNow what my job is as an administrator\nto make sure that when I'm doing device\n\n376\n00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.620\nhardening I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna copy this, right?\n\n377\n00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.940\nI'm gonna copy this fixed value that\nthe vendor just told me, all right?\n\n378\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.450\nAnd then what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n379\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.600\nI'm gonna select that file, right?\n\n380\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:54.040\nAnd I'm gonna run it through the hashing\nalgorithm itself, all right.\n\n381\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.540\nAnd let me go ahead and redo that,\nlet me select the file there and I run it.\n\n382\n00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.430\nI do the same thing, the same calculation.\n\n383\n00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.670\nAnd then what I do is I compare the two.\n\n384\n00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.740\nSo all I'm doing is pasting\nthe value that I copied earlier,\n\n385\n00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.050\nthe one that the manufacturer\nwould tell me.\n\n386\n00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.020\nNotice it said expected hash\nmatches the computed file hash.\n\n387\n00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.390\nSo I've got a one-to-one comparison\nhere and the values are identical.\n\n388\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.280\nThat means that I can tell not\na single bit, and I mean bit, B-I-T,\n\n389\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.830\nas in bit in the binary,\nhas been modified in this file at all,\n\n390\n00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.060\nall right, and that let's me know\nthat it has maintained its integrity.\n\n391\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.240\nAnd specially with upgrading firmware\nyou wanna make sure that there's not\n\n392\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.890\na modification, right, whether it's\nmaliciously or through network error.\n\n393\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.830\nNotice what happens,\nI'm gonna reopen this.\n\n394\n00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.475\nNow I want you to pay attention Zach.\n\n395\n00:22:42.475 --> 00:22:43.010\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n396\n00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'm gonna ahead and\nI'm gonna put blank space in there,\n\n397\n00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.695\nthat's all I did just a blank space,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and save it.\n\n398\n00:22:50.695 --> 00:22:55.565\nAll right now remember,\nI looked at the manufacturer's,\n\n399\n00:22:55.565 --> 00:22:57.135\nwe're still in make believe.\n\n400\n00:22:57.135 --> 00:23:01.495\nI looked at the manufacturer's web site\nand I got this hash value earlier.\n\n401\n00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:03.185\nI just pasted it in here.\n\n402\n00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:10.260\nDownloaded my file I put that\nfile in this hashing utility,\n\n403\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.760\nI choose Open and\nit compares the hash value and\n\n404\n00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.160\nthe expected harsh value does not match,\nall but just the blank character.\n\n405\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.531\nIt changes the results,\nthe output just with the blank character,\n\n406\n00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:26.993\nlet alone if there's\nan actual real modifications.\n\n407\n00:23:26.993 --> 00:23:29.604\nIt says hey,\nI ran that same algorithm across here and\n\n408\n00:23:29.604 --> 00:23:31.230\nI know what you're expecting.\n\n409\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.270\nThe vendor told you\nwhat you should expect.\n\n410\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.390\nBut when I run it across there,\nI'm getting two different things.\n\n411\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.990\nSo that lets me know there's a warning,\nsomething wrong with the file.\n\n412\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.390\nI should discard it and\nre-download it, all right.\n\n413\n00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:46.660\nSo that is a great way to understand\nwhat's going on with file hashing, right.\n\n414\n00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.581\nIt ensures that the file that you\ndownload, the file that you have\n\n415\n00:23:51.581 --> 00:23:56.427\nis in the same state as expected,\nright, and it's a great way.\n\n416\n00:23:56.427 --> 00:24:01.392\nWe wouldn't even know that just a single\nblank character like that inside of\n\n417\n00:24:01.392 --> 00:24:03.807\nyour program would cause a problem.\n\n418\n00:24:03.807 --> 00:24:08.235\nNow, we also have things like, for\ninstance, patching and updating,\n\n419\n00:24:08.235 --> 00:24:11.370\nfirmware could kinda fall under that too,\nright?\n\n420\n00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:14.595\nUpdating, upgrading your firmware,\nagain, patching,\n\n421\n00:24:14.595 --> 00:24:16.666\nwe talk about things like in Windows.\n\n422\n00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:19.590\nWe wanna do Windows updates,\nsoftware applications,\n\n423\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.040\nyou wanna make sure that they're updated.\n\n424\n00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.604\nWe're looking at network devices right?\n\n425\n00:24:24.604 --> 00:24:28.880\nSo if you have functionality flaws, or\nif you have these devices on your network.\n\n426\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.845\nYou wanna make sure that you're paying\nattention to the manufacturer's\n\n427\n00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:34.156\nrecommendations for updates,\nthey might release one.\n\n428\n00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:35.891\nIn fact let's go to our\nWindows machine here.\n\n429\n00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:44.070\nI'll show you one that actually\ncame across our radar awhile back.\n\n430\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.457\nAt the time of this recording\nwe're a few weeks out now,\n\n431\n00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:52.301\nI think about a month now from an attack\nthat was a key re-installation attack.\n\n432\n00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:54.005\nThey called it crack attack, right?\n\n433\n00:24:54.005 --> 00:24:57.275\nAnd there was another one there\ntoo that was called a attack.\n\n434\n00:24:57.275 --> 00:25:00.641\nAnd there were some problems\nwith things in Windows the TPM,\n\n435\n00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:02.357\nthe Trusted Platform Module.\n\n436\n00:25:02.357 --> 00:25:07.144\nAnd this is supposed to be a secure\ndevice, secure cryptographic processor,\n\n437\n00:25:07.144 --> 00:25:08.968\nbut they found attacks to it.\n\n438\n00:25:08.968 --> 00:25:11.779\nWell, Microsoft went ahead and\nthey updated it.\n\n439\n00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:16.603\nBut you have to have your Windows Updates\nturned on in order to patch the system,\n\n440\n00:25:16.603 --> 00:25:19.206\nagain patching and updates is important.\n\n441\n00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:22.469\nSo if I go down to Update &amp;\nSecurity here and we go in,\n\n442\n00:25:22.469 --> 00:25:24.781\nfor instance to our Windows Update.\n\n443\n00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:28.550\nAll right, you can see here that it´s\ntelling me there's a cumulative update.\n\n444\n00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.761\nAnd this isn't really the one I want.\n\n445\n00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.972\nSo let me go ahead and\ndo a Update History.\n\n446\n00:25:32.972 --> 00:25:38.710\nAnd you know what, it's not gonna\nbe there so, one more place here.\n\n447\n00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.300\nLet me go ahead and,\n\n448\n00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.150\nI'm gonna have to uninstall it cuz\nit's not showing up here on the list.\n\n449\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.390\nBut there is one here that\ndoes show up in the list.\n\n450\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.900\nNotice that I have some security updates.\n\n451\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.833\nIn fact, this security update,\nZach, I'm gonna tell you,\n\n452\n00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:51.847\nI don't really know what it is.\n\n453\n00:25:51.847 --> 00:25:53.928\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I do know what this one is.\n\n454\n00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:54.943\n&gt;&gt; Well, that makes me feel secure.\n\n455\n00:25:54.943 --> 00:25:56.736\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good [LAUGH].\n\n456\n00:25:56.736 --> 00:26:00.050\nBut I do know what this one is\nbecause it's so important, right?\n\n457\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.070\nAnd the great thing is if you're\nupdating and patching your systems and\n\n458\n00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.140\nyou make sure that it\nhappens you're secure, right?\n\n459\n00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.170\nOr at least that's the goal.\n\n460\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.550\nYou might have a patch management platform\nin which you have a systematic approach to\n\n461\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.780\ndownloading, basically testing and\ndeploying your patches as well.\n\n462\n00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.399\nBut if I know what this\nsecurity update's for, or\n\n463\n00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:25.426\nI don't know what it's for I should say.\n\n464\n00:26:25.426 --> 00:26:28.314\nI can just check out the knowledge\nbase article, all right?\n\n465\n00:26:28.314 --> 00:26:32.224\nAnd if I do that, if I want a little bit\nmore information, well we can find out,\n\n466\n00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:35.331\nwe just go ahead and\ntype that into the search engine, right?\n\n467\n00:26:35.331 --> 00:26:41.150\nThat KB article number and it tells\nme a little bit about this update.\n\n468\n00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.660\nAnd I can go right to the vendor,\nin this case Microsoft, and\n\n469\n00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.790\nI can find out all these kinds\nof improvements and fixes.\n\n470\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.024\nAnd that's why we want updates and\npatches.\n\n471\n00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:52.219\nNow I could sit here and\nbore you guys which I'm not going to do,\n\n472\n00:26:52.219 --> 00:26:56.101\nguys and gals, out there with all\nthe different things that this might fix.\n\n473\n00:26:56.101 --> 00:27:00.989\nBut what I'm looking for specifically\nas it has to do with things like\n\n474\n00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:04.205\nyour network device hardening, all right?\n\n475\n00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:09.009\nIf this happened to be a server,\nI'd probably want to make sure that things\n\n476\n00:27:09.009 --> 00:27:12.216\nlike Windows Authentication,\nthe Windows TPM,\n\n477\n00:27:12.216 --> 00:27:16.975\nthe Trusted Platform Module,\nDevice Guard, our Wireless Networking.\n\n478\n00:27:16.975 --> 00:27:20.120\nWhich by the way was that key\nre-installation attack that we were\n\n479\n00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.320\ntalking about.\n\n480\n00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.383\nNotice all the things that it fixes,\nright?\n\n481\n00:27:23.383 --> 00:27:27.588\nIt fixes authentication problems,\nthe TPM issues, Device Guard issues, and\n\n482\n00:27:27.588 --> 00:27:29.356\nin this case wireless networks.\n\n483\n00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:34.670\nSo they patched the crack or\nthe kiwi installation attack,\n\n484\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:39.252\nthey patched the attack all in one update.\n\n485\n00:27:39.252 --> 00:27:42.471\nAnd if you weren't updating or\npatching your systems or\n\n486\n00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:47.074\ndidn't have a systematic approach through\npatch management to deploy these.\n\n487\n00:27:47.074 --> 00:27:50.376\nYour system's attack surface\nwould be a lot greater, right?\n\n488\n00:27:50.376 --> 00:27:54.479\nSo again, it's about reducing\nthe size of the attack surface.\n\n489\n00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:57.751\n&gt;&gt; So Wes in general it's a good\nidea to have automatic updates?\n\n490\n00:27:57.751 --> 00:27:59.159\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n491\n00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:03.610\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, now there are a few\nmore things that we have to talk about.\n\n492\n00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.110\nBut it does look like\nspeaking talking about,\n\n493\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.290\nI've talked way too much in this episode\nso we're gonna come back with a part two.\n\n494\n00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.670\n&gt;&gt; Good a network device hardening\npart two coming your way.\n\n495\n00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:13.890\nThis has been part one.\n\n496\n00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.040\nAnd make sure you see everything\nin that CompTIA Net+ series Wes is\n\n497\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.420\nputting together for you,\nbecause he's doing a great job.\n\n498\n00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.420\nAnd while you're in the course library\nthere's hundreds of other videos there.\n\n499\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.450\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n500\n00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.200\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be very glad you

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.095\nWelcome to ITProTV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n2\n00:00:03.095 --> 00:00:06.553\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.553 --> 00:00:08.362\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.162\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:15.990\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.880\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA Net+,\n\n8\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.475\nhardening network devices.\n\n9\n00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:25.460\nI'm gonna say that again,\nnetwork device hardening part two.\n\n10\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.070\nAnd the person that's bringing us\nthe rest of the information we need for\n\n11\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.300\nthis series is Wes Bryan.\n\n12\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.200\nHey, Wes, good to see you.\n\n13\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Zach, great to see you.\n\n14\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.080\nAnd you know what?\n\n15\n00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.524\nI don't really think it matters whether\nyou say hardening network devices or\n\n16\n00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:36.471\nnetwork devices hardening.\n\n17\n00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:38.000\n&gt;&gt; Tomato, tomato.\n\n18\n00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.450\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nI think it's gonna be the same thing.\n\n19\n00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.310\nNow like Zach said, we're coming back\nwith a part two cuz we got a few\n\n20\n00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.990\nloose ends that we kinda want to tie off\nhere and make sure that you are aware.\n\n21\n00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.110\nAnd we definitely want to be\nthorough in our objective coverage.\n\n22\n00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.600\nSo it might be a little bit of a shorter\nepisode here, but you know what?\n\n23\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.980\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe will continue right where we left off.\n\n24\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.210\nNow, if it's the first time you're\njoining us, definitely watch part one and\n\n25\n00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.640\ncome back and\nwatch us again here in part two.\n\n26\n00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.350\nBut I will tell you we gotta just mention\nreal briefly, again, what hardening is.\n\n27\n00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.300\nRemember what we're trying to do\nis we're trying to shorten that or\n\n28\n00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.910\nmake that attack surface smaller, right.\n\n29\n00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.590\nRemember, the bigger the target on your\nchest the easier it is to hit the chest,\n\n30\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020\nlet alone the bullseye, right?\n\n31\n00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.900\nAnd the more we secure our devices,\nthe more we do\n\n32\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.750\nthings like steering away from defaults,\nthings that we're not using,\n\n33\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.110\nturning them off, we're gonna\nshrink the size of that bullseye.\n\n34\n00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.750\nWe're shrinking our attack surface and\nhopefully giving the attackers less\n\n35\n00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.690\navenue, or less vulnerabilities,\nto potentially exploit.\n\n36\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.452\n&gt;&gt; Well, what I wanted to ask\nyou right off the bat here, Wes,\n\n37\n00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:45.330\nis if you're trying to harden a device,\n\n38\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.730\nright, sometimes you have to disable\nsome services, is that correct?\n\n39\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.600\n&gt;&gt; You certainly do because sometimes\nby default, software's a great example.\n\n40\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.382\nAnd you might say, well, wait a second,\nWes, this doesn't say software hardening.\n\n41\n00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.430\nWell, network devices, what do they run?\n\n42\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.023\nThey run software, and sometimes in\nproviding a service or providing a role,\n\n43\n00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:09.337\na functionality on our networks,\nthat device you might install a piece of\n\n44\n00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.134\nsoftware on it that has some defaults,\nright.\n\n45\n00:02:12.134 --> 00:02:14.896\nWell, you say well, wait a second,\nyou said steer away from the defaults,\n\n46\n00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:16.200\nwe've already talked about that.\n\n47\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360\nWell, the default configuration might\nhave services that are turned on that\n\n48\n00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.400\nyou don't necessarily need or\nin this case maybe don't even want.\n\n49\n00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.075\nLet me give you an example, right.\n\n50\n00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:31.147\nSo for instance, MSSQL,\nMicrosoft SQL Server, right,\n\n51\n00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:34.314\ngreat product,\nnot by any means downing it.\n\n52\n00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:35.519\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But by default,\n\n53\n00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.978\nsometimes you'll install piece\nof software that needs MSSQL,\n\n54\n00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:43.043\nMicrosoft SQL Server Reporting Services.\n\n55\n00:02:43.043 --> 00:02:47.010\nAnd it's turned on by default, or\nmay be you don't need that is what l say.\n\n56\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.840\nYou're installing a piece of software and\nit installs that service and\n\n57\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.010\nnow we've got network\nfunctionality that's going on,\n\n58\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.460\nnetwork communications that\nare just really unnecessary, right?\n\n59\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.310\nMaybe I don't need\nthe SQL Reporting Services, right?\n\n60\n00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.490\nSo we need to make sure that we figure\nout if we do install a piece of software\n\n61\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.060\nthat if it's turned a service on and\nwe don't need that service.\n\n62\n00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.040\nBut again we're shrinking up\nthat attack surface, right?\n\n63\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.710\nThings like network discovery services,\nright?\n\n64\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.199\nNetwork discovery services make\nme visible on the network.\n\n65\n00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:21.191\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n66\n00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:25.360\nSo we got a Windows 10 machine we've\nbeen kind of working with here.\n\n67\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.230\nAnd if I just kinda dig down into\nmy settings, and then go to,\n\n68\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.030\nwhere do we wanna go to?\n\n69\n00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.190\nWe'll go to Network and\nInternet, all right?\n\n70\n00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.400\nAnd you can tell, I love it,\nthe new interfaces.\n\n71\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.080\nHey, you don't have Internet access.\n\n72\n00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.130\nThat's okay.\n\n73\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.335\nBut what I want wanna look at\nis something like, for instance,\n\n74\n00:03:40.335 --> 00:03:44.155\nif we're gonna change the network,\nwe'll go back to the old Control Panel and\n\n75\n00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:46.455\ngo to Network and Sharing Center here.\n\n76\n00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:49.872\nAnd notice that we have some\nadvanced sharing settings.\n\n77\n00:03:49.872 --> 00:03:53.134\nWell, the advanced sharing settings\nhave things like, for instance,\n\n78\n00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:54.795\nthis is a good thing, all right.\n\n79\n00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:58.870\nThis is actually a really good thing\nbecause based on my network profile it's\n\n80\n00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.040\nactually got it turned off, right.\n\n81\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.754\nBut based on your choice, right, when you\nfirst install an operating system and\n\n82\n00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:07.593\nyou connect to a network for\nthe very first time, it asks you,\n\n83\n00:04:07.593 --> 00:04:09.795\ndo you want to be\ndiscoverable on this network?\n\n84\n00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:12.880\nAll right, and this could be a user\nthat's configuring it, right.\n\n85\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.650\nAnd they're not reading anything,\nthey just, yes, it's gotta be good,\n\n86\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.080\nwhatever it is, right.\n\n87\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.990\nNotice what it does.\n\n88\n00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.970\nWhen network discovery is turned on, this\ncomputer can see other network computers\n\n89\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.740\nand devices and\nis visible to other network computers.\n\n90\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.820\nAll right, well, if it's a client,\nmaybe I'm not so worried about it.\n\n91\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.810\nBut other things like, for instance,\nfile and printer sharing, all right?\n\n92\n00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.221\nWell, I don't have a network share,\nI'm not sharing folders, right.\n\n93\n00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:48.210\nI don't have a printer\nconnected to this machine.\n\n94\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.370\nSo why would I want that turned on, right?\n\n95\n00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.180\nIf it is turned on I\nwant to come in here and\n\n96\n00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.310\nrather than have it turned on I want\nto make sure that it's turned off.\n\n97\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.680\nSo this is important, right?\n\n98\n00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.510\nWe're reducing the attack surface.\n\n99\n00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.510\nAnd the interesting thing is if\nI get over to my server as well.\n\n100\n00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.020\nAnd my head's kind of covering it up, but\n\n101\n00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.730\nif I right-click on my little monitor icon\nwith the little RJ-45 jack in front of it.\n\n102\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.650\nAnd I choose advanced sharing settings.\n\n103\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.050\nNotice that I also have the same\nsettings on our servers, and\n\n104\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.355\nnotice here Turn on file and\nprinter sharing.\n\n105\n00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n106\n00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.665\n&gt;&gt; Well, do I need that on?\n\n107\n00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:22.230\nI'm not sure, right?\n\n108\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.750\nIt's never a one size fits all.\n\n109\n00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.949\nIt really is contingent on the role that\nthe device is playing on your network,\n\n110\n00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.770\nwhether you need this on or not, right?\n\n111\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.780\nNow if it's a print server,\nI want print sharing on, right?\n\n112\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.970\nBut if this role that's installed on\nthis machine isn't a print server,\n\n113\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.390\nmaybe I wanna turn that off.\n\n114\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.190\nAgain, there's never a one\nsize fits all on this.\n\n115\n00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.430\nAnd even more so, again if we jump\nback over to our client, right,\n\n116\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.600\nyou might see that there\nare a bunch of services, right?\n\n117\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.231\nIf I bring up my services console here and\nwe kinda drill down into that, you'll\n\n118\n00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:59.214\nsee that there are a great many services\nthat are running in the background, right.\n\n119\n00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:03.850\nAnd I can see, in fact,\nlet's go ahead and re-sort this, right.\n\n120\n00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.750\nI can see things that are already\nturned on by default.\n\n121\n00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.490\nI didn't turn them on.\n\n122\n00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.740\nDo I need them?\n\n123\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.910\nI don't know.\n\n124\n00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.480\nHere's one, look at this,\nGeolocation Service.\n\n125\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.320\nIf I look at the service it tells me, this\nservice monitors your current location of\n\n126\n00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.730\nthe system and manages geofences.\n\n127\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.770\nTurning off this service,\napplications will be unable too use and\n\n128\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.290\nreceive notifications for\ngeolocation or geofences.\n\n129\n00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.360\nMaybe we're not doing geofencing.\n\n130\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.660\nI don't want people to see\nthe location of this device, right.\n\n131\n00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.948\nNow, that's one of the things where we\nmight want to turn that service off,\n\n132\n00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:37.460\nright, it's important.\n\n133\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.190\nSo for instance, there are other things,\ntoo, things like, for instance, Telnet.\n\n134\n00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.630\nNow Telnet falls under a couple of things\nthat we might want to talk about too,\n\n135\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.220\nZach.\n\n136\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.932\nTelnet, if I'm not using\nTelnet on my machine,\n\n137\n00:06:47.932 --> 00:06:50.470\nsomething you really shouldn't be.\n\n138\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.760\nBut I need to disable it, all right.\n\n139\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.200\nNow, the reason I said it also falls\nunder another category is we also gotta\n\n140\n00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.920\ntalk about things like, for\ninstance, unsecure protocols.\n\n141\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.270\nThey call using secure protocols.\n\n142\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.440\nI shouldn't be using Telnet at all, right.\n\n143\n00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.808\nBecause we've talked about, one of its\nmajor drawbacks really is the fact that,\n\n144\n00:07:08.808 --> 00:07:12.830\nagain, we're gonna go down\nan imaginary road here, right.\n\n145\n00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.380\nSo if Zach happens to be a server\nthat I need to connect to and\n\n146\n00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.885\nI connect over the network to Zach's\nas a server with Telnet, all right.\n\n147\n00:07:20.885 --> 00:07:24.311\nAnd somebody's out there on the network\nand they're running, I don't know,\n\n148\n00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.880\nwireless packet analyzer, right,\npacket capture protocol analyzer, right.\n\n149\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.610\nThey can see things like my login.\n\n150\n00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.210\nThey can see things like,\nnot only the credentials,\n\n151\n00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.090\nthey can see the commands\nthat I'm issuing, right?\n\n152\n00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.000\nBecause it's a clear text protocol.\n\n153\n00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.440\nSo instead what I need to be\ndoing is disabling Telnet cuz you\n\n154\n00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.870\nshouldn't be using it, but\nif it is on it's an unnecessary service.\n\n155\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.251\nAnd I should be switching over to\nsomething like SSH, right, secure shell.\n\n156\n00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:50.151\nBecause now if I connect to,\nlet's say, again,\n\n157\n00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.985\nconnect to the server that Zach's running\nas an administrator and I do it over SSH,\n\n158\n00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.415\nnow we're using public key cryptology.\n\n159\n00:07:57.415 --> 00:07:59.505\nWe got encryption.\n\n160\n00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:02.456\nBetween myself and\nZach's server as the administrator and\n\n161\n00:08:02.456 --> 00:08:05.112\nbecause of the encryption\nwe get the confidentiality\n\n162\n00:08:05.112 --> 00:08:08.534\nthat picked somebody that is running\nsome kinda protocol analyzer,\n\n163\n00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:12.550\nmakes it a little bit harder for\nthem to kinda see what's going on, right?\n\n164\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.860\nThings like ICMP, right?\n\n165\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.620\nInternet Control Message Access Protocol\nor Internet Control Message Protocol,\n\n166\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.127\nI get it right?\n\n167\n00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:28.350\nICMP, if you don't require ICMP,\ndisable it.\n\n168\n00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:32.530\nAnd in fact, a lot of people do disable\nthat service just because they don't\n\n169\n00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:37.380\nwant to be running things like ping sweeps\nand find the location of a machine just by\n\n170\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.670\npinging it or just by running a piece\nof software, right, like Nmap, right?\n\n171\n00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.660\nThat's a network scanner.\n\n172\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.600\nThey can do a ping sweep and find out\nall the active host on your network cuz\n\n173\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.420\nI return the replies back, right.\n\n174\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.810\nSo that might be a service\nthat you want to disable.\n\n175\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.597\n&gt;&gt; And just a real quick, Wes,\n\n176\n00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:55.300\njust because you've disabled it\ndoesn't mean you can't go back and\n\n177\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.000\nenable it later.\n\n178\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, absolutely, so again, best\npractices says, disable it now, right?\n\n179\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.640\nAnd then if you need it,\nopen it back up, right?\n\n180\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.500\nAgain, maybe you decide two months down\nthe way that you need to monitor a device.\n\n181\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.790\nWell, if I'm not monitoring\ndevice at the time,\n\n182\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.020\nmaybe I wanna disable SNMP,\nsimple network management protocol, right.\n\n183\n00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.307\nIf I'm not using this SNMP, I certainly\ndon't want it communicating the status\n\n184\n00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:27.271\nover the network and\nits condition, its iterations and\n\n185\n00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:30.927\nstuff like that where somebody could\npotentially gain access to that\n\n186\n00:09:30.927 --> 00:09:34.864\ninformation even worse when I never\nneeded it in the first place, right.\n\n187\n00:09:34.864 --> 00:09:38.834\nKeep in mind that a lot of\nthe connectivity devices will ship out of\n\n188\n00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:42.210\nthe box with services that\nare enabled by default.\n\n189\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n190\n00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.650\n&gt;&gt; So you wanna, we've already talked\nabout that, I think we did a good job of\n\n191\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.090\nestablishing that in the first place but,\nagain, it also lends itself to,\n\n192\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.450\nfor instance, disabling those services.\n\n193\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.640\nNow the other thing that you might wanna\nknow is what services can I disable?\n\n194\n00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.610\nWhat services can't I disable?\n\n195\n00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.545\nWell, I don't really know.\n\n196\n00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:05.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Honestly.\n\n197\n00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.050\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait timeout.\n\n198\n00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.790\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n199\n00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.190\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what services\nyou can disable, right.\n\n200\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.950\nCuz in disabling on service you might\nbreak a dependency that another service\n\n201\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:14.680\nhas.\n\n202\n00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.450\nSo where can we find out that information?\n\n203\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.590\nWell, let me show you, right.\n\n204\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:24.200\nSo if I wanted to go to Windows, there we\ngo so, in fact Google is reading my mind.\n\n205\n00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.850\nMaybe this is a tin foil hat.\n\n206\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.360\nNotice, Windows server\nsecurity best practices.\n\n207\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.110\nWell, wouldn't it be nice to just go to\nMicrosoft and find out, Checklist for\n\n208\n00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.760\nSecurity Best Practices here, right?\n\n209\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.120\nAnd we can go ahead and click on this.\n\n210\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.400\nWe're gonna go right to Microsoft and\nwe're gonna find out,\n\n211\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.700\nwhat is their best practice for\nsecurity configuration, right?\n\n212\n00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.060\nThey tell us, right?\n\n213\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.780\nPhysically secure your computer.\n\n214\n00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.580\nNow this is something we've\nalready talked about.\n\n215\n00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.870\nApply security updates, right.\n\n216\n00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.670\nProtect against unauthorized\nadministrators, right.\n\n217\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.410\nDo secure base lines, defence and\ndepth, a layered defence system, right.\n\n218\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.750\nSo keep that in mind, right.\n\n219\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.730\nSo you have a best practices\nguides to follow, right.\n\n220\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.803\nIt's really good to at least\nget a baseline of what\n\n221\n00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:09.863\nyou should be turning off right.\n\n222\n00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:14.430\nCuz I can't tell you In Linux,\nright, if you got a Linux server up.\n\n223\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.730\nAre you running a web server,\n\n224\n00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.400\nwell if not why have\nthe Apache Daemon turned on, right.\n\n225\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.920\nTurn it off, disable it right.\n\n226\n00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.920\nThere's should be no reason to do\nthe whole LAMP installation right, Linux,\n\n227\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.380\nApache what is it MySQL on PERL or\nPHP, right.\n\n228\n00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.680\nIf I don't need all of those\nadditional technologies cuz I'm not\n\n229\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.360\ngonna run a web server, why install it?\n\n230\n00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.160\nThis isn't the time to say, I will\ninstall just in case I need it, right.\n\n231\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.670\nBetter than need it and not have it than\nhave it and, wait a second, have it and\n\n232\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.480\nnot need it than need it and not have it.\n\n233\n00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.050\nNot in security,\nyou don't need it, disable it.\n\n234\n00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.340\nIt's better better than have\nit if you don't need it.\n\n235\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.140\nSo it does lend itself to that.\n\n236\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.600\nBut you can always check out things like\nthis, like the security fundamentals or\n\n237\n00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.150\nsecurity best practices, all right?.\n\n238\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:04.280\nNow, that leads us into another\ntopic that I kind of touch base on.\n\n239\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.590\nAnd that's using secure protocols,\nall right?\n\n240\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.340\nWe talk about using secure protocols.\n\n241\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.490\nReally, in just talking\nabout the protocols,\n\n242\n00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.270\nwe've already established\nthis in other episodes.\n\n243\n00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.900\nBut it, again, we should remention it here\n\n244\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.535\nbecause we're talking about\nnetwork device hardening, right?\n\n245\n00:12:22.535 --> 00:12:27.479\nUse HTTPS, right,\nHTTP over secure socket layer, right.\n\n246\n00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:31.451\nNow, technically today it's typically\nTLS that's doing the security, but\n\n247\n00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.122\nthe regardless is I get the encryption\nbetween myself and the endpoint,\n\n248\n00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:39.092\nmyself and the web server so that people\ncannot eavesdrop on what's going on in\n\n249\n00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:42.737\nthe communications between the client and\nthe web server themselves.\n\n250\n00:12:42.737 --> 00:12:45.440\nWe've mentioned already here\nin this episode Telnet.\n\n251\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.231\nTelnet is a plain clear text\ncommunication and I should be using SSH,\n\n252\n00:12:50.231 --> 00:12:53.297\nI should not be using Telnet today, right.\n\n253\n00:12:53.297 --> 00:12:57.442\nIf you are using SSH, are you using SSH1?\n\n254\n00:12:57.442 --> 00:13:00.229\nProbably should be using SSH2, right,\n\n255\n00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:03.850\nit's the more secure more robust protocol,\nright.\n\n256\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.380\nSNMP, we've talked about using\nsimple net management protocol.\n\n257\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.823\nWe'll talk more about databases in other\nepisodes, too, but are you using SNMP1?\n\n258\n00:13:12.823 --> 00:13:14.450\nYou shouldn't be, right.\n\n259\n00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.670\nAre you using SNMP2?\n\n260\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.290\nWell you really shouldn't be using that\nunless you're on an air gapped completely\n\n261\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.550\nisolated network, with no possible way for\nsomeone to physically plug into to your\n\n262\n00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.750\nnetwork then maybe but\nyou should be using SNMP3, right?\n\n263\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.780\nIt's the more secure of all the different\nthree versions of that protocol, right?\n\n264\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.910\nThings like WEP,\nwe shouldn't be using WEP, right?\n\n265\n00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.100\nWe should be using WPA2, right?\n\n266\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.650\nWe shouldn't be using WPA by itself,\nagain,\n\n267\n00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.418\nbecause it's the stronger of the protocol.\n\n268\n00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:49.840\nDisable WPS, WiFi protected setup\nbecause it has issues, too.\n\n269\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.920\nSo steer away from using unsecure\nprotocols by making sure you're\n\n270\n00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.500\nusing secure protocols and in doing so,\nreducing that attack surface even more,\n\n271\n00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.880\nthereby increasing your resiliency,\nif you will, to attacks.\n\n272\n00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.620\nAll right, couple other things\nthat they talk about here,\n\n273\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.450\nZach they mentioned things\nlike generating new keys.\n\n274\n00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.400\nAll right, one of the things that we've\nmentioned in our wireless communications,\n\n275\n00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.630\nright, or\nwireless in general is we said hey,\n\n276\n00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.000\nit was a problem with\nthe wired equivalent privacy.\n\n277\n00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.140\nNobody should be using that today because\nit's a static key it never changes.\n\n278\n00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.776\nAnytime you have something that is\nstatic like that that never changes,\n\n279\n00:14:26.776 --> 00:14:31.868\nyou're giving the attacker as much time\nas they need to take advantage of that.\n\n280\n00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:34.267\nBut if we have something that's temporal,\nright,\n\n281\n00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:37.701\nthat's one of the reasons the IEEE\nintroduced, or WiFi lines if you will,\n\n282\n00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:40.223\nintroduced TKIP,\ntemporal key integrity protocol.\n\n283\n00:14:40.223 --> 00:14:43.363\nBecause the thought process was\nthere if I have an ephemeral key and\n\n284\n00:14:43.363 --> 00:14:47.530\nI generate a new one every time I send\na frame across the 802.11 network.\n\n285\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.460\nThen sure crack the first key but\n\n286\n00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.090\nby the time you've cracked that\nfirst key the second data packet or\n\n287\n00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.940\nframe if you will in that communication is\nnow encrypted with a completely new key,\n\n288\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.810\nit's one of the reasons we use\nthings like one time passwords.\n\n289\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.800\nOne time passwords means I\ngive that one time password to\n\n290\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.940\nZach here he can use it that one time for\nwhatever the authentication might be but\n\n291\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.610\nafter that its not good.\n\n292\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.860\nAll right, but we do even more than that.\n\n293\n00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.720\nWe use a TOTP, right?\n\n294\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.990\nA timed one-time password that says Zach,\nI'll give you that password, but\n\n295\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.940\nif you don't use that one time\npassword within the next 30 seconds,\n\n296\n00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.660\nwe're gonna discard it and\ngenerate a new key, right?\n\n297\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.936\nAgain, any time a key is temporal or\nephemeral, if you will,\n\n298\n00:15:29.936 --> 00:15:34.220\nmeaning lasting just for a short time and\nyou generate a new key, you're again,\n\n299\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.874\nincreasing the resilience to things\nlike password based attacks and\n\n300\n00:15:37.874 --> 00:15:41.790\nyou're also making that system\na little bit more secure.\n\n301\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.957\nSo do keep that in mind as well.\n\n302\n00:15:43.957 --> 00:15:47.817\nNow one of the last things that\nthey talk about here is a very,\n\n303\n00:15:47.817 --> 00:15:52.511\nvery important concept that people need\nto be aware of and that is they talk\n\n304\n00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:57.074\nabout disabling unused ports whether\nit's an IP port or a device port.\n\n305\n00:15:57.074 --> 00:15:59.857\nNow, what do they mean by,\nwhat's the difference, right?\n\n306\n00:15:59.857 --> 00:16:04.520\nWell, an IP port is a logical identifier,\nit's inside a software.\n\n307\n00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.680\nA device port is a physical\nport on the switch, right?\n\n308\n00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.496\nIf I am not using a certain amount\nof ports on a switch, chances are,\n\n309\n00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:14.195\nI should disable them.\n\n310\n00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:19.026\nNow, you also have to keep in mind that a\ndefense in depth system is something that\n\n311\n00:16:19.026 --> 00:16:23.237\nis applicable here, because device\nports require physical access.\n\n312\n00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:26.998\nAnd I can tell you right now, somebody\nhas physical access to your device ports,\n\n313\n00:16:26.998 --> 00:16:29.627\nyou got bigger problems than\njust disabling that port.\n\n314\n00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:31.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got a problem with your physical\n\n315\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:31.880\nsecurity.\n\n316\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:38.560\nBut, there again, joking aside if\nyou're not using it, turn it off.\n\n317\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.480\nThere are plenty of drop\npanel ports with drop cables.\n\n318\n00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.890\nSomebody could just plug into a port\nthat comes into your network,\n\n319\n00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.290\nand now they've got access.\n\n320\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.950\nFor instance,\nif you got a lobby that allows for\n\n321\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.780\nwhatever reason that has network jacks,\n\n322\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.440\nthen somebody can just plug into your\nnetwork and potentially get access.\n\n323\n00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.340\nSo disable those ports if\nyou're not using them.\n\n324\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.450\nNow on the IP port side, we're technically\ntalking about TCP/IP session identifiers.\n\n325\n00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.210\nThese ports that we call the logical\nendpoint of a connection.\n\n326\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:18.081\nWe talk about, in our ports and protocols,\nhey, port 80, http, port 443, https.\n\n327\n00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.725\nWell, there's a reason that you wanna\ndisable those ports if you're not\n\n328\n00:17:21.725 --> 00:17:22.379\nusing them.\n\n329\n00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:26.522\nDisable the service that's\nassociated with those, and\n\n330\n00:17:26.522 --> 00:17:31.108\nyou usually disable the port\nthat service uses, I should say.\n\n331\n00:17:31.108 --> 00:17:36.131\nHere's the problem with the ports,\nsometimes the ports might just be,\n\n332\n00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:39.751\nthey might give themselves\nover to like a leap frog,\n\n333\n00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:43.868\nthey could give you a starting point for\nother attacks, and\n\n334\n00:17:43.868 --> 00:17:47.550\nthat is something that you\nhave to be very careful.\n\n335\n00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.545\nIn fact, I'll tell you what,\nlet me go ahead and show you what I mean.\n\n336\n00:17:50.545 --> 00:17:54.486\nWe're gonna, here on our Windows\n10 machine, I've got n-map,\n\n337\n00:17:54.486 --> 00:17:56.600\nit's actually z-map with the GUI here for\n\n338\n00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.060\nWindows, it's just the front end to\nthe back end command line utility.\n\n339\n00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.390\nIt's a port.\n\n340\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.560\nAnd I could potentially find targets.\n\n341\n00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.920\nWe could do things like ping sweeps.\n\n342\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.830\nIt's one of the reasons you\nwanna disable things like ICMP.\n\n343\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.710\nBut once I run something like a ping\nsweep, I can identify hosts that\n\n344\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.760\nare valid and up if you will on\nyour network and communicating.\n\n345\n00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.390\nBut then, once I go a little bit farther I\ncan do something like this where now I've\n\n346\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.630\ngot, actually let me make sure\nI've got the right IP address.\n\n347\n00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.600\nOnce I find that target,\nI put them in there as the target\n\n348\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.040\nof the port scan if you will,\nand I modify the scan.\n\n349\n00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.880\nWe'll just do a quick scan here,\nand we´ll let this run.\n\n350\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.170\nAnd what this is doing is,\n\n351\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:47.470\nthis is actually sending a scan over\nthe network against this target.\n\n352\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.190\nAnd, what I as the attacker\nmight wanna see,\n\n353\n00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.250\nwill want to see, is what ports\nare currently opened on that machine.\n\n354\n00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.890\nWell, if I find out what ports are open\non the machine that can give me a lot\n\n355\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.360\nmore information, not only about just\nthe ports that are available or open.\n\n356\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.700\nBut also indication of what\nthe role of this device is here.\n\n357\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.530\nAnd we'll see here in a second\nwe'll see the outputs, there we go.\n\n358\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.080\nSo it's kind of interesting.\n\n359\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.490\nHere's the port, here's the service\nassociated with the port, and\n\n360\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.540\nthat's why I tell you,\ndisable the service you\n\n361\n00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.760\ntypically disable the port that's\nassociated with the service.\n\n362\n00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.040\nLet's go a little farther than that.\n\n363\n00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.750\nI can see DNS is open on here.\n\n364\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:36.660\nThat means that this computer is\nreceiving DNS resolution request.\n\n365\n00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.398\nRight away, Zach,\nI can tell this is DNS server.\n\n366\n00:19:38.398 --> 00:19:39.202\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n367\n00:19:39.202 --> 00:19:42.410\n&gt;&gt; So now, DNS poisoning maybe.\n\n368\n00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.020\nMaybe that's the attack,\nbecause I know it's a DNS server.\n\n369\n00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.100\nI look at http, it's got IIS.\n\n370\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.100\nHow do I know it's IIS, right?\n\n371\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.510\nIIS is Microsoft's\nimplementation of a web server,\n\n372\n00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.480\nwell how do I know it's\na Microsoft implementation?\n\n373\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.970\nIt tells me right there on the port scan.\n\n374\n00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:01.530\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n375\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.630\n&gt;&gt; I can see that there's SMB traffic,\nserver message block.\n\n376\n00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:10.470\nI can see that it's open, so\nthat let's me know that it's running IIS.\n\n377\n00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.110\nSo now I know the software\nthat I might want to attack,\n\n378\n00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.090\nnot only DNS but maybe a web attack.\n\n379\n00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.460\nKerberos, that's interesting.\n\n380\n00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.810\nKerberos is running on PORT 88.\n\n381\n00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.330\nAnd I see ldap,\nlight weight directory access protocol.\n\n382\n00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.200\nWell, hold on.\n\n383\n00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:26.870\nStop the press here.\n\n384\n00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.540\nWhat's going on?\n\n385\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.640\nWhat's this machine doing?\n\n386\n00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.020\nThis machine is a domain controller.\n\n387\n00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.403\nI just found a domain controller by\na simple port scan based on the ports that\n\n388\n00:20:36.403 --> 00:20:37.101\nwere open, and\n\n389\n00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:40.337\nI can tell that because it's light\nweight directory access protocol.\n\n390\n00:20:40.337 --> 00:20:42.765\nIt's PORT 389.\n\n391\n00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:47.685\nI can tell that it's doing\nauthentication over kerberos, why,\n\n392\n00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:54.155\nbecause in a Windows domain,\nthe authentication protocol is kerberos.\n\n393\n00:20:54.155 --> 00:20:57.445\nSo right away,\nI can say all right we got the DNS server.\n\n394\n00:20:57.445 --> 00:20:59.975\nI can probably try a DNS,\nI can go even further than that and\n\n395\n00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:02.815\nbecause this is domain\ncontroller that is running DNS.\n\n396\n00:21:02.815 --> 00:21:05.205\nI can tell you that it's got\nan active directory most likely, and\n\n397\n00:21:05.205 --> 00:21:08.267\nactive directory integrated DNS zone.\n\n398\n00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:13.294\nTell the information you can start to\nglean, not only maybe attack the servers\n\n399\n00:21:13.294 --> 00:21:18.037\nor the application that's using these\nports, but you start to profile.\n\n400\n00:21:18.037 --> 00:21:22.745\nI start to profile information,\nglean information based on this PORT\n\n401\n00:21:22.745 --> 00:21:26.412\nscan had I had these closed off,\nhad they not replied,\n\n402\n00:21:26.412 --> 00:21:30.833\nI won't be able to find these\ninformation out, well not as easy.\n\n403\n00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:33.306\nI understand that then makes very,\nvery powerful thing, and\n\n404\n00:21:33.306 --> 00:21:36.078\nyou need to a lot more than what\nwe're doing here with the basic scan.\n\n405\n00:21:36.078 --> 00:21:40.185\nBut that one of the reasons things that\nyou wanna disable things like these ports.\n\n406\n00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:44.409\nFor not running DNS,\nI should uninstall that role,\n\n407\n00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:47.961\nI should basically turn\noff DNS if you will,\n\n408\n00:21:47.961 --> 00:21:52.178\nand then I know that\npart 53 will disappear.\n\n409\n00:21:52.178 --> 00:21:56.410\nMaybe you can't, again,\nI don't know what service is,\n\n410\n00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.600\nI don't know what ports you can or can't\ndisable, I can tell you right now what\n\n411\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.680\nthe domain controller not gonna\nbe able to disable PORT 88.\n\n412\n00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.880\nI mean, that's Kerberos protocol.\n\n413\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.370\nThat's what it's used for authentication.\n\n414\n00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.990\nI'm not gonna be able to disable ldap.\n\n415\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.570\nWhy?\n\n416\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.280\nBecause that's how we communicate with\nthe directory service that's running\n\n417\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.582\non this server.\n\n418\n00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:17.280\nSo again, keep in mind that you want to\ndisable IP ports that you're not using,\n\n419\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.480\nbecause it reduces that\nattack surface even more.\n\n420\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.450\nAnd those open ports can lend\ntheir way into other attacks, too.\n\n421\n00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.880\n&gt;&gt; Wes, should we be consider those\nunknown services, is there any open ports?\n\n422\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.270\n&gt;&gt; Well with the unknown services,\n\n423\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.190\nI'm not really worried about it and\nin fact let's check that out, all right?\n\n424\n00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.000\nSo these are actually what\nare known as private ports.\n\n425\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.820\nThese are, we talked about temporary.\n\n426\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.730\nThese are dynamic ports, temporary ports\nand I'm not really worried about these.\n\n427\n00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.770\nIf you remember your port ranges, right?\n\n428\n00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.860\nWe talked about our port ranges,\nports and protocols.\n\n429\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.450\nWe said that there are well-known ports,\nthere registered ports, and\n\n430\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.135\nthat there are dynamic ports.\n\n431\n00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:56.900\nWell-known ports, 0 to 1023,\nthat's all the common services.\n\n432\n00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.910\nIn fact, most of these all fall in that\nwell-known common services range, right?\n\n433\n00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Register port range is 1024 to 49151,\n\n434\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:11.339\nanything above that, that 49152 and\nbeyond is a dynamic port.\n\n435\n00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:14.795\nIt just means that this server\nis currently using that port for\n\n436\n00:23:14.795 --> 00:23:19.582\na communication, once that communication\nis done, you know close that port down and\n\n437\n00:23:19.582 --> 00:23:21.055\nyou'll no longer see it.\n\n438\n00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:23.899\nSo I'm not really too worried about these.\n\n439\n00:23:23.899 --> 00:23:26.688\nYou can worry too about\nregister port range, and\n\n440\n00:23:26.688 --> 00:23:30.974\nthe reason I say that is sometimes you\nhave things like gaming servers, and\n\n441\n00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:32.827\nyou need to open certain ports.\n\n442\n00:23:32.827 --> 00:23:37.219\nAnd a lot of times we can map that out by\nnot only using nmap and then we can go to,\n\n443\n00:23:37.219 --> 00:23:40.058\nlike an online gaming or\ngo to a gaming platform and\n\n444\n00:23:40.058 --> 00:23:43.575\nfind out what are the recommended\nports for a gaming system and\n\n445\n00:23:43.575 --> 00:23:45.765\nattackers can use that information.\n\n446\n00:23:45.765 --> 00:23:50.375\nSo, just because I'm not too\nworried about the dynamic ports,\n\n447\n00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.215\neven the registered ports\ncan cause you problems.\n\n448\n00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:56.350\nSo, remember, disable this ports.\n\n449\n00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.740\nMake yourself a little bit more invisible.\n\n450\n00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.200\nYou can't do it completely, but\n\n451\n00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.060\nat least you can make your\ndevice a little bit more secure.\n\n452\n00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.810\nThese are some of the things\nthat you have to keep in mind,\n\n453\n00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.250\nwhen it comes to network device hardening.\n\n454\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.540\nDo your do diligence.\n\n455\n00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.580\nResearch your applications, research\nthe services, research the devices and\n\n456\n00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.410\ntheir configuration so that you're aware\nof what you should have turned on,\n\n457\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.590\nwhat you should have turned off.\n\n458\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.510\nSteer away from defaults,\nbecause if I know the defaults.\n\n459\n00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.370\nZach knows the defaults-\n&gt;&gt; Then the attacker's gonna know\n\n460\n00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:35.670\nthe defaults as well,\njust by doing simple Google searches.\n\n461\n00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.770\nThese are some of the things\nthat you have to keep in mind.\n\n462\n00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.590\nSo that when you sit that Net+ exam,\n\n463\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.440\nif they put you in a scenario,\nyou'll be able to answer those questions.\n\n464\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.000\nAnd not only answer the questions.\n\n465\n00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.030\nWe don't want you to\njust pass the Net+ exam.\n\n466\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.870\nWe want you to knock it\nout of the ball park.\n\n467\n00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot Wes.\n\n468\n00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.260\nNetwork advice happening part two.\n\n469\n00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:51.880\nThere was a part one.\n\n470\n00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.818\nSee them both and see everything in the\nCompTIA Net+ series Wes has put together\n\n471\n00:24:55.818 --> 00:24:58.752\nfor you, done a great job and\nwill help you in the long run and\n\n472\n00:24:58.752 --> 00:25:02.257\nwhile you are there in the course library,\nhundreds of other videos.\n\n473\n00:25:02.257 --> 00:25:05.359\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further, and\n\n474\n00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:07.320\ntell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n475\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.680\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n476\n00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.821\nI'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n477\n00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:12.030\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for watching,\nwe'll see you soon.\n\n478\n00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:19.947\n[MUSIC]\n\n479\n00:25:19.947 --> 00:25:22.743\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.324\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.345\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:17.240\nchoosing ITProTV, empowering\nthe world through engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.930\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with CompTIA Net+.\n\n7\n00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.092\nThis is common network service issues,\npart two.\n\n8\n00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:29.010\nAnd once again, Wes Bryan is here to\nhelp us out, Wes, great to have you.\n\n9\n00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.462\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me back, Zach,\n\n10\n00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:33.979\nthat is right, we are moving along in some\nof the service issues that you might see.\n\n11\n00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:37.402\nRemember in part one, we really just\ndealt with name resolution issues.\n\n12\n00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:42.011\nCuz DNS is a major part of our\nnetworking communications, and\n\n13\n00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:46.099\nwithout it,\na lot of applications can start to break.\n\n14\n00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:50.385\nWe might not find those websites out there\nbecause we cannot map those names to their\n\n15\n00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:51.136\nIPs.\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n\n16\n00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:52.482\n&gt;&gt; In this episode,\n\n17\n00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:58.530\nwe're gonna talk about things that can,\nif you will, have to do with DHCP.\n\n18\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030\nAs well as just an overall\nmisconfiguration of the network adapter's\n\n19\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.250\nbasic network adapter properties, right.\n\n20\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.797\nSo one of the things that they call\nout is an incorrect gateway, right.\n\n21\n00:01:09.797 --> 00:01:14.068\nAnd in this context, understand that we're\nnot talking about a translation device\n\n22\n00:01:14.068 --> 00:01:16.365\nbetween two dissimilar protocols, right?\n\n23\n00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:20.556\nThat is a gateway as well, but\nwe're talking about, just generically,\n\n24\n00:01:20.556 --> 00:01:22.130\nTCP/IP default gateway.\n\n25\n00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.170\nRemember that the default gateway is how\nI send traffic off of my local network\n\n26\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.160\nonto another network, right.\n\n27\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.825\nA lot of times, where we see that\nis Internet communication, right.\n\n28\n00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.340\nIt doesn't have to be,\ncuz you can have a heavily\n\n29\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.730\nrouted large enterprise network\nthat this could also happen.\n\n30\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.531\nBut commonly,\n\n31\n00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.597\nyou might identify it as being able to\ncommunicate from your local area network\n\n32\n00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.317\nout there across the Internet.\n&gt;&gt; So is this like when I go on\n\n33\n00:01:45.317 --> 00:01:48.449\nthe Internet, I try to find a website,\nand I get back something that says,\n\n34\n00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:52.490\nincorrect gateway?\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's actually that's\n\n35\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.780\nsomething that's returned, if you will,\non the back end of the web server.\n\n36\n00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560\nThat might be the fact, and\nI'm not sure, cuz be different things.\n\n37\n00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.640\nBut it might be the fact that, cuz\nremember, when you hit a web page, right,\n\n38\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.030\nyou have the front end,\nwhich is the web application, and\n\n39\n00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.810\nthe back end is the database.\n\n40\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.467\nAnd there's no telling how they're routing\ntraffic or how they're communicating.\n\n41\n00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.192\nSo that's more on the application side,\n\n42\n00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:15.158\nif you will.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n43\n00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:16.528\n&gt;&gt; Let's go ahead, and\n\n44\n00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:21.110\nI'll show you where we could see this\nin a couple of issues, all right?\n\n45\n00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.820\nSo in our Windows 10 machine here,\nif I go ahead,\n\n46\n00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.170\nthe first thing I'll do is\nbring up our command prompt.\n\n47\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.520\nAnd we'll do an ipconfig, all right, if\nyou notice, I've got an IP address, right?\n\n48\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.800\nI've got my subnet mask, cuz the other\none, too, by the way, is mask, right.\n\n49\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.790\nI said gateway, but there's incorrect\ngateway and incorrect mask, right.\n\n50\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.156\nWhen you're using DHCP,\na lot of times this doesn't happen.\n\n51\n00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:49.505\nIt's not to say that it couldn't happen,\n\n52\n00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:54.460\nsomebody could misconfigure the DHCP\nserver, and that could cause problems.\n\n53\n00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.280\nA lot of times, what you're gonna see\nis where the static configuration\n\n54\n00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.510\ncomes in, right?\n\n55\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.408\nBecause if I do, I'll tell you what,\nlet's rerun that ipconfig command,\n\n56\n00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:04.873\nbut we'll do a /all.\n\n57\n00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:09.667\nAnd you'll see that yes,\nthis is a DHCP enabled address, so\n\n58\n00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.310\nwe called out to a DHCP server.\n\n59\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.650\nI can see that it's got a lease time,\nright?\n\n60\n00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.010\nAnd I can see that the DHCP\nserver gave me a subnet mask, and\n\n61\n00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.230\ngave me my default gateway, all right?\n\n62\n00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.085\nWell, notice what happens if I ping\nan external address 4.2, oops,\n\n63\n00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:31.836\nif I can type an IP address, 2.1, right,\nI'm getting replies back, all right?\n\n64\n00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.789\nI can also open up a web browser,\nand you can see,\n\n65\n00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:38.176\nI can connect from this machine\nout to the Internet, and\n\n66\n00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:43.580\nessentially out to our web servers,\nright, that's what we want to happen.\n\n67\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.550\nHowever, when you start configuring things\nwrong, you could get some issues, so\n\n68\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.800\nlet me go ahead and close this down.\n\n69\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.515\nMy head's kind of covering this up,\nbut same place we've been going for\n\n70\n00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:54.250\nawhile now, just right clicking\non the little monitor icon and\n\n71\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.080\nchoosing Open Network and Sharing Center.\n\n72\n00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.450\nAnd then we're gonna get into\nthe properties of our network adapter.\n\n73\n00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.265\nAll right, and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n74\n00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:05.061\nI'm gonna reconfigure\nthe TCP/ IP properties, right?\n\n75\n00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:06.488\nSo now we're gonna do a static assignment\n\n76\n00:04:06.488 --> 00:04:08.200\nwhere you can start to see the problem,\nright?\n\n77\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.150\nFirst we'll show you how it should look,\nright, if you're doing static assignment.\n\n78\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.250\nAll right, so I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.720\nI'm gonna select our\nInternet Protocol Version 4 properties.\n\n80\n00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.190\nAnd notice that we are obtaining\nan IP address automatically,\n\n81\n00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.310\nit's a DHCP signed address.\n\n82\n00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.550\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nconfigure this a little bit different,\n\n83\n00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.220\nI'll do 10.0.200.200, all right.\n\n84\n00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.770\nAnd I'll give it the right subnet mask,\nwhich is basically a class B subnet mask.\n\n85\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.620\nI'm gonna give it the right\ndefault gateway, and again,\n\n86\n00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310\nthis is what it should look like, and\nthen we'll introduce the problem.\n\n87\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.805\nAnd for this, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n88\n00:04:49.805 --> 00:04:53.964\nI'm gonna statically map\nour DNS servers to 8.8.8.8.\n\n89\n00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:57.240\nEven though our DHCP server did the same\nthing, it gave me these options.\n\n90\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.550\nI'll go ahead, and we're gonna do it\nmanually, and we'll keep it the same.\n\n91\n00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.450\nI could do this, I could put the default\ngateway as the preferred DNS server.\n\n92\n00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.500\nAnd then what's just gonna happen\nis when I get to the gateway,\n\n93\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.590\nit's gonna say, I see this.\n\n94\n00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.320\nThis is port 53, UDP, DNS query,\nI'll just pass that on to the DNS server.\n\n95\n00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.090\nBut I'm gonna go ahead and\nstatically map it, choose Close, and\n\n96\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.727\nwe will let it apply these configurations.\n\n97\n00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:27.260\nNow, while this is running in\nthe background, we'll go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.290\nwe'll see if that's taken effect yet.\n\n99\n00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.620\nLooks like I'm not quite patient enough\ncuz we still have our DHCP address,\n\n100\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.770\nso we'll just give it a second here.\n\n101\n00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.090\nAnd hopefully what we're gonna see is,\n\n102\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.600\nwhen I've statically mapped this, we can\nperform those same tests that we just did,\n\n103\n00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.020\nwith a DHCP server\ngiving me those options.\n\n104\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.940\nAgain, the subnet mask and\nthe gateway, all right?\n\n105\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.590\nSo we'll go ahead and\ngive that just a second here.\n\n106\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.058\nIt's running a little slow here,\nand sometimes I just get impatient.\n\n107\n00:05:56.058 --> 00:06:00.190\nI say I tell you Zach, the faster\ncomputers get, the more impatient I get,\n\n108\n00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.997\nthat's for sure.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:06:01.997 --> 00:06:02.999\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n110\n00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.523\nso it's taking its sweet time,\nthat's for sure.\n\n111\n00:06:07.523 --> 00:06:11.061\nIt looks like it just connected there, I\njust had to be a little bit more patient,\n\n112\n00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:12.043\nright?\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n113\n00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:13.099\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back to our command prompt.\n\n114\n00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:13.668\n&gt;&gt; I want patience and\n\n115\n00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:16.841\nI want it right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll run ipconfig, and\n\n116\n00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:18.340\nthere we have it.\n\n117\n00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.668\nAll right,\nnow notice that information looks kind of\n\n118\n00:06:22.668 --> 00:06:25.755\nthe same when we run out our ipconfig.\n\n119\n00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:29.940\nBecause I have an IP address,\ngot a subnet mask, and a default gateway.\n\n120\n00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.860\nIf I rerun that ipconfig utility,\nand choose the all option.\n\n121\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.717\nIt will let me know that this is not,\nright,\n\n122\n00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:45.687\nthis isn't a DHCP enabled address,\nright, this is statically assigned.\n\n123\n00:06:45.687 --> 00:06:52.595\nAll right, and if I run my ping utility\nagain, we do a ping of 4.2.2.1,\n\n124\n00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:59.100\nI can communicate across my local network,\nthat's what I wanna see.\n\n125\n00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.800\nI close that down, go ahead and\n\n126\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.630\nclose this down for now,\nclean up the desktop here a little bit.\n\n127\n00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.330\nThen I open up the web page,\nthere we go, right, ITProTV.\n\n128\n00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.051\nIt loads up statically assigned,\nit's not a problem.\n\n129\n00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.482\nAll right,\nnow let's introduce the problem,\n\n130\n00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:20.640\nthe incorrect subnet mask, or\nthe incorrect, if you will, gateway.\n\n131\n00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.520\nLet's start with the subnet mask,\nlet's see, now,\n\n132\n00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.730\nI'll tell you what,\nwe'll start with the gateway.\n\n133\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.650\nAll right, let's open up Network and\nSharing Center again.\n\n134\n00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.450\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nlook at our adapter settings.\n\n135\n00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.569\nAnd one of the first things, let me go\nahead and bring up the properties here.\n\n136\n00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:39.077\nAnd we're gonna make sure that\nour DHCP server is actually\n\n137\n00:07:39.077 --> 00:07:41.200\nissuing out that address.\n\n138\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.681\nLet me go ahead and\njust change this here real quick.\n\n139\n00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:47.998\nWe'll let it identify,\nwe'll look at the status real quick, and\n\n140\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.247\nit's still taking a second here.\n\n141\n00:07:50.247 --> 00:07:53.948\nAgain, I'm a little bit too quick\non this or just a little impatient,\n\n142\n00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:55.219\nprobably a bit of both.\n\n143\n00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.634\nNow, Looks like it did obtain\nits IP address and all right.\n\n144\n00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:01.600\nSo we've got our,\nagain we've got our IPv4 address.\n\n145\n00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.000\nDHCP has give us our subnet mask and\nour default gateway.\n\n146\n00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.630\nAgain, a lot of times what's going\nto happen is this will be a static\n\n147\n00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.640\nconfiguration issue.\n\n148\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.425\nI'll show you where, on the server side,\nit could cause problems, too.\n\n149\n00:08:13.425 --> 00:08:17.030\nIf it's a configuration\nproblem with the DHCP server.\n\n150\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.070\nAll right, so what I'm gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n151\n00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.020\njust right click on our\nNetwork Adaptor and choose Properties.\n\n152\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.450\nI'm gonna choose the TCP, IPv4 properties\nand we'll go ahead and bring those up.\n\n153\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.370\nAnd let's go ahead and\nwhat we'll do is we'll do a one,\n\n154\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.018\nlet me just statically\nmap an IP address here.\n\n155\n00:08:36.018 --> 00:08:41.610\nI'll do 10.0.200.200 and\nwe will use a class B\n\n156\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.792\nsubnet mask and let's go ahead and\nassign the right default gateway.\n\n157\n00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:53.950\nAnd I'll give it our 8.8.8.8 for\nour dns server and choose okay.\n\n158\n00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.486\nWe'll go ahead and choose close to this.\n\n159\n00:08:56.486 --> 00:09:00.614\nGive it a second, sometimes it can\ntake a little bit I've seen it,\n\n160\n00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:04.840\nthis is just more of this machine's\nrunning a little bit slow here.\n\n161\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.262\nAnd hopefully what we see here is that\nonce this is statically assigned the IP\n\n162\n00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:11.896\naddress, we should see, if everything goes\nall right, and I betcha if I run an IP\n\n163\n00:09:11.896 --> 00:09:15.813\nconfig, there's Zach, I am gonna find that\nyeah, it's still got the DHCP address.\n\n164\n00:09:15.813 --> 00:09:20.783\nAnd that's okay it's taking a little\nbit to assign these settings to\n\n165\n00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:22.900\nthe network adapter.\n\n166\n00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.210\nSo we'll just give it a second here,\nand run our ping.\n\n167\n00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.200\nLooks like we still got the ping.\n\n168\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.830\nBut again, we want to make sure.\n\n169\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.920\nThere we go.\nAnd again,\n\n170\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.320\njust had to wait a little bit longer here.\n\n171\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.580\nLet's rerun ipconfig, and\n\n172\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.560\nmake sure that it is the static\nassignment that we just configured.\n\n173\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.120\nAnd I do see that yes, it is, right.\n\n174\n00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:48.078\nSo we can see that our IP address,\nright, IPv4 address, 10.0.200.200.\n\n175\n00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:50.884\nWe also have our subnet mask,\nclass B subnet mask,\n\n176\n00:09:50.884 --> 00:09:53.120\nas well as our default gateway, right.\n\n177\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.897\nWe are good to go as far\nas statically assigned and\n\n178\n00:09:55.897 --> 00:09:59.101\nwe hopefully can ping off of\nour local network, right.\n\n179\n00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:00.459\nSo we run our ping utility.\n\n180\n00:10:00.459 --> 00:10:04.085\nWe send that information off\nof the local network, right.\n\n181\n00:10:04.085 --> 00:10:06.068\nThat's what we wanna see\nwhen the gateway is right.\n\n182\n00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:11.960\nAll right, however, if I go ahead and\ndo that same thing again, we'll bring back\n\n183\n00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.090\nup the Network and Sharing Center here,\nand we'll change the adapter settings.\n\n184\n00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:22.020\nAnd this time,\nwe're gonna basically introduce the error,\n\n185\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.320\nthe issue that we're talking abou\n&gt;&gt; And we'll go ahead and\n\n186\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.130\nchoose Properties.\n\n187\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.080\nAnd I'm just gonna change one number,\nthat's it.\n\n188\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.030\nGonna change that last octet from\n.1 to .2, and we'll choose OK.\n\n189\n00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.570\nHopefully this takes, a little bit quicker\nthat time, we didn't have to wait so long.\n\n190\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.200\nAll right?\nAnd let's go ahead and\n\n191\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.080\nlet's clear our screen out and\nlet's rerun our ping utility.\n\n192\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.920\nAnd it isn't communicating.\n\n193\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.410\nWhy?\nCuz remember that what your computer is\n\n194\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.300\ndoing is it's saying, hey I'm looking\nat the destination IP address.\n\n195\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.240\nI know what my local routing table says.\n\n196\n00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.990\nI don't know where any of the,\n\n197\n00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.150\nthat's not on my local network\nwhen it applies it's subnet mask.\n\n198\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:02.000\nSo it says, I'm gonna look for the route\nthat says, hand it to the default gateway.\n\n199\n00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.880\nAll right, well in this case it's\nstill doing that same thing.\n\n200\n00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.512\nIn fact, if we do a route, print B4,\nyou're gonna see that 0.0.0.0 address.\n\n201\n00:11:11.512 --> 00:11:14.230\n0.0.0.0, just make sure I got\nfour zeros in there, right.\n\n202\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.250\nSo it has a default gateway, but\nthe problem is the ip address.\n\n203\n00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.430\nIt's an incorrect, right,\ngateway, so there's nothing there.\n\n204\n00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.860\nThere's no router out there\nto receive that packet and\n\n205\n00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.770\nsend it off of my local network and\nthat can cause an issue.\n\n206\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.170\nNow the other thing that could happen too\nhere, and you can also see it too, because\n\n207\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:40.900\nwhat's interesting is that when your\nnetwork adapter, you apply the settings.\n\n208\n00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.850\nNotice that it's telling me here that I\ndon't have any Internet access, right.\n\n209\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.780\nMy head's kinda covering it up, but\nnotice that it says No Internet access.\n\n210\n00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.700\nIt's kinda interesting because it uses\na little bit of name resolution and\n\n211\n00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.770\nit actually tries to connect to a couple\nof Microsoft servers out there.\n\n212\n00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.430\nWhen it can't resolve\nthose names it assumes,\n\n213\n00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.290\nwell I can't connect to the Internet.\n\n214\n00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.130\nI have no name resolution.\n\n215\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.020\nYou just must not have\nany Internet connection,\n\n216\n00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.710\nbecause you can't do\nthe name resolution there.\n\n217\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.330\nSo, we definitely have a problem.\n\n218\n00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.610\nLet's go ahead.\n\n219\n00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.760\nWe'll close this down.\n\n220\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.070\nWe'll bring back up our network and\nsharing center,\n\n221\n00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.930\nchange the adapter settings, and we will\nchange this back to the right setting.\n\n222\n00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.310\nAll right, bring up our Internet\nprotocol version four properties, and\n\n223\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.020\nwe will change that back to .1,\nand choose OK, and Close.\n\n224\n00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.650\nAnd you can see when we\nhave the correct gateway,\n\n225\n00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.170\nwe should be able to ping\noff of our local network.\n\n226\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.120\nThe other thing that could be a problem\nis you might have the subnet mask\n\n227\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.920\nconfigured incorrectly.\n\n228\n00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.600\nNow Windows does kind of\nan interesting thing.\n\n229\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.428\nIt'll give you an error, and\n\n230\n00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:48.780\nthen it will make a persistent\nroute of the true default gateway.\n\n231\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.093\nSo, this is something that's\na little unique to Windows, but\n\n232\n00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:53.474\nI do want you to just know.\n\n233\n00:12:53.474 --> 00:12:55.341\nRemember what the subnet mask does?\n\n234\n00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.340\nIt identifies the network that you're on.\n\n235\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.838\nAnd when you change the subnet mask,\nespecially in static mapping like this,\n\n236\n00:13:02.838 --> 00:13:09.010\nstatic addressing, I could change this to\nsomething like, I don't know, 255.255.252.\n\n237\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.520\nAnd you know what, it didn't give me that.\n\n238\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.420\nLet me change this to something\na little bit different so\n\n239\n00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.730\nhopefully it will give you that warning,\nshow you that warning.\n\n240\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.400\nIt'll let you know, hey, you might\nwant to change these settings, 255,\n\n241\n00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.320\nyou know the one time I say\nthat it might not, there it is.\n\n242\n00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.710\nThat's the warning I wanted to see.\n\n243\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.630\nAll right, notice it says the default\ngateway is not on the same\n\n244\n00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.770\nnetwork segment or subnet as defined by\nthe IP address and the subnet mask, right.\n\n245\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.480\nSo, what it's letting you know is that\nhey, you've changed the subnet mask.\n\n246\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.160\nRemember the subnet mask\nidentifies what network you're on.\n\n247\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.040\nAnd if you change that subject mask to\nsomething different than what the network\n\n248\n00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.080\nis, that you're currently on,\nyou're no longer on the same network.\n\n249\n00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.730\nNow again,\nthis does something kind of interesting.\n\n250\n00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.555\nIf I choose Close to this,\nyou're gonna notice here, Zach,\n\n251\n00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:56.480\neven though I have a different subnet\nmask, just run our ipconfig, right.\n\n252\n00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.170\nI have, instead of a Class B default\nIP address, I changed it to a Class C.\n\n253\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.680\nI'm not on the same network anymore.\n\n254\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.930\nIt even warned me.\n\n255\n00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.930\nBut this is something\nunique to Windows and\n\n256\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.760\nI don't want you to think that\nthis is always going to happen.\n\n257\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.970\nWell, watch if I ping.\n\n258\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.840\nI could still get off of my local network,\nright.\n\n259\n00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.440\nAnd that's because what Windows did,\n\n260\n00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.710\nif we use our route print command again,\nnotice that it made this persistent route.\n\n261\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.580\nPersistent route means\nit's surviving a reboot.\n\n262\n00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.880\nSo, even though I told it what\nthe default gateway is, it's says, no,\n\n263\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.980\nno, no, I'm not gonna let that happen.\n\n264\n00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.640\nI got your back.\n\n265\n00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.030\nThat doesn't work when you got two\nnodes within a network, right.\n\n266\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.770\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n267\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:46.190\nIf I go ping, let's see if we can,\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n268\n00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.130\nRemember our domain controller\nthat we've been working with?\n\n269\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.310\n10.10.10.10.100?\nIt can't communicate.\n\n270\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.080\nThey're not on the same network anymore.\n\n271\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.350\nRight, and in fact,\nthat's not really a good example.\n\n272\n00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.180\nLet me give you,\nlet me give you another example, too.\n\n273\n00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.580\nNow like I said,\nthis one's kind of unique to Windows.\n\n274\n00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.590\nI'll tell you what, we're gonna\ndo this a little bit different.\n\n275\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.220\nLet's do this with the other\nnetwork adapter and\n\n276\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.700\nshow you an incorrect subnet mask.\n\n277\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.350\nI'm gonna go ahead and disable this one.\n\n278\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.400\nI'm not worried about connecting outbound\nto the Internet, because I wanna show you,\n\n279\n00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.880\nwhen you change these\nsubnet masks to essentially\n\n280\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.440\nput the computers on different networks.\n\n281\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.850\nI'm pinging 10.10.10.100.\n\n282\n00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.900\nIt's a completely different\nnetwork anyway, so\n\n283\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.270\nthat's not really a good example.\n\n284\n00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.900\nLet me give you a better example on this,\nall right.\n\n285\n00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.020\nSo we run our ipconfig.\n\n286\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:40.238\nNotice that we have now 10.10.10.101 and\n255.255.255.0, right.\n\n287\n00:15:40.238 --> 00:15:46.852\nAnd if I go to ping the domain controller,\n10.10.10.100.\n\n288\n00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:48.858\nWe're receiving replies back, right.\n\n289\n00:15:48.858 --> 00:15:52.149\nNow, I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna bring back up our network and\n\n290\n00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:53.030\nsharing center.\n\n291\n00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.146\nAll right, and what I'm gonna do, again,\nnot worried about the default gateway.\n\n292\n00:15:57.146 --> 00:16:00.310\nBut what I wanna focus in\nmore on is that subnet mask.\n\n293\n00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.782\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna use\n10.10, I don't know, we'll just do 200.\n\n294\n00:16:07.782 --> 00:16:11.359\nIn fact,\nwe'll do something kinda interesting,\n\n295\n00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:14.949\nI'll do 10.10.10.150, all right.\n\n296\n00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:23.062\nAnd instead of using the subnet\nmask of 255.255.255.0,\n\n297\n00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:31.593\nI'm gonna do a 255.255.255.128 and\nchoose OK and close.\n\n298\n00:16:31.593 --> 00:16:35.764\nAnd what we're gonna do here is,\nwe are going to try to ping that\n\n299\n00:16:35.764 --> 00:16:39.409\ndomain controller, and\nthat's what I wanted to see.\n\n300\n00:16:39.409 --> 00:16:42.390\nSee, it gives you a better example, right?\n\n301\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.241\nWith that default gateway, and\nagain, that persistent route,\n\n302\n00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:49.330\nthat might not be what's\ngonna happen all the time.\n\n303\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.133\nBut this is what you can see when\nyou have an incorrect subnet mask,\n\n304\n00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:54.204\nbecause now you're on\ntwo different networks.\n\n305\n00:16:54.204 --> 00:16:56.948\nThe domain controller is no longer\non the same network as this client,\n\n306\n00:16:56.948 --> 00:16:59.700\nbecause remember,\nthat's what the subnet mask defines.\n\n307\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.571\nDefines what network you're on, and\nthat could be problematic, right,\n\n308\n00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:05.360\nespecially for communications.\n\n309\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.323\nLet me go ahead and open up our properties\nof our network adapter here, and\n\n310\n00:17:10.323 --> 00:17:14.230\nwe will fix this,\nbecause we want communication.\n\n311\n00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.480\nThe other thing I can do is just kind of\nlet the DHCP server do this when I let\n\n312\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:23.220\nthe DHCP server give me my IP address.\n\n313\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.386\nAnd I try to ping now\nthe same domain controller,\n\n314\n00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:31.665\nI get replies back cuz\nthe subnet mask is correct.\n\n315\n00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:35.550\nAgain, a lot of times, it's just\na configuration issue on the client side.\n\n316\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:40.040\nNow, in fairness, let me go ahead and\nlog back into my server here.\n\n317\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.061\nRight, you could see that\nthere is a potential that\n\n318\n00:17:46.061 --> 00:17:52.515\nin the DHCP server itself,\nwhen you open up the scope.\n\n319\n00:17:52.515 --> 00:17:57.106\nWe'll go ahead and expand out DHCP here,\nexpand out the server,\n\n320\n00:17:57.106 --> 00:17:59.039\nthe IPv4, and the scope.\n\n321\n00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:03.850\nAnd we look at under the scope,\nscope options, right?\n\n322\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.910\nNotice it's handing out my router,\nthe router is the gateway, right?\n\n323\n00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.124\nAnd that's what we want to know, right?\n\n324\n00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:16.596\nThe fact that if I configure this wrong,\nright,\n\n325\n00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:22.470\nlet's say that 10.10.10.1 is my default\n\n326\n00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.419\ngateway and I accidentally put 2, right?\n\n327\n00:18:27.419 --> 00:18:31.601\nAnd when I put 2, I add that, and\nI choose OK, now there's potential for\n\n328\n00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:34.520\nmy DHCP server to be handing\nout the wrong options.\n\n329\n00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.080\nAnd when it's handing out\nthe wrong options, doesn't matter\n\n330\n00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.620\nwhat the options are, if the options\naren't exactly what the network is, right?\n\n331\n00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.230\nWhat the IP address of the router is,\nall right?\n\n332\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.400\nKeep in mind, they have to be the same, so\n\n333\n00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.076\nit could be something where\nthe options are wrong.\n\n334\n00:18:49.076 --> 00:18:52.073\nAnd again, more often than not,\nthat isn't gonna be the case, and\n\n335\n00:18:52.073 --> 00:18:54.425\nlet me go ahead and\nchange that back here real quick.\n\n336\n00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:57.570\nThere's our router, let's remove that,\nand we will fix that problem.\n\n337\n00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.331\nYou could see that it's\non the server side, but\n\n338\n00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:05.320\nagain, probably not as common as a static\nconfiguration that could cause the issue.\n\n339\n00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.778\nAll right, now speaking of DHCP, let me\ngo ahead and go back to our DHCP console.\n\n340\n00:19:10.778 --> 00:19:13.325\nRemember that what I did is, I said,\n\n341\n00:19:13.325 --> 00:19:17.680\nlet's let DHCP had out my Windows\n10 client its IP address.\n\n342\n00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.200\nAnd if I open up the scope,\nhere on my DHCP server, and\n\n343\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:29.570\nI look at my address lease, I can see\nthat yes, client 01 has a IP address.\n\n344\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.660\nThat it reached out the DHCP server,\n\n345\n00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.170\nit pulled down its IP address in\nthose options we're talking about.\n\n346\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.290\nAll right,\nwhen you get where people have DHCP server\n\n347\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:45.460\nhanding out a range of addresses and\nsomebody statically maps an IP address,\n\n348\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.360\nthere's a potential that you\ncould have a duplicate, right?\n\n349\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:54.180\nAnd again, you're letting DHCP do its job,\nand you're creating exclusions or\n\n350\n00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.590\nstatically mapping IP addresses out of\nthe range of this pool of addresses,\n\n351\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.340\nyou usually don't have that problem.\n\n352\n00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.080\nLet me show you what can happen, though.\n\n353\n00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.050\nAnd it's kind of interesting how Windows,\nspecifically Windows will work here.\n\n354\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n355\n00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.920\nI'm gonna bring up the properties of\nthe network adapter on the server.\n\n356\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.552\nAll right, I already know cuz we just\nchecked out the lease that my Windows 10\n\n357\n00:20:16.552 --> 00:20:20.988\nclient, client 01 has, right,\nwe've just seen it in the background.\n\n358\n00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:25.386\nBut what if I accidentally select IPv4,\nright, and\n\n359\n00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:29.210\nI choose properties, and\nI say you know what?\n\n360\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:35.560\nI'm gonna change this to 101, all right,\nI don't know if you can see, follow\n\n361\n00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.300\nwhat's going on here, but I just changed\nit to the same IP address as my client.\n\n362\n00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.880\nNow my server and\nmy client have the same IP address, right.\n\n363\n00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.360\nCuz remember,\nwe see that in the background there,\n\n364\n00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.561\nthat my client obtained 10.10.10.101.\n\n365\n00:20:50.561 --> 00:20:55.011\nBut now if I drop down\nto my command prompt and\n\n366\n00:20:55.011 --> 00:21:00.558\nI do an ipconfig, one second,\nwhat's going on here?\n\n367\n00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:02.860\nI don't have a 10.10.10.101,\nI've got an APIPA address, why is that?\n\n368\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:08.168\nWell, it's kind of interesting,\nWindows detected a duplicate,\n\n369\n00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:11.438\nall right, and it says no, no, no, no.\n\n370\n00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.276\nI'm not gonna let you\nhave that IP address,\n\n371\n00:21:13.276 --> 00:21:15.870\nsomebody else has already\ngot that IP address.\n\n372\n00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.500\nCuz when you statically assign an IP\naddress or when you map an IP address,\n\n373\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.310\nyou still do an ARP resolution out there.\n\n374\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.603\nAnd it's saying, hey,\nthis is my IP address, let everybody know.\n\n375\n00:21:24.603 --> 00:21:29.228\nAnd when I assigned the server this IP\naddress, it called out to the network and\n\n376\n00:21:29.228 --> 00:21:34.370\nsaid, hey, I'm gonna take 10.10.10.101 and\nhere's my MAC address.\n\n377\n00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:39.040\nWell, remember,\nthat's a broadcast communication.\n\n378\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.050\nWell, my client was listening\nto that broadcast communication.\n\n379\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:46.900\nAnd it listened and it said, well,\nwait a second, wait, no no no,\n\n380\n00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:52.090\nthat's my IP address, and\nit's mapped to this MAC address, right.\n\n381\n00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.220\nAnd if we do a getmac,\n\n382\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:59.170\nit basically said this is my MAC address,\nthat's my IP address.\n\n383\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.230\nSo this server recognized that and\n\n384\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.260\nit said, I'm sorry,\nlet me correct the problem.\n\n385\n00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.830\nYep, that's right, that's client01's IP\naddress, I'm gonna take an APIPA address,\n\n386\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.320\nthat automatic private IP address.\n\n387\n00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.620\nThere was a conflict, and Windows\ntries to eliminate the conflict, but\n\n388\n00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.160\nyou don't see it if you just run ipconfig.\n\n389\n00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.140\nIf you run an ipconfig /all,\nand I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n390\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.380\npipe this out to more, make it a little\nbit easier for us to see, and me to find.\n\n391\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.500\nNotice what it says, IPv4 address,\n\n392\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.380\nit still has the IPv4 address, but\nbecause it knows it's a duplicate,\n\n393\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.820\nit's shut it down, and\nit's not gonna let it work.\n\n394\n00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.293\nIt's not gonna let the duplicate fly,\nright, no, no, no, no,\n\n395\n00:22:42.293 --> 00:22:46.221\nno, you're right, that's client01,\nI'm gonna fall back to APIPA.\n\n396\n00:22:46.221 --> 00:22:51.007\nAnd it's up to me to fix the problem,\nright, and we can do that.\n\n397\n00:22:51.007 --> 00:22:54.615\nWe can come up here, we'll close our\ncommand prompt or our PowerShell down,\n\n398\n00:22:54.615 --> 00:22:58.742\nwe'll open our Network and Sharing Center,\nchange the network adapter's settings.\n\n399\n00:22:58.742 --> 00:23:02.580\nRight click, choose Properties,\nTCP/IPv4, again,\n\n400\n00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.450\nchoosing Properties, and we'll change\nthis back to the right address.\n\n401\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.700\nIn fact, I'll go way overboard here,\nand I'll overshoot the runway.\n\n402\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.141\nI'll say 10.10.10.250, we'll say OK,\n\n403\n00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:22.210\nhit close, and let's rerun our ipconfig.\n\n404\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:26.500\nNow when I rerun ipconfig,\nnotice that it's got that IP address.\n\n405\n00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.982\nBecause it called out and it said, hey,\n\n406\n00:23:28.982 --> 00:23:33.800\n10.10.10.250 is at my MAC address,\nthe server's MAC address.\n\n407\n00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.480\nIt listened out and\nit didn't get a response back, and\n\n408\n00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.860\nit said, it must be unique.\n\n409\n00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.060\nI'll go ahead and apply it to the\nproperties of this network adapter, and\n\n410\n00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.969\nwe can communicate, all right?\n\n411\n00:23:44.969 --> 00:23:46.795\nSo that's something that you might see,\ntoo.\n\n412\n00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:51.949\nNow, the other duplicate, and I know\nwe're kind of running a little bit short\n\n413\n00:23:51.949 --> 00:23:56.728\non time, so let's do one more here,\nZach, is a duplicate MAC address.\n\n414\n00:23:56.728 --> 00:24:00.545\nNow if you're watching this for the first\ntime, this might confuse a little bit.\n\n415\n00:24:00.545 --> 00:24:04.080\nCuz you might have paid attention to some\nof our other episodes where I told you\n\n416\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.970\na MAC address is a six-byte\nhardware identifier, right?\n\n417\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.060\nIt's burned into the network adapter.\n\n418\n00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.190\nWell, how could there be two\nthat are the duplicates, right?\n\n419\n00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:15.200\nThere shouldn't be any duplicates.\n\n420\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.280\nIt's one of the reasons we\nhave that unique identifier.\n\n421\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.570\nWell, here's the thing, virtualization,\nI have multiple computers right now,\n\n422\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.370\nmultiple operating systems all running\non this Mac, and I can show you, right?\n\n423\n00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.230\nIf we go back to my screen here, right?\n\n424\n00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.690\nI have a Mac desktop, right?\n\n425\n00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.460\nI'm running them in VMWare.\n\n426\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.770\nAnd inside of VMware,\nit's virtualizing the MAC address.\n\n427\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.640\nSo it's allowing me to run\nmultiple operating systems.\n\n428\n00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.955\nAnd we're not breaking the rules of TCP/IP\ncuz it's virtualizing the MAC addresses,\n\n429\n00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:48.620\nright?\n\n430\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.310\nWell, this is where you could\npotentially get a duplicate.\n\n431\n00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.670\nIf I look at the virtual machine it's\nwhere the duplicate MAC address comes in,\n\n432\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.500\ntypically a problem with virtualization.\n\n433\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.830\nAnd if I look at settings, all right?\n\n434\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.448\nAnd more so, I go to the network adapter\nand some of the advanced options,\n\n435\n00:25:04.448 --> 00:25:05.201\nall right?\n\n436\n00:25:05.201 --> 00:25:08.866\nNotice the MAC address right here,\nthe hypervisor,\n\n437\n00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:13.191\nthe virtualization software is\ngenerating this MAC address.\n\n438\n00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:15.448\nAnd if this machine was turned off,\nI could sit there and\n\n439\n00:25:15.448 --> 00:25:16.850\nI could regenerate a MAC address.\n\n440\n00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.700\nAnd there's a lot of possibilities,\nlot of possibilities, right?\n\n441\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.340\nBut there is also a possibility that\npotentially if you statically map\n\n442\n00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.730\nthese MAC addresses through\nthe virtualization software,\n\n443\n00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.270\nthat you get a duplicate as well.\n\n444\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.310\nAll right, typically that's gonna\nbe a virtualization problem.\n\n445\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.180\nThat's gonna be an issue\nin your virtualization, and\n\n446\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.600\nit doesn't really mean that it's gonna\nbe a problem with the hypervisor,\n\n447\n00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.290\nthe virtualization software,\nyou could try to manually generate this.\n\n448\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.560\nThat's why it's good to let\nthe hypervisor generate them.\n\n449\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.720\nCuz, the hypervisor, if it generates them,\nor the virtualization software generates\n\n450\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.410\nthem, it's keeping track of what the MAC\naddresses are that are being used.\n\n451\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.290\nBut you could get a duplicate.\n\n452\n00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:57.270\nAnd these are some of the service issues\nthat you might run into on your machines.\n\n453\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.490\nKeep in mind that we still got more to go.\n\n454\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.930\nBut Zach's looking at me over there, and I\ndon't think we have time in this episode.\n\n455\n00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.434\n&gt;&gt; Common Network Service Issues part\n\n456\n00:26:04.434 --> 00:26:05.741\nthree will be coming your way.\n\n457\n00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:07.629\nThere's a part one and part two,\nmake sure you see that.\n\n458\n00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:10.857\nAnd see everything in the CompTIA Net Plus\nseries that Wes put together and\n\n459\n00:26:10.857 --> 00:26:12.750\nhe's done a wonderful job at doing that.\n\n460\n00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.040\nThank you again Wes.\n\n461\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.610\nAnd by the way, when you're looking at\nthat course library there are thousands of\n\n462\n00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.170\nvideos there and\nthey are there to help you go further.\n\n463\n00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.310\nCheck them all out.\n\n464\n00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.298\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n465\n00:26:24.298 --> 00:26:26.390\nITPROTV is binge-worthy.\n\n466\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.620\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n467\n00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.250\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n468\n00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:37.281\n[MUSIC]\n\n469\n00:26:37.281 -->
