ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:18.990\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.600\nin today's episode we are taking\na look at network troubleshooting.\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.370\nJoining us today to help us\nout with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.890\nis none other than our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.830\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.780\nHow's it going?\n>> It's going great, and as always,\n\n9\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.060\nDan, it's great to be back here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.890\nAnd that's right, we're gonna look at\na little bit of the command line and\n\n11\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.390\nsee what we got going on when it comes\nto the world of troubleshooting.\n\n12\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.318\nSo, tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and dive in.\n\n13\n00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:45.944\nAnd Dan, one of the first commands I think\nwhen I think of just understanding about\n\n14\n00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:50.680\nthe networking communications in general,\nis gonna be good old trusty ipconfig.\n\n15\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.100\nNow, we've probably seen this before in\nother episodes and if you haven't, well,\n\n16\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.440\nthat's good that you're here.\n\n17\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710\nWe gotta keep in mind that we got a lot of\ngood episodes on networking that can show\n\n18\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.840\nyou really in depth about ipconfig.\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.100\nSo what is ipconfig for us?\n\n20\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.890\nWell that's the internet\nprotocol configuration utility.\n\n21\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.660\nAnd what we use it for\nprimarily is to look and\n\n22\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.860\nsee the parameters,\nTCP/IP parameters of our network adapter.\n\n23\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.140\nNow let's take the geek speak and all\nthe acronyms and alphabet soup out of it.\n\n24\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.110\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n25\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.310\nWell, we have to have an IP address,\nright,\n\n26\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.590\nto communicate across\nthe TCP/IP based network.\n\n27\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.170\nSo this is one of the first\nutilities that lets us know well,\n\n28\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.510\nwhat are those settings, Dan?\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.980\nSo I think we'll just go ahead and\ndive right in here and see what we have.\n\n30\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.320\nSo I've got a command prompt pulled up and\nI'm just gonna type ipconfig.\n\n31\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.250\nNow if I just type ipconfig by itself it's\ngonna give me some basic information.\n\n32\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.020\nNow you have to pay attention to\nwhich network adapter you have, and\n\n33\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.730\nit starts to get a little confusing\nsometimes when you couple in\n\n34\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.390\nthings like maybe wireless adapter and\na wired adapter, and then Bluetooth.\n\n35\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990\nAnd you should see some\nIPv6 here going on,\n\n36\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.440\nToredo and some of those other adapters\nand technologies that are out there.\n\n37\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.780\nThe ones that we really are concerned\nwith, specifically in a TCP/IP v4 network,\n\n38\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.970\nis gonna be the one that\nyou see right here.\n\n39\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.160\nAnd if you notice, we have what?\n\n40\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.070\nWe have our Ethernet adapter Ethernet0.\n\n41\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.480\nRight, Ethernet0 is the name\nof the local area connection.\n\n42\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.800\nNow you might, out there, look and\nsee local area connection.\n\n43\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.260\nRight, that's pretty standard here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.370\nNow, I'm in a virtual machine.\n\n45\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.850\nSo, kind of renames the network\nvirtualized adapters a little bit\n\n46\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.990\ndifferently, but that's all it is,\nit's just a name.\n\n47\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.510\nIt's gonna look maybe the local\narea connection for you.\n\n48\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.420\nNow Dan, one of the first things I have\nto find out is if I do have network\n\n49\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.530\nconnection problems, right?\n\n50\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.980\nIf I don't have communication, right?\n\n51\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.630\nI'm gonna probably check here, right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.210\nI'm probably gonna check the IP\naddress cuz I have to have one.\n\n53\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.780\nNow Dan,\nyou mentioned something earlier, right?\n\n54\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.830\nIf we are gonna check for\n\n55\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.780\nnetwork communications, ipconfig might\nnot be the first place I go, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.496\n>> Yeah, usually it's really a good idea\nto actually check your cable stuff first.\n\n57\n00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:50.642\nIt happens all the time.\n\n58\n00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:54.580\nNo, that's not specifically a command line\nfunction, obviously we're in the physical\n\n59\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.115\nrealm and that's kind of a virtual thing,\ndigitized, as it were.\n\n60\n00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.825\nBut it does happen a lot, maybe you moved\nyour desk, maybe you said, you know what,\n\n61\n00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:05.357\nmy computer would look better over here or\nit'd be more functional.\n\n62\n00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:09.463\nAnd now I got a different office, awesome,\nI'm migrating over there for all my stuff,\n\n63\n00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.200\nand you forgot to plug that cable in.\n\n64\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.818\nThat is one thing that'll stop you\ndead in your tracks every time,\n\n65\n00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.540\nyou're not gonna get much connectivity\nif your cable isn't actually plugged in.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.690\nMight be on a wireless network,\nthat could happen, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.420\nBut if you are on a wired network,\ncheck both ends of the cable, right,\n\n68\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.050\nmake sure that they are securely seated,\nlisten for that click, and\n\n69\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.640\nthen if you're still having trouble,\n\n70\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.445\njust make sure that there's no\nobvious places inside that cable.\n\n71\n00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:36.070\nWhere maybe you ran it over with\na chair and now it's cut inside.\n\n72\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.710\nMaybe it didn't cut through but\nit's broken the wires, and such.\n\n73\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.400\nJust look for damage to the cable.\n\n74\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.450\nThese are simple starting\npoints that you want to check.\n\n75\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.560\nIf you realize, hey,\nmaybe I did some moving.\n\n76\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.780\nMaybe there is a physical problem.\n\n77\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.230\nYou might just want to go there first,\nbut other than that, ipconfig,\n\n78\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.330\nthat's definitely where we're gonna start,\nbecause we got to see whether or\n\n79\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.840\nnot, we're even on a network and\nipconfig and lets us do that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.660\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n81\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.760\nSo while we were getting that explanation,\nI went ahead and move about five or\n\n82\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.500\nsix computers and\nforgot to plug in their network adapters.\n\n83\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.130\nOkay, just kidding.\n\n84\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.280\nBut we went ahead and set up a scenario,\nwhat would it look like if\n\n85\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.390\nthe media was disconnected inside\na command prompt with ipconfig?\n\n86\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.210\nLet's check that out here, so\nI'm gonna rerun the command.\n\n87\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.890\nAll right,\n\n88\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.580\nand the very first thing you notice right\nhere is media is disconnected, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.438\nSo, first of all, I don't have an IP\naddress, so then I can tell that's\n\n90\n00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:28.579\ngotta be a problem here and I don't\neven see anything, I see no information.\n\n91\n00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:33.570\nI don't see a MAC address or anything,\nso I can also check down here.\n\n92\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.800\nMy head's kind of covering it up, but down\nhere at the bottom you got that little\n\n93\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.700\nmonitor icon, and notice,\nI gotta get my hand out of the way there.\n\n94\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.060\nNotice how there's a little red x on it,\n\n95\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.180\nthat lets me know that\nthe media's disconnected.\n\n96\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.050\nAnd if I go into the Network and\nSharing Center, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.990\njust re-enable this and\nthen we'll get out of the GUI here and\n\n98\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.900\nget back to the command prompt.\n\n99\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.990\nAll right, now notice the difference\nhere once I rerun this command.\n\n100\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.710\nNotice when I do an ipconfig,\nwell, I get an IP address here.\n\n101\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.320\nI get a subnet mask and\nI get my default gateway, and\n\n102\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.440\nthese are all important things.\n\n103\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.035\nIt is a necessity to have an IP address\nand the right subnet mask communicate on\n\n104\n00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:11.585\nyour local network,\nif you want to go across your network.\n\n105\n00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:14.856\nMaybe for you home viewers out there, you\nwant to go communicate out there across\n\n106\n00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.780\nthe Internet, then the default\ngateway is gonna be important, too.\n\n107\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.110\nSome other information in here, as well,\nbut this is definitely gonna be the start.\n\n108\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.520\nNow, If you need to see\nadditional information, right?\n\n109\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.880\nMore information than just what ipconfig\ngets, well we got a switch now, right?\n\n110\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.570\nWe add the switch with a /all.\n\n111\n00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:38.000\nAll right now,\nthis is a ton of information guys, so\n\n112\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.660\nyou'll see a lot of IPV6\ntranslational technologies.\n\n113\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.630\nNow I see my Bluetooth adapter here.\n\n114\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.690\nBut notice that in the ethernet\nadapter area, notice that I get a lot\n\n115\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.200\nof additional information that\nwasn't there before, right?\n\n116\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.610\nI get information on, am I using DHCP,\nand if I follow this information over,\n\n117\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.440\nright, I can see that,\nyeah, DHCP is enabled.\n\n118\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.241\nSo if for some reason I don't have an IP\naddress, all right, well, I can probably\n\n119\n00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:10.133\nsay that it doesn't have to do with the\nfact that my computer's configured wrong.\n\n120\n00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:14.196\nI might want to check out my home router\nor something, maybe that's being blocked,\n\n121\n00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:17.420\nright, and we could even show you\nwhat that might look like, too.\n\n122\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.420\nIf I come in here and I do an ipconfig and\nI do a release, all right,\n\n123\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.240\nbasically what I'm telling this\nnetwork adapter is I'm saying,\n\n124\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.430\nI know the DHCP server's\ngiving an IP address.\n\n125\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.750\nI just want you to let it go, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.580\nLet it go, man.\n\n127\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.390\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nrun an /all here.\n\n128\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.840\nAnd now you're gonna notice\na little bit different here, right?\n\n129\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.880\nNotice that DHCP is still enabled.\n\n130\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.780\nRight, nothing has changed.\n\n131\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.080\nI still have DHCP, but now I'm getting\nwhat is known as an APIPA address, right?\n\n132\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.980\nNow an APIPA address, understand.\n\n133\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.360\nAnd Dan made a good point as we were\ntaking behind the scenes here that\n\n134\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.410\nAPIPA in and\nof itself isn't a tool, right?\n\n135\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.570\nIt's not a utility.\n\n136\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.140\nBut it could be indicative of\na problem that you're having with\n\n137\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.930\nyour DHCP server, right?\n\n138\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.460\nMy computer now is calling out to the\nnetwork and it's saying, hey DHCP server,\n\n139\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.660\nare you out there?\n\n140\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.490\nI could really use an IP address, right?\n\n141\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.180\nNow, I kind of created this problem here,\nbut this would look no different, right?\n\n142\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.730\nSo it's calling out and\nthe DHCP server is snoozing.\n\n143\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.460\nWell, that's a problem.\n\n144\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.170\nNow what if I know that I've\nrebooted the DHCP server?\n\n145\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.590\nI know it's online but\nI still don't have an IP address.\n\n146\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.970\nWell, you seen the release, right?\n\n147\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.560\nSometimes you get a sticky lease where the\ncomputer just doesn't want to let it go,\n\n148\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.070\nor you want to force the DHCP\nprocess to start over again.\n\n149\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.180\nWell that's when we change that,\nand let me clear the screen and\n\n150\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.090\nget towards the top so\nyou guys can see that a little easier,\n\n151\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:38.210\nnow this is where I want to change\nthat switch to renew, right?\n\n152\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.960\nNow what's gonna happen?\n\n153\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.308\nWhen I change it to renew,\nit's gonna take a second.\n\n154\n00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:43.170\nNow you're gonna see something,\nan error out here,\n\n155\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.340\nBluetooth is not going to receive an IP\naddress, and you should be able to see it.\n\n156\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.180\nThis operation can't be performed in\nthe Bluetooth network connection.\n\n157\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.310\nIt's an expected error, right?\n\n158\n00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.115\nWe're not using DHCP on Bluetooth.\n\n159\n00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:59.325\nBut what I do see now is that I've got\nan IP address again, and if I get a little\n\n160\n00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:04.874\nbit more information I can say that yes,\nagain, DHCP is still enabled, right?\n\n161\n00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:08.190\nOops, there we go, DHCP is still enabled.\n\n162\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.850\nI do have an IP address and now I also\nhave what's known as an active lease.\n\n163\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.850\nKinda like a car rental agreement,\nright, or I'm gonna be in town for\n\n164\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.010\na while, I'm gonna be using this car,\nI've got the car for a week,\n\n165\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.360\nsame thing happens with your IP addresses.\n\n166\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.970\nSo Dan, ipconfig, ipconfig all,\nipconfig release and\n\n167\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.160\nrenew All good switches inside of\nthe IP Configuration utility, or\n\n168\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.810\nIPConfig utility that can help you start\non your network troubleshooting journey.\n\n169\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.670\n>> Yeah, it's, like I say, it's a great\nplace to begin, because you start getting\n\n170\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.580\nan idea of the network connectivity\nthat your device actually has.\n\n171\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.000\nWe saw it with Ethernet Zero.\n\n172\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.720\nWe looked at it.\n\n173\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.430\nIPConfig's giving me an IP\naddress Subnet mask.\n\n174\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.030\nAll the good stuff was there.\n\n175\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.640\nNow, sometimes, you're setup for DHCP.\n\n176\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.170\nYou plug in, you turn on.\n\n177\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.411\nOkay, my cables are good, but\nI still can't contact the network.\n\n178\n00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.640\nDo an ipconfig.\n\n179\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.060\nI have an IP address.\n\n180\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.270\nI still can't do any kind of connectivity.\n\n181\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.830\nThe problem is it might just be set to\nat static address, That does happen,\n\n182\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.360\nmaybe someone came in and configured,\nmaybe you did it during some testing.\n\n183\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.090\nThis happens.\n\n184\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.060\nI've had it happen to me.\n\n185\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.320\nYou just forget that I had this thing set\nfor a static address for whatever reason.\n\n186\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.380\nNow I wanted to get a DHCP address, you\ngotta go back in, you gotta change that.\n\n187\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.630\nNow that's not necessarily done\nthrough the command line...\n\n188\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.270\nyou can do it and\nwe might even actually talk about that.\n\n189\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.070\nBut, using IP config is gonna let you\nknow, I'm not on the correct network.\n\n190\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.480\nI've got a static IP outside of the range\nof the network that I'm on right now.\n\n191\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.510\nIt's not valid.\n\n192\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.980\nSo, just using IP config is\ngonna allow you to see that and\n\n193\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.100\ngo, yes, I'm set for static.\n\n194\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.100\nI'm need to change that to DHCP and\nnow I should be good to go.\n\n195\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.835\nSo even though it's a very simple tool.\n\n196\n00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.520\nRight?\nIt just gives you output.\n\n197\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.750\nYou do have a few functional keys with it.\n\n198\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.130\nIt's got some switches you can\nthrow at it and do some things.\n\n199\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.470\nBut normally, you're just using it for\ninformational, or just hey,\n\n200\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.890\nrelease that and renew me another one.\n\n201\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.640\nWes, is there anything else when it comes\nto IP config that we can learn about.\n\n202\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.870\n>> There really is, and there\nare a ton of switches, like Dan says.\n\n203\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.740\nThere are a couple that I wanna point out,\nbecause we're gonna talk more about this\n\n204\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.770\ntroubleshooting, troubleshooting\nthis service coming up as well.\n\n205\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.841\nBut DNS, DNS might be something that,\nyou know, DNS Domain Name System, keep in\n\n206\n00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.747\nmind it just takes our user friendly names\nand maps them to their IP addresses.\n\n207\n00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:23.531\nSo if we want to contact websites\nout there across the world,\n\n208\n00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:27.243\nwell Dan doesn't have to break out that\nold 50 pound book of all the IP addresses\n\n209\n00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:31.070\nthat he has written out, because you\nknow we couldn't remember them all.\n\n210\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.050\nRight, so DNS does name resolution for us.\n\n211\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.340\nWell, you might say,\nwell wait a second, Wes,\n\n212\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.010\nI thought you just said IP\nconfiguration utility, right?\n\n213\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.590\nWell what does that have\nto do with anything?\n\n214\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.580\nWell, DNS has a lot to do with it, right?\n\n215\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.230\nIf I type a name in,\nI can't visit the website by its name, but\n\n216\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.140\nI type in its IP address\ncuz I happen to know it,\n\n217\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.150\nthen I know there's a problem with DNS And\nthat's where ipconfig display DNS.\n\n218\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.550\nThe display DNS switch\ncan come in handy for us.\n\n219\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.780\nSo, if I need to for\ninstance view the local resolver cache,\n\n220\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.750\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n221\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.960\nI can do a ipconfig and\nI can do a /displaydns and\n\n222\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.340\nwhen I do this I don't expect you\nto remember all this information.\n\n223\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.320\nDan, did you catch that last one?\n\n224\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.100\n>> Every last bit.\n\n225\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.485\n>> All right, I got that.\n\n226\n00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:15.040\n[LAUGH] And this is a good thing, right?\n\n227\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.950\nSo this is the local resolver cache.\n\n228\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.340\nAnd what does helps you do?\n\n229\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.330\nIt helps speed up the response times\nbetween the time you type in that name to\n\n230\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.880\nactually connecting to the web page and\nit being delivered right.\n\n231\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.830\nIt's like caching area if you will.\n\n232\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.270\nWhy send a communication out to your\nISP's DNS server and wait for it,\n\n233\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.100\neven though is milliseconds, wait for\nit to come back if I can look locally.\n\n234\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.660\nI know where the IP address is based\non it's name because I have it\n\n235\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.080\nright here on this machine.\n\n236\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.610\nNow doesn't necessarily happen a lot but\nit could on your internal network\n\n237\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.680\nespecially if you're maintaining\nyour own internal DNS server and\n\n238\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.770\nthere's some changes like internally and\ninside of your infrastructure.\n\n239\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.340\nMaybe you've got a intranet site\nthat your company, you go to and\n\n240\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.370\nyou visit employee documents and\nstuff like that.\n\n241\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.310\nAnd for whatever reason,\nit doesn't happen a lot,\n\n242\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.969\nbut for whatever reason maybe\nthe IP address changes.\n\n243\n00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.860\nWell if you haven't turned your computer\noff that IP address could be in one of\n\n244\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.720\nthese records, right?\n\n245\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.590\nAnd it could be mapping you to your\ninternal company website to an IP\n\n246\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.580\naddress that no longer exists,\nor isn't relevant right now.\n\n247\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.900\nMaybe it changed.\n\n248\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.274\nThe problem is because this caching system\nis the first place you're gonna look\n\n249\n00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:24.464\nI'm never gonna send a request, hey DNS\nserver, where is www.employeehandbook.com.\n\n250\n00:12:24.464 --> 00:12:26.180\nLet's say that's our intranet site.\n\n251\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.440\nWhy?\nBecause I've already got my\n\n252\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.460\nanswer locally.\n\n253\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.280\nRight or wrong, I've got my answer locally\nand that's what I'm sticking with.\n\n254\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.230\nSo that's where the next one comes in.\n\n255\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.760\nI might wanna do something like this.\n\n256\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.420\nI might wanna do,\n\n257\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.960\ninstead of a display DNS they call\nthat caching a stale record, right?\n\n258\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.460\nIt's stale because it It no longer\nmaps to a valid IP address.\n\n259\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.310\nSo instead what I could do is a flushdns.\n\n260\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.926\nAll right now this works as well.\n\n261\n00:12:48.926 --> 00:12:49.437\nBut you know,\n\n262\n00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:53.050\nwe're in the command prompt you can\nalso do this in PowerShell as well.\n\n263\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.604\nSo you pay attention to some of\nthe PowerShell episodes we got out there.\n\n264\n00:12:56.604 --> 00:13:04.230\nCuz likewise you can do a get-DNS client\ncache or a clear-DNS client cache.\n\n265\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.730\nBut we'll stick with\nthe command prompt here and\n\n266\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.490\nwe'll do the flush DNS,\nipconfig /flushdns.\n\n267\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.740\nNow Dan, did you catch that one?\n\n268\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.760\nThat one wasn't too bad, right?\n\n269\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.150\nWe didn't have a whole bunch\nof records going through.\n\n270\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.650\n>> A big flyby.\n\n271\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.410\n>> That's right.\n\n272\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ndisplay our DNS cache again.\n\n273\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.940\nAnd notice it says,\ncould not display the DNS Resolver Cache.\n\n274\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.500\nSo, if I do feel like that name resolution\n\n275\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.490\nis an issue because of a stale record,\nright, well, I can flush that.\n\n276\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.170\nYou say,\nwell how did you get to that point?\n\n277\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.110\nWell, let me show you, all right?\n\n278\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.820\nIf I go back to my ipconfig /all,\n\n279\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.910\nnotice that I am using\na couple of DNS servers here.\n\n280\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.680\nNow, Dan, I'm sure you could pick up\non what these servers are, right?\n\n281\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.580\n>> If they are the 8.8.8s, then, yes,\nthey are, I believe, Google's DNS servers?\n\n282\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.080\n>> That's right.\n\n283\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.030\nYes, sir.\nVery good.\n\n284\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.880\nVery good.\nAnd for the most part,\n\n285\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.740\nguys, I really have never had\nthese not return a response on me.\n\n286\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.590\nAnd I'm sure they're using some kind of\nload balancing in the background that\n\n287\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.300\nwe're not aware of.\n\n288\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.030\nBut they usually give responses,\nso I know, all right,\n\n289\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.630\nthat I've got at least a DNS\nserver set up, all right.\n\n290\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.960\nSo I could say that maybe that\nthe DNS problem that I was having\n\n291\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.750\nwas directly related right\nthere to these records.\n\n292\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.340\nNow you say, well wait a sec, are you\nbrowsing to anything in the background?\n\n293\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.220\nWell Yes I am.\n\n294\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.160\nAlright, you guys could probably\nsee that I got my Chrome browser\n\n295\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.000\nopened in the background.\n\n296\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.320\nWell it's doing a keep alive,\nright, with Google server.\n\n297\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.050\nSo it's still resolving names because\nI've got that active connection.\n\n298\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.980\nSo it's constantly generating\nthose records and again real fast.\n\n299\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.980\nIf I wanna clear them, there you go.\n\n300\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.120\nIt's, they're all gone It's gonna\nmake me close that down, isn't it?\n\n301\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.020\nThere we go.\nAnd let me clear the screen up\n\n302\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.830\nhere one more time and\nwe'll display the DNS.\n\n303\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.270\nSo very easy way that if you do think\nrelated to IP config that you're having\n\n304\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.650\nsome kind of DNS name resolution issue,\njust go ahead and flush the cache.\n\n305\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.380\n>> That's right.\n\n306\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.679\nNow the one two punch as we like\nto call it here Is usually,\n\n307\n00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:06.975\nyou start with IP config and you say,\nokay I see that I'm on a network.\n\n308\n00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:09.110\nNow it's time to start\ntesting connectivity.\n\n309\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.557\nDo I have connectivity\nwith a certain device?\n\n310\n00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:15.120\nThis is a very common troubleshooting\ntechnique that we use.\n\n311\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.390\nAnd the utility that we\nuse in that one-two punch\n\n312\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.230\nis gonna be your good old friend ping,\nright?\n\n313\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.320\n>> That's right.\n\n314\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.490\n>> And I know everybody, I learned\nit as the Packet Internet Groper.\n\n315\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.110\nFrom what I actually understand,\nthat's actually kinda anachronistic.\n\n316\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.018\nIt came later to be called Packet Internet\nThe original developer just meant it as\n\n317\n00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:34.380\nping, like sonar.\n\n318\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.880\nI'm sending out a noise and I'm waiting to\nhear back from it to measure whether or\n\n319\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.210\nnot was something there,\nand that's the idea, right?\n\n320\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.170\n>> Nothing like retro\nnaming to confuse you.\n\n321\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.030\nThat's exactly it.\n\n322\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.620\nWe've got to use ping.\n\n323\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.670\nAll right,\nnow ping It sends out little signals.\n\n324\n00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.010\nThese little signals that go to whatever\ndevice it is that you're testing them and\n\n325\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.550\nthey say, hey, are you there?\n\n326\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.282\nAnd we should get some replies back.\n\n327\n00:15:56.282 --> 00:16:00.018\nNow if we get replies back then we know\nfrom the standpoint of this device\n\n328\n00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:04.084\nhere and whatever device I sent that\ninformation to That we can communicate.\n\n329\n00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:08.436\nBut there is a process to do this.\n\n330\n00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.759\nLet me give you the real world scenario.\n\n331\n00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:13.750\nIf I'm testing internet connectivity, I'm\ngoing to test against the Internet, right?\n\n332\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.000\nBut there is a right way to use ping.\n\n333\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.848\nYou start as local to your computer as you\ncan, and then you slowly work your way to\n\n334\n00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:23.430\nyour perimeter of your network, and\nthen, finally, past your network.\n\n335\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.900\nAnd that is a good way.\n\n336\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.550\nLike I said, for those of you that are\nwatching that have used ping before, and\n\n337\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.270\nI'm sure we've got some of you out there,\nsay, well, why don't you just ping\n\n338\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.890\nthe Internet, or something out there\non the Internet, and find out?\n\n339\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.940\nYeah, well, that's good.\n\n340\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.760\nBut if you had a multi-routed\nenvironment internally on your network,\n\n341\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.790\nthat's not always the case.\n\n342\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.810\nFirst place that we're gonna go,\nwe say there's no place like home, right?\n\n343\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.890\nSo first thing I'm gonna do is,\n\n344\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.890\nI wanna test my operating system's ability\nto speak the language of the network.\n\n345\n00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.952\nIn this case, the protocol being TCP/IP.\n\n346\n00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:54.766\nSo the first thing I'm doing is I'm\npinging the loopback address, and\n\n347\n00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:58.068\nby default we usually say 127.0.0.1.\n\n348\n00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.840\nNow this doesn't send any electrical\ncommunications out of the network adapter.\n\n349\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.810\nAll this does is says, internally,\n\n350\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.645\ndoes my operating system understand\nthe DNA that we're using, or\n\n351\n00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:11.325\nthe communication protocols that\nwe're using for this network.\n\n352\n00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:13.455\nAnd at this point I'm\ngetting a reply back.\n\n353\n00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:20.800\nI can see that the operating system\nknows what's going on with the TCP/IP.\n\n354\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.074\nNow what if I want to find out does\nmy network adapter have the ability\n\n355\n00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:26.033\nto respond to itself when its called on?\n\n356\n00:17:26.033 --> 00:17:29.200\nDan says we have our piece of information,\nhowever it might be.\n\n357\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.314\nA share or something like that.\n\n358\n00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:35.540\nWell, Dan, I didn't know that my network\nadapter can respond to that request.\n\n359\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.507\nSo here's what we do.\n\n360\n00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:39.198\nNext thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're going to ping.\n\n361\n00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:40.440\nOops.\n\n362\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.740\nI'm gonna spell that right.\n\n363\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.420\nWe're going to ping our own IP address.\n\n364\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.520\nNow, you know what's kind of funny?\n\n365\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.170\nI think I've forgotten my IP address\nafter all this looking at it.\n\n366\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.810\nSo that's why we got ipconfig, and\nthat's why Dan said a one-two punch.\n\n367\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.094\nFirst of all, I've got to find some\nIP addresses that are valid and\n\n368\n00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:54.745\nrelevant to me personally here.\n\n369\n00:17:54.745 --> 00:18:04.067\nI can see my IP address there is\n10.1.230.54, and if I do a ping.\n\n370\n00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:04.729\nWhat was it?\n\n371\n00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:11.940\n10.1.230.54, I see that\nit returns a response.\n\n372\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.200\nAnd if I want to, I'm gonna make\nthat persistent here, as we go.\n\n373\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.860\nIf you're in the other operating\nsystems it's persistent by default.\n\n374\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.010\nWindows it isn't.\n\n375\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.372\nBut, what I'm doing here is my\nnetwork adapter is being called upon.\n\n376\n00:18:23.372 --> 00:18:26.204\nNow it's being called upon by the\noperating system, and it proves to me that\n\n377\n00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:29.820\nmy network adapter, when it's called on,\nit can say, yeah, I'm over here.\n\n378\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.750\nYou can talk to me.\n\n379\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.950\nSo that we can see that we are getting\nresponses from the network adapter.\n\n380\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.300\nHowever, we do have to go\na little bit farther than that.\n\n381\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.870\nFrom the standpoint of this computer,\n\n382\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.260\nI know that this computer can\ncommunicate with the network.\n\n383\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.100\nNow that doesn't mean that this\ncomputer can communicate with any other\n\n384\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.610\ndevice on the network,\nwhich is our next step, right?\n\n385\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:51.270\nNow we're as close as we can,\nthe operating system, the network adapter\n\n386\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.753\nthat is attached to the operating system,\nor the other way around if you will, and\n\n387\n00:18:54.753 --> 00:18:56.670\nthen, finally,\nanother computer on my network.\n\n388\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.180\nWell, there's a couple of\nthat things you can do.\n\n389\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.242\nIf you end up having like, maybe\na separate DNS server on the internal\n\n390\n00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:06.950\nnetwork, just do an IP config, or find\nthat DHCP, or DNS server, and ping it.\n\n391\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.069\nA lot of times I will tell you\nthat our default gateways for\n\n392\n00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:10.005\ndoing all of that for us.\n\n393\n00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:12.000\nSo that might not be an accurate test.\n\n394\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.790\nSo what I've got is another machine,\nout here on the network.\n\n395\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.250\nWell, first you have to\nuse an IP address and\n\n396\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.330\nyou have to use the-\n>> Valid notation?\n\n397\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.611\n>> Make sure you use ping, right?\n\n398\n00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:25.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what we're talking about here.\n\n399\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.526\n>> It just knows inherently,\nyou wanna use ping.\n\n400\n00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:28.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n401\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.170\nThat's right, and you know I might not,\none of the things, let me see here.\n\n402\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.000\nIt might have gone to sleep here.\n\n403\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.358\nMake sure I got that right.\n\n404\n00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:35.196\nAnd you know what?\n\n405\n00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.497\nIt doesn't look like it's pinging.\n\n406\n00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:38.563\nSo the good thing about this is,\n\n407\n00:19:38.563 --> 00:19:42.860\nI've communicated with other\ncomputers on this network.\n\n408\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.045\nSo this is one that we weren't\nreally going to talk about here, but\n\n409\n00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:50.282\nI'm going to go ahead and\nthrow it in here anyways.\n\n410\n00:19:50.282 --> 00:19:54.415\nARP is the Address Resolution Protocol,\nand if my computer has talked to other\n\n411\n00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:58.930\ncomputers within the network, it should\nhave cached their MAC addresses and IPs.\n\n412\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.150\nSo I want to see if I've got another\ncomputer in here that maybe this one,\n\n413\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.040\nlooks like we've got a few here.\n\n414\n00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.980\nAll right, so I'm gonna try one of these\nother computers that are on the network.\n\n415\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.350\nApparently at one point,\nI was communicating with them.\n\n416\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.200\nSo I can use this database as a way,\nreally,\n\n417\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.630\nto find an IP address of\nanother computer on my network.\n\n418\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.630\nSo a kinda little cool thing,\n\n419\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.820\neven though we weren't really talking\nabout ARP there, that we can throw in.\n\n420\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.521\n>> The only caveat to this is\nthese are computers that Wes\n\n421\n00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:23.390\nalready knows that they're alive.\n\n422\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.850\nHe's already made a connection to and\nis talking to.\n\n423\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.450\nIf you're trying to trouble shoot\na computer that you don't have that\n\n424\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.440\nknowledge, the computer has never\nspoken to it, well, at least since it's\n\n425\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.760\nbeen up and running, then you're not going\nto be able to use ARP to make this happen.\n\n426\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.103\nSo you might just have to\ngo the old sneakernet way.\n\n427\n00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:39.820\n>> That's right.\n\n428\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.161\n>> Run over there, check that computer,\nfind out what its IP address is,\n\n429\n00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:43.694\nuse good old ipconfig,\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n430\n00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:45.590\n>> and then do that.\n\n431\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.880\nIf you have a user on the phone,\nif that's the scenario, you can just say,\n\n432\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.160\nhey, do me a favor.\n\n433\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.710\nShow them how to open a command prompt.\n\n434\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.270\nType in ipconfig.\n\n435\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.210\nTell me what your IPv4 address is for\nyour computer.\n\n436\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.390\nAnd now you'll be able to do that.\n\n437\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.640\nOtherwise, we can do this.\n\n438\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.880\nThis is for demonstration purposes.\n\n439\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.860\n>> Yeah, definitely, and\nthank you for that, for sure.\n\n440\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.860\nSo now we've got one of the IP addresses,\nand\n\n441\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.780\nI just picked one out of the list here,\nand we'll see if it is good and going.\n\n442\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.497\nSo, we can see that we can ping it.\n\n443\n00:21:09.497 --> 00:21:10.437\nIt is there.\n\n444\n00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:13.417\nLike Dan said, I've got another computer\nover here that it is connected to\n\n445\n00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:16.160\nthe network, and I might just be\ndoing exactly that, sneakernet.\n\n446\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.700\nI'll go over here, do my ipconfig on this\ncomputer that's off to the side you guys\n\n447\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.139\ncan't see right here, find out its IP\naddress, and try to send a ping to it.\n\n448\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.820\nNow let me tell you something\na little bit about the ping.\n\n449\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.530\nWe're gonna stop right here,\njust for a second,\n\n450\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.830\nbecause ICMP can be a security risk,\nall right?\n\n451\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.141\nSo we've got to understand that.\n\n452\n00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:36.820\nLet's take right here for ITProTV.\n\n453\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.920\nThere might be something set up,\nmaybe Don or one of other hosts here,\n\n454\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.820\nhe might have something set up that he\ndoesn't want anybody just pinging and\n\n455\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.290\nsending all kinds of data to.\n\n456\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.170\nSo for security purposes,\nthey might block that.\n\n457\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.050\nSo ping isn't a one-stop-shop.\n\n458\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.750\nIf you ping one address and it doesn't\nreturn replies, try to ping another one,\n\n459\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.450\njust to make sure that\nIMCP isn't being blocked.\n\n460\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.830\nNow, what have we done, Dan?\n\n461\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.530\nSo far,\nwe've got our operating system is good.\n\n462\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Our network adapter is communicating,\n\n463\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.180\nit's responding.\n\n464\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.820\nNow we've got another\ncomputer that's responding.\n\n465\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.770\nSo at this point, internally,\nlocally in my network,\n\n466\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.410\nI know from the standpoint of\nthis computer I can communicate.\n\n467\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.260\nBut let's go a step farther.\n\n468\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.290\nWe're going to the edge of the network.\n\n469\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.740\nAs far to the edge of the network\nas we can get is the gateway.\n\n470\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.360\nThey call it the gateway for\na reason, right?\n\n471\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.380\nSo the last thing that we're gonna do,\n\n472\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.008\nwell, second to last thing that\n>> Second to last.\n\n473\n00:22:25.008 --> 00:22:26.840\n>> we're gonna do.\nThat's right, can't forget the last one.\n\n474\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.890\nThe second to last thing that we're\ngonna do is we're gonna ping our\n\n475\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.820\ndefault gateway.\n\n476\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.270\nNow, you might be asking yourself,\n\n477\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.770\nwell, what if I don't know the IP\naddress of my default gateway?\n\n478\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.515\nYes, you do.\nLet's go back and show you.\n\n479\n00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:38.860\nYou remember,\nwe've been using the ipconfig?\n\n480\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.130\nKinda see that one-two\nthat he's talking about,\n\n481\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.690\nwhy it keeps coming up back and forth?\n\n482\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.380\nWe use them a lot, they go hand-in-hand.\n\n483\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.590\nAnd notice that I got my\ndefault gateway here.\n\n484\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.420\nAll I have to do, and let me put this\nup to the top so you guys can see that.\n\n485\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.099\nWe'll do a ping.\n\n486\n00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:58.480\nWe'll do a 10.1.230.1, all right, and\nthen I'm just making these persistent.\n\n487\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.060\nGuys, you don't have\nto use the switch tee.\n\n488\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.400\nI'm just used to some of\nthe other operating systems.\n\n489\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.870\nYou know, ping doesn't shut\noff until you tell it too.\n\n490\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.460\n>> You know you bring\nup a really good point.\n\n491\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.860\nIt is a good practice to\nstart using the persistence.\n\n492\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:15.150\nI do it all the time because maybe I'm\ngetting intermittent connectivity,\n\n493\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.240\nand I can see you when\nthe pings dropped out.\n\n494\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.330\nMaybe there's a pattern to it?\n\n495\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.850\nMaybe I see it goes from five minutes,\nand then it drops.\n\n496\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.320\nI lose all my pings.\n\n497\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.940\nThey go away.\n\n498\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.300\nI start getting request denied,\nor unavailable, or whatever.\n\n499\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.740\nI can't get to it.\n\n500\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.890\nNow they're back up, five minutes later,\nI'm starting to see a pattern.\n\n501\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:31.640\nI can say, well,\n\n502\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.140\nthere's something going on in this\nnetwork between these two devices.\n\n503\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.580\nSometimes it's a flapping\nport on a switch.\n\n504\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.500\nThat can definitely cause things\nof intermittent connectivity.\n\n505\n00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.210\nThat is a great way, and using just\nping will help you figure that out.\n\n506\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.370\nMaybe I'm installing a new\npiece of network gear?\n\n507\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.340\nI've bought a new switch to replace\nthe one that's got flapping ports.\n\n508\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.834\nI'm like, okay, throw that in there.\n\n509\n00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:56.895\nI can do a persistent ping, put in my new\nswitch, run all the configuration, and\n\n510\n00:23:56.895 --> 00:24:00.386\nwhen those pings come back alive,\nI know that that switch is active.\n\n511\n00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:02.935\nEverything is now working,\nand using ping to do that.\n\n512\n00:24:02.935 --> 00:24:07.382\nVery simple tool, but I know guys that are\nlike CCIE level and that's what they use\n\n513\n00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:11.520\nto check connectivity with because\nit's a simple tool, it's easy to use.\n\n514\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.220\n>> It really is, now I wouldn't recommend\ndoing this from a remote location.\n\n515\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.790\nAnd Dan's got plenty of stories of\nwhy you don't reboot servers from\n\n516\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.270\na remote location.\n\n517\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.590\nNow if I'm on location, right, and we're\ngonna walk right over to, for instance,\n\n518\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.811\nour server closet here at ITProTV, right.\n\n519\n00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:30.420\nI will use a ping to do\na reboot on a server, right.\n\n520\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.320\nI'll issue the ping, and\nthen I'll make sure it's active.\n\n521\n00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.090\nI'll reboot the server and I don't really\nhave any way of telling very early on if\n\n522\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.930\nthat server has been rebooted.\n\n523\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.710\nAnd just like Dan says,\nit goes intermittent,\n\n524\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.590\nand then when it starts receiving replies\nback I could fire up Remote Desktop,\n\n525\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.000\nI'm back into the server\nbefore you know it.\n\n526\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.666\nBut, I would never recommend\ndoing that on a remote location,\n\n527\n00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:54.964\nbecause if the server doesn't come\nback online, you're in for a drive.\n\n528\n00:24:54.964 --> 00:24:57.667\nAll right so,\nvery easy utility to use here Dan, and\n\n529\n00:24:57.667 --> 00:25:00.860\nI'm just doing a Ctrl+C guys by the way,\nthat'll stop it.\n\n530\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.161\nPing, very, very good utility.\n\n531\n00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:06.176\nNow, we ping the default gateway,\nwe see that up until this point,\n\n532\n00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:09.560\nat the edge of our router,\nwe can communicate.\n\n533\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.250\nBut now we've gotta go\na little bit farther and\n\n534\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.668\nyou might hear some people say,\nping a remote network.\n\n535\n00:25:13.668 --> 00:25:15.054\nWell, in TCP/IP speak,\n\n536\n00:25:15.054 --> 00:25:18.778\nthat just means any other network\nto the one that your computer's on.\n\n537\n00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:21.409\nIt just so happens that if you're in\na home environment and watching this,\n\n538\n00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:22.730\na lot of times it's the Internet.\n\n539\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.180\nSo one of the last ones that I do is ping\na location out there on the Internet.\n\n540\n00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.090\nAnd there is plenty of them, in fact\nwe've already mentioned one of them\n\n541\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.230\nthat I use to see if I could replies back.\n\n542\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.170\nAnd that's Google's DNS servers out there,\nright?\n\n543\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.600\nThey're pretty good, I mean DNS,\nyou want it to be online or\n\n544\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.857\nthe backbone of the Internet goes down,\nso they want those servers to be online.\n\n545\n00:25:39.857 --> 00:25:40.706\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n546\n00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:45.690\nAll right so we'll do a ping, 8.8.8.8.\n\n547\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.630\nAnd when we run that, oops,\nwe'll run it right off the screen and\n\n548\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.870\nout the front door and out of the office.\n\n549\n00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.360\nSo we can see that we've\ngot some replies back now.\n\n550\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.418\nAnd from the standpoint of this computer,\n\n551\n00:25:56.418 --> 00:26:01.590\nit knows TCP/IP, my adapter's fine,\nI can communicate with other devices.\n\n552\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.560\nMy gateway, I can get to the gateway, and\n\n553\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.760\nnow I can even route\ntraffic off of the gateway.\n\n554\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.840\n>> That's right.\n\n555\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.060\nNow it comes to the part, well,\nwe've gotten ping, right?\n\n556\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.040\nIt's underneath our pelt, it's in our\ntoolkit, we can use it effectively, and\n\n557\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.460\nI want to ping something.\n\n558\n00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.390\nI'm trying to test connectivity\nwith something that's outside of\n\n559\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.440\nmy network like we did with\nthose Google DNS servers.\n\n560\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.800\nWhat happens if I ping them and\nthey don't reply?\n\n561\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.042\nIt could be one of two things.\n\n562\n00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.560\nAnd well, first thing is they\nshould be blocking ping, right?\n\n563\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.370\nThat could be the thing of it.\n\n564\n00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.330\nAnd if it is, well, let's try something\nelse that's not blocking ping.\n\n565\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.470\nContinue to work through things that are\noutside of your network until you find one\n\n566\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.420\nthat replies.\n\n567\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.010\nThat way you know,\n\n568\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.850\nmaybe you know something specific\nthat's out there that allows for ping.\n\n569\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.960\nYou can use that, write that down,\nkeep that in your little toolkit.\n\n570\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.420\nIf I need to test outside\nconnectivity with ping,\n\n571\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.920\nI can always go to this because\nit's not blocking ping.\n\n572\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.500\nBut what if I'm still not getting it and\nI know it's not blocking.\n\n573\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.930\nThat leads us to our next tool right?\n\n574\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.490\n>> That's right, and\nthat's called tracert.\n\n575\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.340\nNow those of you that maybe have seen\nthis in other operating systems,\n\n576\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.030\nthey spell it out.\n\n577\n00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.199\nSometimes even in the Windows\nworld we'll say traceroute,\n\n578\n00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:02.442\ntechnically it's not accurate.\n\n579\n00:27:02.442 --> 00:27:05.700\nIt's tracert,\ntraceroute is in the nix-based systems.\n\n580\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.200\nHowever, as far as functionality goes\nthey're very, very close to what they do.\n\n581\n00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.600\nTracert here in Windows and\ntraceroute out there in the nix system,\n\n582\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.080\ntraces the path a packet takes\nfrom source to destination.\n\n583\n00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.570\nSo we typically have more than one\nhop across remote networks and\n\n584\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.200\nespecially in packet switch networks,\nwe usually have more than one hop.\n\n585\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.818\nWell I need to know where\nthe communication breakdown is happening.\n\n586\n00:27:28.818 --> 00:27:32.247\nSo imagine a utility that lets me roadmap,\nright,\n\n587\n00:27:32.247 --> 00:27:37.130\nlike a footprint, like cookie crumbs,\nright, footprint on the sand.\n\n588\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.186\nAnd I can see which path it's\ntaken when leaves my computer and\n\n589\n00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:42.980\ngoes to that destination.\n\n590\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.020\nI wanna track each hop,\nright, the hop is the act or\n\n591\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.970\ntechnique of forwarding\ntraffic between two routers.\n\n592\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.240\nLet's see what that does for us, right?\n\n593\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.040\nSo if I do a tracert, and I tell you what,\n\n594\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.730\nfirst of all,\nyou can do this a couple of ways.\n\n595\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.020\nKeep in mind that if you use a name,\n\n596\n00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.050\nyou better hope you tested your name\nresolution to use that first, right?\n\n597\n00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.822\nBecause it's still gonna be use\na name resolution on the background.\n\n598\n00:28:04.822 --> 00:28:09.056\nIf I do www.google.com,\nright, so that's a name.\n\n599\n00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.512\nAnd if I run the tracert on it,\n\n600\n00:28:10.512 --> 00:28:13.089\nyou can see that it's resolved\nthe name here at top.\n\n601\n00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:17.812\nNotice that it gives me an IP address and\nit says tracing route to www.google.com.\n\n602\n00:28:17.812 --> 00:28:21.055\nAnd then it gives me Google's IP address.\n\n603\n00:28:21.055 --> 00:28:25.980\nAnd you see some of this information\ncoming out, we'll see here in a second.\n\n604\n00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:32.130\nIf you do a tracert that way,\nit's contingent on having name resolution.\n\n605\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:39.940\nSo if this fails, don't just automatically\nassume that the route itself has failed.\n\n606\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.390\nIt might be name resolution and\nDNS is snoozing, or whatever is going on.\n\n607\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.010\nYou might have to do some of those\nDNS troubleshooting that we were\n\n608\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.980\ntalking about.\n\n609\n00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.040\nAnd let me show you what I mean,\nso I'll tell you what,\n\n610\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.780\nI'll give that demonstration in a second.\n\n611\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.930\nLet’s see what we're looking at here, Dan.\n\n612\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.104\nAll right, now I've got a series of hops,\nright, it says 9 hops.\n\n613\n00:28:58.104 --> 00:29:01.050\nIt'll trace it over maximum of 30 hops,\nyou'll see.\n\n614\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.340\nThat means that's the maximum\ninformation it's gonna give back.\n\n615\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.830\nAll right, now I can see the first hop.\n\n616\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.420\nYou say, well how is this\ninformation useful to you?\n\n617\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.270\nWell here in Gainesville, this is\nactually really useful information.\n\n618\n00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.100\nAnd Dan, as you know,\nour major provider here locally,\n\n619\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.030\nour local ISP is gonna be\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n620\n00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.030\nRight, well call them GRUCom here,\nit's just shortened for\n\n621\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.750\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n622\n00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.412\nWell I can see that I'm on\ntheir networks right here.\n\n623\n00:29:28.412 --> 00:29:30.882\nIn fact, you can see I go all\nthe way out to their networks.\n\n624\n00:29:30.882 --> 00:29:33.994\nI wanna say this is somewhere\nin the Midwest I believe,\n\n625\n00:29:33.994 --> 00:29:36.170\nbut anyways it's on their local ISP.\n\n626\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.200\nSo if I start to see things like timeouts,\n\n627\n00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.420\nright, you might not see any information,\nright?\n\n628\n00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.110\nIf I start seeing this request timed out,\nrequest timed out and\n\n629\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.924\nit's on this local network,\ncouple things could be happening.\n\n630\n00:29:47.924 --> 00:29:52.266\nIt could be a firewall, right, again, this\nis based off a ICMP just like ping is, so\n\n631\n00:29:52.266 --> 00:29:54.850\nthey might not want you\nhaving that information.\n\n632\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.290\nSo it might give you these\nlittle asterisk symbols here.\n\n633\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.973\nHowever, what I can see is that,\nif I start getting latency, right,\n\n634\n00:30:01.973 --> 00:30:05.669\nthese milliseconds here,\nmaybe it's not going past this location.\n\n635\n00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:10.024\nIt gets to maybe this fourth hop here\nwhich, again, is still GRUCom's network,\n\n636\n00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:10.790\nand it stops.\n\n637\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.950\nI'm getting request timed out.\n\n638\n00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:17.050\nWell, since it's my local ISP, I can\ncall them and say hey, what's going on?\n\n639\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.580\nIs there a problem with\nyour network right now?\n\n640\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.550\nBecause I'm seeing I can\nmake it to your network, but\n\n641\n00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.930\nmy data can't leave your network.\n\n642\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.190\nAnd somewhere in the mix that somethings\nhappening, they'll probably tell you no,\n\n643\n00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.870\nit's not their fault.\n\n644\n00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.860\nYou need to turn your firewall of or\nsomething.\n\n645\n00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.275\nNo, just kidding, don't ever do that.\n\n646\n00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:36.160\n[LAUGH] But\nwhat is also interesting here too,\n\n647\n00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.220\nand this is what I always think is\njust the information that you, oops,\n\n648\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:45.080\nas I click all around the place there,\nis this last one, right.\n\n649\n00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.776\nThis last one's kinda cool, right.\n\n650\n00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:48.957\nThis is one of the IBPs,\nthe Internet backbone providers, right.\n\n651\n00:30:48.957 --> 00:30:53.660\nSo the top dogs, if you will,\nin the Internet hierarchy.\n\n652\n00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.940\nThere's nine of them globally and we can\nsee that this is Level3, one of them.\n\n653\n00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.690\nNow, if there's a problem right here,\n\n654\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.615\nthere's absolutely nothing\nyou can do about it.\n\n655\n00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:05.650\nCuz these guys have the best\nnetwork engineers in the world.\n\n656\n00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.250\nThey're trained to just\ndeal with stuff in seconds.\n\n657\n00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.530\nBut you can get a lot of good\ninformation here, right?\n\n658\n00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.830\nI can find out things latency.\n\n659\n00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.570\nRight, when it comes to the latency,\nfrom here to there, round trip times.\n\n660\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.440\nIf I start seeing some high\nlatencies here, I can say okay,\n\n661\n00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.560\nthat's why performance is maybe not so\ngreat.\n\n662\n00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.000\nIt goes to my local ISP, my local ISP,\nin this case GRUCom, they're doing great.\n\n663\n00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.810\nIt gets out there,\nhits another network, and\n\n664\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.248\nall of a sudden I start seeing these\nmilliseconds jacked up through the roof.\n\n665\n00:31:32.248 --> 00:31:35.427\nI know that they're having latency off of\nsomewhere out there across the Internet.\n\n666\n00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:36.796\nAnd unfortunately,\nthere's nothing I can do.\n\n667\n00:31:36.796 --> 00:31:40.990\nBut it is good to know where that\npacket's going from source to\n\n668\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.640\ndestination if png should fail you.\n\n669\n00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.540\n>> That's right, Wes has laid this out\nexactly what you wanna know, right?\n\n670\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.010\nWe have all the different hops\nthat my packets are taking\n\n671\n00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.260\nto get to their destination.\n\n672\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.720\nIf you ultimately get to trace complete,\nwell,\n\n673\n00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.070\nyou're getting to where\nyou're wanting to go.\n\n674\n00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.645\nYou might have some of those\nfailures like Wes showed you.\n\n675\n00:31:58.645 --> 00:32:02.165\nBut it just means they're probably\nnot replying to that information.\n\n676\n00:32:02.165 --> 00:32:04.210\nIt's saying stand off, usually a firewall,\n\n677\n00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.460\nmaybe it just doesn't have that feature\nturned on, and that's what's happening.\n\n678\n00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.870\nBut as long as you get to the end of it,\nyou should be good to go,\n\n679\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.500\nyou have connectivity.\n\n680\n00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.624\nBut if you're not having connectivity, you\nnever get trace complete and it stops, and\n\n681\n00:32:15.624 --> 00:32:16.292\nit stops, and\n\n682\n00:32:16.292 --> 00:32:19.989\nit stops and it never keeps going, well\nat least you know where the problem is.\n\n683\n00:32:19.989 --> 00:32:21.451\nYou go to your provider if\nthat's were it might be.\n\n684\n00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:25.398\nIf it's outside your provider's network,\nmaybe the information is in there where\n\n685\n00:32:25.398 --> 00:32:29.250\nit's stopped and you can call them and\nsay, are you having a problem with outage?\n\n686\n00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.880\nPeople dig through optic\ncables all the time.\n\n687\n00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.445\nAnd I've seen the whole state, sides, and\n\n688\n00:32:34.445 --> 00:32:39.036\nthe entire state of Florida go down\nbefore because entire providers are done.\n\n689\n00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:42.972\nSomething happened with their fiber\nbackbone and that's the end of it.\n\n690\n00:32:42.972 --> 00:32:44.704\nAnd you'll see that when\nyou start the traceroute.\n\n691\n00:32:44.704 --> 00:32:47.057\nYou're saying,\nokay well I can get to my network,\n\n692\n00:32:47.057 --> 00:32:49.440\nI can even get outside ov\nmy network a certain bit.\n\n693\n00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.040\nBut where am I stopping?\n\n694\n00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.060\nIt's with my provider, let me call them.\n\n695\n00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.460\nAre you having any issues?\n\n696\n00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.670\nThey'll verify, yep, we had a guy,\ndidn't call before he dug, and\n\n697\n00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.890\nsliced right through our fiber\nbackbone and we're having issues.\n\n698\n00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.815\nAt that point, it is,\nit's out of your hands,\n\n699\n00:33:04.815 --> 00:33:06.368\nthere's nothing you can do but wait.\n\n700\n00:33:06.368 --> 00:33:11.343\nYou got an SLA with your provider, they're\ngonna give you some sort of compensation\n\n701\n00:33:11.343 --> 00:33:16.748\nfor that, sometimes, as long it's outside\nof the realms of what they expect to see.\n\n702\n00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:18.150\nBut then there's nothing\nyou can really do,\n\n703\n00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.160\nwait until that connectivity comes back.\n\n704\n00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.815\nNow Wes, we've got a few more tools\nthat we wanna go through, but\n\n705\n00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:26.855\nthat clock is well done.\n\n706\n00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:28.515\nWe went well past it.\n\n707\n00:33:28.515 --> 00:33:30.968\nSo it looks like we're gonna have to have\na part two on network troubleshooting with\n\n708\n00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:31.608\ncommand line tools.\n\n709\n00:33:31.608 --> 00:33:32.908\n>> That sounds good,\nit looks like we killed the clock.\n\n710\n00:33:32.908 --> 00:33:33.628\n>> Yeah we sure did.\n\n711\n00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:35.137\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look forward to seeing you there.\n\n712\n00:33:35.137 --> 00:33:35.647\n>> Definitely.\n\n713\n00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:36.344\n>> Thanks for stopping by.\n\n714\n00:33:36.344 --> 00:33:37.875\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n715\n00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:39.185\nHopefully we'll see you in part two.\n\n716\n00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:41.534\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n717\n00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:42.825\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n718\n00:33:42.825 --> 00:33:43.655\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n719\n00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:44.585\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n720\n00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:53.120\n[SOUND]\n\n",
