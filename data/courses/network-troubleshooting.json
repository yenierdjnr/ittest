ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:18.990\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.600\nin today's episode we are taking\na look at network troubleshooting.\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.370\nJoining us today to help us\nout with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.890\nis none other than our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.830\nWes, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.780\nHow's it going?\n>> It's going great, and as always,\n\n9\n00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.060\nDan, it's great to be back here.\n\n10\n00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.890\nAnd that's right, we're gonna look at\na little bit of the command line and\n\n11\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.390\nsee what we got going on when it comes\nto the world of troubleshooting.\n\n12\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.318\nSo, tell you what,\nlet's go ahead and dive in.\n\n13\n00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:45.944\nAnd Dan, one of the first commands I think\nwhen I think of just understanding about\n\n14\n00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:50.680\nthe networking communications in general,\nis gonna be good old trusty ipconfig.\n\n15\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.100\nNow, we've probably seen this before in\nother episodes and if you haven't, well,\n\n16\n00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.440\nthat's good that you're here.\n\n17\n00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710\nWe gotta keep in mind that we got a lot of\ngood episodes on networking that can show\n\n18\n00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.840\nyou really in depth about ipconfig.\n\n19\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.100\nSo what is ipconfig for us?\n\n20\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.890\nWell that's the internet\nprotocol configuration utility.\n\n21\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.660\nAnd what we use it for\nprimarily is to look and\n\n22\n00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.860\nsee the parameters,\nTCP/IP parameters of our network adapter.\n\n23\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.140\nNow let's take the geek speak and all\nthe acronyms and alphabet soup out of it.\n\n24\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.110\nWhat does that mean for us?\n\n25\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.310\nWell, we have to have an IP address,\nright,\n\n26\n00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.590\nto communicate across\nthe TCP/IP based network.\n\n27\n00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.170\nSo this is one of the first\nutilities that lets us know well,\n\n28\n00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.510\nwhat are those settings, Dan?\n\n29\n00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.980\nSo I think we'll just go ahead and\ndive right in here and see what we have.\n\n30\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.320\nSo I've got a command prompt pulled up and\nI'm just gonna type ipconfig.\n\n31\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.250\nNow if I just type ipconfig by itself it's\ngonna give me some basic information.\n\n32\n00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.020\nNow you have to pay attention to\nwhich network adapter you have, and\n\n33\n00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.730\nit starts to get a little confusing\nsometimes when you couple in\n\n34\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.390\nthings like maybe wireless adapter and\na wired adapter, and then Bluetooth.\n\n35\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.990\nAnd you should see some\nIPv6 here going on,\n\n36\n00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.440\nToredo and some of those other adapters\nand technologies that are out there.\n\n37\n00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.780\nThe ones that we really are concerned\nwith, specifically in a TCP/IP v4 network,\n\n38\n00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.970\nis gonna be the one that\nyou see right here.\n\n39\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.160\nAnd if you notice, we have what?\n\n40\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.070\nWe have our Ethernet adapter Ethernet0.\n\n41\n00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.480\nRight, Ethernet0 is the name\nof the local area connection.\n\n42\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.800\nNow you might, out there, look and\nsee local area connection.\n\n43\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.260\nRight, that's pretty standard here.\n\n44\n00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.370\nNow, I'm in a virtual machine.\n\n45\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.850\nSo, kind of renames the network\nvirtualized adapters a little bit\n\n46\n00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.990\ndifferently, but that's all it is,\nit's just a name.\n\n47\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.510\nIt's gonna look maybe the local\narea connection for you.\n\n48\n00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.420\nNow Dan, one of the first things I have\nto find out is if I do have network\n\n49\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.530\nconnection problems, right?\n\n50\n00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.980\nIf I don't have communication, right?\n\n51\n00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.630\nI'm gonna probably check here, right?\n\n52\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.210\nI'm probably gonna check the IP\naddress cuz I have to have one.\n\n53\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.780\nNow Dan,\nyou mentioned something earlier, right?\n\n54\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.830\nIf we are gonna check for\n\n55\n00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.780\nnetwork communications, ipconfig might\nnot be the first place I go, right?\n\n56\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.496\n>> Yeah, usually it's really a good idea\nto actually check your cable stuff first.\n\n57\n00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:50.642\nIt happens all the time.\n\n58\n00:02:50.642 --> 00:02:54.580\nNo, that's not specifically a command line\nfunction, obviously we're in the physical\n\n59\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.115\nrealm and that's kind of a virtual thing,\ndigitized, as it were.\n\n60\n00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.825\nBut it does happen a lot, maybe you moved\nyour desk, maybe you said, you know what,\n\n61\n00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:05.357\nmy computer would look better over here or\nit'd be more functional.\n\n62\n00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:09.463\nAnd now I got a different office, awesome,\nI'm migrating over there for all my stuff,\n\n63\n00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.200\nand you forgot to plug that cable in.\n\n64\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.818\nThat is one thing that'll stop you\ndead in your tracks every time,\n\n65\n00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.540\nyou're not gonna get much connectivity\nif your cable isn't actually plugged in.\n\n66\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.690\nMight be on a wireless network,\nthat could happen, right?\n\n67\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.420\nBut if you are on a wired network,\ncheck both ends of the cable, right,\n\n68\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.050\nmake sure that they are securely seated,\nlisten for that click, and\n\n69\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.640\nthen if you're still having trouble,\n\n70\n00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.445\njust make sure that there's no\nobvious places inside that cable.\n\n71\n00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:36.070\nWhere maybe you ran it over with\na chair and now it's cut inside.\n\n72\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.710\nMaybe it didn't cut through but\nit's broken the wires, and such.\n\n73\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.400\nJust look for damage to the cable.\n\n74\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.450\nThese are simple starting\npoints that you want to check.\n\n75\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.560\nIf you realize, hey,\nmaybe I did some moving.\n\n76\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.780\nMaybe there is a physical problem.\n\n77\n00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.230\nYou might just want to go there first,\nbut other than that, ipconfig,\n\n78\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.330\nthat's definitely where we're gonna start,\nbecause we got to see whether or\n\n79\n00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.840\nnot, we're even on a network and\nipconfig and lets us do that.\n\n80\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.660\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n81\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.760\nSo while we were getting that explanation,\nI went ahead and move about five or\n\n82\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.500\nsix computers and\nforgot to plug in their network adapters.\n\n83\n00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.130\nOkay, just kidding.\n\n84\n00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.280\nBut we went ahead and set up a scenario,\nwhat would it look like if\n\n85\n00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.390\nthe media was disconnected inside\na command prompt with ipconfig?\n\n86\n00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.210\nLet's check that out here, so\nI'm gonna rerun the command.\n\n87\n00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.890\nAll right,\n\n88\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.580\nand the very first thing you notice right\nhere is media is disconnected, all right?\n\n89\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.438\nSo, first of all, I don't have an IP\naddress, so then I can tell that's\n\n90\n00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:28.579\ngotta be a problem here and I don't\neven see anything, I see no information.\n\n91\n00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:33.570\nI don't see a MAC address or anything,\nso I can also check down here.\n\n92\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.800\nMy head's kind of covering it up, but down\nhere at the bottom you got that little\n\n93\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.700\nmonitor icon, and notice,\nI gotta get my hand out of the way there.\n\n94\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.060\nNotice how there's a little red x on it,\n\n95\n00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.180\nthat lets me know that\nthe media's disconnected.\n\n96\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.050\nAnd if I go into the Network and\nSharing Center, I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n97\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.990\njust re-enable this and\nthen we'll get out of the GUI here and\n\n98\n00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.900\nget back to the command prompt.\n\n99\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.990\nAll right, now notice the difference\nhere once I rerun this command.\n\n100\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.710\nNotice when I do an ipconfig,\nwell, I get an IP address here.\n\n101\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.320\nI get a subnet mask and\nI get my default gateway, and\n\n102\n00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.440\nthese are all important things.\n\n103\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.035\nIt is a necessity to have an IP address\nand the right subnet mask communicate on\n\n104\n00:05:08.035 --> 00:05:11.585\nyour local network,\nif you want to go across your network.\n\n105\n00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:14.856\nMaybe for you home viewers out there, you\nwant to go communicate out there across\n\n106\n00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.780\nthe Internet, then the default\ngateway is gonna be important, too.\n\n107\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.110\nSome other information in here, as well,\nbut this is definitely gonna be the start.\n\n108\n00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.520\nNow, If you need to see\nadditional information, right?\n\n109\n00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.880\nMore information than just what ipconfig\ngets, well we got a switch now, right?\n\n110\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.570\nWe add the switch with a /all.\n\n111\n00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:38.000\nAll right now,\nthis is a ton of information guys, so\n\n112\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.660\nyou'll see a lot of IPV6\ntranslational technologies.\n\n113\n00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.630\nNow I see my Bluetooth adapter here.\n\n114\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.690\nBut notice that in the ethernet\nadapter area, notice that I get a lot\n\n115\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.200\nof additional information that\nwasn't there before, right?\n\n116\n00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.610\nI get information on, am I using DHCP,\nand if I follow this information over,\n\n117\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.440\nright, I can see that,\nyeah, DHCP is enabled.\n\n118\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.241\nSo if for some reason I don't have an IP\naddress, all right, well, I can probably\n\n119\n00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:10.133\nsay that it doesn't have to do with the\nfact that my computer's configured wrong.\n\n120\n00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:14.196\nI might want to check out my home router\nor something, maybe that's being blocked,\n\n121\n00:06:14.196 --> 00:06:17.420\nright, and we could even show you\nwhat that might look like, too.\n\n122\n00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.420\nIf I come in here and I do an ipconfig and\nI do a release, all right,\n\n123\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.240\nbasically what I'm telling this\nnetwork adapter is I'm saying,\n\n124\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.430\nI know the DHCP server's\ngiving an IP address.\n\n125\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.750\nI just want you to let it go, all right?\n\n126\n00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:30.580\nLet it go, man.\n\n127\n00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.390\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and\nrun an /all here.\n\n128\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.840\nAnd now you're gonna notice\na little bit different here, right?\n\n129\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.880\nNotice that DHCP is still enabled.\n\n130\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.780\nRight, nothing has changed.\n\n131\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.080\nI still have DHCP, but now I'm getting\nwhat is known as an APIPA address, right?\n\n132\n00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.980\nNow an APIPA address, understand.\n\n133\n00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.360\nAnd Dan made a good point as we were\ntaking behind the scenes here that\n\n134\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.410\nAPIPA in and\nof itself isn't a tool, right?\n\n135\n00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.570\nIt's not a utility.\n\n136\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.140\nBut it could be indicative of\na problem that you're having with\n\n137\n00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.930\nyour DHCP server, right?\n\n138\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.460\nMy computer now is calling out to the\nnetwork and it's saying, hey DHCP server,\n\n139\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.660\nare you out there?\n\n140\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.490\nI could really use an IP address, right?\n\n141\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.180\nNow, I kind of created this problem here,\nbut this would look no different, right?\n\n142\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.730\nSo it's calling out and\nthe DHCP server is snoozing.\n\n143\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.460\nWell, that's a problem.\n\n144\n00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.170\nNow what if I know that I've\nrebooted the DHCP server?\n\n145\n00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.590\nI know it's online but\nI still don't have an IP address.\n\n146\n00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.970\nWell, you seen the release, right?\n\n147\n00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.560\nSometimes you get a sticky lease where the\ncomputer just doesn't want to let it go,\n\n148\n00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.070\nor you want to force the DHCP\nprocess to start over again.\n\n149\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.180\nWell that's when we change that,\nand let me clear the screen and\n\n150\n00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.090\nget towards the top so\nyou guys can see that a little easier,\n\n151\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:38.210\nnow this is where I want to change\nthat switch to renew, right?\n\n152\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.960\nNow what's gonna happen?\n\n153\n00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.308\nWhen I change it to renew,\nit's gonna take a second.\n\n154\n00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:43.170\nNow you're gonna see something,\nan error out here,\n\n155\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.340\nBluetooth is not going to receive an IP\naddress, and you should be able to see it.\n\n156\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.180\nThis operation can't be performed in\nthe Bluetooth network connection.\n\n157\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.310\nIt's an expected error, right?\n\n158\n00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.115\nWe're not using DHCP on Bluetooth.\n\n159\n00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:59.325\nBut what I do see now is that I've got\nan IP address again, and if I get a little\n\n160\n00:07:59.325 --> 00:08:04.874\nbit more information I can say that yes,\nagain, DHCP is still enabled, right?\n\n161\n00:08:04.874 --> 00:08:08.190\nOops, there we go, DHCP is still enabled.\n\n162\n00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.850\nI do have an IP address and now I also\nhave what's known as an active lease.\n\n163\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.850\nKinda like a car rental agreement,\nright, or I'm gonna be in town for\n\n164\n00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.010\na while, I'm gonna be using this car,\nI've got the car for a week,\n\n165\n00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.360\nsame thing happens with your IP addresses.\n\n166\n00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.970\nSo Dan, ipconfig, ipconfig all,\nipconfig release and\n\n167\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:30.160\nrenew All good switches inside of\nthe IP Configuration utility, or\n\n168\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.810\nIPConfig utility that can help you start\non your network troubleshooting journey.\n\n169\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.670\n>> Yeah, it's, like I say, it's a great\nplace to begin, because you start getting\n\n170\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.580\nan idea of the network connectivity\nthat your device actually has.\n\n171\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.000\nWe saw it with Ethernet Zero.\n\n172\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.720\nWe looked at it.\n\n173\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.430\nIPConfig's giving me an IP\naddress Subnet mask.\n\n174\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.030\nAll the good stuff was there.\n\n175\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.640\nNow, sometimes, you're setup for DHCP.\n\n176\n00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.170\nYou plug in, you turn on.\n\n177\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.411\nOkay, my cables are good, but\nI still can't contact the network.\n\n178\n00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.640\nDo an ipconfig.\n\n179\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.060\nI have an IP address.\n\n180\n00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.270\nI still can't do any kind of connectivity.\n\n181\n00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.830\nThe problem is it might just be set to\nat static address, That does happen,\n\n182\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.360\nmaybe someone came in and configured,\nmaybe you did it during some testing.\n\n183\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.090\nThis happens.\n\n184\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.060\nI've had it happen to me.\n\n185\n00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:16.320\nYou just forget that I had this thing set\nfor a static address for whatever reason.\n\n186\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.380\nNow I wanted to get a DHCP address, you\ngotta go back in, you gotta change that.\n\n187\n00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.630\nNow that's not necessarily done\nthrough the command line...\n\n188\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.270\nyou can do it and\nwe might even actually talk about that.\n\n189\n00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:30.070\nBut, using IP config is gonna let you\nknow, I'm not on the correct network.\n\n190\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.480\nI've got a static IP outside of the range\nof the network that I'm on right now.\n\n191\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.510\nIt's not valid.\n\n192\n00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.980\nSo, just using IP config is\ngonna allow you to see that and\n\n193\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.100\ngo, yes, I'm set for static.\n\n194\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.100\nI'm need to change that to DHCP and\nnow I should be good to go.\n\n195\n00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.835\nSo even though it's a very simple tool.\n\n196\n00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.520\nRight?\nIt just gives you output.\n\n197\n00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.750\nYou do have a few functional keys with it.\n\n198\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.130\nIt's got some switches you can\nthrow at it and do some things.\n\n199\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.470\nBut normally, you're just using it for\ninformational, or just hey,\n\n200\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.890\nrelease that and renew me another one.\n\n201\n00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.640\nWes, is there anything else when it comes\nto IP config that we can learn about.\n\n202\n00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.870\n>> There really is, and there\nare a ton of switches, like Dan says.\n\n203\n00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.740\nThere are a couple that I wanna point out,\nbecause we're gonna talk more about this\n\n204\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.770\ntroubleshooting, troubleshooting\nthis service coming up as well.\n\n205\n00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.841\nBut DNS, DNS might be something that,\nyou know, DNS Domain Name System, keep in\n\n206\n00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.747\nmind it just takes our user friendly names\nand maps them to their IP addresses.\n\n207\n00:10:20.747 --> 00:10:23.531\nSo if we want to contact websites\nout there across the world,\n\n208\n00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:27.243\nwell Dan doesn't have to break out that\nold 50 pound book of all the IP addresses\n\n209\n00:10:27.243 --> 00:10:31.070\nthat he has written out, because you\nknow we couldn't remember them all.\n\n210\n00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.050\nRight, so DNS does name resolution for us.\n\n211\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.340\nWell, you might say,\nwell wait a second, Wes,\n\n212\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.010\nI thought you just said IP\nconfiguration utility, right?\n\n213\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.590\nWell what does that have\nto do with anything?\n\n214\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.580\nWell, DNS has a lot to do with it, right?\n\n215\n00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.230\nIf I type a name in,\nI can't visit the website by its name, but\n\n216\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.140\nI type in its IP address\ncuz I happen to know it,\n\n217\n00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.150\nthen I know there's a problem with DNS And\nthat's where ipconfig display DNS.\n\n218\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.550\nThe display DNS switch\ncan come in handy for us.\n\n219\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.780\nSo, if I need to for\ninstance view the local resolver cache,\n\n220\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.750\nlet me show you what I mean here.\n\n221\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.960\nI can do a ipconfig and\nI can do a /displaydns and\n\n222\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.340\nwhen I do this I don't expect you\nto remember all this information.\n\n223\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.320\nDan, did you catch that last one?\n\n224\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.100\n>> Every last bit.\n\n225\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.485\n>> All right, I got that.\n\n226\n00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:15.040\n[LAUGH] And this is a good thing, right?\n\n227\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.950\nSo this is the local resolver cache.\n\n228\n00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.340\nAnd what does helps you do?\n\n229\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:23.330\nIt helps speed up the response times\nbetween the time you type in that name to\n\n230\n00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.880\nactually connecting to the web page and\nit being delivered right.\n\n231\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.830\nIt's like caching area if you will.\n\n232\n00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.270\nWhy send a communication out to your\nISP's DNS server and wait for it,\n\n233\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.100\neven though is milliseconds, wait for\nit to come back if I can look locally.\n\n234\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.660\nI know where the IP address is based\non it's name because I have it\n\n235\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.080\nright here on this machine.\n\n236\n00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.610\nNow doesn't necessarily happen a lot but\nit could on your internal network\n\n237\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.680\nespecially if you're maintaining\nyour own internal DNS server and\n\n238\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.770\nthere's some changes like internally and\ninside of your infrastructure.\n\n239\n00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:53.340\nMaybe you've got a intranet site\nthat your company, you go to and\n\n240\n00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.370\nyou visit employee documents and\nstuff like that.\n\n241\n00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.310\nAnd for whatever reason,\nit doesn't happen a lot,\n\n242\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.969\nbut for whatever reason maybe\nthe IP address changes.\n\n243\n00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.860\nWell if you haven't turned your computer\noff that IP address could be in one of\n\n244\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.720\nthese records, right?\n\n245\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.590\nAnd it could be mapping you to your\ninternal company website to an IP\n\n246\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.580\naddress that no longer exists,\nor isn't relevant right now.\n\n247\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.900\nMaybe it changed.\n\n248\n00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:18.274\nThe problem is because this caching system\nis the first place you're gonna look\n\n249\n00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:24.464\nI'm never gonna send a request, hey DNS\nserver, where is www.employeehandbook.com.\n\n250\n00:12:24.464 --> 00:12:26.180\nLet's say that's our intranet site.\n\n251\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.440\nWhy?\nBecause I've already got my\n\n252\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.460\nanswer locally.\n\n253\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.280\nRight or wrong, I've got my answer locally\nand that's what I'm sticking with.\n\n254\n00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.230\nSo that's where the next one comes in.\n\n255\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.760\nI might wanna do something like this.\n\n256\n00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.420\nI might wanna do,\n\n257\n00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.960\ninstead of a display DNS they call\nthat caching a stale record, right?\n\n258\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.460\nIt's stale because it It no longer\nmaps to a valid IP address.\n\n259\n00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.310\nSo instead what I could do is a flushdns.\n\n260\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.926\nAll right now this works as well.\n\n261\n00:12:48.926 --> 00:12:49.437\nBut you know,\n\n262\n00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:53.050\nwe're in the command prompt you can\nalso do this in PowerShell as well.\n\n263\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.604\nSo you pay attention to some of\nthe PowerShell episodes we got out there.\n\n264\n00:12:56.604 --> 00:13:04.230\nCuz likewise you can do a get-DNS client\ncache or a clear-DNS client cache.\n\n265\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.730\nBut we'll stick with\nthe command prompt here and\n\n266\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.490\nwe'll do the flush DNS,\nipconfig /flushdns.\n\n267\n00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.740\nNow Dan, did you catch that one?\n\n268\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.760\nThat one wasn't too bad, right?\n\n269\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.150\nWe didn't have a whole bunch\nof records going through.\n\n270\n00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.650\n>> A big flyby.\n\n271\n00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.410\n>> That's right.\n\n272\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.340\nSo let's go ahead and\ndisplay our DNS cache again.\n\n273\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.940\nAnd notice it says,\ncould not display the DNS Resolver Cache.\n\n274\n00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.500\nSo, if I do feel like that name resolution\n\n275\n00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.490\nis an issue because of a stale record,\nright, well, I can flush that.\n\n276\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.170\nYou say,\nwell how did you get to that point?\n\n277\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.110\nWell, let me show you, all right?\n\n278\n00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.820\nIf I go back to my ipconfig /all,\n\n279\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.910\nnotice that I am using\na couple of DNS servers here.\n\n280\n00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.680\nNow, Dan, I'm sure you could pick up\non what these servers are, right?\n\n281\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.580\n>> If they are the 8.8.8s, then, yes,\nthey are, I believe, Google's DNS servers?\n\n282\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.080\n>> That's right.\n\n283\n00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.030\nYes, sir.\nVery good.\n\n284\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.880\nVery good.\nAnd for the most part,\n\n285\n00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.740\nguys, I really have never had\nthese not return a response on me.\n\n286\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.590\nAnd I'm sure they're using some kind of\nload balancing in the background that\n\n287\n00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.300\nwe're not aware of.\n\n288\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.030\nBut they usually give responses,\nso I know, all right,\n\n289\n00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.630\nthat I've got at least a DNS\nserver set up, all right.\n\n290\n00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.960\nSo I could say that maybe that\nthe DNS problem that I was having\n\n291\n00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.750\nwas directly related right\nthere to these records.\n\n292\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.340\nNow you say, well wait a sec, are you\nbrowsing to anything in the background?\n\n293\n00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.220\nWell Yes I am.\n\n294\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.160\nAlright, you guys could probably\nsee that I got my Chrome browser\n\n295\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.000\nopened in the background.\n\n296\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.320\nWell it's doing a keep alive,\nright, with Google server.\n\n297\n00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.050\nSo it's still resolving names because\nI've got that active connection.\n\n298\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.980\nSo it's constantly generating\nthose records and again real fast.\n\n299\n00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.980\nIf I wanna clear them, there you go.\n\n300\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.120\nIt's, they're all gone It's gonna\nmake me close that down, isn't it?\n\n301\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.020\nThere we go.\nAnd let me clear the screen up\n\n302\n00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.830\nhere one more time and\nwe'll display the DNS.\n\n303\n00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.270\nSo very easy way that if you do think\nrelated to IP config that you're having\n\n304\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.650\nsome kind of DNS name resolution issue,\njust go ahead and flush the cache.\n\n305\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.380\n>> That's right.\n\n306\n00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.679\nNow the one two punch as we like\nto call it here Is usually,\n\n307\n00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:06.975\nyou start with IP config and you say,\nokay I see that I'm on a network.\n\n308\n00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:09.110\nNow it's time to start\ntesting connectivity.\n\n309\n00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.557\nDo I have connectivity\nwith a certain device?\n\n310\n00:15:11.557 --> 00:15:15.120\nThis is a very common troubleshooting\ntechnique that we use.\n\n311\n00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.390\nAnd the utility that we\nuse in that one-two punch\n\n312\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.230\nis gonna be your good old friend ping,\nright?\n\n313\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.320\n>> That's right.\n\n314\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.490\n>> And I know everybody, I learned\nit as the Packet Internet Groper.\n\n315\n00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.110\nFrom what I actually understand,\nthat's actually kinda anachronistic.\n\n316\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.018\nIt came later to be called Packet Internet\nThe original developer just meant it as\n\n317\n00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:34.380\nping, like sonar.\n\n318\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.880\nI'm sending out a noise and I'm waiting to\nhear back from it to measure whether or\n\n319\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.210\nnot was something there,\nand that's the idea, right?\n\n320\n00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.170\n>> Nothing like retro\nnaming to confuse you.\n\n321\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.030\nThat's exactly it.\n\n322\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.620\nWe've got to use ping.\n\n323\n00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.670\nAll right,\nnow ping It sends out little signals.\n\n324\n00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.010\nThese little signals that go to whatever\ndevice it is that you're testing them and\n\n325\n00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.550\nthey say, hey, are you there?\n\n326\n00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.282\nAnd we should get some replies back.\n\n327\n00:15:56.282 --> 00:16:00.018\nNow if we get replies back then we know\nfrom the standpoint of this device\n\n328\n00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:04.084\nhere and whatever device I sent that\ninformation to That we can communicate.\n\n329\n00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:08.436\nBut there is a process to do this.\n\n330\n00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.759\nLet me give you the real world scenario.\n\n331\n00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:13.750\nIf I'm testing internet connectivity, I'm\ngoing to test against the Internet, right?\n\n332\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.000\nBut there is a right way to use ping.\n\n333\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.848\nYou start as local to your computer as you\ncan, and then you slowly work your way to\n\n334\n00:16:19.848 --> 00:16:23.430\nyour perimeter of your network, and\nthen, finally, past your network.\n\n335\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.900\nAnd that is a good way.\n\n336\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.550\nLike I said, for those of you that are\nwatching that have used ping before, and\n\n337\n00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.270\nI'm sure we've got some of you out there,\nsay, well, why don't you just ping\n\n338\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.890\nthe Internet, or something out there\non the Internet, and find out?\n\n339\n00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.940\nYeah, well, that's good.\n\n340\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.760\nBut if you had a multi-routed\nenvironment internally on your network,\n\n341\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.790\nthat's not always the case.\n\n342\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.810\nFirst place that we're gonna go,\nwe say there's no place like home, right?\n\n343\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.890\nSo first thing I'm gonna do is,\n\n344\n00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.890\nI wanna test my operating system's ability\nto speak the language of the network.\n\n345\n00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.952\nIn this case, the protocol being TCP/IP.\n\n346\n00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:54.766\nSo the first thing I'm doing is I'm\npinging the loopback address, and\n\n347\n00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:58.068\nby default we usually say 127.0.0.1.\n\n348\n00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:01.840\nNow this doesn't send any electrical\ncommunications out of the network adapter.\n\n349\n00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.810\nAll this does is says, internally,\n\n350\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.645\ndoes my operating system understand\nthe DNA that we're using, or\n\n351\n00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:11.325\nthe communication protocols that\nwe're using for this network.\n\n352\n00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:13.455\nAnd at this point I'm\ngetting a reply back.\n\n353\n00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:20.800\nI can see that the operating system\nknows what's going on with the TCP/IP.\n\n354\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.074\nNow what if I want to find out does\nmy network adapter have the ability\n\n355\n00:17:24.074 --> 00:17:26.033\nto respond to itself when its called on?\n\n356\n00:17:26.033 --> 00:17:29.200\nDan says we have our piece of information,\nhowever it might be.\n\n357\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.314\nA share or something like that.\n\n358\n00:17:30.314 --> 00:17:35.540\nWell, Dan, I didn't know that my network\nadapter can respond to that request.\n\n359\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.507\nSo here's what we do.\n\n360\n00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:39.198\nNext thing that we're gonna\ndo is we're going to ping.\n\n361\n00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:40.440\nOops.\n\n362\n00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.740\nI'm gonna spell that right.\n\n363\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.420\nWe're going to ping our own IP address.\n\n364\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.520\nNow, you know what's kind of funny?\n\n365\n00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.170\nI think I've forgotten my IP address\nafter all this looking at it.\n\n366\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.810\nSo that's why we got ipconfig, and\nthat's why Dan said a one-two punch.\n\n367\n00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.094\nFirst of all, I've got to find some\nIP addresses that are valid and\n\n368\n00:17:53.094 --> 00:17:54.745\nrelevant to me personally here.\n\n369\n00:17:54.745 --> 00:18:04.067\nI can see my IP address there is\n10.1.230.54, and if I do a ping.\n\n370\n00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:04.729\nWhat was it?\n\n371\n00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:11.940\n10.1.230.54, I see that\nit returns a response.\n\n372\n00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.200\nAnd if I want to, I'm gonna make\nthat persistent here, as we go.\n\n373\n00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.860\nIf you're in the other operating\nsystems it's persistent by default.\n\n374\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.010\nWindows it isn't.\n\n375\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.372\nBut, what I'm doing here is my\nnetwork adapter is being called upon.\n\n376\n00:18:23.372 --> 00:18:26.204\nNow it's being called upon by the\noperating system, and it proves to me that\n\n377\n00:18:26.204 --> 00:18:29.820\nmy network adapter, when it's called on,\nit can say, yeah, I'm over here.\n\n378\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.750\nYou can talk to me.\n\n379\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.950\nSo that we can see that we are getting\nresponses from the network adapter.\n\n380\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.300\nHowever, we do have to go\na little bit farther than that.\n\n381\n00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.870\nFrom the standpoint of this computer,\n\n382\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.260\nI know that this computer can\ncommunicate with the network.\n\n383\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.100\nNow that doesn't mean that this\ncomputer can communicate with any other\n\n384\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.610\ndevice on the network,\nwhich is our next step, right?\n\n385\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:51.270\nNow we're as close as we can,\nthe operating system, the network adapter\n\n386\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.753\nthat is attached to the operating system,\nor the other way around if you will, and\n\n387\n00:18:54.753 --> 00:18:56.670\nthen, finally,\nanother computer on my network.\n\n388\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.180\nWell, there's a couple of\nthat things you can do.\n\n389\n00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.242\nIf you end up having like, maybe\na separate DNS server on the internal\n\n390\n00:19:02.242 --> 00:19:06.950\nnetwork, just do an IP config, or find\nthat DHCP, or DNS server, and ping it.\n\n391\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.069\nA lot of times I will tell you\nthat our default gateways for\n\n392\n00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:10.005\ndoing all of that for us.\n\n393\n00:19:10.005 --> 00:19:12.000\nSo that might not be an accurate test.\n\n394\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.790\nSo what I've got is another machine,\nout here on the network.\n\n395\n00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.250\nWell, first you have to\nuse an IP address and\n\n396\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.330\nyou have to use the-\n>> Valid notation?\n\n397\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.611\n>> Make sure you use ping, right?\n\n398\n00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:25.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what we're talking about here.\n\n399\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.526\n>> It just knows inherently,\nyou wanna use ping.\n\n400\n00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:28.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n401\n00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.170\nThat's right, and you know I might not,\none of the things, let me see here.\n\n402\n00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.000\nIt might have gone to sleep here.\n\n403\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.358\nMake sure I got that right.\n\n404\n00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:35.196\nAnd you know what?\n\n405\n00:19:35.196 --> 00:19:36.497\nIt doesn't look like it's pinging.\n\n406\n00:19:36.497 --> 00:19:38.563\nSo the good thing about this is,\n\n407\n00:19:38.563 --> 00:19:42.860\nI've communicated with other\ncomputers on this network.\n\n408\n00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.045\nSo this is one that we weren't\nreally going to talk about here, but\n\n409\n00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:50.282\nI'm going to go ahead and\nthrow it in here anyways.\n\n410\n00:19:50.282 --> 00:19:54.415\nARP is the Address Resolution Protocol,\nand if my computer has talked to other\n\n411\n00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:58.930\ncomputers within the network, it should\nhave cached their MAC addresses and IPs.\n\n412\n00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.150\nSo I want to see if I've got another\ncomputer in here that maybe this one,\n\n413\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.040\nlooks like we've got a few here.\n\n414\n00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.980\nAll right, so I'm gonna try one of these\nother computers that are on the network.\n\n415\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.350\nApparently at one point,\nI was communicating with them.\n\n416\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.200\nSo I can use this database as a way,\nreally,\n\n417\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.630\nto find an IP address of\nanother computer on my network.\n\n418\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.630\nSo a kinda little cool thing,\n\n419\n00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.820\neven though we weren't really talking\nabout ARP there, that we can throw in.\n\n420\n00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.521\n>> The only caveat to this is\nthese are computers that Wes\n\n421\n00:20:21.521 --> 00:20:23.390\nalready knows that they're alive.\n\n422\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.850\nHe's already made a connection to and\nis talking to.\n\n423\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.450\nIf you're trying to trouble shoot\na computer that you don't have that\n\n424\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.440\nknowledge, the computer has never\nspoken to it, well, at least since it's\n\n425\n00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.760\nbeen up and running, then you're not going\nto be able to use ARP to make this happen.\n\n426\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.103\nSo you might just have to\ngo the old sneakernet way.\n\n427\n00:20:39.103 --> 00:20:39.820\n>> That's right.\n\n428\n00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.161\n>> Run over there, check that computer,\nfind out what its IP address is,\n\n429\n00:20:42.161 --> 00:20:43.694\nuse good old ipconfig,\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n430\n00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:45.590\n>> and then do that.\n\n431\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.880\nIf you have a user on the phone,\nif that's the scenario, you can just say,\n\n432\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.160\nhey, do me a favor.\n\n433\n00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.710\nShow them how to open a command prompt.\n\n434\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.270\nType in ipconfig.\n\n435\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.210\nTell me what your IPv4 address is for\nyour computer.\n\n436\n00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.390\nAnd now you'll be able to do that.\n\n437\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.640\nOtherwise, we can do this.\n\n438\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.880\nThis is for demonstration purposes.\n\n439\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.860\n>> Yeah, definitely, and\nthank you for that, for sure.\n\n440\n00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.860\nSo now we've got one of the IP addresses,\nand\n\n441\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.780\nI just picked one out of the list here,\nand we'll see if it is good and going.\n\n442\n00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.497\nSo, we can see that we can ping it.\n\n443\n00:21:09.497 --> 00:21:10.437\nIt is there.\n\n444\n00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:13.417\nLike Dan said, I've got another computer\nover here that it is connected to\n\n445\n00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:16.160\nthe network, and I might just be\ndoing exactly that, sneakernet.\n\n446\n00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.700\nI'll go over here, do my ipconfig on this\ncomputer that's off to the side you guys\n\n447\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.139\ncan't see right here, find out its IP\naddress, and try to send a ping to it.\n\n448\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.820\nNow let me tell you something\na little bit about the ping.\n\n449\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.530\nWe're gonna stop right here,\njust for a second,\n\n450\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.830\nbecause ICMP can be a security risk,\nall right?\n\n451\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.141\nSo we've got to understand that.\n\n452\n00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:36.820\nLet's take right here for ITProTV.\n\n453\n00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.920\nThere might be something set up,\nmaybe Don or one of other hosts here,\n\n454\n00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.820\nhe might have something set up that he\ndoesn't want anybody just pinging and\n\n455\n00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.290\nsending all kinds of data to.\n\n456\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.170\nSo for security purposes,\nthey might block that.\n\n457\n00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.050\nSo ping isn't a one-stop-shop.\n\n458\n00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.750\nIf you ping one address and it doesn't\nreturn replies, try to ping another one,\n\n459\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.450\njust to make sure that\nIMCP isn't being blocked.\n\n460\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.830\nNow, what have we done, Dan?\n\n461\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.530\nSo far,\nwe've got our operating system is good.\n\n462\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Our network adapter is communicating,\n\n463\n00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.180\nit's responding.\n\n464\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.820\nNow we've got another\ncomputer that's responding.\n\n465\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.770\nSo at this point, internally,\nlocally in my network,\n\n466\n00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.410\nI know from the standpoint of\nthis computer I can communicate.\n\n467\n00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.260\nBut let's go a step farther.\n\n468\n00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.290\nWe're going to the edge of the network.\n\n469\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.740\nAs far to the edge of the network\nas we can get is the gateway.\n\n470\n00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.360\nThey call it the gateway for\na reason, right?\n\n471\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.380\nSo the last thing that we're gonna do,\n\n472\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.008\nwell, second to last thing that\n>> Second to last.\n\n473\n00:22:25.008 --> 00:22:26.840\n>> we're gonna do.\nThat's right, can't forget the last one.\n\n474\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.890\nThe second to last thing that we're\ngonna do is we're gonna ping our\n\n475\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.820\ndefault gateway.\n\n476\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.270\nNow, you might be asking yourself,\n\n477\n00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.770\nwell, what if I don't know the IP\naddress of my default gateway?\n\n478\n00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.515\nYes, you do.\nLet's go back and show you.\n\n479\n00:22:36.515 --> 00:22:38.860\nYou remember,\nwe've been using the ipconfig?\n\n480\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.130\nKinda see that one-two\nthat he's talking about,\n\n481\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.690\nwhy it keeps coming up back and forth?\n\n482\n00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.380\nWe use them a lot, they go hand-in-hand.\n\n483\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.590\nAnd notice that I got my\ndefault gateway here.\n\n484\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.420\nAll I have to do, and let me put this\nup to the top so you guys can see that.\n\n485\n00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.099\nWe'll do a ping.\n\n486\n00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:58.480\nWe'll do a 10.1.230.1, all right, and\nthen I'm just making these persistent.\n\n487\n00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.060\nGuys, you don't have\nto use the switch tee.\n\n488\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.400\nI'm just used to some of\nthe other operating systems.\n\n489\n00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.870\nYou know, ping doesn't shut\noff until you tell it too.\n\n490\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.460\n>> You know you bring\nup a really good point.\n\n491\n00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.860\nIt is a good practice to\nstart using the persistence.\n\n492\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:15.150\nI do it all the time because maybe I'm\ngetting intermittent connectivity,\n\n493\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.240\nand I can see you when\nthe pings dropped out.\n\n494\n00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.330\nMaybe there's a pattern to it?\n\n495\n00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.850\nMaybe I see it goes from five minutes,\nand then it drops.\n\n496\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.320\nI lose all my pings.\n\n497\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.940\nThey go away.\n\n498\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.300\nI start getting request denied,\nor unavailable, or whatever.\n\n499\n00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.740\nI can't get to it.\n\n500\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.890\nNow they're back up, five minutes later,\nI'm starting to see a pattern.\n\n501\n00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:31.640\nI can say, well,\n\n502\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.140\nthere's something going on in this\nnetwork between these two devices.\n\n503\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.580\nSometimes it's a flapping\nport on a switch.\n\n504\n00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.500\nThat can definitely cause things\nof intermittent connectivity.\n\n505\n00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.210\nThat is a great way, and using just\nping will help you figure that out.\n\n506\n00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.370\nMaybe I'm installing a new\npiece of network gear?\n\n507\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.340\nI've bought a new switch to replace\nthe one that's got flapping ports.\n\n508\n00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.834\nI'm like, okay, throw that in there.\n\n509\n00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:56.895\nI can do a persistent ping, put in my new\nswitch, run all the configuration, and\n\n510\n00:23:56.895 --> 00:24:00.386\nwhen those pings come back alive,\nI know that that switch is active.\n\n511\n00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:02.935\nEverything is now working,\nand using ping to do that.\n\n512\n00:24:02.935 --> 00:24:07.382\nVery simple tool, but I know guys that are\nlike CCIE level and that's what they use\n\n513\n00:24:07.382 --> 00:24:11.520\nto check connectivity with because\nit's a simple tool, it's easy to use.\n\n514\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.220\n>> It really is, now I wouldn't recommend\ndoing this from a remote location.\n\n515\n00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.790\nAnd Dan's got plenty of stories of\nwhy you don't reboot servers from\n\n516\n00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.270\na remote location.\n\n517\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.590\nNow if I'm on location, right, and we're\ngonna walk right over to, for instance,\n\n518\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.811\nour server closet here at ITProTV, right.\n\n519\n00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:30.420\nI will use a ping to do\na reboot on a server, right.\n\n520\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.320\nI'll issue the ping, and\nthen I'll make sure it's active.\n\n521\n00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.090\nI'll reboot the server and I don't really\nhave any way of telling very early on if\n\n522\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.930\nthat server has been rebooted.\n\n523\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.710\nAnd just like Dan says,\nit goes intermittent,\n\n524\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.590\nand then when it starts receiving replies\nback I could fire up Remote Desktop,\n\n525\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.000\nI'm back into the server\nbefore you know it.\n\n526\n00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.666\nBut, I would never recommend\ndoing that on a remote location,\n\n527\n00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:54.964\nbecause if the server doesn't come\nback online, you're in for a drive.\n\n528\n00:24:54.964 --> 00:24:57.667\nAll right so,\nvery easy utility to use here Dan, and\n\n529\n00:24:57.667 --> 00:25:00.860\nI'm just doing a Ctrl+C guys by the way,\nthat'll stop it.\n\n530\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.161\nPing, very, very good utility.\n\n531\n00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:06.176\nNow, we ping the default gateway,\nwe see that up until this point,\n\n532\n00:25:06.176 --> 00:25:09.560\nat the edge of our router,\nwe can communicate.\n\n533\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.250\nBut now we've gotta go\na little bit farther and\n\n534\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.668\nyou might hear some people say,\nping a remote network.\n\n535\n00:25:13.668 --> 00:25:15.054\nWell, in TCP/IP speak,\n\n536\n00:25:15.054 --> 00:25:18.778\nthat just means any other network\nto the one that your computer's on.\n\n537\n00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:21.409\nIt just so happens that if you're in\na home environment and watching this,\n\n538\n00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:22.730\na lot of times it's the Internet.\n\n539\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.180\nSo one of the last ones that I do is ping\na location out there on the Internet.\n\n540\n00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.090\nAnd there is plenty of them, in fact\nwe've already mentioned one of them\n\n541\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.230\nthat I use to see if I could replies back.\n\n542\n00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.170\nAnd that's Google's DNS servers out there,\nright?\n\n543\n00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.600\nThey're pretty good, I mean DNS,\nyou want it to be online or\n\n544\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.857\nthe backbone of the Internet goes down,\nso they want those servers to be online.\n\n545\n00:25:39.857 --> 00:25:40.706\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n546\n00:25:40.706 --> 00:25:45.690\nAll right so we'll do a ping, 8.8.8.8.\n\n547\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.630\nAnd when we run that, oops,\nwe'll run it right off the screen and\n\n548\n00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.870\nout the front door and out of the office.\n\n549\n00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.360\nSo we can see that we've\ngot some replies back now.\n\n550\n00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.418\nAnd from the standpoint of this computer,\n\n551\n00:25:56.418 --> 00:26:01.590\nit knows TCP/IP, my adapter's fine,\nI can communicate with other devices.\n\n552\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.560\nMy gateway, I can get to the gateway, and\n\n553\n00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.760\nnow I can even route\ntraffic off of the gateway.\n\n554\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.840\n>> That's right.\n\n555\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.060\nNow it comes to the part, well,\nwe've gotten ping, right?\n\n556\n00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.040\nIt's underneath our pelt, it's in our\ntoolkit, we can use it effectively, and\n\n557\n00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.460\nI want to ping something.\n\n558\n00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.390\nI'm trying to test connectivity\nwith something that's outside of\n\n559\n00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.440\nmy network like we did with\nthose Google DNS servers.\n\n560\n00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.800\nWhat happens if I ping them and\nthey don't reply?\n\n561\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.042\nIt could be one of two things.\n\n562\n00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.560\nAnd well, first thing is they\nshould be blocking ping, right?\n\n563\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.370\nThat could be the thing of it.\n\n564\n00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.330\nAnd if it is, well, let's try something\nelse that's not blocking ping.\n\n565\n00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.470\nContinue to work through things that are\noutside of your network until you find one\n\n566\n00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.420\nthat replies.\n\n567\n00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.010\nThat way you know,\n\n568\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.850\nmaybe you know something specific\nthat's out there that allows for ping.\n\n569\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.960\nYou can use that, write that down,\nkeep that in your little toolkit.\n\n570\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.420\nIf I need to test outside\nconnectivity with ping,\n\n571\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.920\nI can always go to this because\nit's not blocking ping.\n\n572\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.500\nBut what if I'm still not getting it and\nI know it's not blocking.\n\n573\n00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.930\nThat leads us to our next tool right?\n\n574\n00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.490\n>> That's right, and\nthat's called tracert.\n\n575\n00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.340\nNow those of you that maybe have seen\nthis in other operating systems,\n\n576\n00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.030\nthey spell it out.\n\n577\n00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.199\nSometimes even in the Windows\nworld we'll say traceroute,\n\n578\n00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:02.442\ntechnically it's not accurate.\n\n579\n00:27:02.442 --> 00:27:05.700\nIt's tracert,\ntraceroute is in the nix-based systems.\n\n580\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.200\nHowever, as far as functionality goes\nthey're very, very close to what they do.\n\n581\n00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.600\nTracert here in Windows and\ntraceroute out there in the nix system,\n\n582\n00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.080\ntraces the path a packet takes\nfrom source to destination.\n\n583\n00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.570\nSo we typically have more than one\nhop across remote networks and\n\n584\n00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.200\nespecially in packet switch networks,\nwe usually have more than one hop.\n\n585\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.818\nWell I need to know where\nthe communication breakdown is happening.\n\n586\n00:27:28.818 --> 00:27:32.247\nSo imagine a utility that lets me roadmap,\nright,\n\n587\n00:27:32.247 --> 00:27:37.130\nlike a footprint, like cookie crumbs,\nright, footprint on the sand.\n\n588\n00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.186\nAnd I can see which path it's\ntaken when leaves my computer and\n\n589\n00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:42.980\ngoes to that destination.\n\n590\n00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.020\nI wanna track each hop,\nright, the hop is the act or\n\n591\n00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.970\ntechnique of forwarding\ntraffic between two routers.\n\n592\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.240\nLet's see what that does for us, right?\n\n593\n00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.040\nSo if I do a tracert, and I tell you what,\n\n594\n00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.730\nfirst of all,\nyou can do this a couple of ways.\n\n595\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.020\nKeep in mind that if you use a name,\n\n596\n00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.050\nyou better hope you tested your name\nresolution to use that first, right?\n\n597\n00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.822\nBecause it's still gonna be use\na name resolution on the background.\n\n598\n00:28:04.822 --> 00:28:09.056\nIf I do www.google.com,\nright, so that's a name.\n\n599\n00:28:09.056 --> 00:28:10.512\nAnd if I run the tracert on it,\n\n600\n00:28:10.512 --> 00:28:13.089\nyou can see that it's resolved\nthe name here at top.\n\n601\n00:28:13.089 --> 00:28:17.812\nNotice that it gives me an IP address and\nit says tracing route to www.google.com.\n\n602\n00:28:17.812 --> 00:28:21.055\nAnd then it gives me Google's IP address.\n\n603\n00:28:21.055 --> 00:28:25.980\nAnd you see some of this information\ncoming out, we'll see here in a second.\n\n604\n00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:32.130\nIf you do a tracert that way,\nit's contingent on having name resolution.\n\n605\n00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:39.940\nSo if this fails, don't just automatically\nassume that the route itself has failed.\n\n606\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.390\nIt might be name resolution and\nDNS is snoozing, or whatever is going on.\n\n607\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.010\nYou might have to do some of those\nDNS troubleshooting that we were\n\n608\n00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.980\ntalking about.\n\n609\n00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.040\nAnd let me show you what I mean,\nso I'll tell you what,\n\n610\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.780\nI'll give that demonstration in a second.\n\n611\n00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.930\nLet’s see what we're looking at here, Dan.\n\n612\n00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:58.104\nAll right, now I've got a series of hops,\nright, it says 9 hops.\n\n613\n00:28:58.104 --> 00:29:01.050\nIt'll trace it over maximum of 30 hops,\nyou'll see.\n\n614\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:04.340\nThat means that's the maximum\ninformation it's gonna give back.\n\n615\n00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.830\nAll right, now I can see the first hop.\n\n616\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.420\nYou say, well how is this\ninformation useful to you?\n\n617\n00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.270\nWell here in Gainesville, this is\nactually really useful information.\n\n618\n00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.100\nAnd Dan, as you know,\nour major provider here locally,\n\n619\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.030\nour local ISP is gonna be\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n620\n00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.030\nRight, well call them GRUCom here,\nit's just shortened for\n\n621\n00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:24.750\nGainesville Regional Utilities.\n\n622\n00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.412\nWell I can see that I'm on\ntheir networks right here.\n\n623\n00:29:28.412 --> 00:29:30.882\nIn fact, you can see I go all\nthe way out to their networks.\n\n624\n00:29:30.882 --> 00:29:33.994\nI wanna say this is somewhere\nin the Midwest I believe,\n\n625\n00:29:33.994 --> 00:29:36.170\nbut anyways it's on their local ISP.\n\n626\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.200\nSo if I start to see things like timeouts,\n\n627\n00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.420\nright, you might not see any information,\nright?\n\n628\n00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.110\nIf I start seeing this request timed out,\nrequest timed out and\n\n629\n00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.924\nit's on this local network,\ncouple things could be happening.\n\n630\n00:29:47.924 --> 00:29:52.266\nIt could be a firewall, right, again, this\nis based off a ICMP just like ping is, so\n\n631\n00:29:52.266 --> 00:29:54.850\nthey might not want you\nhaving that information.\n\n632\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.290\nSo it might give you these\nlittle asterisk symbols here.\n\n633\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.973\nHowever, what I can see is that,\nif I start getting latency, right,\n\n634\n00:30:01.973 --> 00:30:05.669\nthese milliseconds here,\nmaybe it's not going past this location.\n\n635\n00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:10.024\nIt gets to maybe this fourth hop here\nwhich, again, is still GRUCom's network,\n\n636\n00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:10.790\nand it stops.\n\n637\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.950\nI'm getting request timed out.\n\n638\n00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:17.050\nWell, since it's my local ISP, I can\ncall them and say hey, what's going on?\n\n639\n00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.580\nIs there a problem with\nyour network right now?\n\n640\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.550\nBecause I'm seeing I can\nmake it to your network, but\n\n641\n00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.930\nmy data can't leave your network.\n\n642\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:27.190\nAnd somewhere in the mix that somethings\nhappening, they'll probably tell you no,\n\n643\n00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.870\nit's not their fault.\n\n644\n00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.860\nYou need to turn your firewall of or\nsomething.\n\n645\n00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.275\nNo, just kidding, don't ever do that.\n\n646\n00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:36.160\n[LAUGH] But\nwhat is also interesting here too,\n\n647\n00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.220\nand this is what I always think is\njust the information that you, oops,\n\n648\n00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:45.080\nas I click all around the place there,\nis this last one, right.\n\n649\n00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.776\nThis last one's kinda cool, right.\n\n650\n00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:48.957\nThis is one of the IBPs,\nthe Internet backbone providers, right.\n\n651\n00:30:48.957 --> 00:30:53.660\nSo the top dogs, if you will,\nin the Internet hierarchy.\n\n652\n00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.940\nThere's nine of them globally and we can\nsee that this is Level3, one of them.\n\n653\n00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.690\nNow, if there's a problem right here,\n\n654\n00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.615\nthere's absolutely nothing\nyou can do about it.\n\n655\n00:31:02.615 --> 00:31:05.650\nCuz these guys have the best\nnetwork engineers in the world.\n\n656\n00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.250\nThey're trained to just\ndeal with stuff in seconds.\n\n657\n00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.530\nBut you can get a lot of good\ninformation here, right?\n\n658\n00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.830\nI can find out things latency.\n\n659\n00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:16.570\nRight, when it comes to the latency,\nfrom here to there, round trip times.\n\n660\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.440\nIf I start seeing some high\nlatencies here, I can say okay,\n\n661\n00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.560\nthat's why performance is maybe not so\ngreat.\n\n662\n00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.000\nIt goes to my local ISP, my local ISP,\nin this case GRUCom, they're doing great.\n\n663\n00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.810\nIt gets out there,\nhits another network, and\n\n664\n00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.248\nall of a sudden I start seeing these\nmilliseconds jacked up through the roof.\n\n665\n00:31:32.248 --> 00:31:35.427\nI know that they're having latency off of\nsomewhere out there across the Internet.\n\n666\n00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:36.796\nAnd unfortunately,\nthere's nothing I can do.\n\n667\n00:31:36.796 --> 00:31:40.990\nBut it is good to know where that\npacket's going from source to\n\n668\n00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.640\ndestination if png should fail you.\n\n669\n00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.540\n>> That's right, Wes has laid this out\nexactly what you wanna know, right?\n\n670\n00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.010\nWe have all the different hops\nthat my packets are taking\n\n671\n00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.260\nto get to their destination.\n\n672\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.720\nIf you ultimately get to trace complete,\nwell,\n\n673\n00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.070\nyou're getting to where\nyou're wanting to go.\n\n674\n00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.645\nYou might have some of those\nfailures like Wes showed you.\n\n675\n00:31:58.645 --> 00:32:02.165\nBut it just means they're probably\nnot replying to that information.\n\n676\n00:32:02.165 --> 00:32:04.210\nIt's saying stand off, usually a firewall,\n\n677\n00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.460\nmaybe it just doesn't have that feature\nturned on, and that's what's happening.\n\n678\n00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.870\nBut as long as you get to the end of it,\nyou should be good to go,\n\n679\n00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.500\nyou have connectivity.\n\n680\n00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.624\nBut if you're not having connectivity, you\nnever get trace complete and it stops, and\n\n681\n00:32:15.624 --> 00:32:16.292\nit stops, and\n\n682\n00:32:16.292 --> 00:32:19.989\nit stops and it never keeps going, well\nat least you know where the problem is.\n\n683\n00:32:19.989 --> 00:32:21.451\nYou go to your provider if\nthat's were it might be.\n\n684\n00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:25.398\nIf it's outside your provider's network,\nmaybe the information is in there where\n\n685\n00:32:25.398 --> 00:32:29.250\nit's stopped and you can call them and\nsay, are you having a problem with outage?\n\n686\n00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.880\nPeople dig through optic\ncables all the time.\n\n687\n00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.445\nAnd I've seen the whole state, sides, and\n\n688\n00:32:34.445 --> 00:32:39.036\nthe entire state of Florida go down\nbefore because entire providers are done.\n\n689\n00:32:39.036 --> 00:32:42.972\nSomething happened with their fiber\nbackbone and that's the end of it.\n\n690\n00:32:42.972 --> 00:32:44.704\nAnd you'll see that when\nyou start the traceroute.\n\n691\n00:32:44.704 --> 00:32:47.057\nYou're saying,\nokay well I can get to my network,\n\n692\n00:32:47.057 --> 00:32:49.440\nI can even get outside ov\nmy network a certain bit.\n\n693\n00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.040\nBut where am I stopping?\n\n694\n00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.060\nIt's with my provider, let me call them.\n\n695\n00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.460\nAre you having any issues?\n\n696\n00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.670\nThey'll verify, yep, we had a guy,\ndidn't call before he dug, and\n\n697\n00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.890\nsliced right through our fiber\nbackbone and we're having issues.\n\n698\n00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:04.815\nAt that point, it is,\nit's out of your hands,\n\n699\n00:33:04.815 --> 00:33:06.368\nthere's nothing you can do but wait.\n\n700\n00:33:06.368 --> 00:33:11.343\nYou got an SLA with your provider, they're\ngonna give you some sort of compensation\n\n701\n00:33:11.343 --> 00:33:16.748\nfor that, sometimes, as long it's outside\nof the realms of what they expect to see.\n\n702\n00:33:16.748 --> 00:33:18.150\nBut then there's nothing\nyou can really do,\n\n703\n00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.160\nwait until that connectivity comes back.\n\n704\n00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.815\nNow Wes, we've got a few more tools\nthat we wanna go through, but\n\n705\n00:33:24.815 --> 00:33:26.855\nthat clock is well done.\n\n706\n00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:28.515\nWe went well past it.\n\n707\n00:33:28.515 --> 00:33:30.968\nSo it looks like we're gonna have to have\na part two on network troubleshooting with\n\n708\n00:33:30.968 --> 00:33:31.608\ncommand line tools.\n\n709\n00:33:31.608 --> 00:33:32.908\n>> That sounds good,\nit looks like we killed the clock.\n\n710\n00:33:32.908 --> 00:33:33.628\n>> Yeah we sure did.\n\n711\n00:33:33.628 --> 00:33:35.137\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look forward to seeing you there.\n\n712\n00:33:35.137 --> 00:33:35.647\n>> Definitely.\n\n713\n00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:36.344\n>> Thanks for stopping by.\n\n714\n00:33:36.344 --> 00:33:37.875\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n715\n00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:39.185\nHopefully we'll see you in part two.\n\n716\n00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:41.534\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n717\n00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:42.825\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n718\n00:33:42.825 --> 00:33:43.655\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n719\n00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:44.585\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n720\n00:33:44.585 --> 00:33:53.120\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.290\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.950\nour network troubleshooting,\nusing command line tools.\n\n5\n00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.271\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.364\nnone other than our good friend,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:30.800\nWes, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800\n>> Hey, thanks for\nhaving me here, and that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400\nApparently, I talked way too\nmuch in the first episode.\n\n10\n00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.320\nSo we're coming at you with, well, the\nsequel here today, cuz we do have a few\n\n11\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.690\nmore, just a couple more utilities that\nwe wouldn't really be doing you justice,\n\n12\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.870\nif we didn't mention and\nput in the episode here.\n\n13\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntalk about a couple of them.\n\n14\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.197\nOne that I really want to talk\nabout right going out the gate,\n\n15\n00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.880\nis gonna be something known as netstat.\n\n16\n00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.200\nNow that's short for network statistic.\n\n17\n00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.704\nNow, there's a couple different\nreasons you might use this.\n\n18\n00:00:56.704 --> 00:01:00.054\nOne of the primary reasons I\nknow that I've used it before,\n\n19\n00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:01.528\nis to look and determine,\n\n20\n00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:05.559\nwhat are the state of the connections\nthat I have on my machine, right?\n\n21\n00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:07.703\nAnd when we talk about connections,\ntypically,\n\n22\n00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:10.469\nwe're talking about\nTransmission Control Protocol, right?\n\n23\n00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.810\nConnection-oriented service.\n\n24\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.123\nAnd I wanna see if I can establish\na connection, maybe to a server, or\n\n25\n00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:18.722\nif I already have an established\nconnection, not only to web servers, but\n\n26\n00:01:18.722 --> 00:01:21.600\nto other services that you have\nrunning in the background.\n\n27\n00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.350\nFor instance, if you're connected\nto shared resources as well.\n\n28\n00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.490\nLet me go show you what I mean here.\n\n29\n00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.486\nSo we've got the network's,\nI say network's statistics utility, but\n\n30\n00:01:29.486 --> 00:01:32.011\nlet's be careful with that one guys,\nright?\n\n31\n00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.890\nThat is the netstat they\njust abbreviated there.\n\n32\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.410\nWe're gonna use the -a switch, and\nthat just means show me everything.\n\n33\n00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.970\nI'm gonna show you a couple different\nswitches here that you might like.\n\n34\n00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.991\nFor instance, I might do this a little bit\ndifferently then just, sometimes they just\n\n35\n00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:51.270\nsay, -a, that shows me everything, all\nthe connections in their current state.\n\n36\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.826\nAnd you can see some over here\nin this right-hand column.\n\n37\n00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:57.192\nYou'll notice that it says that yeah,\nthey're listening.\n\n38\n00:01:57.192 --> 00:02:00.019\nAnd if we scroll down just\na little bit farther here,\n\n39\n00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.240\nwe could see that there are some\nestablished connections.\n\n40\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.249\nIt looks like it got done there.\n\n41\n00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.060\nSo we do see that there are some\nestablished connections here, and\n\n42\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.020\nwe can find IP addresses here.\n\n43\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.080\nIn fact, there should be a couple in here\nthat might even be related to things like\n\n44\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.380\nSMB connections too.\n\n45\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.333\nSo, if Dan's got a file server\nout there in Windows, and\n\n46\n00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.995\nI'm connected to it, well that's still\nan established connection, right?\n\n47\n00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.200\nAnd I would see that fact here,\nand maybe that's what I'm doing.\n\n48\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.312\nMaybe I'm troubleshooting a connection,\nif you will,\n\n49\n00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.854\nto something like a file server, right?\n\n50\n00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:30.208\nAnd I wanna know,\ndo I have to establish a connection?\n\n51\n00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.517\nI can say, well on this computer,\nif I run netstat -a,\n\n52\n00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:34.620\nI can say that I had a connection, right?\n\n53\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.144\nMaybe the next computer\nthat I'm troubleshooting,\n\n54\n00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:40.205\nI run a netstat space -a, and\nI don't get that connection, and\n\n55\n00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:44.190\nthat'd maybe give me an idea of where\nI want to troubleshoot from there.\n\n56\n00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.900\nBut one of the things that might help you\nout too, is you can also filter this down,\n\n57\n00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.602\nand Dan as you can see, right,\nwe got a lot of stuff for UDP.\n\n58\n00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:56.090\nAnd as we know, UDP, User Datagram\nProtocol, it's a connectionless service,\n\n59\n00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.510\nit's best ever delivery.\n\n60\n00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.280\nSo it makes no established connection,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.270\nSo it's not gonna give us any information.\n\n62\n00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.715\nWell, if it's not gonna give us any\ninformation, why put it in the list?\n\n63\n00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:08.545\nWell, it might be important\ninformation for you, you never know.\n\n64\n00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:10.030\nNothing like seeing nothing.\n\n65\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.195\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead, let me\nclear this and get this back to the top of\n\n66\n00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:15.495\nthe screen, guys,\nmake it a little easier for you to see.\n\n67\n00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:21.310\nWe're gonna do a netstat, and I can\nactually do a switch p, for protocol.\n\n68\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.880\nAnd I could say, okay,\nI just wanna see TCP.\n\n69\n00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.470\nAnd what it's gonna do, is it's gonna look\nthrough all those connections that we just\n\n70\n00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.180\nhad, right, but\nit'll filter the list a little bit faster.\n\n71\n00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.870\nYou see it kinda went through\nit a little bit quicker there.\n\n72\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.530\nBecause I'm really just worried\nabout the TCP connections, and\n\n73\n00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.850\nwhat their current state is.\n\n74\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.520\nI don't care about all\nthe User Datagram Protocol information.\n\n75\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.500\nAnd I can get to that\ninformation a little bit faster.\n\n76\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.750\nNow, you could do a little bit\nmore of information for this.\n\n77\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.520\nLike I said,\nit's a really powerful utility.\n\n78\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.330\nFor instance, maybe I wanna see\nthe statistics of the ethernet adapter\n\n79\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.820\nthemselves, right?\n\n80\n00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.330\nNot a little higher in\nthe OSI model there.\n\n81\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.520\nI don't really care about transmission\ncontrol protocol, maybe, per se.\n\n82\n00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.380\nWell, I can always do a netstat -a,\nand you can remember it for -ethernet.\n\n83\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.400\nThat's how I remember it.\n\n84\n00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.580\nIf you're ever out there at\na certification endeavor,\n\n85\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.340\nsome of you guys that have taken your\ncerts know that it's 1001 standards and\n\n86\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.170\nacronyms you gotta remember,\nit'd help you remember, a -e for ethernet.\n\n87\n00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.770\nAnd what I can do is,\nI can see some basic ethernet\n\n88\n00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.520\ninterface statistics is what it says,\nbut the interface is ethernet.\n\n89\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.410\nAnd I could see unicast packets, I could\nsee non-unicast packets, and maybe I'm,\n\n90\n00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000\neven though this is not as prevalent\ntoday in modern networks as it would have\n\n91\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.240\nbeen maybe in older networks, maybe I'm\nlooking for broadcast storms, right?\n\n92\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.244\nAnd I see non-unicast packets.\n\n93\n00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:33.590\nNon-unicast is gonna be lumped together,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.130\nSo it's not the only type of\ncommunication that we have.\n\n95\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.200\nIt's not just unicast, but I might\nsee some broadcast information here.\n\n96\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.143\nOr maybe I've got some errors going on,\nand\n\n97\n00:04:42.143 --> 00:04:44.040\nI can see something's not playing right.\n\n98\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.327\nWe're getting some kind of corruption,\nright?\n\n99\n00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.944\nAnd my computer's sending back\nto the source saying, hey,\n\n100\n00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:50.240\nnegative acknowledgement.\n\n101\n00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.170\nWe've got some kind of error,\nretransmit that information.\n\n102\n00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.500\nAnd that can also lead to performance\ndegradation too as well, right?\n\n103\n00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.360\nAny time you've gotta send a packet twice,\nit's just retransmission.\n\n104\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.842\nIt could cause delay, or\n\n105\n00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:07.377\nit could cause just an overwhelming\namount of information on your network.\n\n106\n00:05:07.377 --> 00:05:08.860\nSo netstat, Dan, kinda cool.\n\n107\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.220\nLet me give you a little\n\n108\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.670\nbit more information here on what's going\nin the background, because we ran it, and\n\n109\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.550\nI really didn't tell you\nthe information here.\n\n110\n00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.320\nYou notice that there's some\nconnections that are established?\n\n111\n00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.610\nI can see that this is a connection\nto our storage location, right?\n\n112\n00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.240\nAnd I how do I know that\nthat's my computer?\n\n113\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.690\nWell first of all,\nyou notice it says local address, right?\n\n114\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.120\nSo here's my local IP address.\n\n115\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.440\nI can see that this is a high-level\nport value that's on the end of it.\n\n116\n00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.130\nSo I can see that this is a temporary\nconnection that my computer's established,\n\n117\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.720\nand you can get that information\nright out of what you're seeing here.\n\n118\n00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.060\nI know it's kinda hard to see out there,\nbut I'm gonna hover it over right here,\n\n119\n00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.260\nnotice that we have Chrome\ngoing in the background, and\n\n120\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.080\nI've got a connection here.\n\n121\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.940\nTry to get that out of the way, it always\nwants me to start that up, or show it.\n\n122\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.580\nAnd you can see that I got an established\nconnection out there to Google as well,\n\n123\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.760\nout to their servers.\n\n124\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.300\nSo, it's good to test the connections and\nsee what the state of the connections are.\n\n125\n00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.400\nSo that's why netstat, definitely\nput it in your tech tool bag, and\n\n126\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.940\nI would know it if you're troubleshooting.\n\n127\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.800\n>> Yeah, it's really handy\nwhen it comes to figuring out,\n\n128\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.630\nwhy am I having some\nnetwork slowdown issues?\n\n129\n00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.360\nIt can help in that endeavor.\n\n130\n00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.250\nSpecifically on, or I should say\nespecially, on client computers.\n\n131\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.760\nCuz a lot of times they'll get programs\nthey weren't intending to get.\n\n132\n00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.040\nWe like to call this malware.\n\n133\n00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.130\nIt's really great for\nhelping you find that.\n\n134\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.180\nIf someone says, man,\nmy computer's running slow,\n\n135\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.160\nI always ask, is the computer running\nslower, or is the network running slower?\n\n136\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.770\nIs the Internet connectivity slow?\n\n137\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.492\nWell, it's anytime I access the Internet.\n\n138\n00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:38.718\nOkay, let's check your\nnetwork connectivity.\n\n139\n00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:41.982\nSometimes I'll run netstat there and\nsee, let's check and\n\n140\n00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:43.779\nsee what you're connecting to.\n\n141\n00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.259\nAnd if I see some weird activity\nhappening, I might look that up,\n\n142\n00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.910\nand we'll lookup where it is\nthey're actually contacting.\n\n143\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.180\nLook.\nIt's a Romanian server somewhere.\n\n144\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.970\nLook at this nice Chinese server here.\n\n145\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.220\nYou might have a hacker going on, so\nit's really good for picking up that.\n\n146\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.170\nOr, if your computers just gone haywire,\nmaybe your network card is just\n\n147\n00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.240\nflooding the network with traffic,\nI can see that, using the statistics.\n\n148\n00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.868\nSo, very handy little tool.\n\n149\n00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.861\nDefinitely one that you\nwanna have in the kit.\n\n150\n00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:13.950\n>> Yeah, true.\n\n151\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.100\nAnd with Transmission Control Protocol\nbeing that connection-oriented state, Dan,\n\n152\n00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.708\ntoo, you might think of things like\ndenial-of-service attacks, right?\n\n153\n00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:25.831\nCuz in the whole communication\nwith TCP/IP, it's gonna wait for\n\n154\n00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:29.596\nthe last piece of a handshake\nto establish that connection.\n\n155\n00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:32.273\nAnd if that connection is\ngonna be just withheld,\n\n156\n00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:36.930\nthen what happens is your computer starts\nhaving all these established connections,\n\n157\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.753\nand before you know it, you're out of RAM,\nyou're out of memory, and\n\n158\n00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.203\nworst case scenario your computer reboots.\n\n159\n00:07:43.203 --> 00:07:47.470\nSo a lot of good, handy information\nto have, and I would be aware of it.\n\n160\n00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.199\nNow, there is another one that's out there\nthat we need to be aware of, in general,\n\n161\n00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.076\nand this is for name resolution.\n\n162\n00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:56.215\nKeep in mind,\nin the first part of this episode,\n\n163\n00:07:56.215 --> 00:07:58.784\nwe did talk about some handy\nutilities that you could use.\n\n164\n00:07:58.784 --> 00:08:03.727\nWe talked about ipconfig, right, and\nthe displaydns to see the local resolver\n\n165\n00:08:03.727 --> 00:08:07.210\ncache, and\nthe flushdns to clear that resolver cache.\n\n166\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.997\nWell, there's another one out there that\nyou need to be aware of that helps test\n\n167\n00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:12.970\nname resolution, and his is nslookup.\n\n168\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.190\nNslookup is short for name server lookup.\n\n169\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.600\nIf you guys are in other NIC-based\nsystems, I believe they have DIG, right,\n\n170\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.010\nthe domain internet groper.\n\n171\n00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.520\nSo what we need to do is we need\nto find out if I send a request to\n\n172\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.600\na DNS server,\nwill it resolve it for me, right?\n\n173\n00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.900\nWell, let's find out, right.\n\n174\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:40.000\nSo I'm gonna type www, and, we'll\njust do Facebook.com here real quick.\n\n175\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.940\nAll right.\n\n176\n00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.548\nWell, you say, okay,\nit resolved for me, right?\n\n177\n00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:49.720\nWell, that doesn't really tell me much\nbecause what if it's in the local resolver\n\n178\n00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.940\ncache, right?\n\n179\n00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.245\nIf it's in the local resolver cache,\nremember what we said in part one.\n\n180\n00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:55.900\nI'm not gonna send that request\nout to the DNS server, so\n\n181\n00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.905\nthat doesn't truly tell me if\nthe server can resolve the name.\n\n182\n00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:04.011\nSo one of the benefits of nslookup is\nyou're saying, pull a blind eye, right,\n\n183\n00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:07.342\npull the horse blinders over and\ndon't look at the local cache.\n\n184\n00:09:07.342 --> 00:09:08.573\nI know I can resolve it there.\n\n185\n00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:11.081\nI want you to skip that cache and\nI want you to send this request.\n\n186\n00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:13.740\nWhere is www.facebook.com?\n\n187\n00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.960\nAnd I want you to send it to the DNS\nserver to see if it can do its job.\n\n188\n00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.560\nThis is where nslookup comes in.\n\n189\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.368\nSo let's go ahead and show you that on\na command prompt here cuz, remember,\n\n190\n00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:25.940\nwe're supposed to be in the command line,\nright.\n\n191\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.080\nSo we're gonna do nslookup,\n\n192\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.350\nand there's a couple of different\nways that you can do this, right?\n\n193\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.950\nThere's what's known as\ninteractive mode and\n\n194\n00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.810\nthere's what's known as\nnon-interactive mode.\n\n195\n00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.136\nWhat I'm gonna use is just\nnon-interactive mode.\n\n196\n00:09:36.136 --> 00:09:37.899\nAnd this is where you use the command and\n\n197\n00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:40.316\nwhatever the name is that\nyou're trying to resolve.\n\n198\n00:09:40.316 --> 00:09:47.236\nLet's do that same thing,\nwww.facebook.com.\n\n199\n00:09:47.236 --> 00:09:50.106\nNow, you do have to be able to spell\nthe name right, so if you're like Wes,\n\n200\n00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:51.850\nyou might be in trouble\nno matter what you do.\n\n201\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.578\n>> You might be hindered.\n\n202\n00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:53.917\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n203\n00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.436\nAnd so I can see that, yes,\nit could resolve that name.\n\n204\n00:09:56.436 --> 00:09:59.195\nAnd it tells me that www.facebook.com, and\n\n205\n00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:02.460\nI actually get a little bit\nof information about this.\n\n206\n00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.020\nThis is a canonical name, right,\nit's a c name, it's an alias.\n\n207\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.820\nSo it says any time you type\nwww.facebook.com, what you really meant\n\n208\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.880\nwas star dash mini dot, and a whole\nbunch of other letters and numbers.\n\n209\n00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880\nBut it maps to this IP address.\n\n210\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.490\nNow, that's pretty good, but\nyou can do a lot more, all right?\n\n211\n00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.320\nAnd I'd love to take credit for\nthis one, but Dan was actually,\n\n212\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.810\nwe were working with this\ncommand before we even started.\n\n213\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.220\nAnd he showed me a really cool one\nthat's in the interactive mode.\n\n214\n00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.250\nNow, if you type nslookup, right,\nand you go into interactive mode,\n\n215\n00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.028\nnow if I type a question mark,\nI can do a lot of stuff in here.\n\n216\n00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:42.450\nLike I said, I give props to Dan, oops,\nI can't clear the screen, that's right.\n\n217\n00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.190\nI can't clear the screen cuz only these\ncommands now work in interactive mode,\n\n218\n00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.000\nand hence the name, interactive mode.\n\n219\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.730\nBut if we do a set type =,\nyou showed me MX records,\n\n220\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.340\nI wanna know where the mail server is for\nthis entire domain.\n\n221\n00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.033\nI could say, well, I'm looking for an MX\nrecord, right, a mail exchanger record.\n\n222\n00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.550\nI believe that was just the domain,\nwas it just google.com, Dan?\n\n223\n00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.070\n>> Yeah, I think that should\nget you some sort of result.\n\n224\n00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.110\n>> Yeah, and it tells me, set type = mx.\n\n225\n00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.990\nWhat did I do wrong there?\n\n226\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.668\n>> Yeah, don't add google.com,\njust set type = mx.\n\n227\n00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:19.510\n>> Yep.\n>> And then hit Enter.\n\n228\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.240\n>> And hit Enter.\n\n229\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.550\n>> And it changes.\n\n230\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.613\n>> That's right.\n\n231\n00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:26.010\nAnd you have to remember,\ntoo, there we go.\n\n232\n00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.350\nYou have to remember, too, that this\nis one of those commands that you\n\n233\n00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.690\ncan keep going down into\nthe different levels there,\n\n234\n00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.040\nand who knows how deep the rabbit hole\ngoes, so be careful with this one.\n\n235\n00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.919\nAs you can see,\nI airballed here right on camera.\n\n236\n00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.394\nSo what is going on here?\n\n237\n00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:43.985\nBut it's saying now what I'm requesting,\nI'm not requesting you to just resolve\n\n238\n00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:47.591\nthe name, I want a specific record\nthat's in that database, and\n\n239\n00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:49.772\ncan you give me that information back?\n\n240\n00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:52.399\nSo you can see nslookupcan\nbe very powerful,\n\n241\n00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.798\na lot more powerful than we've\neven shown you right here.\n\n242\n00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:59.101\nBut it's a very, very good utility,\neven to test your own DNS servers, too,\n\n243\n00:11:59.101 --> 00:12:02.054\nthat you can do more, you can find\nout things like zone transfers, but\n\n244\n00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.460\nthat's definitely for\nanother series, for sure.\n\n245\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.890\n>> Yeah, and\nit definitely just boils down to the fact,\n\n246\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:12.025\nthe vast majority of the time you're gonna\nuse this for is my server doing its job?\n\n247\n00:12:12.025 --> 00:12:14.370\nAnd that's what we've really hit on,\n\n248\n00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.000\nthat's 95% of the time why\nyou're gonna use nslookup.\n\n249\n00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.380\nI've tried to get to a website,\nI've typed in the name in the browser, and\n\n250\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.220\nI get can't find it.\n\n251\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.890\nI type in another name, can't find it.\n\n252\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.770\nI'm not getting any resolution.\n\n253\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.350\nWas my server able to resolve those names?\n\n254\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.040\nSo you go into the server,\nyou try to see if it'll resolve.\n\n255\n00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.137\nIf you get no results, you know there's\nan issue with the server, itself, so\n\n256\n00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:36.950\nthen you gotta move toward there.\n\n257\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.710\nSo it's a really good troubleshooting\ntool for when that type of thing happens.\n\n258\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.600\n>> Yeah, and I need to give props\nto our chatroom Dave is mentioning.\n\n259\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.540\nAnd it also shows you the DNS\nserver that you are using.\n\n260\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.882\nLet's go back to our chat screen and\n\n261\n00:12:48.882 --> 00:12:51.175\nsee what they're talking about\nin the chat room right here.\n\n262\n00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:55.958\nNotice that we have, it tells me,\nright, my IP address.\n\n263\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:01.299\nAnd, in fact, let's go ahead, and\nwhat, Q to quit or it's just exit?\n\n264\n00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:02.716\nI think it might even be Ctrl+C.\n\n265\n00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:05.860\nYeah, all right, so\nlet me go ahead real quick,\n\n266\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.636\nremember we said ipconfig / all, right?\n\n267\n00:13:08.636 --> 00:13:13.803\nAnd if I look in here, I can see that\nmy primary DNS server is 8.8.8.8.\n\n268\n00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:16.088\nI've got an alternate,\na backup, of 8.8.4.4.\n\n269\n00:13:16.088 --> 00:13:21.551\nNow, they're both Google, but\nwhat was mentioned in the chat\n\n270\n00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:26.730\nroom says hey,\nit shows you what DNS server you're using.\n\n271\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.050\nAnd sure enough, we'll move that up\nto the top there so you can see,\n\n272\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.790\nit tells me that I am\nusing Google's web server.\n\n273\n00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.549\nOr it's not web server,\nexcuse me, DNS server, and\n\n274\n00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.620\nyou can even see the name there.\n\n275\n00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.380\nSo all good information.\n\n276\n00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.320\nSo nslookup, very, very powerful utility.\n\n277\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.820\nIt is something that I would\nalso put in your tech tool bag,\n\n278\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.450\nespecially when it comes\nto testing name resolution,\n\n279\n00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.840\nwhen you don't wanna resolve\nit from that local cache.\n\n280\n00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.060\nNow, you can also, in all honesty, you\ncould just resolve the local cache if you\n\n281\n00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.710\nwanted to, and then you wouldn't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n282\n00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.390\nYou'll know that you're nothing using\nlocal cache if there isn't anything there.\n\n283\n00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.150\nThis just kinds of ensures that the\nprocess goes directly to the DNS server,\n\n284\n00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.490\nand you bypass any local name\nresolution that might be going on.\n\n285\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.063\n>> Yeah, and you gotta look out for\nthat right [LAUGH]?\n\n286\n00:14:12.063 --> 00:14:16.570\nDon't forget, it can resolve\nany type of DNS type of record,\n\n287\n00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.100\nso there's all different ones out there,\nA records, C names, you name it.\n\n288\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.830\nIt can work with those records\ncuz that's kinda what it does.\n\n289\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.920\nIf you need to change your DNS server,\nit can do that, too.\n\n290\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.300\nHonestly, we could do\na whole show on nslookup.\n\n291\n00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.010\nIt's quite a tool, so\ndefinitely check out its help, right.\n\n292\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.940\nLook up how to use DNS and more features.\n\n293\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.888\nBut, for the most part,\nyou're checking that DNS.\n\n294\n00:14:36.888 --> 00:14:40.380\nYou just wanna make sure that it can\nresolve, and do those names for you.\n\n295\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.960\nThat's where you're gonna go, maybe reset\nthe type of record you're looking at.\n\n296\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.973\nAnd once we've got a couple other\ntools to take a look at now, right,\n\n297\n00:14:45.973 --> 00:14:47.566\nwe can spend the whole\ntime on nslookup [LAUGH].\n\n298\n00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:51.255\n>> Absolutely, we really can, but I have\nto tell you here because there's a couple\n\n299\n00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:53.804\nof good comments that are being\nmet in the chatroom, and\n\n300\n00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:55.941\nI really think it benefits\nyou guys out there.\n\n301\n00:14:55.941 --> 00:15:00.834\nWhat if I want to find out if the\nalternate DNS server will resolve names?\n\n302\n00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.098\nI don't wanna send it to the 8.8.8.8.\n\n303\n00:15:03.098 --> 00:15:04.450\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n304\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.316\nNow, notice that I'm still using\nthe same command down here, right.\n\n305\n00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.870\nNotice it's nslookup,\nwww.facebook.com, but\n\n306\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.950\nat the end I'm putting an IP\naddress to another DNS server.\n\n307\n00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.570\nAnd when I run that, sure enough,\nit replies, and it can respond back to me.\n\n308\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.130\nSo now I'm not only testing does\nthe primary data server resolve for me,\n\n309\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.100\ndoes the alternate DNS server, and\n\n310\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.180\nlike in the context it was mentioned\nin the chatroom, any DNS server.\n\n311\n00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.830\nDo you want to test if it\ncan do name resolution?\n\n312\n00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.870\nSo that's right, so do keep that in mind.\n\n313\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.910\nYou can bounce some of those\nlookups against other DNS servers.\n\n314\n00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.346\nWe do have another one that I wanna\nmention, and I'm gonna mention it just\n\n315\n00:15:42.346 --> 00:15:47.257\nbriefly here because if you were in exam\nendeavor, you would definitely see it.\n\n316\n00:15:47.257 --> 00:15:47.825\nHow much you see it?\n\n317\n00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:52.654\nUnless you're running a core installation,\na server is really gonna be\n\n318\n00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:56.624\ncontingent on how I don't know,\nif you are going for pain.\n\n319\n00:15:56.624 --> 00:15:58.738\n[LAUGH] This next one is called netsh.\n\n320\n00:15:58.738 --> 00:16:02.460\nSometimes it could be easy, sometimes\nit could be relatively difficult.\n\n321\n00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.240\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n322\n00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.990\nSo, the netsh command, it has all\ndifferent kinds of stuff it can do.\n\n323\n00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.780\nYou can configure your firewall,\n\n324\n00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.100\nyou configure IPv4,\nyou can configure IPv6 all of that.\n\n325\n00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:21.150\nIf I wanted to, I could do a netsh, and I\ndon't want to change this over to a static\n\n326\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.840\nIP address, but I can do something like\nthis, I can do netsh interface ip,\n\n327\n00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.450\nand if I don't specify 4 or\n6, it'll default to 4.\n\n328\n00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.020\nSo if I wanted,\nI could do IPv6 or I could do v4.\n\n329\n00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.940\nIf you don't put anything on there,\nit will default to IPv4,\n\n330\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.380\nand I can do set address here,\nand then name=, and\n\n331\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:46.010\nI'll name whatever the local\nnetwork adapter is.\n\n332\n00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:50.620\nAnd then you could do, for\ninstance, you can do source=static.\n\n333\n00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.720\nAll right, and then our IP address,\n\n334\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.905\nwe would just do whatever\nthe IP address might be.\n\n335\n00:16:56.905 --> 00:17:00.370\n168.1.100, and then we can do a mask.\n\n336\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.730\nAnd you know what,\ndon't let me forget something.\n\n337\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.715\nThis is why I let you,\nyou can see how much fun this is, right?\n\n338\n00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:11.310\nAddr= and then you gotta have\nthat in there so it knows, hey,\n\n339\n00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.838\nthat's the address and\nthen mask=, get that right there,\n\n340\n00:17:14.838 --> 00:17:18.593\nyou gotta love it when commands\nstart going two and three lines.\n\n341\n00:17:18.593 --> 00:17:19.493\n>> When it wraps the screen?\n\n342\n00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:24.408\n>> Yeah, 255.0, and\nlast, but not least, so\n\n343\n00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:30.260\nI could do a gateway=, and\nI could do something like this,\n\n344\n00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.350\n192.168.1.1.\n\n345\n00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:38.820\nAnd when I run the command, what it does\nis it sets the adapter to a static IP\n\n346\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.250\naddress of one more\nspecifically that I want.\n\n347\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.940\nAnd it did it, so that's a good thing.\n\n348\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.880\nIt didn't come back and say error.\n\n349\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:52.056\nAnd if I do an ipconfig and I look,\nI now have an IP address of 192.168.1.100.\n\n350\n00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:56.131\nNow the reason I mention this in\nthe context of troubleshooting,\n\n351\n00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:57.620\nI just did my IP config.\n\n352\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.610\nSo we started there.\n\n353\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.210\nWe did our IP config.\n\n354\n00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.020\nWhat if that IP address is wrong?\n\n355\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.229\nWhat if I notice right away\nthat it wasn't supposed to be\n\n356\n00:18:05.229 --> 00:18:07.908\na 255.255.255.0 subnet mask?\n\n357\n00:18:07.908 --> 00:18:09.350\nYou probably remember Dan saying that.\n\n358\n00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.760\nIf you don't have that subnet right,\nyou're not even on the same network.\n\n359\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.866\nWhat if I need to change that?\n\n360\n00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:15.120\nWell, that's where\nthe netsh command comes in.\n\n361\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.340\nYou can do something like\nthat from the command prompt.\n\n362\n00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.180\nLot easier from the GUI for sure, but\n\n363\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.900\nwhat happens when you're met with a\ncommand prompt and you don't have the GUI?\n\n364\n00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.760\nIt is good to know, as a back up, and\nit is one that I would have there.\n\n365\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.370\n>> Yeah, also great for\nscripting as well, right.\n\n366\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.801\nAnytime you can throw something into\na command line and into a script,\n\n367\n00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:34.873\nthat's also very helpful, but it does also\nhelp us troubleshoot our networks, so\n\n368\n00:18:34.873 --> 00:18:37.750\nyou can just stay within\nthat command line utility.\n\n369\n00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.360\nBut it's not the only thing it can do.\n\n370\n00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.690\nThat netsh has some power to it.\n\n371\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.570\nAnd I've had to use it quite a bit for\nthis very reason,\n\n372\n00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.670\nwhich is sometimes the TCP/IP stack,\n\n373\n00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:52.090\nthe protocol suite that you're using,\nit just gets jacked up, right?\n\n374\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.820\nIt just gets completely messed up and\nI need to reseat it.\n\n375\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.860\nI know you're thinking, okay,\nwell reboot the computer.\n\n376\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.320\nWell, rebooting the computer\nis not going to help uou.\n\n377\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.510\nI need to rebuild TCP/IP\nfrom the ground up and\n\n378\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.820\nnetsh will actually help us do that,\nright, Wes?\n\n379\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.740\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n380\n00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.580\nSo, you know,\nif you go to a point where you're at,\n\n381\n00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.770\nyou're pinging, you start with\nyour loop back address, right?\n\n382\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.180\nAnd it says no result.\n\n383\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.570\nIt doesn't even time out.\n\n384\n00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.927\nIt just gives you a whole bunch of output.\n\n385\n00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:21.310\nYou might need to reset\nthe TCP/IP protocols stack.\n\n386\n00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.715\nAnd that's what it means,\nit means your operating system doesn't\n\n387\n00:19:25.715 --> 00:19:29.565\nunderstand the rules of communications\nto even speak to the network.\n\n388\n00:19:29.565 --> 00:19:32.775\nSo if we wanted, let me get some\nof this information off here.\n\n389\n00:19:32.775 --> 00:19:37.695\nWe can do the netsh winsock reset.\n\n390\n00:19:37.695 --> 00:19:43.526\nThen we reset it, and we do have to reset\nthe computer, so we'll do our shutdown.\n\n391\n00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:49.340\nAnd we will restart the computer.\n\n392\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.270\nAnd as the computer restarts,\nwhat's gonna happen is,\n\n393\n00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.390\nwell, we always joke around right?\n\n394\n00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.670\nReboots fix everything?\n\n395\n00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.770\nImagine this a reboot for\n\n396\n00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.630\nthe communication protocol\nstack inside of your network.\n\n397\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.200\nKinda like recycling the printer, which is\na fancy term for rebooting the printer.\n\n398\n00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.020\nThat's essentially what we're doing\nto the protocol stack inside of your\n\n399\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.780\noperating system.\n\n400\n00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.370\n>> That's right.\nAnd\n\n401\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.800\nonce that's done,\nyou should be back to the races.\n\n402\n00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.580\nAnd if that was the problem,\n\n403\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.050\nif your TCP/IP suite has become messed up,\nyou do the reset.\n\n404\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.650\nOnce you've restarted the computer,\nyou should be back in action.\n\n405\n00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.970\nEverything should start working.\n\n406\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.140\nIt has definitely saved this guy more\nthan a time or two, that is for sure.\n\n407\n00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.360\nIt's a nice little handy\ncommand to have in the toolkit.\n\n408\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.890\nWell Wes,\nwe've gone through a lot of tools so far.\n\n409\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.180\nIs there anything else we wanna\ncover before we close the show?\n\n410\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.270\n>> You know,\nthere are plenty of commands out there.\n\n411\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.580\nAnd I remember, guys,\nwhen I first started,\n\n412\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.520\ngot into computing, I was studying as\na student and getting certifications.\n\n413\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.590\nI remember the first time we opened\na command prompt, my skin was crawling.\n\n414\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.430\nWhy, why, did I get myself into this and\nwhat have I done?\n\n415\n00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:54.190\nIf this seems a little bit daunting when\nyou first get into it, don't let it.\n\n416\n00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.370\nIt can be, but the moment you start\nunderstanding what you're doing and\n\n417\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:01.680\npracticing some of these commands,\nyou could become very, very efficient and\n\n418\n00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.020\nyou don't need to be tied down to the GUI.\n\n419\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.290\nSaying, wel,l they don't make a button for\nit, I can't test it.\n\n420\n00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:06.948\nWell, you know what?\n\n421\n00:21:06.948 --> 00:21:07.960\nThey don't have to make a button,\n\n422\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.730\nbecause you can do it inside\nof the command prompt.\n\n423\n00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.540\nSo keep it up, practice it, you can do it.\n\n424\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:15.980\nIf somebody like me can do it, if somebody\nlike Dan can do this over the years,\n\n425\n00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.000\nyou can do this as well and\njust stick to it.\n\n426\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.420\n>> Yeah,\none of the things that I took away from\n\n427\n00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.810\na mentor of mine as I got into IT,\nwe were learning command lines and\n\n428\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.650\nthen somebody was like,\nwhy are we learning this?\n\n429\n00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.070\nThere's graphics for everything.\n\n430\n00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.500\nThere's a GUI for everything, he said.\n\n431\n00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.960\nWhat happens if you don't have the GUI?\n\n432\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.890\nWhat do you do?\n\n433\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.680\nSo these command line tools are very\nfunctional, they're very helpful.\n\n434\n00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.110\nLearning them is gonna help you,\nyou're gonna use them, trust us.\n\n435\n00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.710\nYou might use some more than others,\nbut eventually,\n\n436\n00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.260\none day, you will probably have\nused all of them to some extent.\n\n437\n00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.940\nWes, thank you so much for stopping by.\n\n438\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.612\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Thank you for\n\n439\n00:21:48.612 --> 00:21:51.040\nexplaining these cool\ntools that we can use.\n\n440\n00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.650\nDefinitely developing our tool kit here\nfor our upcoming network engineers.\n\n441\n00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.300\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed this\nshow and learned a little bit, but\n\n442\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.410\nit looks like we've come to the end.\n\n443\n00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.458\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n444\n00:22:01.458 --> 00:22:02.960\nI've been your host, Dan Lowrie.\n\n445\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.770\n>> And I'm Wes Brian.\n\n446\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.756\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n447\n00:22:05.756 --> 00:22:13.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:15.826\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITProTV, I'm your host,\n\n4\n00:00:15.826 --> 00:00:16.696\nMike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:19.935\nAnd today we're doing command\nline networking tools.\n\n6\n00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:23.379\nAnd specifically this episode,\nwe're gonna take a look at how\n\n7\n00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:28.180\nwe can set our IP information, our IP\nconfiguration, from the command line.\n\n8\n00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.670\nAnd here to help us with all\nof that is Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.340\nHow you doing, Daniel?\n\n10\n00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.530\n&gt;&gt; Mike, I couldn't be better.\n\n11\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.760\nI'm glad to be on the show today.\n\n12\n00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.780\nIt's always fun to come\nhere in the studio and\n\n13\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.791\nstand on this side of\nthe podium from time to time.\n\n14\n00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:39.347\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And today is no exception of that.\n\n15\n00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:42.188\nWe're gonna have a great time today and\nlike Mike said,\n\n16\n00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.830\nwe're going to try to set our IP\ninformation through the command line.\n\n17\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.640\nNow, I know, right, normally, we live in\na GUI world, and we all love them, right?\n\n18\n00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.900\nBecause they're so easy.\n\n19\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.350\nI just go into the little graphical box,\nand I check something off, and magically,\n\n20\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.570\nan IP address shows up, or\nif I need to do a static IP,\n\n21\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.980\nI can do it from there as well.\n\n22\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.010\nI just type in the information,\nand I'm off to the races.\n\n23\n00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.290\nBut what if I don't have that option, what\nif I'm maybe remoted in from somewhere,\n\n24\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.110\nand I'm only inside of a command line\nutility, that's all I gotta work with.\n\n25\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.740\nBut guess what?\n\n26\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.540\nYou're not out in the weeds.\n\n27\n00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.590\nWe can still set that IP information, and\nthat's what we're gonna try to do today.\n\n28\n00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.790\n&gt;&gt; So there are some times, are there\nadvantages of doing it through the GUI\n\n29\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.450\nversus using the command line over the\nGUI, or is it more of a what I feel like\n\n30\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.800\nusing today, or other times when\nthat's all I have available?\n\n31\n00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really what it's\ngonna boil down to, a lot of times,\n\n32\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300\nit's gonna be just because that's\nwhat you have available to you.\n\n33\n00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.890\nI've logged into a headless server,\nand I need to set IP information.\n\n34\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.480\nWe don't have a GUI to rely on.\n\n35\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.750\nOther times, we might wanna do some\nscripting, that can also come into play.\n\n36\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.650\nYou'll be able to script things\nlike this out, that's always fun.\n\n37\n00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.700\nBut typically, it's because we just don't\nhave a graphical user interface, or\n\n38\n00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.460\nyou just might be old school, and\nyou want to just stay in one spot.\n\n39\n00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.850\nIt's nice to be able to\nthrow the commands at it.\n\n40\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.420\nNone of these are too terribly\ndifficult to remember or lengthy.\n\n41\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.430\nA couple of them can be,\n\n42\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.590\nbut if you have them underneath your belt,\nwhy jump around?\n\n43\n00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.830\nI gotta go here, I gotta go there,\nit's easier to stay.\n\n44\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.110\nI'm in the command line already.\n\n45\n00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.770\nI can go ahead and\nset that information from here.\n\n46\n00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.820\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I find, Daniel.\n\n47\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.610\nI'm definitely a GUI driven guy,\nbut with Server,\n\n48\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.950\nwhere I spend a lot of my time,\nwe deal with Core, and now Nano.\n\n49\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.620\nAnd so, as you were saying,\nheadless systems where the only\n\n50\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.950\noption is that command prompt, or\nPowerShell in the case of Windows.\n\n51\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.460\nAnd I tell you, what I've found is\nthat once you learn those commands,\n\n52\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.060\nand once you have them under your belt,\nwhen I go back to a system that has a GUI,\n\n53\n00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.850\nit's actually a little bit faster\nif I do it through PowerShell,\n\n54\n00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.830\nespecially when the operating systems\nchange all the time, and, okay,\n\n55\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.010\nwhere is this setting, and\nwhere have you hidden it now, Microsoft?\n\n56\n00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.310\nOr, whatever different operating systems,\nthey all have a terminal,\n\n57\n00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.480\nyou can get to it,\nthe commands are the same,\n\n58\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.600\nno matter what the flavor of\nthe desktop you're looking at.\n\n59\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike makes a great point.\n\n60\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.520\nHe's absolutely right.\n\n61\n00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.391\nIf you're working with something\nlike a Linux system, right,\n\n62\n00:02:58.391 --> 00:02:59.826\nLinux systems are notorious for\n\n63\n00:02:59.826 --> 00:03:03.193\nthe graphical environments being\ncompletely different from each other.\n\n64\n00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:07.984\nSome similarities, but I don't know where\nUbuntu puts the networking configuration\n\n65\n00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:10.622\nutility, versus where RedHat's putting it.\n\n66\n00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:15.697\nAnd if I'm bouncing around RedHat and\nUbuntu, and now I'm on a system.\n\n67\n00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:19.090\nIt's a whole lot easier if well, let me\njust jump into the terminal and do this.\n\n68\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.320\nOr if Windows decides, hey, you know what?\n\n69\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.450\nWe're not gonna put that there anymore.\n\n70\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.040\nI know we've done that for the last 15\nyears, but welcome to curveball land, and\n\n71\n00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.840\nnow you have no idea where to find it.\n\n72\n00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.270\nWell, the good news is I can still use\nthat tried and true command line stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.160\nThey've been around forever.\n\n74\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.990\nSome of them will eventually go away,\nand things do change.\n\n75\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.350\nWe'll see a little bit of that here today.\n\n76\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.650\nBut for the most part,\nthey're very venerable,\n\n77\n00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.780\nand they're not going where people love\nthem, they don't wanna see it disappear.\n\n78\n00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.130\nSo, you can expect them on your systems,\n\n79\n00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.500\nat least as of the shooting\nof this episode.\n\n80\n00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.696\nMaybe in the future-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:53.282\n&gt;&gt; They will be, but as of today,\n\n82\n00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:55.179\nwe get to use these to our advantage.\n\n83\n00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.434\nSo, I say we go ahead and hit the ground\nrunning with the first thing.\n\n84\n00:03:58.434 --> 00:03:59.810\nLet's talk about networking.\n\n85\n00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.311\nRight, this is what we're talking about\nis command line networking tools, well,\n\n86\n00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.650\nif I can't network,\nthen I'm not gonna do a whole lot.\n\n87\n00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.700\nAll right, what good are the tools if\nI can't actually get on the network?\n\n88\n00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.010\nLet's start with setting a static\nIP address on different systems.\n\n89\n00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.100\nAnd we'll look at Linux, and\nwe'll look at Windows as well.\n\n90\n00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.785\nSo let's jump into my Linux machine here,\nI've already got the command line up.\n\n91\n00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:22.170\nIt is looking a little, there we go,\n\n92\n00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.040\nthat'd probably be a little easier to\nsee for you guys, so let's do that.\n\n93\n00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.550\nLet's start with the good old ifconfig.\n\n94\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.366\n[INAUDIBLE] If you've worked in Windows,\nit sounds very similar to the ipconfig,\n\n95\n00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:35.094\nwhich we'll look at in a little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:37.311\nBut right here inside of Linux,\n\n97\n00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:41.262\nthe good old trusty ifconfig\nis what a lot of people know.\n\n98\n00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:45.039\nAnd because it's been around for\na long time, it works very well, and\n\n99\n00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.550\nwe can set an IP address using IP,\nifconfigs.\n\n100\n00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.090\nSo let's do that, the command obviously\nis ifconfig, ifconfig, like so.\n\n101\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.570\nAnd if we do a --help, you can see\na lot of different options available,\n\n102\n00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.490\nit's not too bad.\n\n103\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.810\nIf you do the man ifconfig and\nlook at the menu,\n\n104\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.900\nit's a little bit more lengthy,\nhas a lot of options available to it.\n\n105\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.000\nIt's a very powerful networking tool.\n\n106\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.595\nSo, if you're looking for more advanced\noptions, they are probably in there.\n\n107\n00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:19.880\nYou just gotta kinda trudge through the\nmanual and find what you're looking for.\n\n108\n00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.839\nBut easy stuff like adding an IP address,\nsuper not difficult at all,\n\n109\n00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.950\nso let's take a look at that.\n\n110\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.170\nLet's do ifconfig,\nall you have to do to add an IP address.\n\n111\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.220\nIfconfig and then pick your adapter.\n\n112\n00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220\nWell, what is my adapter?\n\n113\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.237\nWell, if I just hit ifconfig enter,\nI can see that I have two adapters.\n\n114\n00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:41.580\nI've got this one,\nwhich is eth0, ethernet 0.\n\n115\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.110\nSometimes you'll see en0,\nsometimes you'll see Scale.\n\n116\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.160\nMaybe you'll think it's a scsi device,\nor something like that.\n\n117\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.440\nYou'll get different names.\n\n118\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.710\nThat's what you're looking for.\n\n119\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.810\nThis LO is the loopback adapter.\n\n120\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.090\nThat's just basically the software\nversion of a network controller, so\n\n121\n00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.940\nyou can test the networking stack.\n\n122\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.450\nBut this is the actual physical address.\n\n123\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.340\nAnd you can see that, because it actually\nhas, well, it's not showing here, right.\n\n124\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.260\nOr is it?\n\n125\n00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.770\nNo, it's the IPv6 address.\n\n126\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.945\nThere's also a Mac address\nthat goes along with that.\n\n127\n00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:13.051\nAll physical adapters have that.\n\n128\n00:06:13.051 --> 00:06:15.722\nSo, it will be there as well,\nwe can get that up if we need to.\n\n129\n00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:19.879\nBut that's what I'm looking for\nETH zero, ETH one, ETH two, ENO,\n\n130\n00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:23.337\n1699732, you'll see all\nsorts of crazy names.\n\n131\n00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:25.733\nAnd you can do the alias thing and\neverything like that.\n\n132\n00:06:25.733 --> 00:06:30.318\nBut right now, that's what I need to know,\nthat's the information necessary for\n\n133\n00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:34.395\nus to set the IP address for that adapter,\ncuz we're talking specifics.\n\n134\n00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:37.385\nI can't just say, Ifconfig,\nI've got five adapters,\n\n135\n00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:39.450\nwhich adapter do you wanna set this to?\n\n136\n00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.970\n&gt;&gt; You have to tell it which one\nyou're trying to configure with this\n\n137\n00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.820\nparticular command.\n\n138\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we gotta be a little\nspecific when it comes to Linux systems,\n\n139\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.720\nand we'll find that's even true when\nwe get into Windows as well, so.\n\n140\n00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.030\nThat's one of the big steps.\n\n141\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.110\nAlways make sure you get the correct\nadapter that you're trying to work with.\n\n142\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.530\nSo now that we know what it is, we can\nset that IP address for that adapter.\n\n143\n00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.065\nI've already got an IP address,\nand that's fine.\n\n144\n00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:01.877\nIt's a DHCP address.\n\n145\n00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:05.306\nWe'll get into setting DHCP here in\na minute, but I'm gonna change it, and\n\n146\n00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:06.900\nwe're gonna do a static address.\n\n147\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.635\nSo, now I know that it's ETH0,\nso we're gonna go ifconfig.\n\n148\n00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:16.239\n&gt;&gt; And we'll say eth0, and\nthen we just set what IP address we want.\n\n149\n00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:20.473\nRight, so, if I wanted to change this to,\n\n150\n00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:24.728\nwe'll say we'll make it 200, right?\n\n151\n00:07:24.728 --> 00:07:27.387\nSo, 192.168.43.200.\n\n152\n00:07:27.387 --> 00:07:30.894\nJust like that, hit Return\n&gt;&gt; No crazy errors, no nothing,\n\n153\n00:07:30.894 --> 00:07:33.983\nit just goes through, so that lends me\nto believe that everything went fine.\n\n154\n00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:41.438\nIf I do ifconfig again, you'll notice\nthat now my address is set to 200.\n\n155\n00:07:41.438 --> 00:07:44.591\n&gt;&gt; Now, Daniel, I know,\nfrom my networking days,\n\n156\n00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.930\nwe need more than just an IP address.\n\n157\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.940\nSo, when you set that, you didn't\ngive it any additional information.\n\n158\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.847\nWhat happened to the other\nparameters that we wanna set?\n\n159\n00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.041\n&gt;&gt; Great question, and\nMike is absolutely right.\n\n160\n00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.317\nSometimes you're gonna have\nto set more information.\n\n161\n00:07:57.317 --> 00:07:58.454\nWhat I've done here.\n\n162\n00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:00.820\nThis week I said here's an IP address and\n\n163\n00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.023\nthe system knows to say well\nwe've got the classes, so\n\n164\n00:08:04.023 --> 00:08:07.612\nI'm just gonna give it a standard or-\n&gt;&gt; Does it look at that and say okay,\n\n165\n00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.839\nthat was a class C address in the old days\nso I'm gonna use the class C subnet mask?\n\n166\n00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:16.277\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly right, CIDR\nnotation is very prevalent through here.\n\n167\n00:08:16.277 --> 00:08:19.043\nAnd you can use that as well,\nI could have done /24,\n\n168\n00:08:19.043 --> 00:08:21.930\nlike that,\nit would have been fine with that.\n\n169\n00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.570\nI can also say netmask and\nsay here's my network mask.\n\n170\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.750\nIf it's something different\nthan what the CIDR notation, or\n\n171\n00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.860\nthe class that would normally\nhave been this is a class C,\n\n172\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.100\nif I wanted to change to a class B,\nI could do that.\n\n173\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.110\nI could just say here's my netmask\nby setting that parameter.\n\n174\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.810\nLet's take a look at that,\nlet's do that here.\n\n175\n00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.990\nI'm gonna bring up the command.\n\n176\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.020\nWe're just gonna add a little bit\nto the command we previously did.\n\n177\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.196\nWe'll just say, netmask and\nthen say, what is my netmask?\n\n178\n00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:57.300\nSo, if I want it to be 255.255.0.0,\nhit return.\n\n179\n00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.030\nNo barking, no angry, right?\n\n180\n00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.540\nIt's happy, it went through,\nifconfig again, and\n\n181\n00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.842\nnow you'll see my netmask\nhas changed as well.\n\n182\n00:09:05.842 --> 00:09:08.856\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so before, if we look up here,\n\n183\n00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.450\nit was a class C and\nnow I've changed it to a class B.\n\n184\n00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.390\nI'm setting static rules on\nthe adapter itself saying,\n\n185\n00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.270\nthis is what I want it to be.\n\n186\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.250\nWhereas before it was getting it from DHCP\nsaying, this is what you should be for\n\n187\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.210\nthis network.\n\n188\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.370\nObviously, this won't work now because\nwe're on a different network and\n\n189\n00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.780\nthings have gone crazy but we're just\ndoing it for demonstration purposes.\n\n190\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Well and it's great to know\nbecause I know a lot of times on my\n\n191\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.420\ndemos that I set up or\nmy little test network,\n\n192\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.834\nmy sandbox I like to use a 10.address\ncuz it's so much easier to type.\n\n193\n00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:41.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I like to use a class C,\n\n194\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.710\nwhere the first three\nare part of the network ID.\n\n195\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.650\nSo, I can still do that,\nI can just tell it, hey,\n\n196\n00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.020\ndon't make the assumption that because\nit starts with at 10, it's a class A and\n\n197\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.179\nit's 8-bit subnet mask, I can force\nit to use a 24-bit subnet mask.\n\n198\n00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:55.477\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nbecause if I know Mike, and\n\n199\n00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:56.949\nI think I know Mike pretty well,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n200\n00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:58.673\n&gt;&gt; Cuz he's very similar to myself,\n\n201\n00:09:58.673 --> 00:10:02.249\nthis 192.168 something something,\nthat gets a little typey.\n\n202\n00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:02.761\n&gt;&gt; That's way too much.\n\n203\n00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:04.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like 10.0.0.1.\n\n204\n00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a whole lot easier to type.\n\n205\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.813\nBut the system, if I didn't put that\nnetmask information would think,\n\n206\n00:10:10.813 --> 00:10:13.832\nit's a class A, I'll give you a 255.0.0.0.\n\n207\n00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:16.080\nI don't want that, I wanna to shrink down.\n\n208\n00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.975\nI might even be being a little more secure\nand only allowing the amount of nodes\n\n209\n00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:25.641\nthat I have for my network that way no\none can come in and just attach because\n\n210\n00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:30.410\nyou're out of IPs because I've\ncontrolled it using the netmask, right.\n\n211\n00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.651\nSo, setting the netmask very\nsimple obviously as you've seen.\n\n212\n00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:36.899\nThe other one last thing that I wanna\nthrow at you guys is the broadcast\n\n213\n00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:39.709\naddress, you can see it here\nthat's what we got from DHCP.\n\n214\n00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:42.895\nIf we wanted to change\nthat broadcast address,\n\n215\n00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:47.684\nwe could do that well again, just by\nadding a little bit to our command.\n\n216\n00:10:47.684 --> 00:10:52.029\nSo, I'm gonna bring up the old\ncommand again, I'll say netmask, and\n\n217\n00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:56.458\nthen all we gotta do is say broadcast,\nand then whatever the broadcast.\n\n218\n00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:02.980\nSo, if I wanted to change it to\n192.168.what was it, 43, we'll make it.\n\n219\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.530\nAnd you'll notice it's 255.255 here,\nbut we'll make it 1,\n\n220\n00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.030\nwhatever, it doesn't matter.\n\n221\n00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.980\nI can set it to whatever I want really,\nit's not gonna care.\n\n222\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.190\nIt says, well you know what you're doing,\nyou're the net admin around here.\n\n223\n00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.540\nIf that's what you want then\nthat's what you get, buddy.\n\n224\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.370\nAnd [LAUGH] it's kinda funny,\nwe'll let you mess things up.\n\n225\n00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.830\nSo you do have to be sure when you set\nstatic information that it is correct or\n\n226\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.650\nthings are gonna work.\n\n227\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.850\nAnd if you set the static information and\nthings don't work, go back, take a look,\n\n228\n00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.680\nmake sure all your information\nis typed in correctly.\n\n229\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.340\nAnd usually, that's what happens, I put in\nthe wrong netmask on mine, that stinking\n\n230\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.930\nbroadcast address is not that,\nit's .254, I forgot we did that there.\n\n231\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.220\nSo, just be wary that could happen but\nifconfig, pretty straightforward.\n\n232\n00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.380\nWe set an IP address, set a netmask,\nand we set the broadcast address.\n\n233\n00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.840\nThree very important pieces of\ninformation about getting on a network.\n\n234\n00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.520\nAnd if you got all that stuff correct,\n\n235\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.610\nyou should be able to attach to your\nnetwork and things will start working.\n\n236\n00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.580\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n237\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.380\nare there other commands I can use\nto accomplish any of the same thing?\n\n238\n00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.724\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there are.\n\n239\n00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:09.613\nNow, we talked a little bit\nmore about venerable commands,\n\n240\n00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:13.732\nlike ifconfig been around forever but\nwith things like CentOS,\n\n241\n00:12:13.732 --> 00:12:17.180\nright if you install CentOS,\nifconfig is not there.\n\n242\n00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.005\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if you install Red Hat,\n\n243\n00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:22.930\nifconfig is not there and-\n&gt;&gt; Say it isn't so.\n\n244\n00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.760\n&gt;&gt; I know, these heretics have removed it,\nand we say here, I'm joking,\n\n245\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.940\ntugging cheek here, what they're doing\nis they are moving to the newer set of\n\n246\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.440\nnetworking tools that Linux is developing,\nor the Linux community is developing,\n\n247\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.250\nLinux doesn't really develop\nthings other than the kernel.\n\n248\n00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.440\nAnd that is the IP command.\n\n249\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.390\nNow, a lot of times because people\nlove ifconfig, cuz it's been around so\n\n250\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.590\nlong it's hard to teach\nan old dog new tricks.\n\n251\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.810\nMost Linux distros will continue\nto put ifconfig in there.\n\n252\n00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:00.154\nAnd if it does happens, you have CentOS,\nyou've installed the minimal distro,\n\n253\n00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:05.126\nand it's not in there, you can do yum\ninstall net-tools, I believe it is.\n\n254\n00:13:05.126 --> 00:13:08.410\nAnd those net-tools will come back in,\nifconfig be at you're ready and\n\n255\n00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.390\nyou can use that to your hearts content.\n\n256\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.436\nBut if you're like,\n\n257\n00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:15.227\nI'm ready to blaze a path into the future\nIP is there waiting for you, right?\n\n258\n00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:20.250\nSo, IP and it's extremely powerful,\ndoes all the things that ifconfig can do.\n\n259\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.840\nAnd it even might be\na little more intuitive.\n\n260\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.245\n&gt;&gt; Well, I like it already,\nit's six letters shorter.\n\n261\n00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n262\n00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.270\n&gt;&gt; We're all about the economy of typing,\n\n263\n00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.110\nright here, right?\n\n264\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.180\nNot the best typist in the world here\nat IT Pro TV, but we get the job done.\n\n265\n00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.500\nSo, let's take a look at IP and\n\n266\n00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.730\nsee what we gonna do to get\nan IP address going there.\n\n267\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.300\nSo, we jump back down here I\nwill type in ip here we go and\n\n268\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.490\nwe can bore you with the man page again\nbut you guys know that, I won't do that.\n\n269\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.740\nWe'll go straight to the cables and\nthe bits here.\n\n270\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.450\nSo, if I wanna a new address I say,\naddress,\n\n271\n00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.730\nip address that's easy to remember\nan ip address cuz that's what I need.\n\n272\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.320\nAnd then, what you do is you say,\nadd, so I wanna add an address.\n\n273\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.060\nOkay, pretty easy and\nthen, what is that address?\n\n274\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.308\nAgain, we'll just play around for what\nwe got here, I'll make it 201 this time,\n\n275\n00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:12.861\n192.1, actually you know what, Mike and I.\n\n276\n00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:16.230\n&gt;&gt; There we go. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; There we go,\nI make it .2, here we go.\n\n277\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:22.450\nAnd then, remember we have to specify what\nadapter it's gonna be on this is where\n\n278\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.263\nit deviates a bit from the way ifconfig\nright now is easier, at this point.\n\n279\n00:14:27.263 --> 00:14:30.980\nAnd there's a little more typing involved\nas you can see, it's a little lengthier.\n\n280\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.430\nBut it will get better as we go.\n\n281\n00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.404\nSo, type in dev for dev or device, right.\n\n282\n00:14:38.404 --> 00:14:39.830\nAnd what device do we want?\n\n283\n00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.830\nWell, it was eth0.\n\n284\n00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.533\nSo, if I type that in,\nI hit IP address and I do,\n\n285\n00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:48.682\nwell I guess we'll use ifconfig cuz\nthat's what we've learned so far.\n\n286\n00:14:48.682 --> 00:14:53.945\nIfconfig, we'll see that hey,\nit did not change its serial.\n\n287\n00:14:53.945 --> 00:14:55.850\nWell that's interesting,\nI wonder why it didn't do that.\n\n288\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.020\nLet's check this, ip addr.\n\n289\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.450\nAnd so there is the issue.\n\n290\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:09.670\nSo, what I've done is I've actually added\nanother IP address to the same adapter.\n\n291\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.570\nSo, now you start seeing the difference\nin power between ifconfig and ip, right?\n\n292\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.458\nBecause with ifconfig,\nwe just saw the one ifconfig set, right.\n\n293\n00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:23.790\nIt didn't show the rest of it,\nyou might be able to make it do that.\n\n294\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.207\nBut right now out of the gate,\n\n295\n00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:31.860\nif you just do ip addr to look at\nthe information for that adapter.\n\n296\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.890\nAnd I could have stretched\nout into just the,\n\n297\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.058\nonce we get the link adapter here,\nthe local.\n\n298\n00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:41.650\nBut here's eth0 and you'll notice, there's\nour old address that we set before.\n\n299\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.555\nLook at this, there's even\nthe original address that we had.\n\n300\n00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:46.256\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n301\n00:15:46.256 --> 00:15:49.930\n&gt;&gt; And then here's our new address\nright here, which was set there.\n\n302\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.830\nNow, okay there-\n&gt;&gt; You getting [CROSSTALK] I've seen up\n\n303\n00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.923\nall the ideas that's just-\n&gt;&gt; It's getting nuts here right, yeah,\n\n304\n00:15:55.923 --> 00:16:00.630\njust got buck wild Well, the good thing\nis is if we see IP addresses that we know\n\n305\n00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.640\nI set some statics on here.\n\n306\n00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.350\nThey're still lurking around.\n\n307\n00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.910\nI can remove them as well\nwith the delete command.\n\n308\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:12.086\nSo that's, let's take a look at that,\nlet's do that really quickly.\n\n309\n00:16:12.086 --> 00:16:18.246\nSo, all we do is ip addr, and then del.\n\n310\n00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:20.130\nAll right, it is del, it is del.\n\n311\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:25.572\nAnd then whatever the address is you\nwanna remove.this, let's remove that 200.\n\n312\n00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:29.912\n192.168, they're making\nme type here today.\n\n313\n00:16:29.912 --> 00:16:31.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I hate them so much.\n\n314\n00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:36.445\n43.43.200, getting a little.\n\n315\n00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:38.468\n&gt;&gt; Of course.\n\n316\n00:16:38.468 --> 00:16:39.771\nIt gets angry at me, right?\n\n317\n00:16:39.771 --> 00:16:40.848\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n318\n00:16:40.848 --> 00:16:41.593\n&gt;&gt; Because why?\n\n319\n00:16:41.593 --> 00:16:42.580\nI didn't specify which adapter.\n\n320\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.250\nYou've got make sure to do that.\n\n321\n00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.620\nLet me do that now.\n\n322\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.580\nSo, I'll say dev eth0, and\nthat should give me a warning, of course.\n\n323\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.780\nWhat is it hitting me over?\n\n324\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.230\nLet me see here.\n\n325\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.700\nI didn't supply the net mask.\n\n326\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.990\nWhen you're deleting,\nit does want that information.\n\n327\n00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.845\nSo, a good thing is\nit's extremely verbose,\n\n328\n00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:04.813\nit tells me why I'm having a trouble here,\nand you'll notice,\n\n329\n00:17:06.631 --> 00:17:10.630\nAnd actually this is just a warning,\nI'm pretty sure it actually deleted this.\n\n330\n00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.312\nLet's take a look at that ip addr,\nand yeah, it did do it but\n\n331\n00:17:14.312 --> 00:17:17.920\nit warned me, saying hey,\nyou didn't supply a netmask,\n\n332\n00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.997\nso I don't know if this right but\nI'm gonna do it anyway, right?\n\n333\n00:17:21.997 --> 00:17:24.894\nSo, check your information,\nmake sure everything went right.\n\n334\n00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:27.110\nBut it did actually\nfollow through with it.\n\n335\n00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.190\n&gt;&gt; I like that note they put up there,\nthat it was using a wild card with that,\n\n336\n00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.400\nbut that might actually go away soon,\nso don't count on it.\n\n337\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, so don't count on it.\n\n338\n00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.040\nLike I said, they try to keep you\ninformed about what's going on, so\n\n339\n00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.760\nyou get a warning,\n\n340\n00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.230\nread it because it's got information\nin there that's gonna be good for you.\n\n341\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.244\nBut, as we've seen, it's not that\ndifficult to add an IP address or\n\n342\n00:17:49.244 --> 00:17:51.496\ndelete an IP address using IP.\n\n343\n00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:53.263\nYou just gotta learn the syntaxes and\n\n344\n00:17:53.263 --> 00:17:55.486\nif you're a ifconfig guy\nfrom back in the day,\n\n345\n00:17:55.486 --> 00:17:59.250\nit's probably gonna take you a little bit\nbut you just gotta continue to do it.\n\n346\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.990\nIf you do it a few times, then you'll get\nit underneath your fingertips there and\n\n347\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.090\nit should be a little easier.\n\n348\n00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.208\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel so\n\n349\n00:18:06.208 --> 00:18:10.373\nyou shown us a couple of really neat ways\nto do it through in a Linux environment,\n\n350\n00:18:10.373 --> 00:18:13.750\nwe can use ifconfig the old school\nway depending on your distro.\n\n351\n00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.700\nYou've got IP now available,\nmight or might not have ifconfig.\n\n352\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.530\nWhat about the Windows world?\n\n353\n00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.260\nWhat about trying to do this?\n\n354\n00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.160\nIn Windows,\nI'm sure we can do the same thing?\n\n355\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.356\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we definitely can, and\nyou don't have to be a PowerShell,\n\n356\n00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:29.336\nI'm not gonna dive into\nthe PowerShell really, right now.\n\n357\n00:18:29.336 --> 00:18:31.684\nWe're gonna stick with\nold command-line stuff,\n\n358\n00:18:31.684 --> 00:18:35.460\ncuz most people probably are still pretty\nfamiliar with some command line stuff.\n\n359\n00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.980\nYou might not be good to go on PowerShell.\n\n360\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.620\nWe'll throw PowerShell on\nthe heap as we continue on later.\n\n361\n00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.130\nJust not in this episode, right?\n\n362\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.490\nSo, we're going to go back to\nthe old netsh commands, and\n\n363\n00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:55.590\nyes, people forget netsh is still lurking\nunder the hood of their Windows systems.\n\n364\n00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.080\nAnd it's extremely powerful,\nit gives you a lot of functionality for\n\n365\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.770\ncontrolling your system,\nso, here is no deference.\n\n366\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:08.490\nWe can use netsh to statistically\nset an IP address into our systems,\n\n367\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.162\nit is kind of convoluted.\n\n368\n00:19:11.162 --> 00:19:13.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You do have to know a little bit.\n\n369\n00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.662\nYou've gotta spend some\ntime on the help pages.\n\n370\n00:19:15.662 --> 00:19:17.924\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nice politically correct way to state\n\n371\n00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:18.476\nthat, Daniel.\n\n372\n00:19:18.476 --> 00:19:20.740\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I try to stay PC when it comes to,\n\n373\n00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.840\nwell, I don't wanna offend anyone.\n\n374\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.297\n&gt;&gt; That's not what I would say,\nbut I never say\n\n375\n00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:26.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah netsh is a bear right?\n\n376\n00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.330\nThis is probably why\nmost people don't use it.\n\n377\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.420\n&gt;&gt; It's extremely powerful but\nit's got a lot of syntax to learn.\n\n378\n00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.710\n&gt;&gt; It does,\nit's got a lot of syntax to learn.\n\n379\n00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.400\nWe don't get the lovely tab auto\ncomplete like we do with PowerShell.\n\n380\n00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.403\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And PowerShell can\n\n381\n00:19:39.403 --> 00:19:41.910\ndo all the things that netsh\ncan do if I'm not mistaken.\n\n382\n00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.490\nAt least most of them, a lot of them.\n\n383\n00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.320\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, if not everything.\n\n384\n00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.500\nSo, people are tend to\nmigrating to PowerShell.\n\n385\n00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.360\nBut if you're stuck with\na little older system,\n\n386\n00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.900\nmaybe it doesn't have\nthe PowerShell commands built in,\n\n387\n00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.090\nit hasn't been updated for whatever\nreason, you can go, well, you know what?\n\n388\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.760\nI can go throw netsh at this and\nget it up and running.\n\n389\n00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.620\nIt's a great thing to tack\nto a cork board and say,\n\n390\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.480\nhere's my netsh commands\nthat I need to remember.\n\n391\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.910\nIf I ever need to set an IP address,\nboom I can do that.\n\n392\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.990\nThis show is basically trying to be\na reference guide for you people.\n\n393\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.668\nSo, that you can go, yeah I remember\nat ITProTV they talked about setting IP\n\n394\n00:20:12.668 --> 00:20:16.038\naddress in Windows using like netsh,\nso let me look that up real quick.\n\n395\n00:20:16.038 --> 00:20:19.278\nAnd you put that down, it's a little\none-liner and you're off to the races.\n\n396\n00:20:19.278 --> 00:20:21.010\nSo, let's take a look at that.\n\n397\n00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.660\nJump down on my machine here,\nI've got my Windows machine up and ready,\n\n398\n00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.040\ngot the command prompt open.\n\n399\n00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.970\nI am open as an administrator.\n\n400\n00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.730\nI'm not sure if that's absolutely,\npositively necessary.\n\n401\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.870\nBut I'm pretty sure it is,\nbecause we are setting IP information.\n\n402\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.450\nSo, you probably wanna do that.\n\n403\n00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.652\nAnd hey and what the heck, so\nI just open up all command prompts and\n\n404\n00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:36.909\n[LAUGH] administrative privileges.\n\n405\n00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:38.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you got the rights, use them.\n\n406\n00:20:38.885 --> 00:20:39.870\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you got the rights,\n\n407\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.710\nyou've got the power wheel there, right?\n\n408\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.320\nThat's always a good time.\n\n409\n00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.750\nSo, I'll zoom into here a little bit so\nwe can see this a little better.\n\n410\n00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.050\nCome on there computer,\ncomputer, there we go.\n\n411\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.230\nAll right, so\nhow do we get netsh to set an IP address?\n\n412\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.720\nGlad you asked, it is a one-liner.\n\n413\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.570\nIt's not like,\nkind of like what we did before.\n\n414\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.220\nBut you gotta know some\nspecific information.\n\n415\n00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.270\nOne piece of good information you need to\nknow, just like what we did with Linux,\n\n416\n00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.600\nyou gotta know the name\nof the network adapter.\n\n417\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.030\nAnd, Windows names its network\nadapter differently than Linux does.\n\n418\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.440\nObviously, they're two different systems.\n\n419\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.320\nBut they tend to name them things\nlike local area connection, and\n\n420\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.620\nlocal area connection 2.\n\n421\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.470\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times, a lot of that,\nif I can get that out,\n\n422\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.950\ndepends on the version you're running,\nas well.\n\n423\n00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.401\nCuz it seems like through Vista,\nWindows 8.\n\n424\n00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:32.755\nSomeone say ethernet?\n\n425\n00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:36.500\n&gt;&gt; Ethernet, ethernet one, or\nlocal area connection, or just eth.\n\n426\n00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.490\n&gt;&gt; I mean it's, yeah.\n\n427\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.930\n&gt;&gt; It gets a little crazy, and\nthere is a netsh command to find it.\n\n428\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.765\nI think the easiest way to do\nit though is just do ipconfig.\n\n429\n00:21:44.765 --> 00:21:45.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n430\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.210\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthen you'll see that, here it is,\n\n431\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.930\nethernet adaptor, local area connection.\n\n432\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.620\nThat is the name of\nthe local area connection.\n\n433\n00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.470\nSee if I can remember the name of netsh,\nit's netsh Interface, right, and\n\n434\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:05.510\nthen show interface, I want to say.\n\n435\n00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.810\nI don't remember,\nit's something like that.\n\n436\n00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.770\nBut if, or I'm sorry, ifconfig, ipconfig,\nobviously, it shows it to you and\n\n437\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.470\nthat's a whole lot easier.\n\n438\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.990\nThat's a command you should have\na good command of anyway, ipconfig.\n\n439\n00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.820\nSomething you'll use a lot as Network\ntroubleshooting in a Windows environment,\n\n440\n00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:25.850\nso just know IP Config, and that it\ndoes show you the name of the adapter,\n\n441\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:27.680\nwhich is local area connection.\n\n442\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.600\nYou need to know that.\nSpaces and all, you don't have to put\n\n443\n00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.441\nin special characters for the spaces,\nwe're gonna put quotations around it, so\n\n444\n00:22:33.441 --> 00:22:36.630\nthat it knows that that is\na single entity, a single string.\n\n445\n00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.180\nSo, don't worry about the spaces on that.\n\n446\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.530\nSo, let's do it,\nlet's throw a netsh at it here.\n\n447\n00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.090\nAnd all you gotta do is netsh, and\nthen we're gonna do interface, IPv4,\n\n448\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.310\ncuz that's our IPv4 interface.\n\n449\n00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:54.350\nIf you wanna do IPv6 you can do that,\nbut we're sticking with IPv4 today.\n\n450\n00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:58.471\nAnd then we're going to set address and\nthis is where it gets weird,\n\n451\n00:22:58.471 --> 00:23:02.809\nyou would think the next thing would\nbe what the address is, but is not,\n\n452\n00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:06.953\nit's the actual adapter name,\nthis where we put the adapter name.\n\n453\n00:23:06.953 --> 00:23:07.563\nI don't know why they do this,\nI don't know.\n\n454\n00:23:07.563 --> 00:23:08.302\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n455\n00:23:08.302 --> 00:23:11.086\nmaybe you can swap it around, but I know\nthis works cuz this is how I learned it.\n\n456\n00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:17.652\nSo, I say name equals, and\nhere comes my double quotes and\n\n457\n00:23:17.652 --> 00:23:21.819\nthat will be Local area, can I do it?\n\n458\n00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:23.407\nConnection, all right?\n\n459\n00:23:23.407 --> 00:23:23.990\nAnd then end double quote.\n\n460\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.675\nDon't forget to end your quotes,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n461\n00:23:25.675 --> 00:23:28.070\nIt's gonna go, what is this big\nlong string you've given me?\n\n462\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.600\nYou gotta end your quotes there.\n\n463\n00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.010\nSo, and after that,\nwe say this is a static.\n\n464\n00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:38.240\nOkay static like so, and then,\nwe give it the IP address.\n\n465\n00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.119\nSo, the IP here we'll say, we'll go\ncrazy we'll do the 10s again 10.0.0.\n\n466\n00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:47.342\nWe'll say 20, like that.\n\n467\n00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:54.111\nWe can also add things to it like\nthe net mask, and the gateway.\n\n468\n00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:57.501\nAnd I, we'll get into that, it's like how\ncome you didn't talk about gateway with\n\n469\n00:23:57.501 --> 00:24:00.439\nLinux is we're gonna get to that,\nit's actually a different command.\n\n470\n00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.270\nSo just kinda keeping things together,\nwe'll get to that in just a second.\n\n471\n00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.420\nOr at least probably in another episode\nnow that I'm looking at the clock here.\n\n472\n00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.140\nBut we can add that here, net sh.\n\n473\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:14.360\nAnd you need that stuff so we're gonna\ngo ahead and show you that using net sh.\n\n474\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.360\nSo for that we just need the,\nwe got the IP address,\n\n475\n00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.760\nwe need the subnet mask which here\nwe'll make it a class C, 255.255.255.0,\n\n476\n00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.690\nand then whatever the gateway is.\n\n477\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.397\nAnd I don't remember if I need to\ntype in gateway or not, we'll see.\n\n478\n00:24:31.397 --> 00:24:33.181\nWe'll either get in there or we don't.\n\n479\n00:24:33.181 --> 00:24:39.120\nAnd the gateway, we'll make it 10.0.0.254,\nsomething like that.\n\n480\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.450\nThere we go, no barking no angry.\n\n481\n00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.160\n&gt;&gt; It's always good.\n\n482\n00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.680\n&gt;&gt; That's always a pleasurable\nthing to see from your system.\n\n483\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.940\nAnd now if I do ipconfig,\nif I can type ipconfig, like we said,\n\n484\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.530\nwe're horrible typists around here.\n\n485\n00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.110\nHere is my IP address, it has changed.\n\n486\n00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.580\nAnd there's my class C and look there's\nmy default gateway has been set.\n\n487\n00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.490\nI've statically set that\nstuff using Net SH.\n\n488\n00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.270\nAgain it is a little convoluted\nwhen it comes to the syntaxens.\n\n489\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.830\nThat's not a real word.\n\n490\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.629\nThe syntax of Net SH.\n\n491\n00:25:08.629 --> 00:25:12.285\nBut if you play with it a little bit and\nyou start to get it under your fingers or\n\n492\n00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:15.027\nwrite it out on a index card and\npop in in your cork board and\n\n493\n00:25:15.027 --> 00:25:16.254\ntape it to your monitor.\n\n494\n00:25:16.254 --> 00:25:20.801\nAnd go, Net SH will work perfectly here,\nwell now you have that available to you.\n\n495\n00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:23.190\nAnd that's what I am trying to do for\nyou guys today.\n\n496\n00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.310\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic Daniel.\n\n497\n00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.820\nWe saw a few different ways that\nwe can work with our TCP IP\n\n498\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.220\nconfiguration information, right?\n\n499\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.820\nWe know that to communicate on a TCPIP\nnetwork we need certain bits of\n\n500\n00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.240\ninformation and\nunfortunately the GUI, fortunately or\n\n501\n00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.740\nunfortunately, the GUI\nis not always available.\n\n502\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.100\nEspecially in today's environments\nwe see for security reasons, for\n\n503\n00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.765\nperformance reasons,\na lot of these, as Daniel put,\n\n504\n00:25:45.765 --> 00:25:50.680\nheadless systems where we\ndon't have that GUI like nano.\n\n505\n00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.670\nOr we've chosen to strip the GUI out\nto save on installation size and\n\n506\n00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.800\nsecurity like on Server Core.\n\n507\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.920\nA lot of our Linux distros, we install\nthem without the Graphical User Interface,\n\n508\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.210\nwe just have that terminal window but\n\n509\n00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.796\nwe still need to be able to\nconfigure the TCP/IP information.\n\n510\n00:26:06.796 --> 00:26:10.540\nIf we want it to communicate on\nthe network with other machines which is\n\n511\n00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.300\nreally the point of running a system.\n\n512\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.250\nIt doesn't do much good\nisolated on its own.\n\n513\n00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:15.890\nSo Daniel, we thank you for that.\n\n514\n00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.535\nWe saw in Linux we used the if config,\nwe got the newer command, ip.\n\n515\n00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:24.080\nIn our Windows world we took\na look at good old NETSH and\n\n516\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.120\nall of its wonderful quirkiness.\n\n517\n00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.060\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n518\n00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.420\nAnything else you want to add\nbefore we wrap this one up?\n\n519\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I kind of ran out of time here.\n\n520\n00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.910\nBut we've looked at static, but\nnow we need to look at DHCP.\n\n521\n00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:36.530\nHow do I get DHCP working?\n\n522\n00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.835\nWhich is the more typical way to do that?\n\n523\n00:26:37.835 --> 00:26:42.073\nSo we'll have to do a part two on\nsetting DHCP through a command line or\n\n524\n00:26:42.073 --> 00:26:43.326\na terminal window.\n\n525\n00:26:43.326 --> 00:26:45.040\nSo I'll look forward to doing that.\n\n526\n00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.750\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\nwe'll have you back for that one.\n\n527\n00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.084\nIn the meantime, hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n528\n00:26:50.084 --> 00:26:53.426\nSigning off for IT ProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n529\n00:26:53.426 --> 00:26:54.228\n&gt;&gt;

ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:20.054\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our command line networking\n\n7\n00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:25.090\ntools and specifically, we're looking at\nhow we can set our TCP IP information.\n\n8\n00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.100\nNow this is actually a part two, we've\nalready done one part where we looked at\n\n9\n00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.070\ncommands like ifconfig, ip, and\nNet SH in our Windows environment.\n\n10\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.380\nAnd we set a lot of the important\ninformation, the IP address,\n\n11\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.900\nthe subnet mask.\n\n12\n00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.710\nBut there's other information that we need\nto set if we wanna be able to communicate\n\n13\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.320\nsay beyond our local subnet and\nresolve names.\n\n14\n00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.004\nAnd so, here to show us the commands and\nhow we can round out setting our\n\n15\n00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.207\nTCIP information via the command line\nis none other than, Mr. Daniel Lowrie.\n\n16\n00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:52.960\nHow you doing, Daniel?\n\n17\n00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.748\n&gt;&gt; Wow,\nI'm feeling honored to be here today.\n\n18\n00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; None other than me, right?\n\n19\n00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.126\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n20\n00:00:58.126 --> 00:00:59.069\n&gt;&gt; But he's exactly right.\n\n21\n00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.765\nWe are continuing on, looking at using\nthe command line to set IP information.\n\n22\n00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.370\nCuz well, once in a while that will be\na handy skill to have in the tool belt.\n\n23\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.420\nSo we wanna make sure you guys\nare well-rounded systems and\n\n24\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.825\nnetwork administrators.\n\n25\n00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:16.867\nSo that being said,\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I'm already well-rounded.\n\n26\n00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:17.975\n&gt;&gt; You're very well-rounded.\n\n27\n00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:18.739\nRound is a shape, right?\n\n28\n00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:19.552\nI'm in shape, I'm round.\n\n29\n00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:21.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That being said,\n\n30\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.395\nwe talked about setting\nstatic IP information.\n\n31\n00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:30.045\nIn Linux, we even set broadcast address,\nset subnet masks.\n\n32\n00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:33.200\nWe've looked at doing that\nwith NSH instead of Windows.\n\n33\n00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.162\nThat's is a static information, all right.\n\n34\n00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.484\nI know, I want this IP address to be this.\n\n35\n00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:39.426\nI want this net pass to be this.\n\n36\n00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:43.454\nI want this broadcast address to be this,\nand even in,\n\n37\n00:01:43.454 --> 00:01:47.762\nI think in Windows we even\ntalked about setting a gateway.\n\n38\n00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:50.080\nI don't remember if we did it or not.\n\n39\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.250\nBut, that's all static,\nI wanted it to be that.\n\n40\n00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.470\nBut typically,\nthat's not what we're doing, right?\n\n41\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.860\nTypically I turn on my computer and\n\n42\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.942\nit should get IP information via DHCP\nbecause that makes our lives nice, right?\n\n43\n00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:04.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it does.\n\n44\n00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.930\n&gt;&gt; We're not in the corner with\na bottle of bourbon going,\n\n45\n00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.312\nI gotta go set another IP address,\ntake a swig, and sneak or\n\n46\n00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:14.010\nnet over to whoever's computer and\nset up their information.\n\n47\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.960\nAnd then have to worry\nabout dealing with that.\n\n48\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.728\nAdministratively, it's a nightmare.\n\n49\n00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:21.660\nTypically, static IPs are only\ninvolved on very specific devices,\n\n50\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.948\nvery specific nodes on your network\nbecause we don't want them to change.\n\n51\n00:02:25.948 --> 00:02:29.710\nEverybody else, it doesn't really matter\nif their IP address changes or not, right?\n\n52\n00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.090\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Bob brings in his laptop and\nsits down at his cubicle,\n\n53\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.265\nI don't care what IP address he has,\nas long as it's valid on the network,\n\n54\n00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:40.350\nit's not duplicated, and\neverything's working.\n\n55\n00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.860\nWe're good to go.\n\n56\n00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.700\nI've rarely connected his\nmachine via IP address.\n\n57\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.378\n&gt;&gt; Amen, brother and preach it,\ncuz that's exactly right.\n\n58\n00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:47.830\nWe don't wanna be bogged down,\n\n59\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.350\nrunning around trying to get everybody's\nIP information squared away.\n\n60\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.850\nWe want to automate that process and\nthat's where DHZ comes in.\n\n61\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.430\nTypically, we run this to the GUI.\n\n62\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.990\nAgain, it's got this little area,\nhit the checkbox, obtain address\n\n63\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.410\nautomatically of your Linux, it has\nit's own management system somewhere and\n\n64\n00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.360\nthe graphical form if running that.\n\n65\n00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.910\nAnd you click via DHCP and\nyou're off the race and\n\n66\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.980\nall the information get's piped to you.\n\n67\n00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.910\nIP address subnet mask,\nbroadcast, DNS, default gateway,\n\n68\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.170\nall that gets rapped up in a little\nbowl and hand delivered to you.\n\n69\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.340\nBut, what if I'm on a headless server?\n\n70\n00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.950\nFor some reason,\nthe GUI has crashed on me.\n\n71\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.770\nI can't use that.\n\n72\n00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.490\nBut I can login through a terminal.\n\n73\n00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.080\nHow do I, maybe refresh that information?\n\n74\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.720\nWhat if I need to drop an IP address and\nregather.\n\n75\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.890\nMaybe the lease is bad or I'm having\ntrouble and I'm troubleshooting.\n\n76\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.370\nAnd I wanna go from static to DHCP and\n\n77\n00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.040\nthen back just to see if\nthings are working, right?\n\n78\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.130\nThis is where this comes in handy.\n\n79\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.370\nSo we gotta be able to not just do static,\nwe need to be able to do DHCP as well.\n\n80\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.020\nAnd the good thing is it's\nas simple as it was before.\n\n81\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.910\nWe're just saying do DHDP instead\nof here's what the information is.\n\n82\n00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.090\nLet's take a look at that.\n\n83\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.760\nLet's start, I'm already in Windows,\nso let's start back in Windows here.\n\n84\n00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.010\nAnd I'll try to zoom this in.\n\n85\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.560\nHello mouse, you crazy little nut, you.\n\n86\n00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.340\nLet's go over here so\nthe good people can see you.\n\n87\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.950\nAll right, so\nhere's our command prompt back up,\n\n88\n00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.260\nlogged in administratively\nto this command prompt.\n\n89\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.280\nDon't forget to do run as admin,\nall right?\n\n90\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.370\nSo, we're gonna do good old\nfashioned ipconfig, right?\n\n91\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.320\nAnd we know it, we love it.\n\n92\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.120\nIf you don't, that's great,\nno one's born with this knowledge.\n\n93\n00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.690\nYou gotta learn it, this might be\nyour first introduction to iponfig.\n\n94\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.173\nBut we saw it before,\nif I just do ipconfig.\n\n95\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.280\nIP config like that.\n\n96\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.770\nIt gives me some information\nabout my adapters,\n\n97\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.580\nabout my network that\nmy computer is doing.\n\n98\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.475\nWe've got my local area connection.\n\n99\n00:04:42.475 --> 00:04:43.820\nAnd there's my IP address,\n\n100\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.780\nthere's the funny one that we set\nbefore doing the static stuff.\n\n101\n00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.718\nBut I'm done playing around with static.\n\n102\n00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:51.041\nI wanna go back to DHCP.\n\n103\n00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.004\nWhat can I do?\n\n104\n00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:57.540\nWell, one thing you can do is release and\nrenew the IP address, right?\n\n105\n00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.620\nSo I wanna release this information,\nI don't want it any Anymore.\n\n106\n00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.540\nAnd hopefully this will work,\n\n107\n00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.130\nI might have to actually,\ncuz I didn't test this beforehand.\n\n108\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.530\nBut I'm hoping it will, just do ipconfig.\n\n109\n00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.780\nThis will work if you are on DHCP.\n\n110\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.394\nIf there's DHCP available, this should\nwork for you, if you're running DHCP.\n\n111\n00:05:13.394 --> 00:05:16.910\nipconfig /release like that.\n\n112\n00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.570\nHit Enter and it should just say, all that\nIP information, I'm done with it, goodbye.\n\n113\n00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.410\nIt's over.\nIf I do ipconfig again to check my config,\n\n114\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.140\nyeah, so the static stuff is still there.\n\n115\n00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.650\nI'd have to go in and remove that.\n\n116\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.460\nI can show you how to do that.\n\n117\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.710\nWe'll do that here with Netsh, cuz I use\nNetsh to set the static information.\n\n118\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.620\nNow I need to use Netsh\nagain to go back to a DHCP.\n\n119\n00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.970\nSo let's jump to it.\n\n120\n00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.380\nBut if you're running DHCP, release and\n\n121\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.600\nthen if I wanted to do I would\ndo ipconfig /renew like that.\n\n122\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.480\nAnd it would gather,\nI wonder if it'll actually work.\n\n123\n00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.940\nNo.\n\n124\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.050\nWe'll just see.\nNo, it didn't work.\n\n125\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.920\nIt was worth a shot.\n\n126\n00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.030\nAnyway, so let's use netsh.\n\n127\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.520\nBut those are the two main commands.\n\n128\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.658\nYou're on a DHCP network.\n\n129\n00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:11.620\nipconfig/release, then ipconfig/renew\nshould get you a new IP address.\n\n130\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.315\nYou might get the same IP address\nthat you released before.\n\n131\n00:06:14.315 --> 00:06:15.120\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because,\n\n132\n00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.200\nwell, now it's in the pool, right?\n\n133\n00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.120\nCuz you released it and it's in.\n\n134\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.127\nPlus I think there is that Windows does\nsomething where you have preferencing,\n\n135\n00:06:24.127 --> 00:06:24.810\n&gt;&gt; Sort of yeah.\n\n136\n00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.972\n&gt;&gt; You've had this IP address and\n\n137\n00:06:25.972 --> 00:06:28.259\nit's available,\nmight as well give it back to you, right?\n\n138\n00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.827\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why you gave it up,\ndummy, but here it is again.\n\n139\n00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:31.359\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n140\n00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.432\nHey they're looking out for you.\n\n141\n00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:35.860\nIt's kind of like,\nwell if I wanted that, Doesn't matter,\n\n142\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.620\nyou end up getting that a lot.\n\n143\n00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.315\nBut let's use netsh, and get back to DHCP,\nso that's really the more meat and\n\n144\n00:06:42.315 --> 00:06:43.326\npotatoes here.\n\n145\n00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:45.800\nCuz we use netsh to get into this pickle.\n\n146\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.260\nLet's use netsh to get back out of it.\n\n147\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.220\nSo what do we do?\n\n148\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.330\nWe say netsh, so very similar\nactually to what we did before.\n\n149\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.280\nNetsh interface phase and then IPv4.\n\n150\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.980\nJust remember we are doing an IPv4 here.\n\n151\n00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.450\nAnd we're gonna say set address,\nall right.\n\n152\n00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.040\nI remember all this stuff\nfrom my previous episode.\n\n153\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.160\nAgain, we need the adapter name, right?\n\n154\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:15.070\nSo, name=localareaconnection and\n\n155\n00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.780\nthen connection,\ndon't forget to close your quotes.\n\n156\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.520\nAnd then we just say DHCP.\n\n157\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.210\nRight, so space that DHCP and enter.\n\n158\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.750\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Again everything's working fine.\n\n159\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.658\nWe didn't get any warnings or\nerrors or anything, it's a good sign.\n\n160\n00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.410\nI do ipconfig and\n\n161\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.010\nyou'll notice now I have an actual\nDHCP address and it was easy right on.\n\n162\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.810\nBasically took mine and netsh commander\ngot me into this static stuff and\n\n163\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.420\njust truncate it and it was static,\now I'm sorry DCP or back a disk.\n\n164\n00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.618\n&gt;&gt; So you say that was real domain\ndifference there was in the previous,\n\n165\n00:07:48.618 --> 00:07:51.099\nwe said static, and\nonce we put words static, well,\n\n166\n00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.601\nnow we've gotta provide\nall the other information.\n\n167\n00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.317\nCuz you're saying,\nI'm gonna give you what I want you to use.\n\n168\n00:07:57.317 --> 00:08:00.335\nChange the word static to DHCP And\nthere's no more command,\n\n169\n00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:03.484\nbecause now you're saying hey\nyou go get your IP information.\n\n170\n00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.004\nI'm not gonna tell you what to use, so\nthe command is actually a lot easier,\n\n171\n00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.510\njust replace static with DHCP,\nand you're done.\n\n172\n00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.380\nAs long as DHCP is\nrunning on your network.\n\n173\n00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.020\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly right.\n\n174\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.670\nSo, Mike hit the nail on the head.\n\n175\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:20.160\nSince DHCP is handling that information\nfor you, there's no reason to have\n\n176\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.769\nany other information after that because\nthat's DHCP is providing it for you.\n\n177\n00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:26.290\nI just want DHCP and I'm back.\n\n178\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.770\nNow, our ipconfig release and\nrenew should work as well.\n\n179\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.840\nI should be able to throw that at\nthe sync here, ipconfig/release,\n\n180\n00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.850\nand you'll notice now\nLocal Area Connection has nothing, right?\n\n181\n00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.570\nThere's nothing there, there's no\ndefault gateway, nothing to see.\n\n182\n00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:49.840\nBut if I do ipconfig Config/renew\nthen I should get that information.\n\n183\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.560\nIt's taking a minute.\n\n184\n00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.040\nUsually it takes so because it's got\nto go through the door process, and\n\n185\n00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.850\nthen once that's done,\nyes we're back in action.\n\n186\n00:08:57.885 --> 00:09:00.695\nAnd we should be on a network,\nshould be able to ping things there.\n\n187\n00:09:00.695 --> 00:09:05.425\nI'm now connected to that network\nDHCP handling the information for me.\n\n188\n00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:07.170\nSo pretty straight forward, very easy,\n\n189\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.115\nsee if there's anything else I wanted\nto talk about when it came to this.\n\n190\n00:09:12.115 --> 00:09:15.345\nI think for\nright now that's the bare bones, right?\n\n191\n00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:21.394\nThat should get you rocking and rolling as\nfar as, if you do ipconfig/all like that,\n\n192\n00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:27.870\nit should give you more information,\nand let's looks for our adapter.\n\n193\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.430\nThere it is, local ethernet adapter, and\nthere's our DHCP server information,\n\n194\n00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.620\nit doesn't have a default gateway, and\n\n195\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.970\nthat's probably because we set\nthat stuff to static, right?\n\n196\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.140\nSo I would have to use Net SH as well, to-\n&gt;&gt; Now you can pass the buck to the DHCP\n\n197\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.810\nadmins, and say hey, how come I'm not\ngetting a default gateway, right?\n\n198\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.360\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because all I did was change it to\n\n199\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.390\nDHCP, now it should take\ncare of everything else.\n\n200\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.715\n&gt;&gt; You know, you would like to\nthink that that is the case.\n\n201\n00:09:51.715 --> 00:09:52.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And,\n\n202\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.354\nbecause it's fun to pass the buck, but\nit's because if you look at Windows,\n\n203\n00:09:56.354 --> 00:09:58.330\nright if you go into\nthe graphical environment.\n\n204\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.040\nLet's take a look at that actually,\nyou zoom out here.\n\n205\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.620\nIf we go into the control panel,\nand I'm running Windows 7 Pro, but\n\n206\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.550\nthis could be 8, or whatever.\n\n207\n00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.984\nJust go into your control panel,\nfind your network area, and\n\n208\n00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:13.082\ngo into the adapter settings, and\nyou'll notice if you right-click and\n\n209\n00:10:13.082 --> 00:10:17.132\ngo to Properties, you look at IPv4,\nthis is what we're working with.\n\n210\n00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:21.810\nYou'll notice that, well even though\nthis is saying, well, that's DNS stuff.\n\n211\n00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.380\nIt doesn't have the gateway stuff in here,\nall right?\n\n212\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.760\nThat's the important thing,\nthat's what we're not getting.\n\n213\n00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.684\nYes, Mike would be able to say,\nwhere's my DNS information there, Mr.\n\n214\n00:10:30.684 --> 00:10:33.088\nDHCP guy,\nthe guy that runs the DHCP server,\n\n215\n00:10:33.088 --> 00:10:36.601\nwhich is typically yourself if\nyou're doing this kind of thing.\n\n216\n00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:37.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:10:37.641 --> 00:10:38.725\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And then, I turn around and\n\n218\n00:10:38.725 --> 00:10:41.303\ntalk to myself and say, well silly me I\nforgot to set the DHCP default gateway.\n\n219\n00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:41.910\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Exactly,\n\n220\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.950\nyou point the finger right this way and\ngo, you dirty rascal.\n\n221\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.780\nBut you'll notice that\nthe gateway information,\n\n222\n00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.360\nmaybe it's in the the advance stuff,\nI don't remember.\n\n223\n00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.910\nIt's been a while since I've worked with,\nyeah, there's gateway.\n\n224\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.510\nSo it's not in there, he could set that\nand then that would be a part of it.\n\n225\n00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.345\nBut it's not set from my DHCP server,\nI have to do that.\n\n226\n00:11:00.345 --> 00:11:00.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n227\n00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.280\nsometimes if you set\nstatic things like DNS,\n\n228\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.090\njust because you go back to DHCP doesn't\nnecessarily mean it clears that out.\n\n229\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So be wary of that, just be that\n\n230\n00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.330\nmight not happen and you'd have to use\nhard commands to change that information.\n\n231\n00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.103\nSo again you should be the person setting\nthat stuff so you would know that info.\n\n232\n00:11:21.103 --> 00:11:24.660\n&gt;&gt; All right so we see we can use\nDHCP in a Windows environment,\n\n233\n00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.580\nwe can do it from command line with our\nnetsh commands, we can set that DHCP.\n\n234\n00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.040\nWhat about in the Linux world?\n\n235\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.400\nI'm pretty sure that we can use DHCP\nin a Linux environment as well.\n\n236\n00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.510\n&gt;&gt; The reports that you can't use DHCP\nin Linux are highly overestimated.\n\n237\n00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.070\nThey're not true, they're unfounded.\n\n238\n00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.330\n&gt;&gt; And I have heard that,\n\n239\n00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.830\nI think it's more about people\njust don't know how to do it.\n\n240\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.470\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's typically what it is.\n\n241\n00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.580\nTypically, if you're new to the Linux\nenvironment, it's setup to run DHCP,\n\n242\n00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.360\nzang, right,\nwe like that because DHCP is easy.\n\n243\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.055\nBut what happens if you're playing around\nand you're like, I'm gonna become a Linux\n\n244\n00:12:00.055 --> 00:12:02.550\nadmin, and I'm gonna play around\nwith the networking side of things.\n\n245\n00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.670\nYou set a static, now I want to\ngo back to DHCP, what do I do?\n\n246\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.550\nAnd that's kind of what we've done, right?\n\n247\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.390\nWe set a static IP,\nnow I want DHCP to handle this.\n\n248\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.700\nSo what will we do?\n\n249\n00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.470\nWell, we got our all good commands.\n\n250\n00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.210\nRemember we got Ifconfig, and\nwe also have another one that I wanna\n\n251\n00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.580\nintroduce called DH client, and\nthis is typically what you're gonna go to.\n\n252\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.653\nWhereas in the Windows world you continue\nto use IP Config/release and renew,\n\n253\n00:12:28.653 --> 00:12:32.117\nyou just add the release and\nrenew to release your IP information and\n\n254\n00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:34.420\nthen renew your IP information.\n\n255\n00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.240\nHere we use dhclient to do that.\n\n256\n00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.878\nAnd it's pretty simple,\njust about as simple as ipconfig was.\n\n257\n00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:45.909\nSo let's take a look at that,\nI got my Linux box back up,\n\n258\n00:12:45.909 --> 00:12:49.869\nand if you just type in dhclient like so,\nand\n\n259\n00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:53.638\nyou add a -r I think it stands for reload.\n\n260\n00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:57.979\nI dont wanna say like renew or\nwhatever, I think it's a Reload, But\n\n261\n00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:00.348\nit will drop your DHCP Information.\n\n262\n00:13:00.348 --> 00:13:03.681\nBut again, you got to tell it\nwhich adapter to drop down,\n\n263\n00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:06.956\nalso you have to give it\nan adapter which I think is zero.\n\n264\n00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:11.927\nHere, so I hit return and it says\nthat the SMBD service is not active,\n\n265\n00:13:11.927 --> 00:13:15.420\ncannot reload it did fail, let's see here.\n\n266\n00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.890\nifconfig, I wonder why it did that.\n\n267\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.790\n&gt;&gt; Are we static?\n&gt;&gt; It's probably because I don't\n\n268\n00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.706\nhave anything to, to drop [LAUGH].\n\n269\n00:13:21.706 --> 00:13:22.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz you'll notice,\n\n270\n00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.010\nit either dropped it and\ngave me the error, or\n\n271\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.310\nthere was nothing there to begin with.\n\n272\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.690\nI was playing around with this\nbefore we started the show, so\n\n273\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.000\nthat's, that could be the very case here.\n\n274\n00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.460\nSo let's get DHCP,\nlet's do that, I want DHCP.\n\n275\n00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:40.450\nYou can just do DH clients,\nand then etho, like that,\n\n276\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.660\nI like to ad -v for verbosity.\n\n277\n00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.665\nLet daddy know that things are going well.\n\n278\n00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:47.871\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to see that something is\n\n279\n00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:51.640\nactually happening and\nwhat's going on, so let's try that.\n\n280\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.381\nThere we go, notice it went through\nthe door request there right?\n\n281\n00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:59.479\nThere's the offer, and everything was\ndone, and there's an IP Address, and\n\n282\n00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:00.287\nthat's good.\n\n283\n00:14:00.287 --> 00:14:03.989\nSo now if I do I have config,\nor if we like we, like,\n\n284\n00:14:03.989 --> 00:14:07.450\nlet's go new school,\nip addr, too many d's.\n\n285\n00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:13.820\nThere we go, I've got an IP address\non that, and all the information\n\n286\n00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.690\nis there waiting for anything that got\ndelivered to me from DHCP is now set,\n\n287\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.090\nI didn't have to do that\n&gt;&gt; DHCP did it for me.\n\n288\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.500\nNow if I wanted to say,\nI don't want this, for whatever reason.\n\n289\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.960\nI'm checking to make sure maybe the door\nprocess is working correctly, or\n\n290\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.260\nI just want to release and renew,\n\n291\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.560\nbecause something has gone wrong\nwith that lease in the DHCP pool.\n\n292\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see it a lot of times,\n\n293\n00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:36.080\nespecially in smaller networks\nthat are restructuring.\n\n294\n00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.950\nWe Set up a particular range of addresses,\nother clients got their address,\n\n295\n00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.610\nbut then we wanna restructure things.\n\n296\n00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.550\nSo we're gonna change\nto a different scope or\n\n297\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.080\na different pool of addresses,\nproblem is the clients have a lease.\n\n298\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.890\nAnd that lease might be good for\nseven or eight days, and so they're\n\n299\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.960\nnot gonna get the new IP information,\nthey're not gonna be able to talk.\n\n300\n00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.397\nSo once I've reset everything in DHCP,\nI now have to tell the clients,\n\n301\n00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:00.147\nhey throw away your old lease,\nand go get a new lease, and\n\n302\n00:15:00.147 --> 00:15:03.730\nthat's really what we're triggering there,\nis that renewal process.\n\n303\n00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.500\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly right.\n\n304\n00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.570\nI've seen this myself,\nI had satellite offices\n\n305\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.330\nthat had Cisco ASA firewalls in them\nthat we're doing DHCP relay, right?\n\n306\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.502\nBut sometimes I'd have to go to the office\nand make configuration changes or\n\n307\n00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:19.320\nswap-outs.\n\n308\n00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.180\nThat's typically what was happening,\nI was swapping out an old ASA,\n\n309\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.700\nmaybe it was a 10-user license ASA,\n\n310\n00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.670\nwith a 50-user cuz they got a bigger,\nthey've hired more people.\n\n311\n00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.930\nThey've added more nodes to their network,\nand now I need a 50-user.\n\n312\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:31.580\nI swap that out.\n\n313\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.205\nWell, I don't tell everybody,\nshut down your computers.\n\n314\n00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:34.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right?\n\n315\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.263\n&gt;&gt; Now bring them back and now the the.\n\n316\n00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:40.710\nNo, we can just walk around and\ndo DHCP release and renew.\n\n317\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.457\nIf you're on, up on Windows,\nyou do the ipconfig, or\n\n318\n00:15:44.457 --> 00:15:49.424\nI can do the dhclient, and I would do\nhere, I would just do the dhclient,\n\n319\n00:15:49.424 --> 00:15:52.120\nand now that -r should work for eth0.\n\n320\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.560\nYeah, there it goes, and you notice I get\nthe same error, it says cannot reload,\n\n321\n00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.568\nwell yeah that's fine.\n\n322\n00:15:56.568 --> 00:16:03.721\nAs long as if I do ip addr You'll\nnotice now I have no information.\n\n323\n00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:06.968\nThat's basically how to do\nthe ipconfig release and\n\n324\n00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:10.060\nrenew inside of a Linux used dhclient.\n\n325\n00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.790\nNow another easy way to make\nthis happen is I'm actually\n\n326\n00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.200\ngonna get the door process to go through\nsome used dhclient one more time, client,\n\n327\n00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.240\nyeah I'm spelling it right, -v on eth0.\n\n328\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:23.820\nShould give me.\n\n329\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.140\n&gt;&gt; And I'll chime in with James in the\nchat room, I really like that verbose, or\n\n330\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.990\nadding that v and seeing that\ninformation as it's going through.\n\n331\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's just something\nlike a warm old sweater, right.\n\n332\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.680\n&gt;&gt; It's comforting.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes,\n\n333\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.310\nit's comforting to know\nthings are happening and\n\n334\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.230\nit doesn't just bark at me\nwith stupid errors, right.\n\n335\n00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.730\nYes, anytime I can throw\na verbose switch at something,\n\n336\n00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.635\nI'm doing it because it's great stuff.\n\n337\n00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:47.060\n[COUGH] So let's here, what are we doing?\n\n338\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.140\nYeah, that's right.\n\n339\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.810\nWe can still use ifconfig in a certain\nway to kinda do the same thing.\n\n340\n00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.300\nAnd basically what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna.\n\n341\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.710\nIt's not releasing and\nrenewing the IP information.\n\n342\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.800\nBasically it's just gonna\nshut the adapter off.\n\n343\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.710\nAnd say, I want it to shut off.\n\n344\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.640\nAnd when you turn it back on,\nIt'll grab IP information, right?\n\n345\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.670\nIt's going that way so,\nI'm up, I need IP information.\n\n346\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.707\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a dirty little cheat\nto get the same thing done.\n\n347\n00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:13.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\nI like the way you put that.\n\n348\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.288\nIt's a workaround the system, right?\n\n349\n00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:19.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So this is an old Linux hackers trick\n\n350\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:25.150\nor Linux users trick is you just\ndo ifconfig and then you tell it\n\n351\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.265\nwhich adaptor, remember that,\neth0 and we'll say down, Return.\n\n352\n00:17:30.265 --> 00:17:36.300\nYou'll notice no crazy barking,\nno nothing, we are down.\n\n353\n00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.940\nAnd you might not have seen it, but over\nhere there's typically a network thing.\n\n354\n00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.390\nI'm in a graphical environment,\nI wouldn't have this option, but\n\n355\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.610\nit's always a nice visual cue that\nthings are working correctly.\n\n356\n00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:54.010\nIf we watch this if I do the same command,\nbut I add up, notice over here.\n\n357\n00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.920\n&gt;&gt; Did you see that?\n\n358\n00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.500\nDid you see it kind of pop?\n\n359\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.640\n&gt;&gt; For just a second.\n\n360\n00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.280\nA split second.\n\n361\n00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.010\nIf you're watching you'll see it.\n\n362\n00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.530\nRewind, and see it happen.\n\n363\n00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.010\nIt's up at the top right hand corner.\n\n364\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.728\nNow you'll see, I have a wired connection.\n\n365\n00:18:04.728 --> 00:18:07.340\nAnd its I/O settings for us.\n\n366\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.900\nSo the graphical interface is\nalso kind of helping me out here.\n\n367\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.170\nBut I do my either ifconfig,\nyou'll notice I've got,\n\n368\n00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.500\nsince I'm working ifconfig, I now have all\nthe information necessary to get back on\n\n369\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.550\nmy network and start working that way.\n\n370\n00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.770\nAnd all I did was an ifconfig\nadapter name, Down to drop it,\n\n371\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.970\nand then, again, the same thing\nwith up to to bring it back up.\n\n372\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.730\nAnd then it'll grab new DHCP addresses.\n\n373\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.650\nNow this brings us to another\none that I wanted to show you,\n\n374\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.350\nbut Kali Linux is given me fits.\n\n375\n00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.970\nIt's basically the same kind of idea.\n\n376\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.242\nSince this has been around for\nsuch a long time they said you know what,\n\n377\n00:18:44.242 --> 00:18:47.742\nwe'll just add an easier way to do\nthat even though that's pretty simple.\n\n378\n00:18:47.742 --> 00:18:51.259\nInstead of doing ifconfig,\neth0 up or down,\n\n379\n00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:57.408\nwe'll create a command that's just if up,\nand if down, and then adapter name.\n\n380\n00:18:57.408 --> 00:18:59.600\nI couldn't get it to work on here,\nI don't know what's wrong with it.\n\n381\n00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.538\nI looked at some config files, but\n\n382\n00:19:01.538 --> 00:19:06.200\nit basically does exact same thing that\nwe saw with the if config eth0 up and\n\n383\n00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.200\ndown is this is just if up,\nif down with the adapter name.\n\n384\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.760\nSo it would look like this,\nlet me show you real quick.\n\n385\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.435\nIt would look like ifdown and\nthen eth0, like that.\n\n386\n00:19:17.435 --> 00:19:20.309\nI'd hit that,\nthe adapter would shut, right?\n\n387\n00:19:20.309 --> 00:19:24.475\n&gt;&gt; So is it kinda like\nthe whole ifconfig versus IP?\n\n388\n00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:28.235\nThis ifdown is a newer way to things and\nmight not be in all the.\n\n389\n00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:32.135\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nifdown is definitely the newer way to go.\n\n390\n00:19:32.135 --> 00:19:34.095\nIt is in my dist row.\n\n391\n00:19:34.095 --> 00:19:36.375\nSo it's just that I've got\nsome configuration issue.\n\n392\n00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.365\nI don't know why it's not working.\n\n393\n00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:38.910\nIt doesn't like my adapter.\n\n394\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.280\nChanged my config files.\n\n395\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.100\nBut you'll notice that doesn't matter.\n\n396\n00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.230\nIt's the great thing about Linux.\n\n397\n00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.390\nIs typically there's more than one way to\nskin that cat which we did with ifconfig.\n\n398\n00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.027\nIt did very well, didn't drop that.\n\n399\n00:19:49.027 --> 00:19:52.651\nOr I could use dhclient and\nI've got two other ways.\n\n400\n00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.242\nSo if I'm used to using ifup and\n\n401\n00:19:54.242 --> 00:19:58.540\nifdown for whatever reason it's just\ngiving me fits it doesn't work.\n\n402\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.524\nI could go, you know what?\n\n403\n00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:01.260\nI've gotta get work done.\n\n404\n00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.550\nI'll come back and revisit why ifup and\nifdown isn't working later,\n\n405\n00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.420\nI need to get this going, I could use\nifconfig or I could use dhclient.\n\n406\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.670\nSo I like to give you guys options,\nuse whichever one you like the best,\n\n407\n00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.850\nwhichever works for you.\n\n408\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.670\nBut typically,\nthat should be available for you as well.\n\n409\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.280\nSo ifup eth0, if we look at my screen\nreal quick, and then it would just be,\n\n410\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.010\nbecause I want you to see it, ifup and\nifdown, like that, all right?\n\n411\n00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.790\nPretty simple, pretty straight forward.\n\n412\n00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.470\n&gt;&gt; All right, Daniel,\nso, we've seen, again,\n\n413\n00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.000\na way now to switch between assigning\nthat information statically,\n\n414\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.770\nwhich we do on certain nodes\non our network, as you said.\n\n415\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.920\nBut a lot of these nodes\nare going to be DHCP clients.\n\n416\n00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.920\nSo now we know how,\nin both the Windows and\n\n417\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.040\nthe Linux environment,\nto set that client up.\n\n418\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.780\nTo say hey, go get your information,\nthere's a DHCP server on the network.\n\n419\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.140\nGo find it, and then we're done.\n\n420\n00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:53.030\nBut there is some additional TCP IP\nconfiguration that we need to be aware of\n\n421\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.620\nand make sure that our nodes\nare getting as well, right?\n\n422\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.320\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n423\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.010\nI'm gonna walk you through a couple\nof caveats, things that can happen.\n\n424\n00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:05.270\nTypically if you're working with static IP\naddressing there are things that, again,\n\n425\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.510\nyou would need to know, right?\n\n426\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.920\nYou need to know a default\ngateway to be able to set that.\n\n427\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.230\nCuz if I don't have a default gateway,\n\n428\n00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.560\nI'm gonna have a hard time\ngetting out to the internet,\n\n429\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.980\nwhich typically people would like to enjoy\nand use in their business environment.\n\n430\n00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.490\nSo, we wanna be able to set that and\nDNS as well.\n\n431\n00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.108\nDNS makes our lives very easy.\n\n432\n00:21:22.108 --> 00:21:23.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n&gt;&gt; I know I like using it,\n\n433\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.740\nhopefully you do as well.\n\n434\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.830\n[LAUGH] I know that\nmemorizing at list of or\n\n435\n00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.580\nhaving some sheet of IP addresses is\njust not feasible, it's not practical.\n\n436\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:37.125\nSo we need to be able to set\nDNS servers to do that for us.\n\n437\n00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:43.630\nAnd usually that information is\nprovided in a DHCP environment.\n\n438\n00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.140\nSometimes it's not,\nsometimes that stuff isn't provided.\n\n439\n00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.290\nThey want you to set whatever it\nis specifically maybe inside of\n\n440\n00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.960\na LAN that is segregated for\na specific reason.\n\n441\n00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.065\nAnd they don't, I don't know why\nyou would not set this in TCP.\n\n442\n00:21:58.065 --> 00:22:00.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it happens, it does.\n\n443\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.560\nIf you don't get that I wanna\nshow you how to do that as well.\n\n444\n00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.950\nSo, let's do that really quickly.\n\n445\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:05.930\nLet's start with default gateway.\n\n446\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:08.260\nWhere in Linux how do we\nset the default gateway?\n\n447\n00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.751\nHow do I get these things\nout to the internet?\n\n448\n00:22:11.751 --> 00:22:13.860\nIt's another one liner, right?\n\n449\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.809\nSo, you gonna do route route add,\ndefault gw, and\n\n450\n00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:24.230\nthen whatever the IP address\nis of the default gateway.\n\n451\n00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.010\nThis is typically your router or\n\n452\n00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:32.070\ncable modem, depending on the size of\nyour network and the complexity of it.\n\n453\n00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.940\nYou'll need to know what\nthat IP address is.\n\n454\n00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.380\nAgain, if you're doing this you're\nprobably that person anyway.\n\n455\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:44.125\nSo you've got that on your desk,\nso I'll just say this is\n\n456\n00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:50.566\n192.168.219.254.\n\n457\n00:22:50.566 --> 00:22:55.540\nLike that, route add default gateway,\nBa da bing, hit return.\n\n458\n00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.250\nAgain, no problems.\n\n459\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.830\nDo your good old if config.\n\n460\n00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:05.860\nConfig, and now we should see,\nI think it shows it in here.\n\n461\n00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:11.150\nIt's probably in my route commands so\nif I show route it's probably in here.\n\n462\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.250\nWell anyway, it's set.\n\n463\n00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.220\nYou know how you know it's set?\n\n464\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.200\nBecause if you can open your browser and\n\n465\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.710\nyou get out to the internet,\nlook, I can ping Google.\n\n466\n00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.840\nAnd now I know that stuff is working.\n\n467\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.530\nCuz I remember exactly off the top\nof my head how to, I should.\n\n468\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.803\nMaybe it's ifconfig -a is it?\n\n469\n00:23:28.803 --> 00:23:31.320\nMaybe that'll that show it?\n\n470\n00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.710\nNo, it's not showing it there.\n\n471\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.330\nBut anyway,\nit's not really the important thing.\n\n472\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.630\nThe important thing's how to set it.\n\n473\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.030\nThat's what I want you to show.\n\n474\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.360\nAnd you'll notice I didn't get any errors.\n\n475\n00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.672\nI know that that's a good indication\nof things didn't work and\n\n476\n00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:46.359\nan easy way to test it is just ping\nsomething else out of your network and\n\n477\n00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:49.062\nI just can't remember off\nthe top of my head how to.\n\n478\n00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:50.725\n&gt;&gt; Right, always fun stuff,\nRandy, that was good time.\n\n479\n00:23:50.725 --> 00:23:52.215\nWe've got so\nmany commands to throw at you guys today.\n\n480\n00:23:52.215 --> 00:23:53.973\nWhat else have we gotta do?\n\n481\n00:23:53.973 --> 00:23:55.080\nCan we do the same thing in Windows?\n\n482\n00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.090\nJust have to get you on stick\nwith Linux and do DNS, or\n\n483\n00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.429\nyou wanna switch over to Windows?\n\n484\n00:23:58.429 --> 00:24:00.283\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nlet's switch to Windows real quick.\n\n485\n00:24:00.283 --> 00:24:02.632\nLet's set the default gateway there.\n\n486\n00:24:02.632 --> 00:24:07.161\nNow I actually showed you this in\na previous episode using that SH and\n\n487\n00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:10.590\nwe said in that SH,\nwe said the broadcast, right?\n\n488\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.790\nThen we said, I think we said.\n\n489\n00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.210\nWell, I actually have\nthe notes here let's see here.\n\n490\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.070\nWe said the, where are you notes age.\n\n491\n00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:22.950\nThe static IP address, the subnet mask and\nwe set the gateway in that episode.\n\n492\n00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.570\n&gt;&gt; That's correct.\n\n493\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.410\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nSo, it's that command,\n\n494\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.592\nyou do that command, and\nyou're off to the races.\n\n495\n00:24:29.592 --> 00:24:34.250\nBut what if I'm running DHCP, and\nit didn't give me a default gateway?\n\n496\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.450\nRight, and I wanna do that, so\nthat's kind of where I'm going with this.\n\n497\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; Right, is that what I wanna do?\n\n498\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.510\nNo, that's basically it.\n\n499\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.860\nThat's what you would do,\nyou run the same command.\n\n500\n00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Linux,\nit's broken up into two separate commands.\n\n501\n00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.570\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; You're setting your IP information,\n\n502\n00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.420\nthen you're going back and\nadding your gateways.\n\n503\n00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.230\nIt's more of a route thing.\n\n504\n00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.290\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Windows kinda lumps it all together,\n\n505\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.230\nand Netsh actually covers it all,\nIP address, subnet mask, default gateway.\n\n506\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.720\nBut not DNS.\n\n507\n00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not DNS.\n\n508\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.500\nBut there is a trick.\n\n509\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.060\nI don't wanna jump ahead.\n\n510\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.260\nThere is a trick.\n\n511\n00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.620\nAnd it is a route command\ninside of Windows.\n\n512\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.670\nYou can add a D, that's right.\n\n513\n00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.170\nBut wait, there's more.\n\n514\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.080\n&gt;&gt; If you act now.\n\n515\n00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.549\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nLet's see what I'm talking about.\n\n516\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.540\nWe could use the netsh.\n\n517\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.900\nWe've seen that,\nwe know that, pretty sweet.\n\n518\n00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.930\nWhoa, there, buddy, get everybody seasick.\n\n519\n00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.710\nLet me do this here.\n\n520\n00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.875\nI could use that nsh command,\nbut it is long and contrived.\n\n521\n00:25:33.875 --> 00:25:34.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n522\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.890\n&gt;&gt; I can use route in here,\nWindows does have route command.\n\n523\n00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.380\nIt goes a little something like this,\nif I can remember the tune.\n\n524\n00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.420\nRoute, and this is a important\npart,- p for persistent.\n\n525\n00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.140\nIf you just do route and\nyou don't add the dash p,\n\n526\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.870\nit will add the default gateway but\nif you reboot,\n\n527\n00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:56.380\nsomething happens to the adapter,\nturns off and on, you'll lose this, okay?\n\n528\n00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:00.690\nSo you want to make sure to do the dash\np if you want this to be persistent.\n\n529\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.580\nSo -p.\n\n530\n00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.440\nAnd then, this goes, add, that's right.\n\n531\n00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.250\nWe can add, so almost very similar to our\nlaunch command, to be honest with you.\n\n532\n00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.070\nAnd then what we wanna do is,\nif anybody's ever router jockeyed before,\n\n533\n00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.516\nthis is gonna look a little familiar.\n\n534\n00:26:16.516 --> 00:26:17.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 0.0.0.0,\n\n535\n00:26:17.835 --> 00:26:21.810\nlike so,\n&gt;&gt; And then it's mask, that's right.\n\n536\n00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.290\nThe mask is also 0.0.0.\n\n537\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:29.720\nAnd then we need to do what\nthe default gateway is.\n\n538\n00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.160\nSo I'll say for this one,\nI don't know what it is.\n\n539\n00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:32.842\nI'll make it up.\n\n540\n00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:37.397\n2.16.8.219.254, just copy 254.\n\n541\n00:26:37.397 --> 00:26:38.357\nThere we go.\n\n542\n00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:41.170\nYou'll notice that, what's going on here?\n\n543\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:43.500\nWindows is seeing something.\n\n544\n00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.090\n&gt;&gt; It got excited.\n\n545\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.350\n&gt;&gt; It did.\nIt got a little, and\n\n546\n00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.040\nit's freaking out on me here.\n\n547\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.620\nGet rid of that for us.\n\n548\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.580\nIt did that.\n\n549\n00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:56.920\nIt added, let's do an IP config,\nconfig, and let's see if that shows up.\n\n550\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.400\nWell look at that.\n\n551\n00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.060\nThere it is.\n\n552\n00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.740\nRight there.\n\n553\n00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.340\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of another way to\nget to the same place there.\n\n554\n00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.400\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Instead of adding\n\n555\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.669\na default gateway through\nyour IP settings,\n\n556\n00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:09.900\nyou're going to your routing table and\nadding a route of last resort.\n\n557\n00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.600\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly it, and Mike.\n\n558\n00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.400\nPerfectly.\n\n559\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.660\nRouter of last resort.\n\n560\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.990\nIf I don't know how to get to where you're\ntelling me to go, this is where I go,\n\n561\n00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.530\nand that's what a default gateway is.\n\n562\n00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.380\nSo the syntax looks very\nfamiliar to router type syntaxes.\n\n563\n00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.340\nLike I said if you ever played\naround with a Cisco router\n\n564\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.370\nthat's how you set up\nthe gateway of last resort.\n\n565\n00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:33.430\nIt is very similar to that syntax,\nso you can do it.\n\n566\n00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.930\nFrom the terminal,\nit's part of the command prompt itself.\n\n567\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.480\nNow let's jump to DNS, right?\n\n568\n00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.330\nBecause we need DNS too,\nif it doesn't get provided or\n\n569\n00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.470\nif you're setting things up static,\nlet's do that.\n\n570\n00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.200\nI guess I'm in Windows, so\nI'll stay with Windows.\n\n571\n00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.100\nLet's see here.\n\n572\n00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.500\nAgain, we're back to netsh.\n\n573\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.540\nThe one thing I did notice about\nthis when I was setting it up.\n\n574\n00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.430\nIt gets a little, it barks and hates you.\n\n575\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.570\nIt tries to hate you to death.\n\n576\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.060\nBut it actually, but it doesn't.\n\n577\n00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.010\nIt says argh!\n\n578\n00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.080\nIt's like a grumpy old man.\n\n579\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.770\nYou know, you're like, hey,\ncan you do this for me?\n\n580\n00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:04.780\nArgh argh argh!\n\n581\n00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.640\n&gt;&gt; I'm going to do that, but\n\n582\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.610\nI'm going to let you know how\nmuch I don't like doing it.\n\n583\n00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:08.190\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n584\n00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.060\nIt's exactly right.\n\n585\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.150\nIt's gonna do it.\n\n586\n00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:12.190\nBut it will look like it doesn't.\n\n587\n00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.342\nSo just that caveat,\nI'm gonna throw it out there.\n\n588\n00:28:15.342 --> 00:28:16.640\nSo let's see here net sh.\n\n589\n00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.190\nSo net sh and what we do,\nremember our interface ipv4,\n\n590\n00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:26.790\nand then it's going to be add dnsserver.\n\n591\n00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.915\nRight, did I get that right?\n\n592\n00:28:29.915 --> 00:28:30.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Server, yeah.\n\n593\n00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:35.680\nI think DNS servers also works, so if you\nmess that up you should be good to go.\n\n594\n00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.970\nYou can test that on your own, but\nI'm gonna go with DNS server here.\n\n595\n00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.050\nAnd then what is the name of\nyour interface, remember that,\n\n596\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.630\nwe've always gotta have that.\n\n597\n00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.650\nAnd notice I'm not putting a name here,\nsometimes you can leave that name =\n\n598\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.750\noff and just put the\n&gt;&gt; The name of it so\n\n599\n00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.380\nI'll say local area connection.\n\n600\n00:28:54.950 --> 00:29:00.800\nClose my quotes and then what is\nthe DNS' IP address that we wanna do?\n\n601\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.050\nSo that DNS up here we'll say is,\nwe'll do Google, so 8.8.8.8 and\n\n602\n00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.580\nthen you can also add index equals one or\nindex equals two,\n\n603\n00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.330\nso basically setting primary or\nsecondary DNS servers.\n\n604\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.000\nOne will be your primary,\ntwo will be your secondary.\n\n605\n00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.050\nCaveat again, I played around with this,\n\n606\n00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.350\nit kind of does whatever it feels\nlike doing no matter what you set.\n\n607\n00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.070\nAnd I don't know how to force,\nmaybe I'm not doing something right or\n\n608\n00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:34.230\nforcing it But put an index in there and\nyou'll be all right.\n\n609\n00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.960\nIt'll still develop.\n\n610\n00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.460\nI'll put one.\n\n611\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.200\nHit return.\n\n612\n00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.320\nIt takes a second,\nit's turning through the gears.\n\n613\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.505\nWe're gonna get ourselves\na little I hate you.\n\n614\n00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:44.430\n[LAUGH] Then in about two seconds here,\n\n615\n00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:49.170\nas soon as it gets done hating on us and\nbeing an old curmudgeon.\n\n616\n00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.780\nThere we go.\nYou'll notice it said that\n\n617\n00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.248\nthe configured DNS server is incorrect or\ndoes not exist.\n\n618\n00:29:54.248 --> 00:30:01.520\nBut, ipconfig /all and\nlook at that, DNS server, 8.8.8.8.\n\n619\n00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.370\nAnd I can continue to add DNS\nservers through that command and\n\n620\n00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.520\nit will list them in the order\nthat I typed them in.\n\n621\n00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.930\nSo you can add DNS that way on Windows So\n\n622\n00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.800\nback over to our Linux\nbox here really quickly.\n\n623\n00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.780\nThat's a little crazy.\n\n624\n00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.140\nLet's see here.\n\n625\n00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.810\nIn Linux, you're not so much a command.\n\n626\n00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.330\nI'm gonna show you how to do it in\na one liner from the command prompt so\n\n627\n00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.590\nthat you don't have to bring up a text\neditor, which you're basically editing\n\n628\n00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:35.060\na text file Which is /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n629\n00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.090\nIt's a configuration file.\n\n630\n00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:42.637\nIf we cat /etc/resolv.conf\n\n631\n00:30:42.637 --> 00:30:47.230\nyou'll see there are some entries in here.\n\n632\n00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.970\nOne of them I've already put in here,\nit's just Nameserver.\n\n633\n00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:54.500\nI could do vi, I could do nano,\nwhatever text here that I'd like.\n\n634\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.230\nOpen this file,\nmake sure you have the proper privileges.\n\n635\n00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.205\nI'm logged in as root,\nwhich is a no no, but whatever.\n\n636\n00:30:59.205 --> 00:31:00.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I like to live dangerously.\n\n637\n00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.420\nAnd then you just add the line,\n\n638\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.280\nnameserver and\nthen the IP address of that nameserver.\n\n639\n00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.680\nSo if I wanted to do this and one area\nthat I wanted to do that I could just do\n\n640\n00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.160\nthis, echo name server and\nI could say 8.8.8.8 and\n\n641\n00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.590\nthen append it with two, what is that,\ngreater than signs, into that file.\n\n642\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:31.600\nSo /etc/resolve.com Comf, like that.\n\n643\n00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:36.260\nAnd now when I cat it,\nyou'll see that that line has been added.\n\n644\n00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.740\nAnd now,\nit will use that as a name server.\n\n645\n00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.600\nSo if all the other name servers in\nthere don't work, it'll try that one and\n\n646\n00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.790\nit'll keep going down the list\nuntil one of them works or\n\n647\n00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.125\nit gives you an error saying,\nI can't find this.\n\n648\n00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:46.682\n&gt;&gt; Easy-peasy.\n\n649\n00:31:46.682 --> 00:31:47.239\n&gt;&gt; Easy-peasy.\n\n650\n00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.160\nYou can one-line it right in there.\n\n651\n00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.680\nAnd that, my friends, is basically if\nyou've followed this little series,\n\n652\n00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.790\nepisode one and this one,\nyou should be able to in Linux and\n\n653\n00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.890\nin Windows either statically\nassign IP addresses or\n\n654\n00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.918\nuse DHCP and all the other\ninformation that goes along with it.\n\n655\n00:32:02.918 --> 00:32:03.894\n[SOUND] Yeah.\n\n656\n00:32:03.894 --> 00:32:06.077\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Daniel.\n\n657\n00:32:06.077 --> 00:32:09.018\nReally good look at how we can\nset that information from,\n\n658\n00:32:09.018 --> 00:32:11.896\nas he said in part one,\nour IP address information, and\n\n659\n00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:16.430\nthen rounding it out here with the rest\nof the TCPIP configuration that we need.\n\n660\n00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.380\nStatically mapping all that\ninformation as well as being able to\n\n661\n00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.950\nconfigure our client's to obtain\nthat information automatically.\n\n662\n00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.310\nIf we're setting up client's on\na DHCP network, whether it's Lines,\n\n663\n00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.010\nwhether it's Windows, we need to be able\nto tell it to go get the information.\n\n664\n00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.600\nI'm not going to provide it.\n\n665\n00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.740\nSo we appreciate that Daniel,\ngreat look at that.\n\n666\n00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.770\nAnything else you need to add to our\nviewers before we wrap this one up?\n\n667\n00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.630\n&gt;&gt; Man,\nI think I've yakked on long enough.\n\n668\n00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.910\nIf you're new to the Linux world, or\n\n669\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.210\nif you're wanting to get a little more\nin-depth in your knowledge of Windows,\n\n670\n00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.170\nthis should definitely get the ball\nrolling as far as that goes.\n\n671\n00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.980\nGo play with it, see how it works.\n\n672\n00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.640\nNothing beats actual experience.\n\n673\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.040\nSet yourself up a little test\nlab through virtualization or\n\n674\n00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.210\nuse our labs that we have available for\nyou.\n\n675\n00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.770\nPlay around with it, see how it works.\n\n676\n00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.690\nThat way it kinda solidifies\nthat in your mind.\n\n677\n00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.480\nThat'd be my next set of advice.\n\n678\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, that is the key, cuz these\ncommands are, they're a little bit long.\n\n679\n00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.590\nThere are a few words involved in there.\n\n680\n00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.690\nBut you do it four, five, or ten times,\n\n681\n00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.900\nand pretty soon you're gonna\nhave that one in your belt.\n\n682\n00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.500\nAnd I'll tell you,\nwhen you're gonna need that command\n\n683\n00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.030\nis when something's gone wrong, because\nmy graphical interface is not available.\n\n684\n00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.120\nAnd I've gotta be able to do this,\nand if I don't have those commands,\n\n685\n00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.550\nthe stress levels go up.\n\n686\n00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.380\nI gotta go somewhere else, trying to find\nthe commands, come back to the machine.\n\n687\n00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.440\nSo practice these.\n\n688\n00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.920\nHave them in your pocket in case you\nneed them, also for automating things.\n\n689\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.870\nRight?\nI mean scripts are the way to go.\n\n690\n00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.160\nSo good information there.\n\n691\n00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.520\nWe appreciate it, Daniel.\n\n692\n00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.050\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n693\n00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.370\nSigning off for ITPROTV.\n\n694\n00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.260\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n695\n00:33:43.260 -->
