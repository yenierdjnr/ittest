Obtaining the Network+ certification shows that the holder possess the same knowledge and skills of someone who has worked for nine months as a Network Technician. The Network+ exam covers topics ranging from theory (terminology, topology and design) to hardware (routers, switches and cabling) to provide the learner with a broad, vendor neutral perspective on the topics required to work in the field",
