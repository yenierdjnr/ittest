00:00:15,746\nexam from CompTIA, the N 10-006 exam.\n\n4\n00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:20,450\nThat's right, old five he's done,\nhe's gone the way of the dodo.\n\n5\n00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,300\nWell, he's probably still lurking around\nin there, might be able to find one or\n\n6\n00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,470\ntwo walking around in the world.\n\n7\n00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,750\nBut we've got the new 006, so\nthat's what we want to start going over.\n\n8\n00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,730\nWe want you guys to be prepared for that.\n\n9\n00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,350\nThat's gonna be what we are going\nto be doing here at ITProTV,\n\n10\n00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,770\nwe're going to be following their exam\nobjectives for that specific exam.\n\n11\n00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,370\nBecause, we're gonna go ahead and\ntell you right now,\n\n12\n00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,220\nthat joker is a whole lot beefier than\nits younger brother, that is for sure.\n\n13\n00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,505\nOr older brother, should I say?\n\n14\n00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,960\n[LAUGH] It is the newer exam.\n\n15\n00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,820\nDon, have you had a chance\nto take a look at this guy?\n\n16\n00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,890\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n17\n00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,700\nOne of the nice things about CompTIA is\nthat they keep their exams up to date,\n\n18\n00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,520\nthey keep them relevant\nwith new technologies.\n\n19\n00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,470\nAnd that means that we've gotta work\nhard to stay up to date ourselves,\n\n20\n00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,572\nand that's a good thing.\n\n21\n00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:04,280\nThe 005 exam it actually expires of\n\n22\n00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,170\nSeptember of this year\nif you're in the US.\n\n23\n00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,870\nIt expires in December of this\nyear if you're outside of the US.\n\n24\n00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,590\nAnd this year is 2015 depending\non when you watch this video\n\n25\n00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,490\nit might already be expired.\n\n26\n00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,090\nSo if you haven't taken the 005 exam yet\nodds are it's time for\n\n27\n00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,180\nyou to switch over and start studying for\nthe new 006 objectives.\n\n28\n00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,590\nYou always want to take the current exam.\n\n29\n00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,200\nThe exams usually last for\nabout three years before they expire or\n\n30\n00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,710\nretire them and bring in the next one.\n\n31\n00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,140\nSo, this is just the next iteration and\n\n32\n00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,070\nDaniel said there have been\na lot of changes in it.\n\n33\n00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,900\nBut before we dive into that, lets\njust start off with someone who hasn't\n\n34\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,530\neven heard of network clause, right.\n\n35\n00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,460\nWe're ready to jump into the upgrades.\n\n36\n00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,110\nBut what if you're brand new to this?\n\n37\n00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,330\nAnd what is Network processing?\n\n38\n00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,700\n>> Yeah.\nThat's actually a really great question.\n\n39\n00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,690\nWhat is Network plus?\n\n40\n00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,940\nWell, it's a obviously\na technical certification for\n\n41\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,450\nanyone that wants to get\ninto the networking field.\n\n42\n00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,720\nSay that's really looking good over there.\n\n43\n00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,660\nThat Network administrator job.\n\n44\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,620\nI really am interested\nin that kind of thing.\n\n45\n00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,240\nMaybe you've been in as a tech in\nsome way, shape or form in the past,\n\n46\n00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,570\nyou really do need to have some\nexperience when it comes to this exam.\n\n47\n00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,450\nBut going through this exam, looking at\nthe study material, things like that.\n\n48\n00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,110\nTrying to figure out what what\nit is they want you to know so\n\n49\n00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,385\nthat you can pass their test.\n\n50\n00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:22,513\nOr once you get that exam, it's going to\nallow you to be able to start applying for\n\n51\n00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,459\nthose Network administrator jobs and\n\n52\n00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,041\nsaying I actually do have some\nexperience in this, but not only that,\n\n53\n00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:32,157\nI have a certification that says I\nknow what the heck I'm talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:35,437\nAnd when Don says that they keep\nthese things update, that's for\n\n55\n00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:36,287\na very good reason.\n\n56\n00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,027\nBecause, as they keep updating these\nthings to make sure that the material that\n\n57\n00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:44,357\nyou're covering is relevant to the day,\nright.\n\n58\n00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:47,777\nWe don't want to be covering\nmaterial from ten years ago.\n\n59\n00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:48,867\nWhat good would that be?\n\n60\n00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,297\nThat technology is getting older.\n\n61\n00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,550\nIt's probably retiring itself.\n\n62\n00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,260\nSo they keep you marketable.\n\n63\n00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,610\nThis is a very good thing right?\n\n64\n00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,040\nKeeps you marketable by looking at this\nnetwork plus exam, starting to study for\n\n65\n00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,010\nthat, give it in the your old bag there on\nthe belt so you can pull it out and say,\n\n66\n00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,400\n\"I am net plus.\n\n67\n00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,380\nI know about networking, I know about\nnetworking typologies, architecture,\n\n68\n00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,630\nyou name it, I should have some sort of\nexperience with all that type of thing.\n\n69\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,200\nAnd this certification\nproves that is true.\n\n70\n00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,370\n>> Yeah, and the way CompTIA presents\nit is that if somebody takes and\n\n71\n00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,550\npasses the CompTIA Network plus exam,\nthey have the equivalent knowledge\n\n72\n00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,640\nof somebody who has been working\nin the field for nine months.\n\n73\n00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,630\nSo if you were to get a job today, and\nwork for nine months, you learn a lot.\n\n74\n00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,290\nYou'd be exposed to a lot of things\nout there in the real world and\n\n75\n00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,190\nwhen you pass the exam, you're saying\nthat I've got that level of experience.\n\n76\n00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,410\nYou might not have actually worked for\nnine months.\n\n77\n00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,500\nMaybe you haven't worked in IT at all,\nyou're just getting started.\n\n78\n00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,240\nBut you've been messing around with\nit as a hobby, or learning, or\n\n79\n00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,370\nyou've been working help desk not\nnecessarily Network Engineering, right?\n\n80\n00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,870\nSo, you're trying to show that hey,\n\n81\n00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,930\neven though I don't have that on\nmy resume I have that experience.\n\n82\n00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,260\nI've learned it.\nI've done it.\n\n83\n00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,730\nSo, let me get some credit for it.\n\n84\n00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,570\nAnd that's what network plus is all about.\n\n85\n00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,530\nSo, if that's what you're looking for,\n\n86\n00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,660\nthen the Network+ certification\nis the great place to start out.\n\n87\n00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,670\nNow, if you're not looking for that, maybe\nyou just want general computer knowledge.\n\n88\n00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,450\nYou're not sure if networking\nis the field for you, or\n\n89\n00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,090\nyou're really,\ntruly just getting started out.\n\n90\n00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,845\nYou just learned what\na mouse was yesterday.\n\n91\n00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:22,200\nNetwork+ is not the great\nplace to start on day one.\n\n92\n00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,750\nSo instead,\nyou really want to start that one with A+.\n\n93\n00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,940\nIf you're just getting started in IT,\nCompTIA has the IT Fundamentals for\n\n94\n00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,960\nsomebody who just learned what a mouse is.\n\n95\n00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,520\nAnd then they've got CompTIA A+,\nwhich is general computer knowledge.\n\n96\n00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,740\nThings like working on hardware and\nsoftware.\n\n97\n00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,730\nAnd some networking.\n\n98\n00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,450\nYou get an introduction to networking.\n\n99\n00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,400\nWhen you're ready to move up into\nconfiguring routers, switches, firewalls,\n\n100\n00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,610\ndevices like that.\n\n101\n00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,729\nThat's where network plus comes in and\n\n102\n00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,497\nhaving that general\nknowledge about the concept.\n\n103\n00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,070\nThat's what Network plus covers.\n\n104\n00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,290\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a really good exam,\n\n105\n00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,440\nit's tough enough for\nyou that if you do pass this thing,\n\n106\n00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,789\nthen you can feel pretty proud\nabout your accomplishment.\n\n107\n00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:02,455\nIt's no joke.\n\n108\n00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:06,972\nI mean, maybe back when it first came\nout it was a much more lower level, but\n\n109\n00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:11,924\nthere wasn't as nearly as much technology\nand knowledge base as there is now, for\n\n110\n00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:15,630\nyour average network administrator\nas there was back then.\n\n111\n00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,490\nI mean today, just about any kid on a blog\n\n112\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,770\ncan figure out how to configure a SOHO\nrouter and get you up and running and\n\n113\n00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,530\ndoing that, making small home networks,\neven maybe in small business networks.\n\n114\n00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,150\nIf you have that kind of\nexperience that's really good.\n\n115\n00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,940\nThat's gonna help you in this because\nit does have that part in there.\n\n116\n00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,540\nBut with the 006 exam it moves\nup a whole lot more than that,\n\n117\n00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,710\nyou're really gonna get a very wide and\n\n118\n00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,410\nquite a deep knowledge base when\nit comes to networking itself.\n\n119\n00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,110\nWell, I say we go ahead and\ntake a look at the exam objectives.\n\n120\n00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,860\nWhat do you think, Don?\n\n121\n00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,920\n>> Yeah.\nLet's talk about those.\n\n122\n00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,110\nSo, CompTIA takes the information\nyou need to know and\n\n123\n00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,130\nthey break it up into\nwhat are called Domains.\n\n124\n00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,910\nThe Network+ exam covers\nfive different domains, so\n\n125\n00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,990\nlet's just kinda run\nthrough these real quick.\n\n126\n00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,380\nThe very first one, domain 1.0,\nis network architecture.\n\n127\n00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,510\nThat's talking about the overall\nbig picture for a network.\n\n128\n00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,390\nThere's several different topology types\nthat are out there, and technologies.\n\n129\n00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,070\nThere's wired and wireless.\n\n130\n00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,460\nThere's different cables and cards.\n\n131\n00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,850\nYou need to know that to build the\ninfrastructure up to have a network and\n\n132\n00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,270\nthat's what that first domain covers.\n\n133\n00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,470\nIt makes up 22% of the exam,\nwhich is a pretty big chunk,\n\n134\n00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,510\nit's almost a quarter of the exam\nright out of that very first domain.\n\n135\n00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,330\n>> Yeah if you don't understand\nthe interworkings and\n\n136\n00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,670\nthe different ways,\nthat networks are built,\n\n137\n00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,240\nwell then you are going to have a hard\ntime if you get out there in the field.\n\n138\n00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,840\nAnd start saying well,\nyeah I can build this.\n\n139\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,230\nAnd then you're gonna be like okay,\nI don't know what's going on here.\n\n140\n00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,540\nYou have to have that basic architecture,\nand when we say architecture,\n\n141\n00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,710\nit's the building blocks for your network,\nthat's basically what we're talking about.\n\n142\n00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,230\nHow do I build that network\nout from either the ground up,\n\n143\n00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,700\nor come in to one that has already been\nbuilt, understand what's going on, and\n\n144\n00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,650\nthen be able to assist in continuing that,\nsupporting that?\n\n145\n00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,620\nAnd building it even further from there.\n\n146\n00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,780\nSo that's why this objective is very,\nvery important.\n\n147\n00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,480\nIt's one you want to spend\na lot of quality time on.\n\n148\n00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,410\nMake sure that you understand\nall the key concepts and\n\n149\n00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,520\ndifferent factoids that\nthey want you to memorize.\n\n150\n00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,500\nGod knows there's plenty of them in there.\n\n151\n00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,730\nBut, you do have to get that stuff\nrock solid buried into the brain so\n\n152\n00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,680\nthat when it comes time for\neither an exam objective and\n\n153\n00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,160\nthe exam itself or\nwhen you out there in the field and\n\n154\n00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,290\nyou need to support something,\nyou know that stuff really well.\n\n155\n00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,090\n>> The next objective, or\nthe next domain, is Network operations.\n\n156\n00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,950\nOnce you've built a network,\nyou've got to keep it running.\n\n157\n00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,510\nAnd that's what network\noperations is all about,\n\n158\n00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,610\nthe day to day operations of\nkeeping a network healthy.\n\n159\n00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,412\nMonitoring if for performance,\n\n160\n00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:47,530\nupgrading it when necessary,\nhandling security incidents as they occur,\n\n161\n00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,703\nall of that function that is\npart of a day to day operation.\n\n162\n00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,525\nAnd that makes up another 20% of the exam\ncuz that's a good bit of what you're gonna\n\n163\n00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,279\ndo in real life.\n\n164\n00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,631\n>> Yeah, especially when you talked about\noperations- There are plenty of things\n\n165\n00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,511\nthat you are going to get really,\nreally good at, and\n\n166\n00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:04,860\nthey're going to cover that in the exam.\n\n167\n00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,800\nThings like, I am not getting\naccess to the Internet, right?\n\n168\n00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,990\nThat's gonna be a very common\nthing that a network technician\n\n169\n00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,800\nis going to get come across his desk.\n\n170\n00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,810\nHe's gonna have someone come in and say,\nI can't get to this file server, or\n\n171\n00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:19,570\nI can't get to our,\nmy VPN isn't working correctly.\n\n172\n00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,480\nAnd I'm using terminology but\nit's stuff that you're going to learn\n\n173\n00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,280\nthese types of things as we cover\nthese different exam objectives.\n\n174\n00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,950\nThat's a hard word to say, Don.\n\n175\n00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,019\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Exam objectives.\n\n176\n00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,300\nSay that three times fast and\nyou're doing really great.\n\n177\n00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,860\n>> And you'll automatically pass the exam.\n\n178\n00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,410\n>> That's right.\n\n179\n00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,350\nIt's a trick they don't tell you about,\na little back door on the exam there.\n\n180\n00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,112\nThe computer.\n\n181\n00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,336\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now I mentioned\n\n182\n00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:44,969\nsecurity incidents under operations, that\nkinda leads us into the next objective, or\n\n183\n00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:46,925\ndomain, 3.0 network security.\n\n184\n00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:52,360\nSecurity is a much bigger objective\nunder the new exam than it used to be.\n\n185\n00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,730\nAnd that is because security is so\nimportant.\n\n186\n00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,370\nThere are so\n\n187\n00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,120\nmany high visibility compromises\nhappening out there in the world.\n\n188\n00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,780\nThe targets of the world, or Adobe.\n\n189\n00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,380\nWhere these companies\nthat got compromised and\n\n190\n00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,060\nlost all their customer data,\ncredit card data and so on.\n\n191\n00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,500\nWell, it starts with networks.\n\n192\n00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,558\nIt's networks that facilitate\nthese types of attacks.\n\n193\n00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:14,410\nAnd so we need to understand how to\nimplement proper network security to\n\n194\n00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,500\nensure that we've closed off all those\nback doors that other attackers can use\n\n195\n00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,050\nto try and gain access to our system.\n\n196\n00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,890\nNow, security under Network+ is not like\n\n197\n00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,490\nsecurity under Security+ where\nthey really dive into it.\n\n198\n00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,840\nHere, it's just one section.\n\n199\n00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,202\nBut it is 20% of the exam, so on the exam.\n\n200\n00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,386\nOr 18%, sorry.\n\n201\n00:09:31,386 --> 00:09:32,479\n18% of the exam.\n\n202\n00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,543\nSo almost one out of five questions on\nthe exam is gonna be security-related.\n\n203\n00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,050\nThat's a big chunk, you wanna make\nsure you're prepared for that.\n\n204\n00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,804\n>> Yeah, that is no joke at all.\n\n205\n00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:43,536\nThat tells you how much\nthey think of security,\n\n206\n00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,300\nespecially when it comes to networking.\n\n207\n00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,560\nBecause when you network a computer, well,\nyou're basically trying to allow at least\n\n208\n00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,100\nsome access to it from other networks,\n\n209\n00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,760\nor from your own networks that\naren't physically connected maybe.\n\n210\n00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,430\nOr I got two computers that are connected,\n\n211\n00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,450\nyou never know where a security\nbreach might come from.\n\n212\n00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,170\nYou gotta learn about security\nbreaches from the inside,\n\n213\n00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,390\nfrom the external security risks.\n\n214\n00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,110\nYou're just gonna have to learn\nthings like encryption policies and\n\n215\n00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,420\nhow different types of appliances that\nyou can use to harden up your network and\n\n216\n00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,210\nit's a really good thing.\n\n217\n00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,280\nI mean this isn't just exam\nstuff as far as I'm concerned.\n\n218\n00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,560\nThis is practical application\nstuff you've got to know.\n\n219\n00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,460\nYou gotta have that down and\nagain why they spend or put so\n\n220\n00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,130\nmuch weight on it in the exam cuz\nthey understand that at CompTIA.\n\n221\n00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,610\nAnd they say you need to know this\npretty well and we're gonna try and\n\n222\n00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,100\nhelp at compute to know that stuff.\n\n223\n00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,030\nAnd the next domain is domain 4.0,\nand it's troubleshooting it.\n\n224\n00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,218\nDaniel, I don't even know why they put\nthis on the exam, right, because networks,\n\n225\n00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,790\nonce they're in place, they just work.\n\n226\n00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,032\nDon't they?\n>> They just work all the time.\n\n227\n00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:48,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you've worked in IT,\n\n228\n00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,920\nyou know that stuff never works\nthe way it's supposed to.\n\n229\n00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,350\nYou think computers are ones and zeroes,\nbut somehow they get 0.5's in there.\n\n230\n00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,520\nAnd we end up having to troubleshoot\nthem to solve the problems.\n\n231\n00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,240\nThat's what domain 4.0 is all about.\n\n232\n00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,590\nIt makes up a quarter of the exam.\n\n233\n00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,590\nIt's the largest of all the domains.\n\n234\n00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,510\nIf your network is not working the way\nit's supposed to, how do you fix it?\n\n235\n00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,490\nHow do you get things operating smoothly?\n\n236\n00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,810\nThis is really the highest\nvisibility part of your job.\n\n237\n00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,330\nWhen you're a good network engineer and\n\n238\n00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,440\nyou're doing your job, people don't\neven know you're there, right?\n\n239\n00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,530\nThe network just works.\n\n240\n00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,760\nThey get on the Internet,\nthey don't even know you exists.\n\n241\n00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,047\nBut the instant something goes wrong\nall of a sudden they remember you.\n\n242\n00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,390\nOh, where's that network guy?\n\n243\n00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,840\nHe needs to fix this.\n\n244\n00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,345\nAnd, it's very, very visible.\n\n245\n00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:35,380\nSo we need to understand how to\nproperly troubleshoot a network and\n\n246\n00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,640\nhow to resolve those issues\nas quickly as possible.\n\n247\n00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,190\n>> Yeah, the ability to logically\nthink through a problem and because\n\n248\n00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,880\nyou know the subject matter so well, and\nthe concepts that are involved with them.\n\n249\n00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,020\nThat's why you spend so\nmuch time in these other domains, right?\n\n250\n00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,130\nThat's really building\nyour knowledge base so\n\n251\n00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,720\nthat when you get to troubleshooting, you\nhave all the conceptual data that you need\n\n252\n00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,990\nto be able to logically think\nyour way through the problem.\n\n253\n00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,480\nNot only that but\nCompTIA usually does a pretty good job\n\n254\n00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,930\nof coming up with their own formula so\nthat you don't have to use your own.\n\n255\n00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,090\nYou don't have to come up with some\nplan to work through a system.\n\n256\n00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,808\nThey say well here's for\nyou, just try this.\n\n257\n00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:11,540\nThis is this,\n\n258\n00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,220\nbut very successful throughout many of\na technician out there in the field.\n\n259\n00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,510\nThey use this everyday and\nI know I've used it plenty of times.\n\n260\n00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,550\nIt's easy to just say hold on I\ndon't need to reinvent the wheel.\n\n261\n00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,210\nI mean, use what they have.\n\n262\n00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,980\nThey're gonna teach you their method for\ndoing that and\n\n263\n00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,960\nit's a really good method, so\nthat you can logically step through that.\n\n264\n00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,080\nI used to always say,\ndon't just teach me how it works,\n\n265\n00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,750\nteach me what to do when it breaks, right?\n\n266\n00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,570\nCuz like Don says,\n\n267\n00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,060\nyou get the it's supposed to be ones and\nzeros but every now a 0.5 gets in there.\n\n268\n00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,413\nI used to work with a guy who would always\nsay, well, that's impossible, right?\n\n269\n00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,407\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Someone would call and say,\n\n270\n00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,670\nthis is happening with my network.\n\n271\n00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,350\nAnd he would go, well, that's impossible.\n\n272\n00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,700\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n273\n00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,440\nIt's impossible for it to do that.\n\n274\n00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,340\nWell, let me show you.\n\n275\n00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,705\nAnd he'd come in and take a look and\nhe would go, this shouldn't happen.\n\n276\n00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:59,450\n[LAUGH] And you're like, well,\nI understand that it shouldn't happen, but\n\n277\n00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,017\nit is happening, what do we do?\n\n278\n00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,607\nWhere's the breakdown occurring?\n\n279\n00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,628\nAnd we need to try to figure that out, and\n\n280\n00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:09,020\nthat's why troubleshooting Is the most\nimportant domain that they have.\n\n281\n00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,750\n>> Now that last domain that we have\nis the smallest of the domains.\n\n282\n00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,290\nIt's 16% of the exam, domain 5.0 which\nis industry standards practices and\n\n283\n00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,660\nnetwork theory.\n\n284\n00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,450\nThese are things that\nare very important to know.\n\n285\n00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,020\nThey're not a hands on skill, but\nare more theoretical and conceptual.\n\n286\n00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,420\nThat there are ideas behind how networking\nshould work, ideas behind how you should\n\n287\n00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,550\ninteract with your customers and handle\nservice tickets and do basic practices.\n\n288\n00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,510\nIndustry standards that give\nyou those recommendations for\n\n289\n00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,220\nthe way to run the networks.\n\n290\n00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,980\nThose scenarios are things\nthat you need to be aware of.\n\n291\n00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,840\nYou need to learn those.\n\n292\n00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,390\nNow you might have learned those by doing,\nout there in the field.\n\n293\n00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,016\nBut if you're somebody who's learning\nat home, if you're just getting into\n\n294\n00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,709\nnetworking, you haven't been exposed\nto those corporate environments yet.\n\n295\n00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,086\nAnd that's what domain 5.0 is designed\nto kind of correct, to get it to\n\n296\n00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:56,852\nwhere you do understand those things,\nhow systems operate inside of a business.\n\n297\n00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:59,270\nSo for example, a good change management.\n\n298\n00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,640\nIt's a critical skill.\n\n299\n00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,450\nWorking on a home network\nwhen you wanna make a change,\n\n300\n00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,970\nyou just do it and that's it.\n\n301\n00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,890\nBut if you've got ten other network\nengineers that you work with and\n\n302\n00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,510\nyou're supporting thousands of routers,\nif somebody makes an unauthorized change,\n\n303\n00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,370\nit can really cause some problems.\n\n304\n00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,730\nWe've gotta have structures\nin place to handle that and\n\n305\n00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,930\nthat's where our final domain covers that.\n\n306\n00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,160\n>> Yeah, I don't even know what\nmore to add to that, really,\n\n307\n00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,310\nit's that basic stuff\nthat Don was just saying.\n\n308\n00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,080\nJust gotta know the way things\nwork normally inside of a network\n\n309\n00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,360\nas a network technician.\n\n310\n00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,840\nYou can't just go into a router and\ngo, you know what,\n\n311\n00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,080\nI think I'm gonna add me a new interface\ntoday, and plug that in, I'll just\n\n312\n00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,830\ntake this company credit card, purchase\nan MPLS line and that'll be good for me.\n\n313\n00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,430\nWe need that.\n\n314\n00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,855\nLet's just make that happen, right?\n\n315\n00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:43,380\nNow, you can't just do these things\nunless it's your own network, right?\n\n316\n00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,170\nSo we do need to learn,\nwhat is the standard practices?\n\n317\n00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,920\nHow do we need to operate\nas a network technician?\n\n318\n00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480\nWhat are some of\nthe things I need to know?\n\n319\n00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,910\nAnd it's really awesome that\nCompTIA puts this in the exam.\n\n320\n00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,010\nIt's kinda like with the A+ exam.\n\n321\n00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,890\nWe just went through that as well,\nand they have this professionalism and\n\n322\n00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,710\nthings like that.\n\n323\n00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,160\nStuff that we do need to\nimplement as a person\n\n324\n00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,660\nthat is a technician that\nhelps us do our job better,\n\n325\n00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,740\nhelps other people around us that\ndon't necessarily know what we do.\n\n326\n00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,990\nThey just need us to do it.\n\n327\n00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,042\nBut they need to know how to work with us,\nso they're not working against us.\n\n328\n00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,085\nIt does happen from time to time.\n\n329\n00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,730\n>> All right, well,\nDaniel let's start winding this one down.\n\n330\n00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,480\nI do wanna talk a little\nbit about the exam itself.\n\n331\n00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,520\nWhen you watch the ITProTV content,\nour goal is to\n\n332\n00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,410\ncover all the exam objectives so\nyou have an idea of what each topic is.\n\n333\n00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,900\nWhen you're comfortable with all of\nthe topics that are on the exam,\n\n334\n00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,530\nit's time to take the exam and\nget certified.\n\n335\n00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,500\nAnd you do that not through us, but\nthrough Prometric testing centers.\n\n336\n00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,470\nThere is an organization called Prometric.\n\n337\n00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,540\nOh, sorry, this is not through Prometric,\nit's the Pearson VUE.\n\n338\n00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,479\nGotta get my testing center's right.\n\n339\n00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,463\n>> Prometric's gone.\n>> It's VUE, which is vue.com.\n\n340\n00:15:51,463 --> 00:15:55,737\nYou can go to VUE's website and\nregister for the CompTIA Network+ exam.\n\n341\n00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,988\nThe exam number is N10-006.\n\n342\n00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:02,436\nIf you go to CompTIA's website you\ncan find more information about that.\n\n343\n00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:07,650\nThere's Vue testing centers all over\nthe world, so you can find one near you.\n\n344\n00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,300\nIf you don't know where one is,\ndefinitely check out CompTIA's website.\n\n345\n00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,880\nI've got it pulled up here on my laptop.\n\n346\n00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,110\nIf you go to certification.comptia.org,\non their\n\n347\n00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,760\npage you've got this Get Certified menu\nand you can choose the Network+ exam.\n\n348\n00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,840\nIt'll take you in there and give you\nsome information about Network+ and\n\n349\n00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,230\nits got the exam objectives.\n\n350\n00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,040\nYou can pull the official PDF that has all\nof the exam objectives that are on there.\n\n351\n00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,870\nIt serves as a great outline to follow\nwhile you're watching the show to make\n\n352\n00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,500\nsure you've learned everything.\n\n353\n00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,370\nThey also have information about the exam\nitself, kind of buried down here a bit.\n\n354\n00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,050\nThey've got the old information for\nthe 005 exam, but the new one right here,\n\n355\n00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,183\n06, is what you want.\n\n356\n00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,400\nIt's 90 questions maximum.\n\n357\n00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480\nIt could be less, but\n90 questions is the maximum you will have.\n\n358\n00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,981\nYou have an hour and a half to do it.\n\n359\n00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,851\nNot a ton of time, right?\n\n360\n00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:55,344\nIt's about a minute per question, so\nyou've got to stay on the ball while you\n\n361\n00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:58,472\ngo through and\nanswer all the questions on the exam.\n\n362\n00:16:58,472 --> 00:17:01,690\nYou gotta score a 720\nout of a 1,000 to pass,\n\n363\n00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,820\nand you can take the exam\nat any Vue testing center.\n\n364\n00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,540\nAnd they used to have a link in here for\nfinding the Vue testing center near you.\n\n365\n00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,060\nAnd did they get rid of the link?\n\n366\n00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,260\n>> I can't believe they've done that.\n\n367\n00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,770\n>> It certainly looks like they did.\n\n368\n00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,334\nSo if you want to find that,\nyou can just go to vue.com, V-U-E .com.\n\n369\n00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:21,130\nThat'll take you to\nthe Pearson Vue web page.\n\n370\n00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,807\nAnd from here if you go to the For\ntest takers,\n\n371\n00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:27,273\nthat's where you can go to find\na testing center near you.\n\n372\n00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:31,180\nThey ask you to pick your program,\nso we'll just say we are CompTIA.\n\n373\n00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,520\nAnd here you'll start to see information\nabout the CompTIA certifications and\n\n374\n00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,330\nexams.\n\n375\n00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,880\nAnd from here we can find\na testing center that's near you.\n\n376\n00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,121\nSo if I come in and\npunch in a test center near me,\n\n377\n00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:46,510\nI'll just say zip code 32605,\nand I'll search for that.\n\n378\n00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,320\nAnd it'll give me a list of the various\ntesting centers that are available.\n\n379\n00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,371\nI can go to the University of Florida or\nBradford Union Technical Center.\n\n380\n00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,347\nI don't actually know where that is.\n\n381\n00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:56,370\nBut you can pick any of these places and\ngo and take it.\n\n382\n00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,710\nYou'll find there's\nplenty of them near you.\n\n383\n00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,030\nAnd I'm in the US, but\nPearson Vue is all over the world.\n\n384\n00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,810\nLet's say I'm in Berlin, Germany.\n\n385\n00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,680\nIf I punch in Berlin\nwe'll see what we get.\n\n386\n00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,540\nLooks like we got several\nright there in Germany.\n\n387\n00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,954\nSo you can find one definitely near you.\n\n388\n00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,695\nThe exam cost,\ndo you remember that Daniel?\n\n389\n00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:21,100\n>> Yes, we were looking at it and it's\n$277 US if you're in the United States.\n\n390\n00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,030\nI don't know what that equals\nin British pounds or euros or\n\n391\n00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,140\nwhatever the case may be, but\nyou can do the conversion.\n\n392\n00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,070\nIt's quite simple.\n\n393\n00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,360\nGoogle does a lot of cool things for us.\n\n394\n00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,320\nBut in the US if I wanted to take to exam\ntoday I would have to pay 277 bones.\n\n395\n00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,620\nThat's a good price, but\nI get a lot with that.\n\n396\n00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,910\nIf I get that certification,\nthat is an investment.\n\n397\n00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,390\nIt is a really good investment\ninto my future and my career,\n\n398\n00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,650\nand it's going to lead to me\nmaking more money myself.\n\n399\n00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,900\nSo that $277 is really a paltry sum, a\ndrop in the bucket when it comes to this.\n\n400\n00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,050\nNow, that being said, I don't want\nyou to go out there and think,\n\n401\n00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,510\noh, I'll just study a little book,\nmaybe watch a couple of ITProTV videos and\n\n402\n00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,550\nI'm gonna go smoke this exam.\n\n403\n00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,400\nTake your time.\n\n404\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,750\nReally take this exam seriously.\n\n405\n00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,564\nIt is a tougher exam\nthan what it would be.\n\n406\n00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,380\nThey've really upped their game,\nso I want you guys to be prepared.\n\n407\n00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,270\nUse our videos.\n\n408\n00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,299\nUse any other type of study\nmaterial that you can find.\n\n409\n00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,730\nThere are great books and websites that\nare just littered all over the Internet.\n\n410\n00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,250\nYou can find all sorts of great\ninformation that's gonna help\n\n411\n00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,490\nyou get this done.\n\n412\n00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,530\nReally know that information so that when\nyou sit down at that testing center,\n\n413\n00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,440\nand you've got that exam in front of you,\nit's just cranking it out no problem.\n\n414\n00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,930\nIt's very simple.\n\n415\n00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,280\nNow again, 90 questions with 90 minutes.\n\n416\n00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,887\nIs that enough time, Don?\n\n417\n00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:37,711\nCan you get it done?\n\n418\n00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,550\n>> Absolutely,\npeople pass it every single day.\n\n419\n00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,395\nWe've both done it multiple times.\n\n420\n00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:45,060\n[LAUGH] So it's a very doable goal.\n\n421\n00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,009\nYou just have to hit the books.\n\n422\n00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:46,567\n>> Yeah.\n\n423\n00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,837\n>> All right, well, if all of that\nsounds interesting and exciting to you,\n\n424\n00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:51,280\nthen you are in the right place.\n\n425\n00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,850\nStay tuned.\n\n426\n00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,140\nWe've got Network+ episodes coming up.\n\n427\n00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,590\nIf that doesn't sound quite right for\nyou or\n\n428\n00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,530\nif you're not quite ready to jump\nright into Network+, remember,\n\n429\n00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,630\nwith your ITProTV subscription you\nhave access to our entire catalog.\n\n430\n00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,170\nCompTIA IT Fundamentals and\nA+ are both great places to get started.\n\n431\n00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,407\nFor other networking knowledge we\nhave things like the Cisco CCNA or\n\n432\n00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:13,834\nCisco CCNT you can jump into,\na little more focused on the Cisco world.\n\n433\n00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:16,388\nThere's a lot of different\nresources available on the site.\n\n434\n00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:17,851\nMake sure you take advantage of them.\n\n435\n00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:21,426\nBut if Network+ is what you want,\nstay tuned cuz it's coming up next.\n\n436\n00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:26,690\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
