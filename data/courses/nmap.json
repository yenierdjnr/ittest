00:00:17.760\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.280\nwe are diving into the world of none\nother than something called Nmap.\n\n5\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.750\nThat's right, we've got a special\nepisode here for you today, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.540\njoining us today in the studios is\nnone other than Mr. Dan Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.710\nDan, how are you doing today, sir?\n\n8\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.540\nMan, I'm doing great,\nexcited to be hear today!\n\n9\n00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.870\nNmap and computer security,\none of my favorite topics.\n\n10\n00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.710\nSo I am really looking forward for us to\ntake a really good deep dive into Nmap,\n\n11\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.520\nbecause you may have heard of it if\nyou've been around computers at all for\n\n12\n00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.150\nany length of time.\n\n13\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.660\nSpecifically security,\nyou've probably heard this term and\n\n14\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.390\nthis little software bundle\nmentioned from time to time.\n\n15\n00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.470\nAnd if you have you may what is this and\nwhat does it do?\n\n16\n00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.000\nAnd you know that maybe even\nsome nefarious type people\n\n17\n00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.070\ntend to lurk about using\nthis tool as well and\n\n18\n00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.050\nthat's something we need to get into but\nwhat is M Map?\n\n19\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.530\nHow do we use it I want you to be\nable by the end of this series\n\n20\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.290\nto say I know pretty darn well.\n\n21\n00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.550\nI know anybody can kick off a scan.\n\n22\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.470\nAnybody can grab and\nmap type it into a command line.\n\n23\n00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.230\nUse the graphical interface that they have\nalong with it and scan some systems and\n\n24\n00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.490\nthat's what we're gonna do, but\nI want you to know what's going on.\n\n25\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.520\nWhat's underneath the hood is happening.\n\n26\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.030\nWhen I kick off then on.\n\n27\n00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.340\nAll of the myriads of different switches\nand arguments that we can throw at it.\n\n28\n00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.330\nHow do we use those?\n\n29\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.330\nHow do we that to create the correct\nscan for my environment,\n\n30\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.360\nwhat I'm trying to accomplish with that?\n\n31\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.300\nSo I guess it's a good place to start\nis what exactly is and you're right.\n\n32\n00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.370\nIt is a good place to start.\n\n33\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.250\nIf you have never heard of nmap before,\nwhat it means,\n\n34\n00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.390\nit stands for network mapper.\n\n35\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.880\nRight?\nSo that already should be lending your\n\n36\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.420\nmind to exactly what it is\nthat we're talking about.\n\n37\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.490\nWe are mapping networks and that's,\nit's original Intention was,\n\n38\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.890\nI want to be able to see what\ncomputers are on my network,\n\n39\n00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310\nand what are they running,\nwhat is it that they're doing?\n\n40\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.210\nWas there IP addresses, where might\nthey be, what subnets are they on?\n\n41\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.310\nThese are the kinds of things that we're\ngonna discover and find out with using\n\n42\n00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.350\nNMap, and it's a really cool little\nprogram, it's not difficult to us.\n\n43\n00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.790\nIt can be a little overwhelming when you\nsee how many options are available for it.\n\n44\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.730\nPlus, and I haven't even gotten into\nthe fact that there's a whole entire\n\n45\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.060\nscripting engine riding\nunderneath the hood as well.\n\n46\n00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.680\nAnd that can also be\na little overwhelming.\n\n47\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.810\nBut we're gonna take you from the bare\nminimum, you've never heard of this thing\n\n48\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.330\nbefore, today's your first\nforay into working with.\n\n49\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.200\nAnd we're gonna build from that foundation\nand ultimately by the end of the series\n\n50\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.010\nyou should have a pretty good working\nknowledge of the system itself, and\n\n51\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.320\nbe able to utilize it and your networks.\n\n52\n00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.870\n>> That's great Dan, when I think\nof a map in general not even in\n\n53\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.430\nwhen you talk about networking in general.\n\n54\n00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.460\nWhen I think of a map,\nwe're talking about like the topography,\n\n55\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.600\nwe're talking about the layout\nof the land, right.\n\n56\n00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.530\nIf I need to know what's out there and\n\n57\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.830\nI need to see exactly what is\ngoing on in a certain area.\n\n58\n00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.970\nWell what do I do?\n\n59\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.390\nI grab a map and I look at a map.\n\n60\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.870\nSo when we're talking about end map data,\nwe're talking about something like that.\n\n61\n00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.830\nSomething that can basically tell\nus the layout of our network.\n\n62\n00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.760\n>> Yeah.\nIt will definitely give you the layout of\n\n63\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.280\nyour network.\n\n64\n00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.490\nIt might not do this graphically and\nthat is what Wes might be alluding to.\n\n65\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.020\nThere are tools that do that.\n\n66\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.530\nBut they might use Nmap to find out where\nthose machines are, or what they are, or\n\n67\n00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.360\nwhat they do.\n\n68\n00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.310\nThe graphical mapping portions of\nthings tend to be with things like,\n\n69\n00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.390\nsuch as SolarWinds.\n\n70\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.130\nThese are suites of software\n\n71\n00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.180\nthat try to give you a more visual idea\nof what's going on inside your network.\n\n72\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.450\nNmap is more specifically for I need,\nyou gotta remember this came from more of\n\n73\n00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.380\na command line era, back when command\nline was still a very very popular thing.\n\n74\n00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.820\nBecause a, they run really fast and\ntypically if you're running in a Unix or\n\n75\n00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.180\nVariance systems.\n\n76\n00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.340\nYou're going to be working\nin a command line a lot.\n\n77\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.590\nIt doesn't mean you Windows\nboys are out in the weeds.\n\n78\n00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.440\nWe will get to that,\nwhether or not this works,\n\n79\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.930\nand how can we get it to work if so.\n\n80\n00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.000\nBut if you do want to run this,\n\n81\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.390\ntypically you're going to be\nworking in that CLI environment.\n\n82\n00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.150\nSo, be prepared to jump\ninto a black tight box.\n\n83\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.020\nOr maybe hacker green if that's what you\nprefer, and be able to type in a few\n\n84\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.650\ncommands and there's a graphical tool\nas well, but we'll get to that later.\n\n85\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.780\n>> Now you mentioned, Dan,\nthat this is a systems administrator,\n\n86\n00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.900\na systems engineer type of software and\n>> I have to say,\n\n87\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.330\nkind of playing devil's advocate here like\nI like to do a lot, it seems like a lot of\n\n88\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.480\nthe utilities that we have out there that\ncan help us define things on our networks.\n\n89\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.190\nMake sure that our networks are optimized\nwhile they are are used by the systems\n\n90\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.560\nadministrators, seems like they can\nalso put the black hat on if they want.\n\n91\n00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.910\nAnd this can also do a little bit of\nharm and damage to the network as well.\n\n92\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.020\n>> Yeah.\n\n93\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.920\nIt's not, let's just start here,\nlet's just wipe the slate.\n\n94\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.140\nAnd if you've heard\nanything bad about Nmap.\n\n95\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.000\nAbout it crashing machines,\ncrashing networks, bringing down networks.\n\n96\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.620\nLet me go ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.120\ndispell any preconceived notion\nthat that's what it's used for.\n\n98\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.390\nThat is not it's intended use.\n\n99\n00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.340\nIt wasn't designed to do that.\n\n100\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.760\nIf it does do that,\nit's purely coincidental.\n\n101\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.880\nIt's purely accidental.\n\n102\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.650\nIt's not meant to be crashing systems.\n\n103\n00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.080\nIf I'm using Nmap as\na system's administrator.\n\n104\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.720\nWe're gonna get to what West's real\nquestion is there in just a second.\n\n105\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.870\nIf I'm a system's administrator,\nI'm a network administrator and\n\n106\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.600\nI'm employing Nmap, it's sure as\nheck isn't to crash my systems.\n\n107\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.190\nAnd I'm not going to use a tool that\nis known to crash these things.\n\n108\n00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.440\nHave I ever heard of end\nmap crashing a system?\n\n109\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.150\nLike through he said she said,\nshe said he said, right.\n\n110\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.890\nThrough way way beyond, yeah I heard or\n\n111\n00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.910\nread about a guy who used in\nhis friend down the street.\n\n112\n00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.620\nEmployed at one time and\nit crashed his neighbor's computer.\n\n113\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.720\nYeah, I've heard those\nanecdotal situations, but\n\n114\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.350\nI've never known anybody that's said I ran\nNMAP directly and it crashed my system.\n\n115\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.470\nI've never run NMAP and it's crashed\nany of the systems that I've worked on.\n\n116\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.080\nI've been using NMAP since 2001, and I've\nyet to have a single crash on a system.\n\n117\n00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.840\nNow that begs the question of what Wes\nwas asking, do black hats use this?\n\n118\n00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.580\nYes they do.\nDo they use it to crash systems?\n\n119\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.470\nIf they do it's likely unintentionally,\nbecause of why they're using end map.\n\n120\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.450\nSo if it is crashing systems,\nmaybe they found a system that\n\n121\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.310\nit crashes very well and\nthey want that system to crash.\n\n122\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.200\nAnd in that sense they would\nprobably deploy it and\n\n123\n00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.060\nsay hey, I found a weirdness.\n\n124\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.040\nAnd you got to remember\nthat is the hacker mindset.\n\n125\n00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.270\nRight.\nThey think outside the box.\n\n126\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.180\nIf you're a hacker and\nI give you something and\n\n127\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.470\nI say it is designed to do X You go,\ngreat that's awesome.\n\n128\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.820\nAnd you learn how to do it to make it do\nx a million times to do it very well, but\n\n129\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.380\nthe hacker always goes,\nwell what else can I do with it?\n\n130\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.660\nAnd how else can I make this thing work?\n\n131\n00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.130\nWhat can I do?\nWhat if I threw it at the TV?\n\n132\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.250\nWould that do something?\n\n133\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.000\nWhat if I did this?\n\n134\n00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.690\nWhat if I did that?\n\n135\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.190\nAnd that's the hacker mindset.\n\n136\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.400\nSo if they find a way to\ncrash a system using it A,\n\n137\n00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.860\nthey're going to want to intentionally\ncrash the system, any good hacker.\n\n138\n00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.340\nA script kitty, I guess, might go, I\ncrashed a system but all it did was cause\n\n139\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.450\na minor denial of service for however long\nit took them to reboot the system, and\n\n140\n00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.400\nthen they'll firewall that off and\nyou'll never see it again.\n\n141\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.250\nSo typically, if systems are being crashed\nthrough the use of nmap, it's either, A,\n\n142\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.660\nbecause they found a way to do it.\n\n143\n00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.110\nAnd that's exactly what they want to do,\nor, B, it was just completely accidental.\n\n144\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.030\nSo yes, the system admin,\n\n145\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.880\nhe grabs nmap, he puts it in his tool kit\nof administration tools, of network tools,\n\n146\n00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.270\nand says I'm gonna scan a network\nI'm gonna get everything.\n\n147\n00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.790\nI wanna see what's on my systems what\neverything is running maybe start looking\n\n148\n00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.870\nat a vulnerability assessment when we\nstart looking at things of that nature.\n\n149\n00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.525\nI want to come at this from\na security standpoint and\n\n150\n00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:02.265\nharden my system look at\nit from that security idea.\n\n151\n00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:05.149\nIf I'm a hacker I still am\nusing it in the same way,\n\n152\n00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:07.782\nit's just the reasoning that I'm using it.\n\n153\n00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:10.170\nRight that's really what it boils down to.\n\n154\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.360\nSystems, administrators, they use this for\nthe purposes of scanning for,\n\n155\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.200\nto find vulnerabilities, and remove them.\n\n156\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.220\nWhere as a hacker, uses it to find\nvulnerabilities and exploit them.\n\n157\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.815\nSo that's the big difference between\nwhy a SysAdmin would use it,\n\n158\n00:08:28.815 --> 00:08:33.380\nand/or a hacker or\na nefarious type might be employing NMap.\n\n159\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.940\n>> So Dan would it be fair\nto say that most likely,\n\n160\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.550\nwell what it sounds like is that it's\nintent, we have a piece of software.\n\n161\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.840\n>> Seems like it has many capabilities,\n\n162\n00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.260\nwhich we're going to see some of\nthat throughout this series, but\n\n163\n00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.190\nit's the intent or\n\n164\n00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.240\nthe user behind this software that really\ndefines what it does, is that the case?\n\n165\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.250\n>> I think you hit the nail\nright on the head with that one,\n\n166\n00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.480\nit's all about the intent.\n\n167\n00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.040\nHow do I intend to use this?\n\n168\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.850\nAnd just like anything that is meant\n>> for neither good nor evil.\n\n169\n00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.750\nIt's just a tool,\nit is the person wielding said tool that\n\n170\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.430\ngives you the whether or\nnot it's been used badly or if the person,\n\n171\n00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.390\nwe don't go after the creators of Nmap for\nhackers using it for nefarious purposes.\n\n172\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.170\nIt's just it was never intended for that.\n\n173\n00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.660\nIt's meant for\nenumeration is the technical term.\n\n174\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.480\nI want to enumerate the systems\nthat are on my network.\n\n175\n00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.130\nThat I have authorization for\npurposes of keeping track of things.\n\n176\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.870\nMaking sure that I don't have any\nvulnerabilities that are just gaping holes\n\n177\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.280\nin my security system.\n\n178\n00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.150\nThat is its intention.\n\n179\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:39.180\nAnd this has been throughout time as long\nas computer systems have been around\n\n180\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.900\nhackers have been saying, hum, how can I.\n\n181\n00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.320\nI think if I did this It will do X and\nthat'll be awesome.\n\n182\n00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.440\nLet me check that out.\n\n183\n00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.270\nSo there's nothing wrong with\nthe hacker mind set per say.\n\n184\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:55.650\nIt's now I want to crash this machine,\nI want, I've been paid\n\n185\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.700\nby X company because you're the competitor\nto crash as many machines as possible.\n\n186\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.310\nOr to scan their networks,\nfind out what they're running and\n\n187\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.200\nmaybe exploit vulnerabilities\nin those systems.\n\n188\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.290\nSo yeah, it can be used for evil purposes.\n\n189\n00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.160\nBut in and of itself it's neither good nor\nbad, it's just a tool.\n\n190\n00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.750\nIt's how we use it that's going to dictate\nwhether or not we're good, or we're bad.\n\n191\n00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.970\nSo, Dan, if I've got my wallet here,\nready to go.\n\n192\n00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:19.680\nI've decided,\n\n193\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.870\ncuz it does sound interesting,\nthat I want to get Nmap, all right?\n\n194\n00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.450\nSo, I want Nmap, how do we get it?\n\n195\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.730\n>> That's a really good question.\n\n196\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.800\nAnd the great news is about Nmap and\n\n197\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.630\nall of my favorite software is it\ncosts the low, low price of free 99.\n\n198\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.545\nThat's right, for a limited time only if\nyou act now you too can have a copy of\n\n199\n00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:42.210\nNmap and when I say a limited time only\nI mean ever since its inception and\n\n200\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.100\ncreation, it is open source software,\nit is free to use.\n\n201\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.920\nIt, I believe, is under the GPL licence,\nthe public licence that's available for\n\n202\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.300\nmost open-source software,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n203\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.250\nAnd we can dive into that but\nit's neither here nor there.\n\n204\n00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.280\nBasically what it's saying is you can\nuse this software as much as you like.\n\n205\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.190\nYou can even distribute it as, well,\nas the source code along with it,\n\n206\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.290\nas long as you don't try to do that for\nmonetary purposes.\n\n207\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.770\nYou don't try to sell this.\n\n208\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.210\nAnd if you do wanna give it away,\n\n209\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.280\nmake sure you give the source\ncode along with it.\n\n210\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.900\nTypically that's the general idea\nof when we're talking about free,\n\n211\n00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.680\nor under the GPL licensing.\n\n212\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.910\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n213\n00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.050\nThis is something you can go,\nyou can get yourself.\n\n214\n00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.800\nNow we jump over really to Wes's\nreal question, which is, all right,\n\n215\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.880\nnow that I know that I can have this and\nit costs me a whole lot of nothing.\n\n216\n00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.018\n>> We know that Wes can afford it.\n\n217\n00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:35.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, well this is definitely\n\n218\n00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.460\nin Wes's will house when\nit comes to monetary.\n\n219\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.810\nHow do we get this?\n\n220\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.760\nWhat do we do?\nWhere do we go?\n\n221\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.180\nOkay, I'm glad you asked.\n\n222\n00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.560\nLet's jump up on my computer real quick.\n\n223\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.410\nI've already brought up their website.\n\n224\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.861\nWhich is NMAP.org.\n\n225\n00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:51.900\nThere we go, so\nthis is the NMAP.org website.\n\n226\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.730\nSomething that you'll definitely\nwant to get familiar with.\n\n227\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.960\nNot just so that you can just download\nNMAP and install, even though it's\n\n228\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.050\nvery good for that reason, but\nthere's a lot of information here.\n\n229\n00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.200\nSign up for the newsletters.\n\n230\n00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.360\nWhatever they've got,\nsign up for it, right.\n\n231\n00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.230\nGet in on here.\n\n232\n00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.050\nIf you want to be effective with Nmap,\n\n233\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.790\nbecoming a part of the community\nis going to help you a lot.\n\n234\n00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.950\nUnless you just want a working knowledge,\nthen, of course,\n\n235\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.080\nyou don't have to go through all that.\n\n236\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.890\nBut if you really,\nreally want to have a good grasp of Nmap,\n\n237\n00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.990\nwhat's going on with Nmap, and\nit's something that you're gonna be using.\n\n238\n00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.390\nAs a network administrator,\n\n239\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.370\nas maybe a penetration tester,\nif that's your goal in life one day.\n\n240\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.640\nThis is something you're going to want to\nknow about a lot because it is a fantastic\n\n241\n00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.980\ntool and it's a favorite tool of CS net\nand penetration testing administrators.\n\n242\n00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.370\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n243\n00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.740\nLet's take a look at the silence,\nlet's bounce around a little bit and\n\n244\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.460\nthen we'll find out how we can\nactually acquire Nmap from it.\n\n245\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.220\nSo let's go, there is couple of\nthings I just wanted to show you was,\n\n246\n00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.666\nlike over here on the left hand side.\n\n247\n00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:58.700\nYou'll see, it talks about intro,\nthere is a reference guide,\n\n248\n00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.390\nan installation guide, this will be\nworth its weight in gold for you,\n\n249\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.710\nespecially as you bounce through\ndifferent types of systems.\n\n250\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.270\nWe are going to show you how to install\nNmap today, how to get it, how to install\n\n251\n00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.530\nit for different types of Unix systems,\nLinux systems, as well as Windows.\n\n252\n00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.530\nSo these reference guides for installation\nare going to be very helpful for you.\n\n253\n00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.350\nThere's also changelogs,\nwhat's going on with Nmap.\n\n254\n00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.220\nAre there any new features to Nmap?\n\n255\n00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.450\nMaybe there's an update to it,\nI'd wanna go there, find out and\n\n256\n00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.250\nmaybe run an update for\nmy Nmap system, if that's necessary.\n\n257\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.430\nWe also have this book and\ndocs again worth their weight in gold.\n\n258\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.850\nAnd primarily a lot of the information\nthat I am going to be giving to you\n\n259\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.790\nis coming straight from this site and\nstraight from the chapters in the book\n\n260\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.790\nthat are available on the website and the\ndocumentation that's available as well.\n\n261\n00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.270\nI have further experience and\n\n262\n00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:57.980\nreferences so we'll go a little bit\nfurther than what they have but,\n\n263\n00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.850\nif you just had this at your disposal,\nyou have a lot to go through.\n\n264\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.230\nAnd not only that, but\nother things like the manual pages.\n\n265\n00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.400\nJust tons of information on how\nyou can effectively use Nmap and\n\n266\n00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.550\nwhat is happening when you are running it.\n\n267\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.770\nSo give you that good\nthat overall experience,\n\n268\n00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.500\nI know what's happening with my system.\n\n269\n00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.670\n>> Is there also, like we have on\nsome other websites out there for\n\n270\n00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.770\ndifferent pieces of software.\n\n271\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.720\nIs there like a community\nforum where you can,\n\n272\n00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.070\nyou know maybe some people\nhave used this before?\n\n273\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.500\nOr is that something that you can\nkinda research out there, and\n\n274\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.120\nfind forums that use Nmap?\n\n275\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.020\n>> There's probably, just security forums\nin general, probably even have like a.\n\n276\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.640\n>> An enumeration area or an Nmap area\nbecause it is so prolific, so widely used.\n\n277\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.410\nI'm not a hundred percent on whether or\nnot.\n\n278\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.030\nThat's.\nI'm looking on the page really quickly.\n\n279\n00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.630\nI don't see one off the top of my head,\nbut if they do.\n\n280\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.530\nIf I am remembering correctly, if you sign\nup there is a newsletter that you can get\n\n281\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.240\nand that will keep you abreast of all the\ninformation that's happening with Nmap,\n\n282\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.380\nwhere it's being used.\n\n283\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.200\nOther than that, you can just come\nstraight here to their front page.\n\n284\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.323\nThey keep a lot of the news,\nyou can see right here.\n\n285\n00:15:04.323 --> 00:15:06.660\nNmap 7.12 is now available.\n\n286\n00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.780\nThere's the change log and a download\nlink, right, so all the latest and\n\n287\n00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.850\ngreatest news is going to be\nright here on their front page.\n\n288\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.382\nSo, again that's NMAP.org I believe.\n\n289\n00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:17.480\nNsecure.org will also take\nyou here if I'm not mistaken.\n\n290\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.840\nBut I know NMAP.org will because as\nyou can see right here, it does that.\n\n291\n00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:28.760\nOther things just another random aside\non the greatness that is this site.\n\n292\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.940\nIf you look over here\nit says security tools.\n\n293\n00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.150\nSo when you are ready, and you say,\nyou know what, I really enjoy security.\n\n294\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.900\nI enjoy finding the flaw and then\nfixing the flaw, they're going to have\n\n295\n00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.040\na ton of tools that are going to\nbe available for you to download.\n\n296\n00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.120\nAnd it'll let you know whether or\nnot they're free, or if they're pay, or\n\n297\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.370\nfree to try, and then buy different\nlicences, what platform they run on.\n\n298\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.650\nAnd as you can see they've\ngot password auditing,\n\n299\n00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.640\nsniffers, vulnerability scanners,\nweb scanners,\n\n300\n00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.240\nwireless exploitation, and\npacket crafters and more.\n\n301\n00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.550\nTons of stuff.\n\n302\n00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.954\nThis website is a great resource for\nany person in the security realm.\n\n303\n00:16:05.954 --> 00:16:06.685\nSo.\n\n304\n00:16:06.685 --> 00:16:07.648\nFamiliarize yourself with it.\n\n305\n00:16:07.648 --> 00:16:08.623\nWalk through it.\n\n306\n00:16:08.623 --> 00:16:13.693\nClick on every link cuz there's always\nsome great information there just waiting\n\n307\n00:16:13.693 --> 00:16:18.173\nto be found by you and you'll learn\na ton of stuff just by perusing here and\n\n308\n00:16:18.173 --> 00:16:20.470\nreading everything it has to offer.\n\n309\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.980\nNow that we know that's what's going\non with the website, very cool stuff.\n\n310\n00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.200\nLet's get to the download page and\nsee what's going on there.\n\n311\n00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.110\nSo, I can either go here\nwhere it says download, or\n\n312\n00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.490\nI can run over here to download.\n\n313\n00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:34.890\nEither one takes you to the same place.\n\n314\n00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.350\nThey try to make it pretty easy for\nyou to actually acquire Nmap, cuz, hey,\n\n315\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.100\nthey wrote the software and\nthey want you to use it.\n\n316\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.470\nSo, let's jump on over\nto the download page.\n\n317\n00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.178\nSo it talks about downloading Nmap.\n\n318\n00:16:45.178 --> 00:16:48.714\nThis is really like a quick and\ndirty how to download Nmap for\n\n319\n00:16:48.714 --> 00:16:53.045\nwhatever platform you're running and\nprobably even get it installed.\n\n320\n00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:56.486\nIf you need the little installation guide,\n\n321\n00:16:56.486 --> 00:17:02.590\nyou can jump to that as well and\nI think there's links to that on each one.\n\n322\n00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.160\nWe'll see it as we go down.\n\n323\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.220\nBut let's see here.\n\n324\n00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.310\nDownloading Nmap, and\nit's talking about, and Zen Map,\n\n325\n00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.216\nyou might be like, what's that?\n\n326\n00:17:10.216 --> 00:17:11.273\nNMap and Zen Map.\n\n327\n00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:16.210\nZen Map is the graphical front end for\nyour Nmap installation.\n\n328\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.470\nYou'll notice I haven't\ntalked about it a lot, and\n\n329\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.390\nthat's because I don't typically use it.\n\n330\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.460\nI'm not saying that it's bad, don't hear\nme say that, it's actually a really nice\n\n331\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.150\nlittle interface, it's got a lot, but,\nI would say that if you're a newbie,\n\n332\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.930\nif you're new to Nmap, Zen Map is gonna\nbe a nice crutch for you to lean on.\n\n333\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.380\nIf you're not, if you're good with a CLI,\nyou're happy inside of a command line,\n\n334\n00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.110\nthen Nmap is where you're gonna\nspend the bulk of your time.\n\n335\n00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.940\nBecause Zen Map tends to hide\na lot of what's going on.\n\n336\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.720\nYou don't have to know so much about\nNmap to get it to work using Zen Map so\n\n337\n00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.000\nthat's why I'm gonna focus\nmore on using Nmap instead.\n\n338\n00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.843\nWe will take a look at Zen Map though.\n\n339\n00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:01.466\n>> Dan, I know that you've got a lot\nof experience down in the command line,\n\n340\n00:18:01.466 --> 00:18:02.059\nthe shell.\n\n341\n00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:04.920\nI've definitely seen it before,\nfire up a terminal a lot.\n\n342\n00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.560\nSo are you saying somebody like me,\nwho's been more primarily Window-centric,\n\n343\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.530\ndo a lot in the Gui and I do realize\nthat there's some limitations they don't\n\n344\n00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.690\nmake a button, well,\nyou're not doing it in the Gui.\n\n345\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.210\nBut the zenmap might be something for\nsomebody like me.\n\n346\n00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.420\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n347\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.669\nLike I said, if you're new to the systems,\nyou're more of a Windows guy, and\n\n348\n00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.160\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n349\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.270\nDon't hear me down Windows, I'm not.\n\n350\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.830\nI've used Windows extensively\nthroughout my career,\n\n351\n00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.550\nit's a great operating system for\nwhat it does.\n\n352\n00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.570\nIt's even a great operating system for\nwhat I need it for.\n\n353\n00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.990\nEverything has its place.\n\n354\n00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.180\nEverything is a tool for the proper job.\n\n355\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.270\nThere is no one better than the other,\n\n356\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.030\nit's just maybe better\nat this than the other.\n\n357\n00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.660\nSo, you gotta keep that in mind.\n\n358\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.640\nIf you're running Windows,\nyou can be a penetration tester,\n\n359\n00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.190\nyou can hack all day long and\nhave a good time and enjoy it.\n\n360\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.680\nNmap will work for you.\n\n361\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.870\nAnd there is ZenMap as well,\nwhich will give you that, hey, and\n\n362\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.520\nyou know what, if you're in Windows,\nyou're a graphical guy.\n\n363\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.080\nYou like a GUI.\n\n364\n00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.420\nMake no apologies for that.\n\n365\n00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.560\nYou can say, you know what, I like GUIs.\n\n366\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.440\nThey work for me, they're very handy.\n\n367\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.260\nThey're very fast,\nthey're easy to get around.\n\n368\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:10.930\nI do like it.\n\n369\n00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.530\nSometimes I just want to use a tool.\n\n370\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.270\nI don't wanna be a master at it.\n\n371\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.540\nAnd if you just wanna get your feet wet,\n\n372\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.610\nyou want to start doing some scanning,\nZenmap's gonna help you out with that.\n\n373\n00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.350\nSo let's take a look.\n\n374\n00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.500\nLet's go back,\nkinda random aside complete.\n\n375\n00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.200\nLet's jump back down in and\ntake a look at how we acquire this.\n\n376\n00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.710\nSo one of the ways you can do this\nis obviously through source code.\n\n377\n00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.510\nAnd if you're a Linux-Unix guy,\n\n378\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.650\nyou've probably done installation\nfrom source before, right?\n\n379\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.410\nCompiling source.\n\n380\n00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.490\nIf you're new to Linux and\nUnix, you hear those words and\n\n381\n00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:46.839\nyou're thinking, man, I'm getting\nthe sweats, I'm getting the shakes.\n\n382\n00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.780\nThis whole source compiling thing, that's\nfor real users, I'm not quite there yet.\n\n383\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.980\nFortunately, this is a great example\nof if you've never done compiling\n\n384\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.250\nfrom source before.\n\n385\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.250\nIt's not that difficult,\nit's actually quite easy.\n\n386\n00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.040\nIt just gives you more options,\nmore ability to\n\n387\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.670\ncurtail the software to your environment\nand to a way that you want it set up and\n\n388\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.780\nthat's what really the Linux\ncommunity is all about.\n\n389\n00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.570\nIt's all about customization for\nthe individual.\n\n390\n00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.315\nSo don't worry, you can still get it\ninstalled very quickly, very easily.\n\n391\n00:20:19.315 --> 00:20:23.460\nIt's basically three commands and\nyou're done.\n\n392\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.100\nIt's very simple.\n\n393\n00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.130\nAnd we'll take a look at doing\nthat here in just a few minutes.\n\n394\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.680\nNow, let's look at some of\nthe other ways that we have.\n\n395\n00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.660\nHere's the Microsoft Windows binaries,\nand he's like, well, what is a binary?\n\n396\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.220\nBasically an executable package.\n\n397\n00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.790\nLike a package that for\ninstalling software on Windows.\n\n398\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.910\nThat's what they're talking\nabout when they say binaries.\n\n399\n00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:47.140\nYou'll notice right there the familiar\n.exe type of download and installation.\n\n400\n00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.430\nThe cool thing about it is if I'm not\nmistaken, and I might be, I just can't\n\n401\n00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.980\nremember off the top of my head because\nI don't typically use Windows for\n\n402\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.790\nthis, but I think Zen Map becomes bundled\n\n403\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.760\nwith Nmap when you install on\na Windows operating system.\n\n404\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.260\nSo you get the best of both worlds.\n\n405\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.960\nYou can run it from your command prompt\nand you can use the zen map front end.\n\n406\n00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.288\nAnd if not, easy enough fix, we'll grab\nthe zen map front end, install that so\n\n407\n00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:12.298\nthat you have the best there as well.\n\n408\n00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:14.070\nAll right,\nlet's see what else we have here.\n\n409\n00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.750\nHere's Linux RPM source and\nbinaries, and MAC OSS binaries.\n\n410\n00:21:20.052 --> 00:21:25.400\nSo Linux, if you've worked on Linux at\nall, RPMs is a red-hat package manager,\n\n411\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.330\nit's basically kinda like what we\nsaw with the binaries for Windows.\n\n412\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.510\nIt says double-click and it installs.\n\n413\n00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:37.200\nYou have a command line utility as\nwell for RPM to download an RPM and\n\n414\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.820\ninstall it to your system.\n\n415\n00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.610\nAnd you have to know those systems.\n\n416\n00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:45.210\nI don't think I'm gonna\ninstall using RPM because RPM\n\n417\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.220\ntypically isn't how we install software\non Linux and Unix systems any more.\n\n418\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.830\nNot that's it out of\nthe realm of possibility.\n\n419\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:52.630\nIt is.\n\n420\n00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.622\nIt's definitely there if you like RPMs,\ngrab the RPM, you're familiar with that,\n\n421\n00:21:56.622 --> 00:21:58.730\nuse it, it's not that difficult.\n\n422\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.950\nA little quick perusing of the man\npage will get you up an running very,\n\n423\n00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.820\nvery quickly, but we're going to use, and\nyou'll notice you don't see that here,\n\n424\n00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.680\nis what's called package management\nsystems for our Linux variance.\n\n425\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.953\nWe have the Debian type of package\nmanagement was the app to get and we have\n\n426\n00:22:17.953 --> 00:22:23.670\nthe Yum package management system which\nis for Red Hat CentOS Ttpe of systems.\n\n427\n00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.080\nSo the two different architectures\n\n428\n00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.260\nhave their two different\npackage management systems.\n\n429\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.290\nThat's what we're gonna look at today and\nwe're gonna install from source, as well.\n\n430\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.860\nSo we're gonna look at\nthose different things.\n\n431\n00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.130\nOne thing I do wanna say\nabout Mac OSX is you,\n\n432\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.630\nthis is the one that's\na little more difficult.\n\n433\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.340\nSo if you're installing on Mac,\n\n434\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.500\nyou just gotta know that if Mac\nruns BSD under the hood, right?\n\n435\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.350\nSo it's got the Berkeley System D\nunder the hood.\n\n436\n00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.510\nIt's a true Unix variant.\n\n437\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.490\nIt's not a Linux system,\nit's a true Unix type system.\n\n438\n00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.319\nThere can be, especially when it\ncomes to Zenmap, you need some extra,\n\n439\n00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:05.199\nwhich is called I think Xcode,\nthat goes along with that,\n\n440\n00:23:05.199 --> 00:23:10.133\nwhich you'll need to support\nthe graphical front-end and make it work.\n\n441\n00:23:10.133 --> 00:23:12.709\nAnd preparing for this system,\nI did some updating and\n\n442\n00:23:12.709 --> 00:23:15.852\nscrewing around with my system,\nand I've completely broken it.\n\n443\n00:23:15.852 --> 00:23:19.160\nIt's not really that\ndetrimental to our show.\n\n444\n00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.920\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nrun with that ball.\n\n445\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.270\nNot that big of a deal.\n\n446\n00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.830\nAgain, we're gonna focus a lot of being\ninside the graphical environment.\n\n447\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.830\nI think that if we want to use Zen Map,\nwe'll run over to our Windows box because\n\n448\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.120\ntypically that's where you're\ngonna be seeing it used.\n\n449\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:39.200\nMost people that run Nmap from any system,\nincluding Mac, are running it from a CLI.\n\n450\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.340\nSo that why I said,\nI don't think it really hinders us.\n\n451\n00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.640\nIf we need to see Zen map, we'll fire\nup Windows and play with Zen map.\n\n452\n00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.910\nIf we don't, we'll just continue to work\nin whatever CLI, it'll either be Linux or\n\n453\n00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.660\nmy Macintosh.\n\n454\n00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.090\nVery, very simple.\n\n455\n00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.150\nLet's get down and dirty.\n\n456\n00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.958\nLet's get to business.\n\n457\n00:23:55.958 --> 00:24:00.268\nI know that the clock is over there\nticking away like a slave master driving\n\n458\n00:24:00.268 --> 00:24:02.432\nus, let's install some software.\n\n459\n00:24:02.432 --> 00:24:03.013\nLet's do it.\n\n460\n00:24:03.013 --> 00:24:04.069\nLet's go ahead and jump on.\n\n461\n00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:06.860\nLet's see what the first system\nI have To play around with this.\n\n462\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.511\nOkay, so here's Ubuntu.\n\n463\n00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:14.162\nI think this is as of it least the last\nfew weeks the latest rendition of Ubuntu,\n\n464\n00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:16.915\nit's 15 point something or other.\n\n465\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.380\nThat's neither here nor there.\n\n466\n00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.948\nReally how is it that we're gonna\nget Nmap installed on our system and\n\n467\n00:24:23.948 --> 00:24:26.250\nthat's going to be through.\n\n468\n00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.870\nSince this is a dev invariant\nwe're gonna use app to get system.\n\n469\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.314\n>> That was the question\nthat was gonna be.\n\n470\n00:24:31.314 --> 00:24:34.190\nYou said there were two different\nways you could install this.\n\n471\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.452\nI was about to ask you what's under\nthe hood when we say Ubuntu because just\n\n472\n00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.584\nbecause the adistro says one thing,\n\n473\n00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:43.904\nit doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it's as all Linux is.\n\n474\n00:24:43.904 --> 00:24:45.124\nIt usually has and MAC,\n\n475\n00:24:45.124 --> 00:24:49.050\nit's got something under the hood\nthat really dictates how we install.\n\n476\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.120\n>> Yeah that's exactly right.\n\n477\n00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.780\nYou do need to need to kind of understand\nyour architecture a little bit.\n\n478\n00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.510\nBe familiar with your own system,\nthat's gonna help you.\n\n479\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.870\nBut if you're at this level, if you're\nlike hey I wanna start playing with Nmap,\n\n480\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.940\nyou've probably got some\ncomputer time under the belt.\n\n481\n00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.850\nSo if you don't,\nif you're like man I'm completely new\n\n482\n00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.950\nto this whole Linux Unix area and\nI wanna jump into that.\n\n483\n00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.700\nWes makes a really good point.\n\n484\n00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.120\nYou need to know what\ntype of variant are you.\n\n485\n00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:17.910\nAre you a Debian which\nis a main fork of Linux,\n\n486\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:22.290\nor are you a Red Hat which is one\nof the other main forks of Linux.\n\n487\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:27.030\nAnd they are typically any derivation\nthere of, it just means that\n\n488\n00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.640\nyou're either being so if I'm running\na Bluetooth, that's a Debian variant.\n\n489\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.970\nActually Ubuntu has been around so\nlong and\n\n490\n00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.100\nso copied that it's starting\nto become its own major fork.\n\n491\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.370\nEven though it's still under Debian\nbecause it is a Debian variant and\n\n492\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.730\nit doesn't work like\nthe other Debian systems.\n\n493\n00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.140\nBut it has been widely copied and\nwidely changed and\n\n494\n00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.240\nused as a platform to create\nother Linux operating systems.\n\n495\n00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.750\nI think of Linux Mint,\nvery popular, I use it myself.\n\n496\n00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.280\nIt is a Ubuntu variant which\ntherefore makes it a Debian variant.\n\n497\n00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.390\nSo you'll see apt-get again under\nthe hood for package management.\n\n498\n00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.220\nWhen we jump over to the other Linux\nsystem, we'll see that as well,\n\n499\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.010\nwhich is CentOS is a Red Hat variant.\n\n500\n00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.130\nSo you gotta know those major systems,\nwhat's happening there.\n\n501\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.770\nSo let's look at my system,\nlet's get in here.\n\n502\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.690\nFirst thing I need to do is\nopen up a terminal right?\n\n503\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:17.430\nSo let's see here, well actually I'll\njust type terminal and look at that.\n\n504\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.390\nI've got a few options,\nI'll just take the first one.\n\n505\n00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:25.890\nLet me go ahead and\nmake this a little easier if I can here.\n\n506\n00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.360\nControl, well I used\nto be able to do this.\n\n507\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.190\nI'm hitting the wrong button that\ntypically doesn't help here.\n\n508\n00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.689\nI'm not hitting the wrong button,\nI'm hitting delete.\n\n509\n00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.080\nWell, there we go.\n\n510\n00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.100\nI knew I could find it.\n\n511\n00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.640\nAll I had to do was hit the right.\n\n512\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.140\nThe Mac keyboard really throws me off.\n\n513\n00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.490\nI'm so\nused to a standard IBM type keyboard.\n\n514\n00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.400\nBut, there we go.\n\n515\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.160\nAll I did to do that was\nhit the shift control and\n\n516\n00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.430\nplus key in, bumps the font up for us.\n\n517\n00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.790\nGives us better resolution for\nyou guys to see.\n\n518\n00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.930\nBut now you can see,\nI'm in my terminal, what do I gotta do?\n\n519\n00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.800\nFirst I gotta check and make sure I\nam running a Debian type system, and\n\n520\n00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.950\nthe easy way to do that is to see if the\napt packet manager is available for me.\n\n521\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:11.790\nSo I can just do something like,\napt dash get, and then dash dash help.\n\n522\n00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.400\nSomething like that.\n\n523\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.780\nAnd you'll see, if I get output, I know\nthe system's there and it's saying, hey!\n\n524\n00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:22.530\nYou know, either this help function\nis a valid way to get help, or you've\n\n525\n00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.660\ntyped in something I don't know, so here's\nsome output on how to use this system.\n\n526\n00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.630\nIt's a really quick and\n\n527\n00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.190\ndirty way to find out whether\nyou have it installed on there.\n\n528\n00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.980\nI do, because there it is, it's running.\n\n529\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.380\nYou'll notice I can do an app-get-dash-H,\nand I would have also done that.\n\n530\n00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.710\nOf course, my computer is\ngoing to freak out on me here.\n\n531\n00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.160\nLet me just, there we go.\n\n532\n00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.150\nBack into action here.\n\n533\n00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:48.840\nMy computer's trying to go crazy on us,\nwith that being said I know app gate\n\n534\n00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.080\nis waiting, and I can use that,\nso let's do that.\n\n535\n00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.370\nAll you have to do is remember\nif you need to install software,\n\n536\n00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.800\nyou have to be a super user.\n\n537\n00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.010\nYou have to be administrative privileges,\nso typically you don't log in\n\n538\n00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.490\nas the root user,\nwhich is the Linux super user account.\n\n539\n00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.950\nSo you'll use a little switch called\nsudo or sudo, whatever you like.\n\n540\n00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.630\nSo you just do sudo, like that.\n\n541\n00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.700\nIf you're part of the sudo group,\n\n542\n00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.790\nthen you will be able to elevate your\nprivileges to do this one function.\n\n543\n00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.970\nOnce it's done it'll drop you\nback down to a standard user.\n\n544\n00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:25.800\nSo I'll do sudo and then I'll say\napt-get install and then say Nmap.\n\n545\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.820\nOkay so this is basically how it's done.\n\n546\n00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.750\nI'm gonna say hit return it's\ngonna ask me for my password.\n\n547\n00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.958\nIt's gonna let the system\nknow I am who I say I am.\n\n548\n00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:40.830\nSo I'll type that in and now it's\nlooking for the package it has found it.\n\n549\n00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:45.170\nAnd saying okay, after this operation\n18 MB of space will be needed.\n\n550\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.190\nHere's what we found.\n\n551\n00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.760\nThese are the new packages\nthat will be installed.\n\n552\n00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.180\nSo it's showing me this, so if there's any\ndependencies and libraries and things of\n\n553\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.250\nthat nature that are necessary for the\ninstallation, this is what it's gonna do.\n\n554\n00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.940\nSo do you want to continue?\n\n555\n00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.150\nI sure do.\n\n556\n00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.010\nHit Y, hit return, and\nnow it's downloading and installing.\n\n557\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:09.080\nNow for some of us that maybe use\nthe Windows operating system, Dan, I can\n\n558\n00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.890\nassume, and I'm gonna assume here, and you\ncan correct my assumption if I'm wrong.\n\n559\n00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.370\nThat it's reaching out to\nsome public repository,\n\n560\n00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.940\nit's finding the exact\npackage that you want.\n\n561\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.840\nVerifying that package and then pulling\nit back down and installing it?\n\n562\n00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.790\n>> That's exactly right,\n\n563\n00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.450\nwith these package managers,\n>> There are repositories that they\n\n564\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.570\nlook for to say is this there.\n\n565\n00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:33.240\nIf you know that there is a software that\nis available through the App-Get system\n\n566\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.245\nbut it's not finding it, it's probably\nbecause you need to add a repository.\n\n567\n00:29:36.245 --> 00:29:38.315\nThat contains that software.\n\n568\n00:29:38.315 --> 00:29:40.575\nThat's a little beyond what\nwe're trying to do here,\n\n569\n00:29:40.575 --> 00:29:42.525\nnormally this is going to work.\n\n570\n00:29:42.525 --> 00:29:43.285\nIf you need help with that,\n\n571\n00:29:43.285 --> 00:29:46.815\ndon't be afraid to ask us in our forums or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n572\n00:29:46.815 --> 00:29:48.285\nWe'll steer you in the right direction.\n\n573\n00:29:48.285 --> 00:29:52.785\nBut I think most standard repositories\nare going to include Nmap,\n\n574\n00:29:52.785 --> 00:29:54.410\ncuz it's the tried and true software.\n\n575\n00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.280\nIt's been around a long time, you're\ngonna see with just about everything.\n\n576\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.310\nAs you can see it didn't take very long,\nit's text based, it's very small.\n\n577\n00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.280\nIt is installed!\n\n578\n00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.450\nNow, if I just do Nmap,\nyou'll see that I have Nmap available.\n\n579\n00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:11.220\nWe can even probably glean if\nit got the latest and greatest.\n\n580\n00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.870\nLet's see here.\n\n581\n00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:17.570\nAnd you can see there's a lot of options,\nso it grabbed Nmap version 6.47.\n\n582\n00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.810\nIf i wanted to update that, then I could\nrun an update command on my app get,\n\n583\n00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.980\nmake sure that it was getting the common.\n\n584\n00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.840\nBut this is fine,\nthis will work with every one of our,\n\n585\n00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.410\nif you want to run 7.1 too,\nthat's fine as well.\n\n586\n00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.340\nThat will work.\n\n587\n00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.590\nAll of the stuff that we are going to do,\nis going to work regardless of whether\n\n588\n00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.940\nyou're using 6.47, or\nthe latest version seven of Nmap.\n\n589\n00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.860\nSo pretty simple,\nvery straightforward, very easy.\n\n590\n00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.960\nLet's jump over to CentOS and\nsee how that differs.\n\n591\n00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.870\nHere we are again, basic operating system.\n\n592\n00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.680\nBasically, you just need to log in\nover here and grab me a terminal.\n\n593\n00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.520\nLet me go to recently used.\n\n594\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.740\nI actually use this computer so\nLet's try this again.\n\n595\n00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.330\nHey, look at that.\nI am getting better at it everyday.\n\n596\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.120\nAgain, you will need to elevate privileges\nso we'll need a pseudo command.\n\n597\n00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.160\nYou could in theory be logged in as root,\nlike I said, but\n\n598\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.720\nthat is a dangerous practice.\n\n599\n00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.308\nSo we'll typically just use\nthe pseudo commands to elevate and\n\n600\n00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:11.549\nde-elevate as necessary.\n\n601\n00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.210\nSo, we need the yum.\n\n602\n00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:20.400\nSo, yum is what is going to get us\nthe installation for a sent OS or\n\n603\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.870\nred hat variance.\n\n604\n00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.070\nSo, yum install, and\nthen we'll just say Nmap.\n\n605\n00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.370\nAsking me for the password one more time.\n\n606\n00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.550\nAnd here we go.\n\n607\n00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.810\nBasically, doing the same kind of thing.\n\n608\n00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.410\nIt's checking a repository,\nis this software package available?\n\n609\n00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.100\nDo I find anything by that name?\n\n610\n00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.580\nOr maybe a variant of that name,\nmaybe an alias of that name?\n\n611\n00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.810\nDo displace that to me,\nlet me know, there it is.\n\n612\n00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:50.050\nIt's giving me version numbers,\nand I guess that's for Nmap.\n\n613\n00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.700\nAnd then telling me the size,\nand all that thing.\n\n614\n00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.380\nDo I wish to continue?\n\n615\n00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.510\nYes, delete.\n\n616\n00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.850\nNow the weird thing about yum is it\nkind of actually saves the fact that,\n\n617\n00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.680\nif I did look up and\nI decided here, you know what?\n\n618\n00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.430\nI wanna wait.\n\n619\n00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.690\nMaybe this version isn't to my liking, and\n\n620\n00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.224\nI wanna verify before I continue,\nand I hit no.\n\n621\n00:32:08.224 --> 00:32:11.773\nIt'll actually save the session, and\nI can come back and run the session And\n\n622\n00:32:11.773 --> 00:32:15.437\ninstead of running Yum install nmap,\nyou know that's pretty simple as well,\n\n623\n00:32:15.437 --> 00:32:18.730\nI typically just rerun the command\nbecause it's not that difficult.\n\n624\n00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.600\nSo for here, so you do have the delete\noption and that's what that means.\n\n625\n00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.550\nIt's deleting this as a session.\n\n626\n00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.130\nBut I want yes.\n\n627\n00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.160\nThere we go.\n\n628\n00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.260\nDownloading, again a very small package.\n\n629\n00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.110\nInstalling.\n\n630\n00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.740\nAnd look at that, we're complete.\n\n631\n00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.910\nVery quick and\neasy to get installed on Cent.\n\n632\n00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:41.090\nNow since we're here, let's go ahead and\nlet's do a source install as well, okay?\n\n633\n00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:45.320\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nuninstall here, let's say sudo yum,\n\n634\n00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.120\nI think it's erase, and\n\n635\n00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.540\nI'll say nmap and there we go, so\nit's asking me if this is okay.\n\n636\n00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.340\nYes and now it's completed.\n\n637\n00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.850\nIt is removed.\n\n638\n00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.920\nLet's open up a web browser,\n\n639\n00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.940\ngo to the site and\nactually download the source code itself.\n\n640\n00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.420\nSo let's see here, go to recently used,\ngrab a web browser.\n\n641\n00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:15.440\nAnd we will go to Nmap.org.\n\n642\n00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.030\nGo to download, find source and binaries,\n\n643\n00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.970\nhere they are, and they even give\nyou a handy little look, right here.\n\n644\n00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.860\nVery, very simple to make this work.\n\n645\n00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.430\nSo we just want to grab that.\n\n646\n00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.440\nActually, I think I may have\neven downloaded it already.\n\n647\n00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.430\nLet me check it real quick here.\n\n648\n00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.460\nLet's see here.\n\n649\n00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.080\ncd Downloads.\n\n650\n00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:38.800\nAnd look at that.\n\n651\n00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.360\nI am the man.\n\n652\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.580\nI have already prestaged\nthis whole environment.\n\n653\n00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.780\nAll I would do is download the link.\n\n654\n00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:43.870\nObviously, you click the link.\n\n655\n00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.260\nIt says do you want to save this?\n\n656\n00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.640\nYes or no.\nAnd that's what I did.\n\n657\n00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.560\nI saved it.\n\n658\n00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.848\nSo here it is, Nmap 7.1 to T-G-Z and\n\n659\n00:33:51.848 --> 00:33:57.852\nall I have to do is follow\nthe directions right here.\n\n660\n00:33:57.852 --> 00:34:02.800\nIs Bzip, I could even copy and\npaste this if I want.\n\n661\n00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.560\nThat's a little too much.\n\n662\n00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.630\nI don't need that.\n\n663\n00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.276\nAnd grab that.\n\n664\n00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:11.010\nI'm over.\n\n665\n00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:11.800\nThere we go.\n\n666\n00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:18.590\nGet to the console,\npaste that in there and hit return.\n\n667\n00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:22.330\nI guess I did need that\nwhole tag on the end.\n\n668\n00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.350\nIt's giving me errors here.\n\n669\n00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.060\nNo such file.\n\n670\n00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:25.560\nWhat is?\n\n671\n00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.930\nThat's because I didn't get the BZ2.\n\n672\n00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.090\nLook at me I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n673\n00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.010\nI guess I just grabbed\nthe tar file itself.\n\n674\n00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.670\nSo this is TGZ, so\ndo I have to go an unzip it?\n\n675\n00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:40.922\nI don't remember,\nlets just try tar -zxvf should then\n\n676\n00:34:40.922 --> 00:34:46.720\ngive me the Nmap at some point 1.12,\nthere we go.\n\n677\n00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.360\nThere we go, so\nnow I've unzipped the folder.\n\n678\n00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.990\nI do an ls, there should be nmap,\nthere we go.\n\n679\n00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.650\nSo now all I have to do is go into\nthat directory that is created.\n\n680\n00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.820\nThat's where all\nthe installation files are.\n\n681\n00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.250\nSo, cd into nmap and if I do an ls,\nhere's all the things that we need.\n\n682\n00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.740\nHere's where it start's getting tricky.\n\n683\n00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.730\nOkay, uncompressing a zip file and\n\n684\n00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.090\ndumping its contents into a folder,\nI can hang with that.\n\n685\n00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.310\nBut it's this compilation stuff,\n\n686\n00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.600\nthis compiling source that\nI'm not familiar with.\n\n687\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.646\nAgain, not a big deal, it's pretty simple.\n\n688\n00:35:17.646 --> 00:35:20.479\nThree short commands, we do a ./configure.\n\n689\n00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:24.639\nActually I'm gonna just I'm gonna sudo\neverything just cuz I like to have that\n\n690\n00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:25.668\nlevel of control.\n\n691\n00:35:25.668 --> 00:35:29.460\nConfigure, yep, that's right.\n\n692\n00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.620\nAnd hit enter, right?\n\n693\n00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.810\nNow, that's running through.\n\n694\n00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.410\nCraziness is happening right here and\nI can't follow this.\n\n695\n00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.050\nNot a big deal.\n\n696\n00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.240\nIt's just basically building\nthe package for you.\n\n697\n00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.200\nIt's saying, here's all this system.\n\n698\n00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.370\nI'm looking at this system, I'm saying,\nokay, I'm running on Cento S,\n\n699\n00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:52.990\nI'm running on this type of architecture,\nhere's the CPU.\n\n700\n00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.250\nWhat kind is that?\n\n701\n00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.220\nAll that other good stuff,\nit's figuring that out.\n\n702\n00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.720\nWhat is this system I'm\ntrying to install on?\n\n703\n00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.620\nAnd that's compiling and\n\n704\n00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.882\nyou get a cool little graphic out here,\nsaying the configuration is complete.\n\n705\n00:36:03.882 --> 00:36:08.220\nSo Nmap has been configured,\nnow we gotta do a little extra.\n\n706\n00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:13.530\nSudo make, and this is actually\ngoing to build the package right?\n\n707\n00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.150\nSo we hit return.\n\n708\n00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:16.150\nAnd off we go.\n\n709\n00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.750\nIt's billing.\n\n710\n00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.840\nIf there are any library dependencies or\nanything like that,\n\n711\n00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.810\nthis is typically were\nwe'll run into errors.\n\n712\n00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.560\nSo if I needed a library it would error\nout and give me a dependency not found,\n\n713\n00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.760\nthings of that nature.\n\n714\n00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.450\nThis is why people tend\nto be afraid of using or\n\n715\n00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:34.690\ncompiling from source is because\nit can be a lot of leg work.\n\n716\n00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.640\nThere's no doubt.\n\n717\n00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.300\nIf your system does not support what it\nis that you're trying to do you're gonna\n\n718\n00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.110\nspend all day running around trying to\nfind the dependencies, installing those,\n\n719\n00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.950\nmaybe those dependencies\nhave dependencies and\n\n720\n00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:50.560\nyou start seeing why people are like,\nthat evil compiling from source.\n\n721\n00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.390\nAnd yeah it can be a lot of work but\n\n722\n00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.380\nas you get better at doing it as you get\nmore familiar with the operating system\n\n723\n00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.200\nas you get more familiar with\nthe software that you're installing and\n\n724\n00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.420\nthe options that are available at\ninstall time, it lends you to be able to\n\n725\n00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.850\nmore tightly conform it to what it is that\nyou're using the system that you have.\n\n726\n00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.340\nSo, we're giving you the quick and\n\n727\n00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.740\ndirty way of installing\nthrough compiling from source.\n\n728\n00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:23.580\nBut there are much further options and\nability through doing up this way.\n\n729\n00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.880\nAnd looks like we're done.\n\n730\n00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.290\nI don't see any errors.\n\n731\n00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.290\nEverything looks good.\n\n732\n00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:32.210\nWe got one more command to do and\nthat's sudo make install.\n\n733\n00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.220\nAnd that's what actually makes it\navailable to the system as a program.\n\n734\n00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.070\nHere we go, successfully installed.\n\n735\n00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.120\nLooks like we are now Nmap\nready on that system.\n\n736\n00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.569\nThat's it.\nThat's what all it took.\n\n737\n00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:48.495\nYou ./configure which runs\nthe configure script.\n\n738\n00:37:48.495 --> 00:37:51.125\nYou do make which actually\nbuilds the program and\n\n739\n00:37:51.125 --> 00:37:54.000\nthen make install which\nactually installs it.\n\n740\n00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.560\nThat's compiling from source everybody.\n\n741\n00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.120\nNmap should be ready to rock on this and\nthere it is.\n\n742\n00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.530\nIt's good to go even though I didn't\nuse the much more convenient Yum\n\n743\n00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.230\napplications manager.\n\n744\n00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.935\nNow, Wes, we've got one more and\nI know our clock is super, super gone.\n\n745\n00:38:08.935 --> 00:38:10.160\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n746\n00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.640\n>> I don't know how far over we are but\nwe've got one more and that's Windows.\n\n747\n00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.340\nWe'll run through it as quickly\nas possible because it's Windows.\n\n748\n00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.600\nIt's super easy, right?\n\n749\n00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.030\nSo let's go over to the Windows machine.\n\n750\n00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.400\nLet me get logged in.\n\n751\n00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.240\nAnd I believe I've already\neven downloaded it for us.\n\n752\n00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.548\nI think it's in the folder here.\n\n753\n00:38:25.548 --> 00:38:29.720\nWent to Nmap.org,\nwent to the downloads page.\n\n754\n00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.650\nGrab that link that said\nDownload Windows Binaries, right?\n\n755\n00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.320\nThat's what it was.\n\n756\n00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.010\nThat Nmap 7.12.exe.\n\n757\n00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.830\nAnd probably in the Downloads folder.\n\n758\n00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.829\nThere it is right there,\nsetup, double-click.\n\n759\n00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.650\nYes, you'll notice that\nyou get the UAC prompt,\n\n760\n00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.920\nit's saying hey you're\ninstalling software,\n\n761\n00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.310\nyou've gotta have administrator privileges\nhere, do you want me to do this?\n\n762\n00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.270\nHere comes the EULA,\nthe license agreement.\n\n763\n00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.540\nRead through it,\ndefinitely I don't think it's too long.\n\n764\n00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.590\nYou'll only fall asleep two or\nthree times getting through it.\n\n765\n00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.900\nI'm just going to click\nI Agree because I do.\n\n766\n00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.640\nAnd here we go.\n\n767\n00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.380\nAll the options are available.\n\n768\n00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.030\nAll the tried and true easiness\nof Windows, what it's known for,\n\n769\n00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.890\nwhy we love it so\nbecause of its ease of use.\n\n770\n00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.960\nAnd look,\nthere's Zen Map already installed.\n\n771\n00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.250\nNotice it's also installing\nEnd Cat which is Net Cat,\n\n772\n00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.610\nthe swiss army knife of network tools.\n\n773\n00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.980\nIt is a very nice thing to have as well.\n\n774\n00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.660\nNdiff, Nping, Packet Generator,\nScan Comparison Tool.\n\n775\n00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.240\nLot of cool stuff in this suite so\nI'm just gonna go with the defaults here,\n\n776\n00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.390\nhit next.\n\n777\n00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.300\nAnd of course there was a description\nnext to each one of those so\n\n778\n00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.200\nif you don't know what they do,\njust hover over it.\n\n779\n00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.030\nIt will give you\nthe description off to the side.\n\n780\n00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.660\nSo it's asking me where I want to\ninstall it at, default's fine for me.\n\n781\n00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.670\nMaybe you have a different system so know\nyour system, where you install software,\n\n782\n00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.030\nwe'll hit Install and off to the races.\n\n783\n00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:52.840\nAgain, it's not a huge operating system\neven with all the extra bells and\n\n784\n00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.880\nwhistles that we just saw it\ndoesn't take a long time.\n\n785\n00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.430\nI'd be surprised if it took two minutes.\n\n786\n00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.850\nThis is something that\nyou do need to know.\n\n787\n00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.096\nYou'll notice that it's giving me\nanother licensing agreement for.\n\n788\n00:40:06.096 --> 00:40:08.254\nWinpcap, what is that?\n\n789\n00:40:08.254 --> 00:40:13.260\nThe Winpcap is a driver\nthat allows us to put our.\n\n790\n00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.462\nOur network card into what's\ncalled promiscuous mode.\n\n791\n00:40:17.462 --> 00:40:20.357\nIt's saying normally when network\ntraffic comes to your card,\n\n792\n00:40:20.357 --> 00:40:23.787\nif it's not for your system, it's not\ndestined for you, it just drops it,\n\n793\n00:40:23.787 --> 00:40:26.490\nit just says well it's not for\nme, I don't need that data.\n\n794\n00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.560\nBut what if I wanted to see it, right?\n\n795\n00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.850\nWhat if I wanted to see that data,\n\n796\n00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.720\nI didn't want to just drop it,\nI wanna take a look at it.\n\n797\n00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.400\nThe WinPcap is what's necessary for that.\n\n798\n00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.000\nAnd since we're doing a lot of that type\nof functionality and we'll need that for\n\n799\n00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.400\nfurther down the road and\n\n800\n00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.000\ngetting more advanced,\nwe need to install this here at run time.\n\n801\n00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.862\nLuckily, if it senses that you\ndon't have the WinPcap installed,\n\n802\n00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:50.660\nit will throw it up and say, hey,\nyou need to install the WinPcap driver.\n\n803\n00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:55.850\nSo I'll agree to that as well,\nanother really quick and it's done.\n\n804\n00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:59.260\nI click next,\nstart the WinPcap service now.\n\n805\n00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.960\nYou can make these decisions as you like,\nagain,\n\n806\n00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.330\nI'm going with all the defaults\nwhen Pcap is installed.\n\n807\n00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:10.220\nAnd when that's done Nmap\nis not far after again,\n\n808\n00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.870\nthis just took me two minutes, if that.\n\n809\n00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.100\nStart to finish, very, very simple.\n\n810\n00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.200\nI click next.\n\n811\n00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.830\nSays do you want me to\ncreate a desktop icon?\n\n812\n00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.520\nThat will give you the Zenmap GUI.\n\n813\n00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.580\nDo you want me to start menu for.\n\n814\n00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.530\nAgain, I tend to stick with defaults\nunless I don't wanna clutter up\n\n815\n00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.100\nmy desktop.\n\n816\n00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.000\nBut hey it's nice to have\na graphic right there for me.\n\n817\n00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.260\nClick finish and\nnow if I either open up a command prompt\n\n818\n00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.300\nwhich again you've gotta remember and this\nis something we'll get into later, but\n\n819\n00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.990\nI'm gonna mention it right here because\nwe're in Windows in Windows if you open\n\n820\n00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.240\na regular command prompt you have\nno administrator privileges.\n\n821\n00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.870\nYou have to do the right click Windows\nadministrator and then you get admin M Map\n\n822\n00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:53.780\nruns differently when you're logged in as\nour standard user versus an administrator,\n\n823\n00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.440\nso keep that in mind as\nwe move down the line and\n\n824\n00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.420\nwhat we can do within that data and\ndo I need to have elevated privileges.\n\n825\n00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.300\nSo just keep that as a heads up.\n\n826\n00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.350\nI'm not interested in\nthat I just want CMD.\n\n827\n00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:12.590\nSo I can either, let me zoom in here,\nand I can either just type Nmap.\n\n828\n00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.000\nAgain get the same kind of\nstandard output that we're\n\n829\n00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.290\nused to seeing from the other terminal or\nI can go to Zenmap Gui and\n\n830\n00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.900\nwe'll get a little sneak preview of it\nright here, very, very nice, right?\n\n831\n00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.960\nGood old fashioned.\n\n832\n00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.620\nThe cool thing is it does tell\nyou whatever you're trying to do.\n\n833\n00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.760\nIf I say I don't know we're going\nto grab different types of scans.\n\n834\n00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.700\nWhatever I do, it shows me\nthe actual command line output,\n\n835\n00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.940\nor input should I say, for the CLI.\n\n836\n00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.110\nSo if I wanted to do this in the CLI,\nhow would I do it?\n\n837\n00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.580\nWell there it is right there.\n\n838\n00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.440\nI come and use,\nlike I said it's a great crutch for\n\n839\n00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.980\nanybody just getting started having no\ncommand line experience this is going to\n\n840\n00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.970\nhelp a lot, and if you are just having\ntrouble, why isn't this working correctly?\n\n841\n00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:59.430\nJump over to Zen map and run it from\none of their default scans and see.\n\n842\n00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.270\nI missed the dash A.\n\n843\n00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.770\nI wasn't doing that, cool.\n\n844\n00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:03.490\nNow you know what to do.\n\n845\n00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.022\nIt's a really great help.\n\n846\n00:43:05.022 --> 00:43:07.780\nBut its very straightforward and\nwe'll get more into the look and\n\n847\n00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.870\nfeel of the thing in other episodes.\n\n848\n00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.170\nBut, that's basically it.\n\n849\n00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.640\nWe've seen it installed on Lynux which is\nbasically the same way we would install it\n\n850\n00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.290\nin Mac OS as well other than\nthat X code for Zenmap.\n\n851\n00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.340\nBut also we've seen it\ninstalled on Windows.\n\n852\n00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.100\nHopefully you guys are trudging\nright through this.\n\n853\n00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.160\nThis is not too difficult.\n\n854\n00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.200\nIf it is, make sure just give us a,\ngive us an ask there in our forums,\n\n855\n00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:32.150\nwe'll be glad to help you guys out.\n\n856\n00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.770\nBut Wes, that's all there is to it.\n\n857\n00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:38.210\nWe've got Nmap installed,\nwe've got Zenmap installed we are now,\n\n858\n00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:43.210\nwe have the platform ready for\nus to jump off and start scanning systems.\n\n859\n00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.710\n>> Well thank you for\nthat information Dan.\n\n860\n00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.430\nKeep in mind what have we\nlooked at in this episode.\n\n861\n00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:50.170\nWe told you what Nmap is,\nwe told you where to find it and\n\n862\n00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.190\nDan you've been gracious enough\nto show us how to install it, but\n\n863\n00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.590\nyet we are flexing the muscles on\nthe clock on this episode for sure.\n\n864\n00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:00.360\nBut before we go, got anything else,\nany other piece of advice for us?\n\n865\n00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:05.150\n>> Yeah, just be really careful, like if\nyou have installed NMap, don't run out and\n\n866\n00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:07.510\nstart scanning all\nthe systems in the world.\n\n867\n00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.020\nYour service provider might frown on that,\neven if you have permission to do it.\n\n868\n00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:16.440\nYou want to be real careful to not\nscan anything that you don't have\n\n869\n00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.370\nspecific permission for.\n\n870\n00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.780\nAt least not until we get\nlater in the episode.\n\n871\n00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.550\nWe want to get you more\nfamiliar with things.\n\n872\n00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.870\nDon't go crazy, we don't want you wielding\nthis like a kid with a gun, right?\n\n873\n00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:32.680\nIt can be dangerous so set up a scanning\nsystem, scan your own systems.\n\n874\n00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.905\nScan one, two, seven.\n\n875\n00:44:33.905 --> 00:44:34.600\n.0.0.1, right?\n\n876\n00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.490\nStart scanning your own platform,\nsee what you can find,\n\n877\n00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.840\nand start playing around with it.\n\n878\n00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.470\nAnd, we'll definitely get you better\nable to use it in subsequent episodes.\n\n879\n00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.080\nBut that's about it.\n\n880\n00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.700\nWes, it should be ready to rock.\n\n881\n00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.680\n>> I tell you, Dan, thank you for\nall that information.\n\n882\n00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.750\nAnd thank you to our viewers our there for\nwatching, but we're going to go ahead and\n\n883\n00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.230\ntake this time to sign out.\n\n884\n00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.649\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan\n\n885\n00:44:54.649 --> 00:44:55.557\n>> I'm Daniel Lowery\n\n886\n00:44:55.557 --> 00:44:58.041\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n887\n00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:05.750\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
