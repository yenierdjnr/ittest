show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:15.134\nThis particular overview is actually meant\nto help you to not only get ready for\n\n4\n00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:19.568\nthe exam, but to also prepare you for\nimplementing Office 365 for\n\n5\n00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:23.105\na company or for\na customer that you may have, as well.\n\n6\n00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:24.315\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n7\n00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.714\ntake a look at what you have to do\nto get through this exam, as well.\n\n8\n00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.282\nSome of the exam details.\n\n9\n00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.776\nI simply took a search engine that\nI launched up through my browser.\n\n10\n00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.981\nTyped in exam 70-346.\n\n11\n00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.581\nThat number is gonna be very helpful for\nyou.\n\n12\n00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:41.741\nAnd also take a note at\nthe exam title itself.\n\n13\n00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.559\nManage Office 365 Identities and\nRequirements.\n\n14\n00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.528\nBoth of those are going to be necessary\nas you register for the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:53.731\nWhether it's through Pearson VUE\nonline portal itself, or\n\n16\n00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.685\nwhether you go to a Pearson VUE center and\nyou decide to register manually,\n\n17\n00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.602\nboth of those are actually\ngonna be used at some point.\n\n18\n00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:03.448\nThey're either gonna ask you for\nthe name of the exam, or\n\n19\n00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:05.939\nthey're gonna ask you to\nverify the exam number,\n\n20\n00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.058\nyou'll need to know both of them to make\nsure that you can get scheduled in, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:14.417\nThis particular exam itself\nhas been around for a long,\n\n22\n00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:19.532\nI say a long time, a while,\nat least since February of 2014.\n\n23\n00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:24.825\nSo it is a relatively mature\nexam in terms of what we see.\n\n24\n00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:30.315\nNow that doesn't mean that this exam\nthough in what we've also prepared for\n\n25\n00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.989\nin the show is going to be old, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.263\nAnd that is because, as of June 2017,\n\n27\n00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.719\nthe exam itself has been updated.\n\n28\n00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.457\nSo make sure you check this out, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:49.991\nIf you're actually of course past June of\n2017, you're gonna need to download and\n\n30\n00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:54.806\nreview all of the changes that were\nmade to the exam objectives themselves.\n\n31\n00:01:54.806 --> 00:02:00.129\nThe exam objectives are actually broken\nout into six different domains divided\n\n32\n00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.464\nup by different percentages that you may\nactually end up seeing as well, okay?\n\n33\n00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:10.242\nSo those domains of course will divide up\ninto skills that you'll need to be aware\n\n34\n00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:10.746\nof too.\n\n35\n00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:15.424\nNow just when we talk about those\nskills and understanding them,\n\n36\n00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:19.861\nit doesn't mean that those\nare limited to those skills only.\n\n37\n00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.807\nIf I flip on over here,\nthis is where that link takes you.\n\n38\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.647\nHere is the latest exam\nobjectives according\n\n39\n00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.411\nto the site that they've changed here, and\n\n40\n00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:34.132\nyou can see where it says, document\nshows changes to scoping statements.\n\n41\n00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:38.196\nThese changes were\neffective as of June 2017.\n\n42\n00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:43.170\nYou wanna make sure that you are prepared\nfor this exam, not only by, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.244\nunderstanding what\nthe skills measured are, but\n\n44\n00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:48.754\nnotice who should take the exam itself.\n\n45\n00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:49.912\nSo at this point,\n\n46\n00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:54.408\nyou have to actually be experienced\nin a couple of different things.\n\n47\n00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:57.148\nAnd this is what I want\nyou to focus in on.\n\n48\n00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:01.840\nCandidates should have experience\nwith Office 365 admin center, and\n\n49\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.231\nunderstanding of Microsoft Exchange\nOnline, Skype for Business,\n\n50\n00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:11.625\nSharePoint Online, Office 365 ProPlus,\nand Windows Azure Active Directory.\n\n51\n00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.875\nAnd it also includes experience\nin service descriptions,\n\n52\n00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.710\nconfiguration integration services,\nwith identity management and\n\n53\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.264\non premises infrastructure, to support\nsome of the business requirements here.\n\n54\n00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:28.110\nSo this is not meant for someone is just\nsaying, hey, I'm just jumping at this and\n\n55\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.792\nI should just jump right into Office 365.\n\n56\n00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:35.064\nNow it doesn't mean that can't do that,\nknow it means it's gonna be much more\n\n57\n00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:39.142\ndifficult for you if you don't have\nsome of those skills already set down,\n\n58\n00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:43.111\nor if you're not familiar with\nthe products that are listed right here.\n\n59\n00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:48.361\nSo my suggestions, of course,\nis that before you end up just taking even\n\n60\n00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:53.609\nthis first exam, make sure you also\ntake a look at the 70-347 skill\n\n61\n00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.687\nobjectives there as well to understand\nhow you enable the services and\n\n62\n00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:03.679\nmanage those services as well to get\nall those things up an running and\n\n63\n00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.636\nunderstand those products too, okay?\n\n64\n00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:10.541\nSo that way you'll be familiar with some\nof the requirements that they're talking\n\n65\n00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.498\nabout this way too.\n\n66\n00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:15.301\nSo once you have that in your mind and\nyou're ready to go,\n\n67\n00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:19.598\nhere are some of the episodes\nthat we should be covering, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:24.196\nUnderneath the provisioning,\nwe talk about provisioning tenants, okay?\n\n69\n00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.366\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n70\n00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.992\nAnd how do we begin to do it?\n\n71\n00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.953\nAnd what are the best practices for those?\n\n72\n00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:34.307\nWe also begin to add in and configure,\nof course, a custom domain.\n\n73\n00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:39.762\nAnd when we talk about, we'll also talk\nabout of course the use of DNS ownership.\n\n74\n00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:43.610\nWe'll also take a look at registering\nthose DNS records the way that we need\n\n75\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.230\nto as well.\n\n76\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.809\nAnd the updating and\nverifying domain settings.\n\n77\n00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:52.427\nThe ones that we see in red are of course,\nthe added end objectives that we had,\n\n78\n00:04:52.427 --> 00:04:57.560\nor a change objective that has been\nput in place since June of 2016.\n\n79\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.866\nWe also go through planning a pilot and\n\n80\n00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.686\nwe'll take a look at\ndelegating pilot users.\n\n81\n00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:07.191\nWe will also end up running some of these\ndifferent tests here that they talk about.\n\n82\n00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:12.043\nAs well as understanding the use\nof the fast track Office to\n\n83\n00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:15.516\nonboard Office 365 services as well.\n\n84\n00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:19.749\nWe'll also of course configure all\nof our DNS records that we need to,\n\n85\n00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.933\nwe'll take a look at that as well and\nmake sure that they are working.\n\n86\n00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.067\nClient connectivity, we will of\ncourse address client connectivity.\n\n87\n00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:32.877\nWe'll talk about the ability to protect\nall of our files and documents the way\n\n88\n00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:37.771\nthat we want to with the integration with\nthe Azure Rights Management as well.\n\n89\n00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.279\nAnd we'll see some of\nthe set up templates for\n\n90\n00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.926\nRights Management to\nhelp us to protect email.\n\n91\n00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:48.569\nWe'll manage the administrator\nroles that are there and available.\n\n92\n00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.844\nWe'll talk about those roles briefly,\nmake sure you\n\n93\n00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:56.666\nunderstand where you configure those for\nyour users inside of Office 365.\n\n94\n00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:59.797\nWe'll also take a look at\ncloud identity management,\n\n95\n00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:04.372\nwhere we configure password management,\nas well as user and security groups.\n\n96\n00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:08.226\nWe'll also of course,\nimplement the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n97\n00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:11.285\nThis is probably the biggest update,\n\n98\n00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:15.785\nat least since the last domain\nwas updated here, okay?\n\n99\n00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:19.801\nNow it's not that they didn't call this\nout on a previous iteration of the exam.\n\n100\n00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:23.941\nIt's just that the tool may have been\navailable, but the tool may not have been\n\n101\n00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:27.023\navailable, because it was in\ntransition for a long time.\n\n102\n00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:30.379\nBut we'll actually get that\nimplemented when we prepare for\n\n103\n00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.424\nsingle sign on Active Directory for\nAzure AD Connect.\n\n104\n00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:36.049\nWe'll set up the Azure AD Connect\ntool itself and\n\n105\n00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:39.827\nthen we'll actually show you how to\nmanage Active Directory users and\n\n106\n00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:43.176\ngroups using the Connect tool\nwhile it's actually in place.\n\n107\n00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:46.600\nAnd we'll talk about the topology\nthat needs to be implemented as well.\n\n108\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.806\nThen probably the largest scope of\nwhat we'll deal with is the idea here\n\n109\n00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:57.622\nof using and implementing single sign-on\nbetween your on-premises domain,\n\n110\n00:06:57.622 --> 00:07:02.222\nas well as your Azure Active\nDirectory Federation Services and\n\n111\n00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.413\nyour domain up there as well.\n\n112\n00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:08.629\nSo we will, of course, plan out for\nActive Directory Federation Services.\n\n113\n00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.542\nWe'll install and manage the actual\nfederation server itself,\n\n114\n00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:17.174\nincluding the certificates, and\nwe'll also implement a proxy server too.\n\n115\n00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:20.797\nSo we'll see all that information that's\ngoing to be available there, too.\n\n116\n00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:25.632\nLastly, of course, we'll spend a little\nbit of time taking a look at reports.\n\n117\n00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:28.432\nWe'll talk about how we\ncan monitor to health,\n\n118\n00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:32.633\nand isolate service interruption\nusing the tools that are available.\n\n119\n00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:36.462\nIn this last section we also see some\nof these tools are deprecated and\n\n120\n00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:40.767\nwe'll mention some of the things that\nwe might have to be able to understand.\n\n121\n00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:44.412\nBut even though they're deprecated they're\nstill called out on the exam objectives.\n\n122\n00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.874\nSo make sure you pay attention there too.\n\n123\n00:07:46.874 --> 00:07:52.124\nBut overall though, if this seems like\nwhat you're heading your career towards,\n\n124\n00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:56.474\nor you're gonna be managing Office 365,\nthis is a great place for\n\n125\n00:07:56.474 --> 00:08:00.155\nyou to begin to understand how\nto get all that configured.\n\n126\n00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:04.544\nAnd you'll also be able to prepare for\nthis first exam and your MCSA.\n\n127\n00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:08.237\nSo, if you're ready to do that,\njoin us in the very next episode.\n\n128\n00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:14.379\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:27.110\nAnd with us today in the studio\nis we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.370\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.980\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, and\nCherokee, thank you for\n\n10\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.740\nhaving me on the show as we jump into,\nof course, Office 365.\n\n11\n00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.110\nNow, remember that as you\nmight have actually kind of\n\n12\n00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.240\ngone the old school way like I did.\n\n13\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.090\nThere was no Office 365 when I first\nstarted out in system administration.\n\n14\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.542\nBut now, today, with the proliferation of\ncloud technologies that are out there,\n\n15\n00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:52.820\nOffice 365 has kind of\nthe predominant one that you'll see\n\n16\n00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.530\nthat most organizations are adopting.\n\n17\n00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220\nAnd they're actually giving\nsuch good traction on it,\n\n18\n00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.678\nthat you're starting\nto see a wave of this.\n\n19\n00:00:59.678 --> 00:01:03.600\nAnd it was actually very incumbent\nupon you as a system admin to not\n\n20\n00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.670\nonly take advantage of that technology\nthat's gonna be available to you.\n\n21\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.690\nBut also to help you as you might actually\nhave to set this up for a customer,\n\n22\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.030\nor for your own company, so that they\ncan begin using the products as well.\n\n23\n00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.280\nAnd that's what we're here to do\nas we begin this series as well.\n\n24\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.550\nSo, don't forget that there's actually\na two-fold objective, right then?\n\n25\n00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.002\nFirst and foremost, of course, is to\nhelp you to prepare for the exam itself,\n\n26\n00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:36.470\nwhich is a very highly test, wordy exam\nthat requires a lot of concentration.\n\n27\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.870\nThere's a lot of parts in this exam\nthat you'll be paying attention and\n\n28\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.660\nwe'll make sure we're focusing on those.\n\n29\n00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.980\nBut secondly, also, of course, is to\nmake sure that you know how to actually\n\n30\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.920\nget this started, if your company\nis starting to move to Office 365.\n\n31\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.090\nOr if you're actually just being asked to\ntake a look at what needs to happen and\n\n32\n00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.630\nwhether or not it's possible.\n\n33\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.320\nAnd that's what we want to do right now\nis actually take a look at this idea of\n\n34\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.920\ngetting it ready.\n\n35\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.870\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so what if I've\nidentified the need for this shift or\n\n36\n00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.850\nthis change within my organization?\n\n37\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.030\nWhat are those steps,\nwhat do they involve?\n\n38\n00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.800\nOr what do they look like?\n\n39\n00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.500\nWhat should I prepare myself for?\n\n40\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.740\n&gt;&gt; Right when it comes down to it,\n\n41\n00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.290\nright, a lot of planning has to go\ninto before that decision is made.\n\n42\n00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.800\nSo don't mistake this idea of just saying,\nwe'll just start one, right.\n\n43\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.650\nYou wanna make sure that as we start to\ntake a look at the idea of provisioning\n\n44\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.090\nOffice 365 for our company,\n\n45\n00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.470\nour organization, or\nmaybe even for somebody else.\n\n46\n00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.360\nYou're working for somebody else and\nyou're having to provision it for\n\n47\n00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.260\nthem, but you wanna keep in mind some very\nsimple things that are going to happen.\n\n48\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.610\nAnd it's not super technical at\nthe beginning here, but it does require\n\n49\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.720\na little bit more attention to\ndetail than what we might think of.\n\n50\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.730\nSo first and foremost, right, you'll\nfind out that there's a lot of different\n\n51\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.610\nOffice 365 plans that are going\nto be available to you.\n\n52\n00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.480\nAnd you'll need to pick one\nthat fits your organization\n\n53\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.810\nas what you want to be able to do.\n\n54\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.590\nAnd we're gonna show you how\nto do that of course, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.670\nAnd take a look at some of the options\nthat you have right there.\n\n56\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.810\nYou also need to select\na valid email account.\n\n57\n00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.320\nNow, this is where it becomes\na little bit stranger,\n\n58\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.430\nit's not that you can't use\nyour work email for this.\n\n59\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.020\nBut because you're setting it up for\nmaybe a provisioning or\n\n60\n00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.120\na pilot of some sort, you really\ndon't wanna use it for anything else.\n\n61\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.192\nSo the recommendation here is that you\nmight actually set up an email account\n\n62\n00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.260\nthat is just for this.\n\n63\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.830\nI know it sounds strange, but\n\n64\n00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.340\nit's something that you're really gonna\nwant to have if you do that okay.\n\n65\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.195\nWe also, of course then at that point,\n\n66\n00:03:34.195 --> 00:03:37.130\nwould actually select either\nwe're gonna start a trial.\n\n67\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.930\nOr if your company has already decided\nthey're going to push ahead with this and\n\n68\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.800\nthey wanna start off\nwith something simple.\n\n69\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.370\nYou can do that as well and\nthat we'll also get us set up too.\n\n70\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.513\nAnd then have some\norganizational information on\n\n71\n00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:52.189\nhand as well as being able to\ncomplete the signup process.\n\n72\n00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.797\nAnd the great thing about what we're going\nto do, at least at the beginning here,\n\n73\n00:03:55.797 --> 00:03:58.630\nis we're gonna show you how\nto set some of this stuff up.\n\n74\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.180\nBut make sure that as we do so,\nyou'll actually see that it's free.\n\n75\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.510\nBut that we take the right steps to make\nsure that we understand what's going on\n\n76\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.610\nand that we can do this\non our own if we need to.\n\n77\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.200\nSo that's what we want to prepare for\nright at the beginning here,\n\n78\n00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.980\nis to take the time to understand\nwhat those processes are.\n\n79\n00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.382\nBecause if you misstep you might find\nyourself a little bit more of kind of in\n\n80\n00:04:20.382 --> 00:04:23.896\na conundrum than you think, so that's\nwhat we're gonna do from this point.\n\n81\n00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.601\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's say go through and\nI run through that checklist.\n\n82\n00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:30.237\nI make sure I have everything that it feel\nthat I need to go ahead and get started,\n\n83\n00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.193\nare there any obstacles that I\nmay encounter along the way here?\n\n84\n00:04:33.193 --> 00:04:34.922\n&gt;&gt; Yes some basic obstacles for\n\n85\n00:04:34.922 --> 00:04:38.318\nevery first time person\ntrying to set up Office 365.\n\n86\n00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:41.197\nIs that you might find out something\nespecially when it comes to\n\n87\n00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.330\nthe organizational information.\n\n88\n00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.080\nThat a name that you're requesting\nto use is not going to be available.\n\n89\n00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.090\nAnd that's something that you\nhave to actually think about you\n\n90\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.270\nmight have to come up with\na combination of something.\n\n91\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.800\nBut the great thing is, it doesn't really\nmatters so much at the very beginning.\n\n92\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.840\nBut it matters that you pick one that\nyou're gonna be able to kinda go,\n\n93\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.360\nall right, I can work this for a little\nbit of time and get it ready to go.\n\n94\n00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.903\nLater on, we'll talk about implementing\ncustom domain names which we can't change.\n\n95\n00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:13.175\nAnd the other thing is you're\nactually gonna pick a name for\n\n96\n00:05:13.175 --> 00:05:16.330\nthe initial start of this\nthat won't be changed either.\n\n97\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.932\nSo don't make it something so\n\n98\n00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:21.979\ninsanely complex that you're gonna be\nwondering like why did I make that?\n\n99\n00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.168\n&gt;&gt; Why did I make it so long?\n\n100\n00:05:23.168 --> 00:05:25.350\nI have to type it out everything,\nevery single time.\n\n101\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nyou've actually seen us do this as well.\n\n102\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.810\nSo in another series that we've done for\nthe 70-347 exam.\n\n103\n00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.194\nThe name that we actually ended up using,\nbecause it was already previously set up\n\n104\n00:05:39.194 --> 00:05:42.386\nfor us, was one that was set up,\nbut it was so long of a name.\n\n105\n00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:47.354\nOfficeProDemoCo imagine having to\ntype that in every single time when I\n\n106\n00:05:47.354 --> 00:05:51.650\nwanted to do something in\nterms of the authentication.\n\n107\n00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.330\nWell, that sounds great\nbecause it's really specific.\n\n108\n00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.780\nBut that was a lot to type in every\nsingle time when I was doing PowerShell\n\n109\n00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.670\nand I had to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.111\nSo you wanna be careful about\nthe name that you choose.\n\n111\n00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:01.681\n&gt;&gt; Good advice.\n\n112\n00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:04.057\n&gt;&gt; But you might find yourself\nactually realizing something else,\n\n113\n00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:06.620\nthat even if you choose something\nlike that it might not be available.\n\n114\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.110\nSo have a few of them in mind that you\nwant to be able to use as well, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.486\nAlso, if you're setting this up,\nlet's say, for\n\n116\n00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:15.214\na government entity instead, okay.\n\n117\n00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:18.749\nThere's a couple of different requirements\nhere that you may actually want to make\n\n118\n00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.320\nsure that you understand.\n\n119\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.250\nOne, even if you're setting this up for\na pilot, and you go, this is a joke thing,\n\n120\n00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.980\nI don't really care,\nI'm gonna name it something offensive.\n\n121\n00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.180\nIt's not gonna allow you to actually\nput some type of offensive name, so\n\n122\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.550\nno profanity in the name.\n\n123\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.330\nI know I shouldn't have\nto warn about that, but\n\n124\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.470\nlet me make sure that we do that.\n\n125\n00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.540\nAlso, no secret names, okay.\n\n126\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.740\nI know that it sound weird, but\nanything that is on Office 365's.\n\n127\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.870\nI don't know why I started to say that but\non Office 365 restricted list\n\n128\n00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.140\nyou won't be able to actually use so don't\nthink that your gonna set up something.\n\n129\n00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.007\nAnd I mean this like CIA dot,\n\n130\n00:06:56.007 --> 00:07:00.200\nyou know you're probably not gonna be able\nto do that or White House dot anything.\n\n131\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.600\nIt's probably not gonna allow you\nto do something like that, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.910\nSo nothing like that in restriction and so\n\n133\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.550\nbe careful especially if you're using\nsome type of government account.\n\n134\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.360\nAnd we'll talk about the idea of\na government account just briefly in\n\n135\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.250\na little bit, too, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.320\nThe other thing that you'll also\nsee as you create these names,\n\n137\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.150\nthough, if it's already been used somehow.\n\n138\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.539\nIt's gonna tell you, yeah,\n\n139\n00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.880\nyou can't use that,\nyou can't do this, you can't do that.\n\n140\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.720\nSo be ready to change that if you\nneed to as we get started as well.\n\n141\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.400\nAnd then, lastly pretty much,\noverall, okay,\n\n142\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.570\nis most of the time we think that this\nshould just take a moment or two.\n\n143\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.270\nIn other words,\nit should be just quick lightning flash.\n\n144\n00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.025\nSometimes, it can be, but because\nyou're working with cloud technologies.\n\n145\n00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:49.156\nThe thing that may get you is that, if you\nare provisioning this for the first time,\n\n146\n00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:53.300\nnot just as a trial but let's say that you\ngo okay, we're rolling the dice on this.\n\n147\n00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.657\nWe're not going to worry about\na particular type of pilot or\n\n148\n00:07:56.657 --> 00:07:59.150\nanything, we're just gonna roll with it.\n\n149\n00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.120\nIt may take some time in provisioning\nbecause in the background of everything\n\n150\n00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.961\nthat's running Or Office 365.\n\n151\n00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:08.780\nIt's pretty much got\na SharePoint infrastructure.\n\n152\n00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:13.130\nAnd if you think SharePoint\nis slow when it's local,\n\n153\n00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.170\nit's slow when it's in the cloud as well.\n\n154\n00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.360\nSo allow yourself to take a little\nbit of time in the provisioning, and\n\n155\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.857\nit may take up to an hour.\n\n156\n00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:27.399\nIt may take a little bit longer, depending\non how close you are to a particular\n\n157\n00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:33.480\ncenter that is housing where all of the\nOffice 365 servers actually are gonna be.\n\n158\n00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.820\nSo let's make sure that\nwe understand that.\n\n159\n00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.580\nBut those are some of the different\ngotchas that could get us along the way.\n\n160\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so now that we've talked about\nsome of those prerequisites, I mean,\n\n161\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.688\nthose gotchas there,\nthose seem pretty black or white.\n\n162\n00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:46.397\nBut are there any kind of supplemental or\n\n163\n00:08:46.397 --> 00:08:49.173\npractical advice that you could\ngive us when we go and set this up?\n\n164\n00:08:49.173 --> 00:08:51.698\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\nas we start to set this up,\n\n165\n00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:55.854\nthis is gonna go a little bit more\nold school for us than anything else.\n\n166\n00:08:55.854 --> 00:08:57.151\nDocument along the way,\n\n167\n00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.260\nmake sure you write down the information\nthat you're gonna be using.\n\n168\n00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.560\nWrite down whatever it is that you've\nalready typed in and you've clicked.\n\n169\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.815\nBefore you click on the next screen,\nmake sure you write down the information.\n\n170\n00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:12.710\nBecause you'll find out that you may\nneed some of it later on, you may not.\n\n171\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.332\nSome of the stuff that you can\neasily know is perfectly fine, but\n\n172\n00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:18.950\nsome stuff you always\nhave to kind of remember.\n\n173\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.710\nSo the first time I ended\nusing the OfficePro demo.co,\n\n174\n00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.680\nI was just at OfficePro demo, and\nI kept forgetting the co at the end.\n\n175\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.288\nSo I finally just had to\nwrite that thing down.\n\n176\n00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:32.260\nSo we wannna make sure that we document\nalong the way in that process as well.\n\n177\n00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.240\n&gt;&gt; And now, I know you worked with Jo for\nITIL shows here, Ronnie.\n\n178\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.450\nAnd one of the big things that she\nwould always stress when teaching\n\n179\n00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.812\nITIL was we don't care how you do it,\njust do it.\n\n180\n00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:41.557\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n181\n00:09:41.557 --> 00:09:45.404\neven when it comes to something like\nauditing for compliance reasons,\n\n182\n00:09:45.404 --> 00:09:47.210\ndocumentation is so important.\n\n183\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.460\nBecause you can say, hey,\nthis is how I document, and\n\n184\n00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.880\nthen provide that information.\n\n185\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that information is great,\nnot only for setting that up for\n\n186\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.770\nsomebody else that's gonna be using it.\n\n187\n00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.560\nBut in the end, because there's so many\ndifferent things that we can get set up\n\n188\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.730\nand that needs to be set up, documentation\nat the beginning is really gonna help\n\n189\n00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.820\nsomebody else understand the process.\n\n190\n00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.180\nAnd help you understand that better\nas well, so document along the way.\n\n191\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.690\nAlso, before you submit anything for\nfinality,\n\n192\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.900\nright, make sure somebody\nreviews the information.\n\n193\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.240\nYou'd hate to actually set everything up,\nespecially with that domain name or\n\n194\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.440\nthat name you're gonna use for\n\n195\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.690\nyour pilot type of testing, account that\nyou're going to end up doing, right?\n\n196\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.307\nIs that, if it's wrong, people are gonna\nbe a little bit upset about that.\n\n197\n00:10:29.307 --> 00:10:33.410\nSo always get somebody that\ncan review the information.\n\n198\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.862\nYes, we wanna go with that,\nor can we change that?\n\n199\n00:10:35.862 --> 00:10:39.010\nIf there's a time for change,\nit's before you enter it in.\n\n200\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.809\nBecause, especially at the very beginning,\nin the setup, if you make a mistake, and\n\n201\n00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:47.818\nyou accidentally you twist two letters\naround, the I and the A, the I and\n\n202\n00:10:47.818 --> 00:10:48.706\nthe E, right?\n\n203\n00:10:48.706 --> 00:10:52.130\nAnd you go, wait, our company name's\nsupposed to be the other way.\n\n204\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.855\nWell, too late, once you've actually set\nit up, that's what it's gonna be now.\n\n205\n00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:59.140\nCould you kind of scrap that and\nthen just start all over on a new account?\n\n206\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.990\nWell, I guess you technically could, but\n\n207\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.350\nyou're still wasting resources at that\npoint, so don't do that as well, okay?\n\n208\n00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.200\nIf nothing else, right, in terms of\na good thing to always do as well,\n\n209\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.650\nis that with the way that\nOffice 365 is today, and\n\n210\n00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.280\nthe way it's been growing phenomenally,\nOffice 365 is there to help you.\n\n211\n00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.330\nSo get help from Microsoft\nwhen you need it.\n\n212\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.910\nIf you run into a point where you're like,\nI'm stuck here,\n\n213\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.340\nI don't know exactly\nwhat I should enter in,\n\n214\n00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.620\nI'm not sure what's happening,\ngo ahead and give Microsoft a call.\n\n215\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.120\nThe great thing about the way\nthat they're doing the support\n\n216\n00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.590\nis that if they can get to you right then,\nthey'll get to you.\n\n217\n00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:34.060\nBut if not,\nthey'll give you a call back and\n\n218\n00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.580\nthey'll give you a time limit that\nyou're expecting a call back.\n\n219\n00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.860\nNow, when I say that, okay,\ndon't expect it to be within five minutes,\n\n220\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.520\nnot unless they tell you it's\nwithin five minutes or so.\n\n221\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.240\nUsually, for me, if I've actually made\na call to them, it's been about 24 hours,\n\n222\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.230\nif I need to.\n\n223\n00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.420\nBut everything that we're doing\nright here at the beginning,\n\n224\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.210\nIt's not exactly technically difficult.\n\n225\n00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.690\nBut if you do run into a snag,\ndon't hesitate to call them, why?\n\n226\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.230\nBecause they want you\nas a customer as well.\n\n227\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.400\nSo don't think that you're bothering them.\n\n228\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.970\nGo ahead and give them a call, and they're\nmore than happy to help you, to walk\n\n229\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.660\nthrough that process, because you're a\npotential customer for them as well, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.070\nSo that's another thing.\n\n231\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.350\nThe other kind of thing that we\nalso want to just keep in mind,\n\n232\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.760\nright, is that when you set up\nan account at the very beginning, okay,\n\n233\n00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.249\nyou're not gonna use that account,\npretty much, ever again after this.\n\n234\n00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:26.550\nI know that sounds weird, but you don't\nwant to actually use that account,\n\n235\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.656\nbecause that is a full global\nadministrative account for everything.\n\n236\n00:12:29.656 --> 00:12:34.105\nSo you want to make sure you're set up for\ndelegated administration, and\n\n237\n00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:38.020\nthat means don't limit all\nthe stuff just to one account.\n\n238\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.230\nMake sure you think about this idea of who\n\n239\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.490\nam I gonna delegate some of these\ndifferent roles to as we get started.\n\n240\n00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.500\nOr, who's the next person, whatever it\nis gonna be, that you're gonna find\n\n241\n00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.450\nsomeone that's gonna be willing to\nwalk with you through this process.\n\n242\n00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.780\nAnd who you can delegate\na lot of this into, okay?\n\n243\n00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.940\nSo thinking of all that, okay,\nof just that information I went through,\n\n244\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.840\nit's a lot of talking,\nit's a lot of explanation.\n\n245\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.610\nBut it's foundational to what we want to\nunderstand before we get started here.\n\n246\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.425\n&gt;&gt; All right, so can we go ahead and\nget started here, Ronnie?\n\n247\n00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:10.288\nI know we've been talking about it.\n\n248\n00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:14.530\n&gt;&gt; I know, yep, yeah, lets go ahead and do\nthat, and then we'll jump right into it.\n\n249\n00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.460\nSo lets take a look at my computer screen\nhere, and we'll start off right here.\n\n250\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.540\nSo all you have to do\nis open a web browser.\n\n251\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.540\nI'm using Chrome.\n\n252\n00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.800\nYou can use whatever web\nbrowser you want to.\n\n253\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.570\nIf you run into snags,\nI suggest you use Chrome, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.750\nEverything that I've done so\nfar has worked in Chrome.\n\n255\n00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.930\nI haven't seen any problems in Firefox.\n\n256\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.050\nEvery once in a while, in Microsoft Edge,\nI did, but even that, I think,\n\n257\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.210\nhas actually resolved itself now.\n\n258\n00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.836\nBut if you have any issues,\n\n259\n00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:46.459\nrunning it in Chrome has actually\nseemed to be what I needed.\n\n260\n00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:49.226\nBut you can run whatever\nbrowser you want to.\n\n261\n00:13:49.226 --> 00:13:56.565\nMake sure you browse over here\nto https://www.office.com.\n\n262\n00:13:56.565 --> 00:13:59.860\nAnd when we start off,\nit doesn't look like much, right?\n\n263\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.950\nBut what we want to do\nis go into Products.\n\n264\n00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.750\nAnd then under Products,\n\n265\n00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.730\nnotice that you have a couple of different\naspects of what you choose to do, okay?\n\n266\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.200\nSo of course, for the home user,\nwe're probably not gonna do that one for\n\n267\n00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.840\nright now, because that's usually\nindividuals and households, like it says.\n\n268\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.310\nAnd we're not so worried about setting\nthat up and administrating that one.\n\n269\n00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:29.150\nBut more than likely, ours is actually in\nthis line right here, for business or for\n\n270\n00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.055\neducation.\n\n271\n00:14:30.055 --> 00:14:32.730\nOkay, so\nthese are probably the ones that we'll\n\n272\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.140\nend up taking a look at a little bit more.\n\n273\n00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.250\nSo if I now come down,\nlet's select See all business, instead.\n\n274\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.710\nLet's take a look at some of\nthe different ones that we can do.\n\n275\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.027\nNow that we're right here under Office\n365 is built for your business,\n\n276\n00:14:47.027 --> 00:14:48.749\nlet me see plans and pricing.\n\n277\n00:14:50.637 --> 00:14:54.940\nAnd once I get here, okay, you'll see\nit actually does bring us to this\n\n278\n00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.560\nparticular page right here, where it\ncompares all of the actual products.\n\n279\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.290\nNow, you do want to make\nsure that wherever you go,\n\n280\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.270\nyou'll probably see this regionalized,\nso whatever your product is for\n\n281\n00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.450\nyour region that you're in,\nthat's what you'll have access to.\n\n282\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.590\nSo it may be different from\nwhat we have access to.\n\n283\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.770\nRight here, I'm in Florida,\nin the United States, so you may see that.\n\n284\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.880\nSo at this point, notice that\nthe business side has been selected.\n\n285\n00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.700\nAnd then when I scroll down and I look\nthrough here, it looks like that there's\n\n286\n00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.780\nreally three basic, I don't wanna say\nbasic, three business type plans, right?\n\n287\n00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.565\nThe Office 365 Business,\nOffice Premium, Office Essentials.\n\n288\n00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:34.950\nAs I scroll down through,\n\n289\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.340\nit gives me all the details and\nwhat services are included.\n\n290\n00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.597\nAnd if I select More details,\nI can continue to see.\n\n291\n00:15:42.597 --> 00:15:47.640\nAnd what we want to do is actually see\nwhich one would fit us best, okay?\n\n292\n00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.620\nAnd that's what we're really looking for,\nis which one of these would normally fit\n\n293\n00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.157\nus best in what our\nbusiness is going to be?\n\n294\n00:15:55.157 --> 00:15:58.340\nNow, you'll actually notice that there's\na couple of different things here.\n\n295\n00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.789\nWhen I get down to the bottom,\nyou see these links right here.\n\n296\n00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:08.880\nOkay, and the great thing is two of\nthem have this try for free link.\n\n297\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.030\nNotice that this third option over here,\nwhich is the Office\n\n298\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.080\nbusiness essentials, it does not\nhave a try for free link, okay.\n\n299\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.390\nSo these actually are probably what we'll\ntake a look at depending on what we're\n\n300\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.905\nsetting up for.\n\n301\n00:16:24.905 --> 00:16:28.366\nBut, let's say that hey,\nwhen I take a look at all of this,\n\n302\n00:16:28.366 --> 00:16:33.021\nI start noticing that here, it really\ndoesn't have everything that I wanted.\n\n303\n00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:38.071\nSo for example one license covers\nfive phones, five tablets, five pcs,\n\n304\n00:16:38.071 --> 00:16:42.397\nor host online video conferencing\nmeeting for 250 people.\n\n305\n00:16:42.397 --> 00:16:44.807\nWhat if I actually needed\nto go a little bit larger?\n\n306\n00:16:44.807 --> 00:16:47.633\n&gt;&gt; And just from taking\ndifferent Microsoft exams,\n\n307\n00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.658\nit kind of seems like I don't know,\nI haven't sat for\n\n308\n00:16:50.658 --> 00:16:55.233\nthis exam but sometimes being able to\nidentify the features within the different\n\n309\n00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:59.260\neditions is a important element\nof this exam situation as well.\n\n310\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's pretty much one of those things,\n\n311\n00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.660\ndo you actually know what\nit is that you need here?\n\n312\n00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.630\nBut notice, like this.\n\n313\n00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.240\nLet's say that maximum users here, 300,\n\n314\n00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.470\nand they're suggesting,\nif I have that or less,\n\n315\n00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:15.630\nI'm probably gonna select this particular\nplan, this Office 365 Business Premium.\n\n316\n00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.820\nLet's say that what I suggested before,\nI want larger than this, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.308\nIt doesn't seem like it really\ngives me any other options except\n\n318\n00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:27.296\nthat if I look over here to the left,\nokay,\n\n319\n00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:32.720\nthen I can see this link over here\nwhich says options for the enterprise.\n\n320\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.410\nSo if I select options for\nenterprise, now.\n\n321\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.170\nNow we'll change this up.\n\n322\n00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.380\nAnd you'll always have this helpful\nperson, whoever it is today, right here.\n\n323\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.410\nOops, let me see.\n\n324\n00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.380\nDon't want to select everything.\n\n325\n00:17:45.614 --> 00:17:46.933\nIt's not gonna allow me-\n&gt;&gt; This is your LinkedIn?\n\n326\n00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:47.610\n&gt;&gt; Do upgrade, of course not.\n\n327\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n328\n00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.995\n&gt;&gt; This guy-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n329\n00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:49.840\n&gt;&gt; Now wants to chat.\n\n330\n00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.100\nSo I've been trying to get\naway from the chat person.\n\n331\n00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.309\nBut you always see this kind of chat\nfeature pop-up because they want to be\n\n332\n00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:56.254\nvery helpful-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n333\n00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:57.049\n&gt;&gt; To you.\nSo that\n\n334\n00:17:57.049 --> 00:18:00.250\nyou understand what the suggestion is.\n\n335\n00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.720\nSo the bottom line of course normally\ncomes down to what people are looking for\n\n336\n00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.870\nwhich is how much is it gonna\ncost per user, per month?\n\n337\n00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.360\nBut it depends on what\nyour company really needs,\n\n338\n00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.698\nis what we want to end up seeing it.\n\n339\n00:18:11.698 --> 00:18:16.340\nSo if we take a look at suggestion you'll\nsee it lines up exactly like the business\n\n340\n00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.880\nplans do down here at the bottom and\nthen it of course includes a little bit\n\n341\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.650\nmore information as we\nstart to scroll down.\n\n342\n00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.910\nSo there's the E1, E3, and the E5.\n\n343\n00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.440\nEach one,of course,\nis a little bit more, right?\n\n344\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.664\nWe can kind of guess, the one that\ncost $35 a month gives you everything,\n\n345\n00:18:34.664 --> 00:18:37.898\nthis one gives you just about\neverything here on the E3 and\n\n346\n00:18:37.898 --> 00:18:40.552\nthen the enterprise one\nis business services.\n\n347\n00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:45.018\nEmail, file sharing, it looks like\ngood but notice that on the E1,\n\n348\n00:18:45.018 --> 00:18:48.406\nOffice applications are not\nincluded on the E1, so\n\n349\n00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:53.103\nif I wanted Cherokee in my organization,\nto not only be able to use Office\n\n350\n00:18:53.103 --> 00:18:57.569\n365 online in the cloud, but\nI wanted her to be able to download and\n\n351\n00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:01.958\nuse like Word and Excel onto her computer,\nwell, the E1 license is\n\n352\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.523\nprobably not gonna be enough if I\nwanted everyone in my organization.\n\n353\n00:19:06.523 --> 00:19:13.570\nInstead I might have to take a look at\nthis which includes this idea here too.\n\n354\n00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:19.690\nWhich is the feature of Office 365 Pro\nPlus and that's the addition of the entire\n\n355\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:25.630\nMicrosoft Office Suite, that you'll pretty\nmuch see in the Office 365 plans as well.\n\n356\n00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.270\nSo let's say that we're\ngonna select this E3.\n\n357\n00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.210\nNow once I get to E-3,\nand I want to begin,\n\n358\n00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.360\nI'm gonna click on more details,\nscroll on down.\n\n359\n00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.650\nAnd you will have the time,\n\n360\n00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.110\nyou can explore this yourself in terms\nof some of the differences between them.\n\n361\n00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.590\nIf I scroll all the way down to the\nbottom, you want to select this try for\n\n362\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:48.060\nfree, is where we want to\ngo at the very beginning.\n\n363\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.364\nSo once we select that,\n\n364\n00:19:49.364 --> 00:19:52.860\nthis is where it will bring you\nto is this Enterprise trial E3.\n\n365\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.095\nNow do you have to do the trial\nif you are ready to buy?\n\n366\n00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.620\nNope, you don't have to at all, okay,\nyou can simply go ahead and buy it but\n\n367\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.580\nif you're saying hey,\nI want to try this out.\n\n368\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.660\nIt gives you 30 days,\nI believe is what it gives you.\n\n369\n00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.770\nThen, once you have that, you'll actually\nbe able to use all the features for\n\n370\n00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.410\nabout 30 days, and then you'll be cut\noff from that, is what will happen.\n\n371\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.380\n&gt;&gt; Which also could be helpful,\nRonnie, maybe if you haf to perform\n\n372\n00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.130\na demonstration for some buy in from\nupper management, or something like that.\n\n373\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.170\nJust to show them how this tool works,\nand kind of help your argument or\n\n374\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.250\nyour suggestion.\n\n375\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n376\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.820\nAnd so let's talk about some of these\nelements here as we start to go into this\n\n377\n00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.980\nas well.\n\n378\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.880\nMake sure you pay attention to where\nyou are actually gonna be, right?\n\n379\n00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.270\nI know this seems kind of like\na no-brainer on a big deal, but\n\n380\n00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.300\nnotice they have it highlighted.\n\n381\n00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.840\nThey give you a link here.\n\n382\n00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.780\nAnd they;'re pretty much saying you need\nto pick the right region because that's\n\n383\n00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.170\ngonna send you to the closest data center,\n\n384\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.200\nthat's gonna send you to wherever\nthe servers actually are.\n\n385\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.610\nSo you select in the United States but\nyou're over there in Malaysia somewhere,\n\n386\n00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.490\nnow that's a long distance to go-\n&gt;&gt; Performance issues.\n\n387\n00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, performance issues,\nbut whatever else that it is,\n\n388\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.810\nespecially if you're\ndownloading a lot of stuff.\n\n389\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.480\nIt's gonna take a long time, so\nmake sure you pick the right one.\n\n390\n00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.830\nFrom this point, notice it actually wants\nyou to enter in first name and last name.\n\n391\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:15.440\nNow, this is where you cannot actually\nput in generic information like admin1,\n\n392\n00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.780\nadmin2 and stuff like that.\n\n393\n00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.640\nYou really need to enter in a name that\nsomeone can contact if they need to.\n\n394\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.060\nSo for example let me go ahead and\nI'll just enter mine in for right now.\n\n395\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:32.490\nAnd now it's asking me for a particular\nbusiness address if I'm to do this.\n\n396\n00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:42.100\nNow this is where it's recommended that\nyou set up your own email address.\n\n397\n00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.620\nAnd I'm only using this for\nthis setup here.\n\n398\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.830\nSo I've selected this one which\nI actually did create just for\n\n399\n00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.150\nthis purpose right now.\n\n400\n00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.130\nAnd to be able to do this\nI'm running it like this.\n\n401\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.770\nOkay?\n\n402\n00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.290\nNow this email account, right,\nyou really don't want it mixing in and\n\n403\n00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.560\ndoing everything else.\n\n404\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.470\nThis is actually a very important email\naddress even though it's actually\n\n405\n00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.770\ninitially helping us get set up.\n\n406\n00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.910\nThe very first user that logs in that's\ngonna be this particular user as well.\n\n407\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.940\nAnd because of the way that it is,\nand I'll emphasize it again later on,\n\n408\n00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.430\nthis person will become the first\nglobal administrator as well, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.020\nSo you'll actually have that information.\n\n410\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.680\nAnd then you'll probably go ahead and\ndisable that at some point too.\n\n411\n00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.790\nLater on, or you'll make sure that\nit doesn't have access anymore.\n\n412\n00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.810\nBut you'll need it in case your\nactual true global administrator,\n\n413\n00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.090\nwhoever you delegate that access to,\nthey forget their password?\n\n414\n00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.080\nGuess where it's gonna be sent to,\n\n415\n00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.450\nit's gonna be sent back to\nthis particular email address.\n\n416\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.910\nSo make sure you know what\nthe password is to this thing.\n\n417\n00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.750\nAnd the other recommendation\nbehind this as you do this,\n\n418\n00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.060\nis you don't this just protected with just\npassword, they recommend the two-factor\n\n419\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.050\nauthentication for whatever email\naccount you're gonna use here too.\n\n420\n00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:52.720\nSo make sure you do that.\n\n421\n00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.870\nAnd then of course whatever\nyour business phone number is.\n\n422\n00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.340\nSo let me, let's see,\nI can't remember the.\n\n423\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.590\nWe'll just use ours here.\n\n424\n00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:07.020\n6006900 and then the company org,\nthis is where you can actually\n\n425\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:13.260\nenter in whatever you want to and\nthen do ITProTV demo network.\n\n426\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.260\nNow don't worry about that for right now.\n\n427\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.560\nThat's just about whatever\nthe just giving some information.\n\n428\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.370\nThen, of course, you would select\nthe size of your organization,\n\n429\n00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.180\nI told you we'd kind of go a little\nbit larger, and then click next here.\n\n430\n00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.500\nAnd this is when you want to\nbe a little bit more careful.\n\n431\n00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.150\nNow, at this point you also\nwant to change this up here.\n\n432\n00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.340\nWhen you create this idea of your user ID,\n\n433\n00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.720\nthis is the one you want to\nactually give something like this.\n\n434\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.565\nAnd you'll see that I've walked through\nthis already a couple of times here to\n\n435\n00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:47.146\nmake sure that we could do this.\n\n436\n00:23:47.146 --> 00:23:51.117\nBut notice how I have this\nas global admin, okay, so\n\n437\n00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:56.804\nI might actually do it global admin or\nlike something like this if I want to,\n\n438\n00:23:56.804 --> 00:24:02.435\nO 365 global admin, whatever it might\nbe you want to be able to do that.\n\n439\n00:24:02.435 --> 00:24:07.742\nAnd then it's gonna also create\nthe domain name right here at the end.\n\n440\n00:24:07.742 --> 00:24:11.725\nNotice it attaches its own Microsoft\ndot com at the beginning and\n\n441\n00:24:11.725 --> 00:24:14.763\nthis is the area you want\nto enter in what you can.\n\n442\n00:24:14.763 --> 00:24:21.280\nNow, in previous times,\nI've actually used ITProTv.demo before.\n\n443\n00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.354\nAnd if that's not good you'll actually see\nright here it will tell us right here,\n\n444\n00:24:25.354 --> 00:24:28.082\nit is not available try\na different name at this point.\n\n445\n00:24:28.082 --> 00:24:32.230\nAnd even the one that I did use\nearlier here, if I select this one.\n\n446\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.552\nIt's not available because it's\nalready just been used as well.\n\n447\n00:24:36.552 --> 00:24:39.412\nSo this is where you\nmight have to go through\n\n448\n00:24:39.412 --> 00:24:43.632\na couple different iterations to see,\nlet me see if I tab over.\n\n449\n00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:44.411\nThere we go.\n\n450\n00:24:44.411 --> 00:24:48.506\nSo there you go you have this ability to\nmake sure that you can change that and\n\n451\n00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:51.042\ngive it what you actually\nwant to be able to do.\n\n452\n00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:55.458\nAnd then from that point on, as you click\ncreate my account you'll go ahead and and\n\n453\n00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:57.261\naccount will be created for you.\n\n454\n00:24:57.261 --> 00:25:02.061\nAnd now I'm not going that far because\nI've already created this account,\n\n455\n00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:05.072\nis what you've actually\nended up seeing here.\n\n456\n00:25:05.072 --> 00:25:09.023\nSo at this particular point, you want\nto make sure that what will happen on\n\n457\n00:25:09.023 --> 00:25:11.701\nthe very next screen when\nyou create the account,\n\n458\n00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:15.741\nit's gonna give you two pieces of\ninformation that you want to write down.\n\n459\n00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:19.740\nIt's gonna give you this\nas being the email address\n\n460\n00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.930\nthat will become the global\nadministrator address.\n\n461\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.801\nAlso, it's going to give you\nthe login to the portal.\n\n462\n00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:34.211\nThat portal, that place that you\nlogin to your Office 365 account.\n\n463\n00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:39.536\nYou'll actually see it may even, after it\nflashes up on the screen just briefly,\n\n464\n00:25:39.536 --> 00:25:44.493\nand may go ahead and try and log you in/\nSo I'm not going to do that right now.\n\n465\n00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:49.191\nI'm just gonna kinda skip that right\nthere and the now let me zoom in so\n\n466\n00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:50.661\nthat we can see this.\n\n467\n00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:55.665\nSo when we get all that information,\nyou'll end\n\n468\n00:25:55.665 --> 00:26:00.802\nup seeing that it would\nbe portal.office.com.\n\n469\n00:26:00.802 --> 00:26:04.438\nAnd that's what we'll actually end\n\n470\n00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:09.251\nup going is right to that\nparticular point here.\n\n471\n00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:12.873\nAll right, now, once you get\nhere to this particular log in,\n\n472\n00:26:12.873 --> 00:26:16.290\nyou've got a couple of\noptions that you'll have.\n\n473\n00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:20.088\nHere's the old way,\nthat actually is right here and\n\n474\n00:26:20.088 --> 00:26:23.900\nthen you have this new sign in experience,\nTry Now.\n\n475\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:30.863\nThey of course would want you to actually\ndo both but we'll try it now for now..\n\n476\n00:26:30.863 --> 00:26:34.401\nAnd then this point,\nnotice that it went ahead and\n\n477\n00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:39.212\ngave me a global admin and this is where,\nlet's see if I click Next.\n\n478\n00:26:39.212 --> 00:26:42.532\nAnd now it's gonna say hey do I\nwant to enter the proper password.\n\n479\n00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:45.760\nAnd I'm using a password\nmanager to help us out here, so\n\n480\n00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.174\nit's actually there and I click Sign In.\n\n481\n00:26:51.112 --> 00:26:54.042\nAnd this is where it should bring you to,\nokay.\n\n482\n00:26:54.042 --> 00:26:58.420\nNow a very first initial\ndemonstration of this, right.\n\n483\n00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.983\nIs that you won't have anything, so\n\n484\n00:27:00.983 --> 00:27:04.712\nnow initially it will give\nyou some guidance, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:04.712 --> 00:27:09.064\nFirst and foremost, it asks two different\nquestions for us that we will need\n\n486\n00:27:09.064 --> 00:27:12.464\nto take a look at and answer as we\nget the rest of this set up for\n\n487\n00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:15.050\nthe very first steps\nin the administration.\n\n488\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.183\nBut up to this point you'll see it's\nnot really a difficult process.\n\n489\n00:27:19.183 --> 00:27:23.470\nBut it may actually be a little\nbit confusing at times.\n\n490\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.807\nIf you don't have all that information\nthen you're not ready to go.\n\n491\n00:27:26.807 --> 00:27:30.940\nMake sure you get the valid information\nthat you want to use that is associated\n\n492\n00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.683\nwith the way that everything is for\nyour business.\n\n493\n00:27:33.683 --> 00:27:38.149\nGet the right name setup, create\na valid user account that has to be,\n\n494\n00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:41.692\nwell usually a name,\nthat's going to be recognized.\n\n495\n00:27:41.692 --> 00:27:45.910\nIt can't be like a set of generic name,\nlike admin one, or anything like that.\n\n496\n00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.173\nSo, create a particular email\naccount that will help us out.\n\n497\n00:27:49.173 --> 00:27:54.074\nBut once we get to this point, it means we\nare now ready to continue setting up what\n\n498\n00:27:54.074 --> 00:27:55.964\nwe need to to get started here.\n\n499\n00:27:55.964 --> 00:27:58.950\nBut Cherokee, it looks like that\nI am running out of time for\n\n500\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.611\nthis episode, so we'll probably need\nto continue on to a part two here.\n\n501\n00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:03.977\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, sounds like a plan, Ronnie.\n\n502\n00:28:03.977 --> 00:28:07.818\nWe'll pick back up with a part two so\nwe can finish up this installation, and\n\n503\n00:28:07.818 --> 00:28:09.151\nI think that's about it.\n\n504\n00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:11.477\nDo you have any final thoughts for\nthis show?\n\n505\n00:28:11.477 --> 00:28:12.448\n&gt;&gt; Well, just remember,\n\n506\n00:28:12.448 --> 00:28:15.413\nwe went over a lot of material at\nthe beginning because it's important,\n\n507\n00:28:15.413 --> 00:28:18.350\nyou wanna get it set up correctly for\nthe very first time that you log in.\n\n508\n00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.013\nThat's what needs to be done.\n\n509\n00:28:20.013 --> 00:28:23.762\nSo take a little bit of time, notice that,\ntake a look at the procedure that we did,\n\n510\n00:28:23.762 --> 00:28:26.405\nyou'll notice it's not\nvery difficult at all.\n\n511\n00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:28.746\nBut then,\nit should lead you to where we are, and\n\n512\n00:28:28.746 --> 00:28:32.691\nthat means we're ready to proceed on, and\nsee what else is next in configuring and\n\n513\n00:28:32.691 --> 00:28:35.172\ngetting Office 365 ready for\nmy organization.\n\n514\n00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:36.631\n&gt;&gt; Great Ronnie, thank you for\nyour time today.\n\n515\n00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.603\nAnd thank you for joining us as well, but\n\n516\n00:28:38.603 --> 00:28:42.211\nstay tuned you don't wanna miss this\nsecond part we have headed your way.\n\n517\n00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:43.820\nFor this show,\nwe'll go ahead and sign out.\n\n518\n00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.201\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n519\n00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.030\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n520\n00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.287\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n521\n00:28:48.287 --> 00:28:54.825\n[MUSIC]\n\n522\n00:28:54.825 -->

00:00:07.961\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.804\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.804 --> 00:00:17.710\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Managing Office\n365 exam 70-346 series.\n\n6\n00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.720\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.051\nSo this is actually a part\ntwo of continuation.\n\n8\n00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:26.180\nWhere we were looking at our\nprovisioning steps and best practices.\n\n9\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.810\nAnd back with us today in studio\nis we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.580\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie,\nhow is it going?\n\n11\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.550\n&gt;&gt; And it is going well Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back as well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.140\nHow are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.\n\n15\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.850\nI've got my coffee.\n\n16\n00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.343\nI'm ready to go and-\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n17\n00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:41.196\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in the last show you\ndid show us how to get started,\n\n18\n00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:45.270\nyou gave us some really great advice\non what we needed to know before hand.\n\n19\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660\nAnd we begin that process, are we going\nto pick right back up in this show?\n\n20\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.820\nThat seems logical, right?\n\n21\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.360\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\nThat's pretty much what we're doing.\n\n22\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.410\nWe want to make sure that we\ncover everything that we need to,\n\n23\n00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.440\nbut now that we've kind of\ngotten everything in there,\n\n24\n00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.450\nyou'll notice that it is a relatively\nlimited aspect in what we're seeing.\n\n25\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.690\nSo how we actually get to that\npoint where we can start using it?\n\n26\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.370\nWell, we're gonna start\nfrom this point here.\n\n27\n00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.110\nSo here it is, last thing that we did in\nthe previous episode of course was to get\n\n28\n00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.420\nstarted where we showed you how to create\nthe tendency at the very beginning.\n\n29\n00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.239\nAnd now you'll see it's pretty\nmuch it's limited telling me hey,\n\n30\n00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:21.657\nis this a brand new Office 365 license?\n\n31\n00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:23.241\nThey don't see any apps.\n\n32\n00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.262\nHere's what you do,\n\n33\n00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:27.570\nyou essentially follow their steps\nhere and it will get you started.\n\n34\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.250\nNow before we do that,\n\n35\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.330\nlet's take a look at some of the places\nwhere the information that we typed in or\n\n36\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.640\nI typed in earlier actually\nends up showing up.\n\n37\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.610\nIf I take a look in the upper right hand\ncorner right here, where you see my name.\n\n38\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.800\nI was the one that typed that in as far as\nthe information I filled out on the form.\n\n39\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.075\nIf I just hover over that for\na moment to click on it,\n\n40\n00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:55.365\nif I click on it now you'll notice\nthat it actually did take my name, and\n\n41\n00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.615\nnotice the email account it ended\nup producing right here, okay?\n\n42\n00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:06.013\nAnd as I hover over it you'll see it's a\nGlobalAdmin@itprotvdemoco.onmicrosoft.com\n\n43\n00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:10.673\nand that's because that's the way\nthat it ended up putting this.\n\n44\n00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:13.904\nNow that name will never\nchange from this point on, and\n\n45\n00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:18.470\nthe way that we have this tenant\nprovision in the office 365 cloud.\n\n46\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.340\nThat name will forever be\nassociated with whatever I do.\n\n47\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.070\nEven if I have my own domain name and\n\n48\n00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.150\nI choose it'll be something different\nthen I will have my own domain name.\n\n49\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.970\nIf I choose that here's the way\nthat office 365 sees it.\n\n50\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.770\nIs right here which is the Office Pro\ndemo co on microsoft.com and\n\n51\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.410\nwe'll see where we can shorten that\nto make it easier for us to use.\n\n52\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.090\nBut overall though in\nMicrosoft it will be that way.\n\n53\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.210\nIf I select my account here, and\nI'm not gonna show you anything so\n\n54\n00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.190\nI should, there we go.\n\n55\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.340\nOkay, so it's from right here we can\nof course see the individual account.\n\n56\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.856\nAnd the subscriptions that are assigned,\nsecurity and privacy, App permissions,\n\n57\n00:02:56.856 --> 00:02:57.545\nyou name it,\n\n58\n00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:01.939\nand the personal info, now you can see\nwhere we added in some information.\n\n59\n00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.720\n&gt;&gt; Do we get to add a photo for you?\n\n60\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.440\n&gt;&gt; Not right now.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n61\n00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.170\n&gt;&gt; So, yes you can but sure, yeah.\n\n62\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.440\nSo here is the other information.\n\n63\n00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.080\nYou'll see there is the alias\nwhich is global admin.\n\n64\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.610\nHere's the phone number that I entered in,\nand\n\n65\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.760\nyou'll notice it's a fake phone number,\nbut that way you can see that.\n\n66\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.220\nNow, the phone number is important\nespecially if you start setting things up\n\n67\n00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.570\nto talk to, confirm or verify for you.\n\n68\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.340\nI had it initially text me, okay,\nto prove that I wasn't a robot.\n\n69\n00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.420\n&gt;&gt; Like a security code-\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n70\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.085\n&gt;&gt; To get that input.\n\n71\n00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.746\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in that she makes you one of\nthose last initial steps when it says\n\n72\n00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:35.180\ncreate the account.\n\n73\n00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.970\nIt says prove that you're not a robot and\nyou'll either enter in a CAPTCHA and\n\n74\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.940\nyou also either put a phone number in or\nyou'll tell it, call me or text me or\n\n75\n00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.050\nsomething like that.\n\n76\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.098\nAnd then that will give\nyou that information and\n\n77\n00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:50.795\nyou'll be able to do that as well and then\nyou'll enter verification code in the end.\n\n78\n00:03:50.795 --> 00:03:52.570\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're a robot right?\n\n79\n00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.330\nAnd if you're a robot even\nI won't be able to do it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, and\n\n81\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.390\nthat point here, unless you're Mr.\nRobot I guess if you're Mr.\n\n82\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.520\nRobot you can do that,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, new show starts tomorrow.\n\n83\n00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.973\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so at this point, but there is\nsome of the information that we have,\n\n84\n00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:10.353\nokay, now, if I go back though to where\nwe were a little bit earlier here,\n\n85\n00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:12.354\nlet me see if I can get out of this.\n\n86\n00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:14.277\nBack to the screen that I was on,\n\n87\n00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:18.841\nhere's kind of the default screen that\nyou end up seeing, the first thing is\n\n88\n00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:23.221\nnotice this is a brand new account I\nneed to assign products here, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:27.968\nSo all I have to do is select assign\nproducts and this is what will\n\n90\n00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:32.905\nnow give me the ability to do so,\nit took me into the admin center.\n\n91\n00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.792\nWhich is part of Office 365 and\nit's called the admin center.\n\n92\n00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:40.889\nAnd then it also allowed me to go\ninto where it says active users from\n\n93\n00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:41.995\nthe home, okay?\n\n94\n00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:46.220\nNow, it doesn't mean that you can't do\nthis manually but let's just use their\n\n95\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.705\nparticular context and\nshow how this ends up working for us here.\n\n96\n00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:50.761\nSo here it is.\n\n97\n00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:58.070\nRonnie, global admin notice that it says\nthat the status right here is unlicensed.\n\n98\n00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.660\nSo it's not seeing any licensing\nproduct with tested user right now.\n\n99\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.040\n&gt;&gt; Is that because you signed it for\nthe free trial for this account?\n\n100\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.240\n&gt;&gt; I did at this point but I haven't\nassigned any particular product to it.\n\n101\n00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.340\nBut let's go ahead and take a look at what\nelse we can do here, as we start to see.\n\n102\n00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.270\nSo if I click on it, which is what I did,\nhere's the details of course for\n\n103\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.830\nthis particular user.\n\n104\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.500\nNotice the username,\nproduct license, group membership,\n\n105\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.790\nthat's something that's actually gonna be\nvery interesting for us a little later on,\n\n106\n00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:34.320\nthe sign-in status, sign-in is\nallowed global administrator, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.730\nAnd of course display name,\noffice phone, and notice this.\n\n108\n00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.800\nIf I wanted to set up multi factor\nauthentication, I could even go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.000\nset up multi factor\nauthentication if I wanted to.\n\n110\n00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.920\nBut what I want to do is I want\nto take a look at the idea,\n\n111\n00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.220\nthe product license in a little bit And\nassign a product there.\n\n112\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.010\nBut I want us to take a look\nat the roles here, okay?\n\n113\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.930\nCuz that's what we need to talk about.\n\n114\n00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.360\nSo, once we have a global\nadministrator and\n\n115\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.530\nhe set up the account,\nthe best practice recommendations,\n\n116\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.710\nit's pretty much all you really\nwant to use this account for.\n\n117\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.080\nNow, doesn't mean he can't do\neverything else with his account, yes.\n\n118\n00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.200\nYes you can.\n\n119\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.100\nBut if I come over here to the\nright-hand-side where you see this word\n\n120\n00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.070\nedit and I click on edit.\n\n121\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.930\nI want you to notice something about\nthe very first global admin account.\n\n122\n00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.820\nOkay.\n\n123\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.330\nChoose the admin role that you\nwant to assign to this user.\n\n124\n00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.070\nLearn more about admin roles.\n\n125\n00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.380\nYou can't edit your own security settings.\n\n126\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.780\nSo not all settings are available here.\n\n127\n00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.550\nWell I'm the global admin and\nI can't edit my own security settings.\n\n128\n00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.510\n&gt;&gt; So who can?\n\n129\n00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n130\n00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.380\nthat's actually a good question here\nof what actually has to be done\n\n131\n00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.510\nif we are going to start to take a look\n&gt;&gt; At\n\n132\n00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.660\ntrying to get some of this stuff\nsetup in the way that we want to.\n\n133\n00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.140\nSo it means that we actually\nhave to create different\n\n134\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.730\ntypes of administrators\nthat will help us out.\n\n135\n00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.573\nNow not everybody of course has to\nbe 100% a different administrator,\n\n136\n00:07:04.573 --> 00:07:08.294\nthere's actually one, two, three,\nfour, five, I'm trying to make\n\n137\n00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:13.118\nsure tell you right, there's actually five\ndifferent Office 365 administrator roles.\n\n138\n00:07:13.118 --> 00:07:15.347\nAnd you can assign them to\neither the same person or\n\n139\n00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:18.780\nyou can assign them to multiple\npeople depending on what you need.\n\n140\n00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.472\nSo, I'm going to just add in\nanother user at this point, and\n\n141\n00:07:23.472 --> 00:07:26.241\nthis time we'll select Cherokee.\n\n142\n00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.590\nAnd there's the display name and then-\n&gt;&gt; I get to be an admin?\n\n143\n00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.684\n&gt;&gt; Sure thing, why not.\n\n144\n00:07:32.684 --> 00:07:33.339\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n145\n00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.810\n&gt;&gt; And\nthere's a couple of different ones here.\n\n146\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:42.133\nI'm actually gonna make Cherokee\nthe GlobalAdmin01, who knows?\n\n147\n00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:42.789\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n148\n00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.016\n&gt;&gt; So we'll do that for right now.\n\n149\n00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:51.433\nSo at this point, GlobalAdmin01 United\nStates, location, contact information,\n\n150\n00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:56.390\npasswords gonna be auto generated,\nthat's perfectly fine here.\n\n151\n00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.460\nThat's what I want,\nlet me create this password here.\n\n152\n00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.021\nAnd then, actually auto generated.\n\n153\n00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:03.300\n&gt;&gt; And then make them change\nit when they first log on.\n\n154\n00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.226\n&gt;&gt; Yeah something like that.\n\n155\n00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:06.440\nLet's do that.\n\n156\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.650\nAfter you select add,\nwe'll show you a confirmation\n\n157\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.910\nwhere you can provide up to five email\naddresses to send to and then the role.\n\n158\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.940\nBecause I am signed on as global\nadministrator, now notice that here it is\n\n159\n00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.042\nyou can assign different roles to\ndifferent people in your organization.\n\n160\n00:08:23.042 --> 00:08:25.077\nI'm gonna make Cherokee a global admin.\n\n161\n00:08:25.077 --> 00:08:28.773\nAnd it's right over here it tells us\na little bit more about these features as\n\n162\n00:08:28.773 --> 00:08:31.890\nwell, let me see if I can\nscroll that up a little bit.\n\n163\n00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.542\nGlobal admins have access\nto all admin features and\n\n164\n00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:37.325\nare the only admins who can\nassign other admin roles.\n\n165\n00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:41.003\nThat's actually a good piece of\ninformation to make sure that we have,\n\n166\n00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:44.866\nmake sure all global admins in your\norganization have a mobile phone number\n\n167\n00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:47.717\nand an alternate email address\nin their contact info.\n\n168\n00:08:47.717 --> 00:08:51.760\nWhich they'll be using for\nresetting password information etc, okay?\n\n169\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.609\nSo at this particular point here,\nthat's what we'll have as well and\n\n170\n00:08:56.609 --> 00:08:59.907\nthen an alternate email address for\nright now.\n\n171\n00:08:59.907 --> 00:09:01.050\nLet's see here.\n\n172\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.930\nI'm just gonna send it back to,\nI'll send it back to me.\n\n173\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.430\nThat'll work.\n\n174\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.020\nActually, we'll do it\njust at my work email.\n\n175\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.520\nThat'll work.\n\n176\n00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.380\nJust to try to give us what we need.\n\n177\n00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.250\nClick add and\nnow I'm adding the user here, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:26.461\nSo when we do this I can select\nsend an email and close.\n\n179\n00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:31.347\nNow if I log off and log back in as\nCherokee at this point, now the problem\n\n180\n00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:36.252\nis I have to go and get all of her email\nstuff and get all that set up first.\n\n181\n00:09:36.252 --> 00:09:38.428\nBut I should be able to then go in and\n\n182\n00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:41.540\nactually change Ronnie's\naccount if I need to.\n\n183\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.490\nSo that gives us that ability\nto be able to do that as well.\n\n184\n00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.090\nSo that's one of the weird things\nat the very beginning here.\n\n185\n00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.450\nEven though I could just continue\nto use my account to do so,\n\n186\n00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.240\nthe recommendation is not to do that but\nto assign another blow admin.\n\n187\n00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.530\nAnd then from this point we can\nassign some of the other global admin\n\n188\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:02.230\nfeatures as well.\n\n189\n00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.100\nSo, I'm just gonna do this for right now,\n\n190\n00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.180\nwhich is pretend like we did that and\nthen click edit.\n\n191\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.560\nAnd now notice I can select\ncustom administrator.\n\n192\n00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.610\nAnd now you'll see, hey,\nRonnie you said five.\n\n193\n00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.255\nLook at all the different customized,\n\n194\n00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:21.620\nadministrator privileges that\nare available at this point, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.210\nSo another global admin.\n\n196\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.510\nHe can actually change that or\n\n197\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.370\nshe can change this to be\nwhat we need it to be, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.910\nSo Billing administrator\nis exactly like is sounds.\n\n199\n00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.550\nThey're responsible of course for\nmaking purchases,\n\n200\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.460\nmanaging subscriptions,\nsupport tickets, you name it.\n\n201\n00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.230\nMonitoring the actual\nservice help of the tendency,\n\n202\n00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.490\nthe billing administrator has\nthe ability to do all that, okay.\n\n203\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.213\nLet's skip over to dynamics for right now\nand we'll kind of do a couple of the other\n\n204\n00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:53.440\nones that are really essential for\nus right now, okay?\n\n205\n00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.070\nThe Password administrator\nof course is another one.\n\n206\n00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.100\nNotice that I can actually make Cherokee,\nif I wanted to both of these here.\n\n207\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.029\nAs a password administrator,\n\n208\n00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:07.787\nnormally this is the one that resets\nmost Office 365 account passwords.\n\n209\n00:11:07.787 --> 00:11:11.516\nAnd even other password\nadministrator's passwords, so\n\n210\n00:11:11.516 --> 00:11:14.850\nthey can actually do\nthat if they choose to.\n\n211\n00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.880\nBut the password administrator\ncannot reset global admin passwords,\n\n212\n00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.250\nnor can they set the actual\nservice administrator password.\n\n213\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.680\nNor the billing administrator\npassword as well.\n\n214\n00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.473\nSo it's kind of unusual, but\n\n215\n00:11:29.473 --> 00:11:34.281\nthis one is pretty much the one that you\nwant assigned of people like supervisors\n\n216\n00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:38.106\nessentially is what we wanna do\nwhen some office user comes in.\n\n217\n00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:42.260\nAn end user comes in and says hey,\nI need to have my password reset.\n\n218\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.920\nWell, you don't wanna give them\nthe global administrative privileges.\n\n219\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.054\nAnd you don't want to give them\nbilling administrator privileges,\n\n220\n00:11:48.054 --> 00:11:50.701\nyou just want them to be able\nto actually reset passwords.\n\n221\n00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:52.321\nYou're probably gonna do that.\n\n222\n00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:55.345\n&gt;&gt; Nice way to delegate a task\nwithout giving too much control there.\n\n223\n00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:58.794\n&gt;&gt; Right and for the same thing, I didn't\nmention the billing I thought it was\n\n224\n00:11:58.794 --> 00:12:01.826\nobvious but let me make sure we\nunderstand this one as well right.\n\n225\n00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:05.123\nThe people that are gonna be\nsetting up additional accounts, so\n\n226\n00:12:05.123 --> 00:12:09.710\nif Cherokee ends up being a supervisor and\nshe says, we just hired five new people.\n\n227\n00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.310\nWhat Cherokee may not, but she may,\n\n228\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.870\nshe may have the ability to set that up,\nwhere she can add in her own people.\n\n229\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.420\nBut if not, she can just go to the billing\nadministrator and they are the ones that\n\n230\n00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.180\ncan essentially say, hey, let's go ahead\nand create a subscription for so and so.\n\n231\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.550\nTo be able to get added in as well, okay.\n\n232\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.680\nThe other one that we\nalso have just by default\n\n233\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:35.710\nis gonna be the service administrator,\nokay, the service administrator.\n\n234\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.040\nService administrator manages\nservice request of course,\n\n235\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.660\nthat means if I'm running email but\nI don't have my Skype from business,\n\n236\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.190\nthese are the ones that are going\nto be handling that request.\n\n237\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.110\nTo making sure that they have access\nto all the services that they need to.\n\n238\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.740\nAnd then lastly as far\nas the default one's go,\n\n239\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.100\nUser management administrator\nis another one.\n\n240\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.140\nThis one, the user management\nadministrator can pretty much do just\n\n241\n00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.290\nabout everything.\n\n242\n00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.850\nA just about, right.\n\n243\n00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.380\nThey can reset passwords, monitor\nthe actual tendency health they need to\n\n244\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.880\nmanage regular user accounts.\n\n245\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.580\nUser accounts groups as well\nas service requests but\n\n246\n00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.570\nthey cannot delete a global administrator.\n\n247\n00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.870\nThey can't create additional\nadministrator roles that they need to nor\n\n248\n00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:30.030\ncan they reset passwords for the billing\nadministrator, the global admin nor\n\n249\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.546\nthe actual service administrator either.\n\n250\n00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:37.950\nSo this user,\nmanagement administrator is once\n\n251\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:43.090\nagain to help manage end users more than\nanything that you end up seeing, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:48.490\nSo those are kind of the basic ones\nthat are really called out for\n\n253\n00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.740\nwhat we are talking about here.\n\n254\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.450\nNow what about these other ones?\n\n255\n00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.440\nThe Dynamics 365, this is all about\ntheir particular CRM process,\n\n256\n00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.820\ntheir customer management system.\n\n257\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.410\nOf course email administrators\ncan be exchanged, Skype for\n\n258\n00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.520\nBusiness for the communication, power BI,\n\n259\n00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.970\nagain another type of selling stuff that\nthey use for trending as well as reports.\n\n260\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.500\nAnd then SharePoint, the back and\nfor handling files and services.\n\n261\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.560\nAll those are there.\n\n262\n00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.114\nBut we'll that more in use in assigning\nthose Is gonna be in the Office 365 for\n\n263\n00:14:23.114 --> 00:14:25.260\nexam 7-347 shell, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.199\nSo you will see a sign in those there,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:32.730\nWe do need to have certain people\nthat have different roles there but\n\n266\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.736\nnormally the ones I at least have checked\nright here, along with the global\n\n267\n00:14:37.736 --> 00:14:42.370\nadministrator that you see These are kinds\nof the basic one's that we want setup\n\n268\n00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.670\nright at the beginning as we actually\nget everything else working.\n\n269\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.280\nSo understanding those\nparticular administrators\n\n270\n00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.360\nare really what helps us\nto get all of Office 365,\n\n271\n00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.140\nkind of administrated correctly\nright at the beginning, okay.\n\n272\n00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.618\nSo those are what we\nnormally end up seeing here.\n\n273\n00:15:00.618 --> 00:15:05.468\nAll right so now that we got at least\na handle on the different types of\n\n274\n00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:08.447\nadministrator accounts that are there,\n\n275\n00:15:08.447 --> 00:15:12.292\nlets go back into the Office 365 home for\na moment.\n\n276\n00:15:12.292 --> 00:15:17.228\nSo I'm gonna close out of this here\nwe will assign some products in\n\n277\n00:15:17.228 --> 00:15:21.101\na little bit if we have\nthe chance to be able to do so.\n\n278\n00:15:21.101 --> 00:15:24.490\nThe same place that we were just at,\nright?\n\n279\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.830\nWhen I hit the Assign Products over here,\n\n280\n00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.700\nI can do the same thing through the tiles\nthat you'll see under Good morning.\n\n281\n00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.180\nOkay, so notice that there's the,\nof course, Windows Store or\n\n282\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.570\nthe Microsoft Store here, or\nthe Office Store for all I know.\n\n283\n00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.490\nOkay, and then there's the Admin tile.\n\n284\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.630\nIf I select the Admin tab, notice that\nbrings me to the Admin center but\n\n285\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.860\nit gives me a different perspective and\nlook in terms of what we see.\n\n286\n00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.875\nNow notice that there is actually\nnothing showing up right here yet,\n\n287\n00:15:55.875 --> 00:16:00.174\nhowever on the left hand side I have this\nnavigation pane that expands out and\n\n288\n00:16:00.174 --> 00:16:01.197\nallows me to see.\n\n289\n00:16:01.197 --> 00:16:03.660\nThat I can use this as\njust a simple navigation.\n\n290\n00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.199\nI can click on Users.\n\n291\n00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:09.060\nI can go to Groups &gt; Resources,\nyou name it, I can have that.\n\n292\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:14.170\nAnd it will drop down into a menu format\nfor me or on the Home center itself.\n\n293\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.660\nYou can now see it styled in the same way,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.950\nNow from here,\nwe want to take a look briefly\n\n295\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.260\nat the idea of managing the actual\ntenant subscription itself.\n\n296\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.000\nSo the way that we do this, if we wanna\ntake a look at how much this is gonna cost\n\n297\n00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.080\nus, well, nothing right now\ncuz we're in a trial edition.\n\n298\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:40.379\nBut if I select Billing, Right here,\nand in the moment, remember\n\n299\n00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:44.740\nwe have to be a little bit patient\nbecause it is working in the cloud here.\n\n300\n00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.870\n&gt;&gt; Attaching their cloud, yeah.\n\n301\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:51.616\n&gt;&gt; Yep, sometimes I can make it do what\nit needs to by shifting it around.\n\n302\n00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:54.890\nBut notice it says, you don't have\nany subscriptions at this point.\n\n303\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.680\nSo there's nothing for me to build.\n\n304\n00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.950\nSo if I select Add subscriptions, you'll\nsee it would change this around again.\n\n305\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:08.730\nAnd now, it will bring me right here to\nwhat I want to be able to purchase, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:14.800\nSo at this particular point, this is where\nwe would scroll down, and we would select.\n\n307\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.423\nAnd what I want to do is I'm not gonna\nstick with the Small Business Suite at\n\n308\n00:17:18.423 --> 00:17:19.072\nthis point.\n\n309\n00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:22.460\nWe're gonna scroll down\ncuz I selected the E3 one.\n\n310\n00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.749\nI'm going to come over here and\ntake a look at the Office 365 Enterprise,\n\n311\n00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:28.502\nand this one is $20 a month.\n\n312\n00:17:28.502 --> 00:17:32.610\nThat's pretty expensive,\ndepending on your organization here.\n\n313\n00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.650\nBut if I scroll, not scroll down,\nif I hit this ellipsis button that's\n\n314\n00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.950\ndown here at the bottom,\nHover over there, I'm trying to.\n\n315\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.916\nI clicked on it,\nI can select Start free trial.\n\n316\n00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:52.510\nAnd now in a moment, it's gonna say,\nhey, here it is, confirm the order.\n\n317\n00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:56.760\nI have an Office 365 E3 trial for\n25 users.\n\n318\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.168\nDo I want to try now?\n\n319\n00:17:58.168 --> 00:17:59.140\nAnd there's my service address.\n\n320\n00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.970\nThis is the information that I\nentered in a little bit earlier.\n\n321\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.094\nI can select Try now.\n\n322\n00:18:07.178 --> 00:18:08.535\nAnd now it's checking it out.\n\n323\n00:18:08.535 --> 00:18:12.758\nSays, to confirm,\nhere is the order number.\n\n324\n00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.461\nAnd then use your license,\n\n325\n00:18:14.461 --> 00:18:18.172\nmake sure you assign them by\nediting them on the Users page.\n\n326\n00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:19.739\nAnd I'm gonna click Continue.\n\n327\n00:18:28.344 --> 00:18:31.743\nSo now it's gonna say,\nit gives us a little kind of setup here,\n\n328\n00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:35.250\ntelling us that it's actually\nincomplete at this point.\n\n329\n00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.954\nAnd what I need to do, so\nif I select Go to the setup.\n\n330\n00:18:40.671 --> 00:18:44.810\nNow notice it's gonna bring\nme into what it takes.\n\n331\n00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.050\nNow, what is it saying?\n\n332\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:50.150\nIt's saying, Ronnie, on this particular\nsubscription on your computer,\n\n333\n00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.900\ndo you want me to go ahead and\ninstall Office?\n\n334\n00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.550\nOr do you want me to set up the actual\nmail and everything else here?\n\n335\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.542\nAnd you'll notice it gives\nus an estimated time.\n\n336\n00:18:58.542 --> 00:18:59.750\n&gt;&gt; Time estimates.\n&gt;&gt; And, of course,\n\n337\n00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.670\nthe time that it takes to get started.\n\n338\n00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:06.390\nSo we can actually do all this from\nright here if we needed to, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.360\nNow the great thing is,\nif you now have users, and\n\n340\n00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.630\nwe're gonna be talking about\nthe pilot a little bit later on.\n\n341\n00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.250\nWe want them to understand what\nthis experience is like and\n\n342\n00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.490\nreport the feedback to us so\nthat they actually know.\n\n343\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.014\nBut we're not gonna fix this for\nright now.\n\n344\n00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:22.010\nWe're simply gonna scroll on back.\n\n345\n00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.603\nLet me see if I can get to here,\nthere we go, okay.\n\n346\n00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:33.130\nAll right, so we are gonna add in some\nusers and start doing this, okay?\n\n347\n00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.510\nNow at this point,\nlet me go back to Add a user.\n\n348\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.880\nOop, not Add a user,\nI want to go to Users, excuse me.\n\n349\n00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.580\nAnd now let's select both of these.\n\n350\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.183\nSo since we're unlicensed,\nI can now change and select Product.\n\n351\n00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:52.595\nAnd now it's gonna say, which of these\nproducts do I want to add in, and\n\n352\n00:19:52.595 --> 00:19:54.050\nwhat location?\n\n353\n00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.280\nSo if I want the Office 365 licence,\n\n354\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.720\nnotice I can select\npretty much everything.\n\n355\n00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.070\nAnd then for the end user,\nit depends on what you've set it up for.\n\n356\n00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.598\nYou might actually be able to\nturn off certain features.\n\n357\n00:20:09.598 --> 00:20:14.962\nIf you don't want the Microsoft Forms or\nthe PowerApps here, or the Planner,\n\n358\n00:20:14.962 --> 00:20:20.622\nor Sway, you can turn these features on or\noff depending on what you need.\n\n359\n00:20:20.622 --> 00:20:23.560\nNow you'll also see a couple\nof other ones, too.\n\n360\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.787\nNotice these actually require a Plan 2.\n\n361\n00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:29.964\nAnd that's essentially an extra\nadd-on here for Plan number 2,\n\n362\n00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:31.240\nif you select this.\n\n363\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.860\nI'm just gonna leave them all on for\nright now and click Save.\n\n364\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.108\nAnd the product has now been assigned.\n\n365\n00:20:41.918 --> 00:20:44.920\nAnd now in just a moment here, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.260\nWe hopefully will end up seeing\nsome of the information assigned or\n\n367\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.552\nI may have to refresh this.\n\n368\n00:20:49.552 --> 00:20:50.960\nLet's see, there we go, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.643\nSo now that I've refreshed the selection,\n\n370\n00:20:53.643 --> 00:20:57.620\nnow notice I have the Office\n365 Enterprise assigned.\n\n371\n00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.520\nNow, we'll probably not do that with the\nglobal administrator who first set it up,\n\n372\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.860\nbut you get the idea here.\n\n373\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.636\nSo if I select Cherokee and\nalso select the same thing.\n\n374\n00:21:10.747 --> 00:21:14.072\nAnd this is where you have to\nstart keeping track of these\n\n375\n00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:16.080\nparticular licensings as well.\n\n376\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.581\nCuz if not, you'll run out of those\nlicense before you realize it.\n\n377\n00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:23.994\nAnd then that's when you have to start\npaying a bit more cuz they will tell you.\n\n378\n00:21:26.392 --> 00:21:29.495\nHere everything else on\nCherokee showed up right away.\n\n379\n00:21:29.495 --> 00:21:31.692\nOffice 365 Enterprise.\n\n380\n00:21:36.737 --> 00:21:38.310\nSo there we go, okay?\n\n381\n00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.535\nNow when you do this,\nunderneath that Admin center, again,\n\n382\n00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:43.528\nif I select Admin center up at the top.\n\n383\n00:21:46.204 --> 00:21:49.476\nAnd if this was a billing cycle,\nyou would have your credit card or\n\n384\n00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:52.790\nwhatever it might be that\nyou actually are paying by.\n\n385\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.695\nThat would start showing up and would tell\nyou when you're actually gonna be billed\n\n386\n00:21:56.695 --> 00:21:58.720\nfor this and what your current billing is.\n\n387\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.700\nAnd it adds up pretty quickly\nif you are not careful.\n\n388\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.540\nBut because I'm actually doing the trial,\n\n389\n00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.940\nat this point, I am not gonna\nhave any balance at all, okay?\n\n390\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.680\nSo this is where we can\nactually begin to manage\n\n391\n00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.340\nour tenant subscriptions a little\nbit better as well, okay?\n\n392\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.630\nNow you can switch subscriptions\nif you happen to buy into more\n\n393\n00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.040\nof those products if you need to, but\njust realize that's what happens.\n\n394\n00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.905\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so I was thinking when you\nfirst switched subscriptions like, hey,\n\n395\n00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:30.860\nif Cherokee were a let go and\nwe hired someone to replace her.\n\n396\n00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.050\nBut you mean upgrading and changing,\nbut do I have flexibility there also?\n\n397\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.250\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so even Cherokee, even if you\nleft our organization at this point and\n\n398\n00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:42.780\nI need to claim that subscription back,\nI can.\n\n399\n00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.400\nI disable your account,\nI take that subscription away from you,\n\n400\n00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.720\nand then I reassign.\n\n401\n00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.550\nNow what happens if you put\nthat onto your home computer?\n\n402\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.610\nWell, that will work to a point, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.895\nBut next time it tries to update,\nit's not gonna update you.\n\n404\n00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:58.600\nIt'll actually give you the chance\nat that point for you to go in and\n\n405\n00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.600\nswitch subscriptions to one of those\nhome plans if you need to as well.\n\n406\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.790\nYeah, and you'll have to pay yourself.\n\n407\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.560\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, to be able to do that.\n\n408\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.770\nBut for right now,\nthis is what the option is.\n\n409\n00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.529\nIt gives you this ability.\n\n410\n00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:14.037\nAnd the great thing is if you're\nusing everything that's here,\n\n411\n00:23:14.037 --> 00:23:18.290\nbeing able to manage these subscriptions\nare pretty much kind of cool, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.310\nNow, the other part of this is to actually\ndeal with the very fact that what\n\n413\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:26.220\nCherokee was talking about is\nsomething that is essential and\n\n414\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.200\nimportant to us in the very fact that\nwe may run into conflict at times.\n\n415\n00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.713\nOne of the big conflicts is what\nwe're just talking about, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:32.713 --> 00:23:37.019\nThe very fact that a person leaves\nthe organization, and now you go, well,\n\n417\n00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:38.850\nI've lost that subscription.\n\n418\n00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.017\nNo, you can actually take that and\nreassign it.\n\n419\n00:23:41.017 --> 00:23:45.630\nThat's a big one that helps us to\nget rid of that idea very easily.\n\n420\n00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.030\nThe other one that we\ncan also think about,\n\n421\n00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.350\nof course, is that you can\npurchase additional subscriptions.\n\n422\n00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.520\nLet's say that your company grows at\na rate that's faster than what you think\n\n423\n00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.640\nis happening.\n\n424\n00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.680\nAnd you realize that you have 25 licenses,\nbut you need 30 instead.\n\n425\n00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.995\nWell, you can go in and actually\nbuy an additional five subscription\n\n426\n00:24:04.995 --> 00:24:07.696\nlicenses per month, and\nit's not tied to any one user.\n\n427\n00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.918\nIt's tied to the company,\n\n428\n00:24:08.918 --> 00:24:12.432\nwhich means you can assign them\nto whoever you need them to be.\n\n429\n00:24:12.432 --> 00:24:16.080\nIf a users says, I don't need that much,\nyou can even move them down to an E1\n\n430\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.910\nsubscription, and even one of those\nbusiness premium subscriptions as well.\n\n431\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.530\nSo it can get a little bit\njumbled in there if you're\n\n432\n00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.270\nnot fairly sure about all\nthe stuff that you need as well.\n\n433\n00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.710\nAnd, of course, if a user does leave,\n\n434\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.730\nyou delete that user from your\nOffice 365 portal right over here.\n\n435\n00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.760\nAnd then that essentially takes\nthe subscription away from them,\n\n436\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.110\nwhich can then be reassigned again.\n\n437\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.130\nSo it is very possible for\nus to be able to manage everything\n\n438\n00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:47.860\nthrough what we have at this point\nright here to at least see, okay?\n\n439\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:52.240\nNow those are some of the basics here\nthat we'll see in terms of the setup.\n\n440\n00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:57.300\nBut as of this point,\nwe understand in using these two episodes.\n\n441\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.950\nHow the global administrator is set up and\nthe tenancy account is already set up.\n\n442\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.505\nWe showed you, of course,\nhow to add just a single subscription,\n\n443\n00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.165\na single user in there as well.\n\n444\n00:25:08.165 --> 00:25:12.750\nTalked about the idea of actually setting\nup for the different administrator roles.\n\n445\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.456\nPay attention to what those\nadministrator roles can do and can't do.\n\n446\n00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:20.176\nAnd also, of course, assign subscription\nand talked about how we can manage those\n\n447\n00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:24.400\nsubscriptions a little bit better, as\nwell as dealing with licensing conflicts.\n\n448\n00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.250\nDeleting a user that's left is a big one,\nokay?\n\n449\n00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.250\nReassigning those licenses to\nsomebody else that needs them\n\n450\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.315\nis a big one as well, okay?\n\n451\n00:25:32.315 --> 00:25:35.430\nPurchasing additional license,\nall these are valid ways\n\n452\n00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.260\nto handle any type of subscription\nconflict that we may end up having.\n\n453\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:45.110\nSo at this particular point, it sounds\nlike that we are kind of ready to continue\n\n454\n00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.320\nto move forward because there's still\nsome more stuff that we have to cover,\n\n455\n00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.790\nsuch as how do we handle\nthings like updates?\n\n456\n00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:56.477\nAnd how do we get the Office 365 out to\nother users inside of our organization\n\n457\n00:25:56.477 --> 00:26:01.031\nbesides a guy who's actually managing or\nadministrating it at this point?\n\n458\n00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:02.499\nWe need to deal with all that.\n\n459\n00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:05.030\nAnd that's gonna be coming up\nin future episodes as well.\n\n460\n00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.077\nSo Cherokee, there's a lot more for\nus to cover in Office 365.\n\n461\n00:26:08.077 --> 00:26:09.640\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\nthank you for being with us.\n\n462\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.138\nAnd I look forward to you navigating\nus through that additional information.\n\n463\n00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.786\nAnd stay tuned, you don't wanna miss that.\n\n464\n00:26:14.786 --> 00:26:17.330\nBut for this show,\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign out.\n\n465\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.920\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n466\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.606\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n467\n00:26:19.606 --> 00:26:22.256\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:23.750\nways we can configure and\nsetup for new features and updates.\n\n9\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.800\nAnd back with us today in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.990\nHow is it going today, Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.150\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Cherokee.\n\n12\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.920\nThank you for having me on the show\nas we continue to take a look at,\n\n13\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.350\nof course, the idea of Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.520\nAnd realizing that it is about software\nwhen it comes down to the end of it,\n\n15\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.570\nespecially on the idea of office software,\nright?\n\n16\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.380\nThe entire Office suite and\nwhat we can do with it.\n\n17\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.543\nRemember that when we get an Office\n365 subscription, if it includes\n\n18\n00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:55.541\nthe ability to download that software onto\ncomputers, it means we also can manage it.\n\n19\n00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.720\nAnd that's what we need to be able to do.\n\n20\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, this isn't like that historical\nconcept where back in the day,\n\n21\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.210\nyou would go into one of those big box\nstores, pick that product off the shelf,\n\n22\n00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.810\ntake it to your office, and\ngo ahead and download and install it.\n\n23\n00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.960\nSo what are we looking at with this\ntype of installation of modern install?\n\n24\n00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.040\nWell, the question modern\nactually begs a question here\n\n25\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.760\nof what is modern versus what isn't?\n\n26\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.150\nCherokee is really going back to there\nwhen she mentions actually getting\n\n27\n00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.420\nphysical software and making sure that we\ncan move that from machine to machine.\n\n28\n00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.287\nYou would then of course have to actually\nhave your licensing product ready and\n\n29\n00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:32.875\navailable to enter in when that\nsoftware gets installed as well, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.688\nIn an enterprise, in a home user,\n\n31\n00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:40.540\nthat's probably not exactly\nfar off from what they can do.\n\n32\n00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.202\nBut when you start talk on an enterprise\nwhen you have 50, 100 computers,\n\n33\n00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:51.620\nthat idea sounds horrific in today,\nin the 2017 era that we are in.\n\n34\n00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.370\nI can't imagine moving around\nfrom 50 to 100 computers,\n\n35\n00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.630\nbringing in an actual DVD or\neven a USB thumb drive along with me.\n\n36\n00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.810\nAnd then having the product key and\n\n37\n00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.070\nmoving that along with every single\nmachine that I install that in.\n\n38\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.910\n&gt;&gt; Pretty tedious.\n\n39\n00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds a little bit tedious.\n\n40\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.870\nSo during this time, at least for\nall of us, we've probably\n\n41\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.850\nfigured out ways to manage the software\na little bit easier, a little bit more.\n\n42\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.530\nAnd the very fact that we've probably\nwent ahead and also been able to\n\n43\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.360\neither deploy it using some type of\ndeployment server at some point.\n\n44\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.710\nOr even pushing it out using group policy,\nby using an MSI file as well.\n\n45\n00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.290\nOkay, now when you start talking\nabout those two items, right?\n\n46\n00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.640\nWe're now getting more into\ndeployment technology.\n\n47\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.690\nWe're now getting into\nmore enterprise features.\n\n48\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.670\nBut Office 365 is designed actually for,\nwell, all environments, right?\n\n49\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450\nWhether you're a home user, whether\nyou're actually a small business user,\n\n50\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.160\nwhether you're an enterprise user.\n\n51\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.650\nWhether you're a government\nuser it wants to go and\n\n52\n00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.260\ndo everything that what we've\ntalked about here, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.200\nOne, get the software to you, okay.\n\n54\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.590\nTwo, manage the licensing that we have.\n\n55\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.840\nAnd then three, which is probably the one\nthat's a little bit more of a conundrum\n\n56\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.870\nthan anything else is how do we manage\nthings like new features that come out and\n\n57\n00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.040\nupdates that come out as well.\n\n58\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760\nAnd that's where it becomes\na bit more challenging, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.050\nSo when we start to take a look at this\nparticular aspect of what we're talking\n\n60\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.880\nabout, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.190\nWe need to discuss this\nidea of the methodology\n\n62\n00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.510\nthat we're probably still seeing and\nusing today, okay?\n\n63\n00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.040\nSo, Cherokee, when we start talking about\nmethodologies that we're still using today\n\n64\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.010\nfor managing and deploying software out\ninto the, into our enterprise, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.140\nWhat do we normally talk about?\n\n66\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.970\nWhat are the two types of technology\nthat we're normally talking about here?\n\n67\n00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.790\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that like you had referenced\nthe MSI for abusing a solution,\n\n68\n00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.020\nan enterprise solution like System Center\nor something to that nature.\n\n69\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.848\nAnd then we also have that C2R for\nthe Click-to-Run feature.\n\n70\n00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:58.970\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, those two are probably the\ntwo biggest as well along with the idea of\n\n71\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.640\nthe deployment server that we have if we\nchoose to run that inside of an image or\n\n72\n00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.570\nanything else that we choose.\n\n73\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.310\nBut those are kind of the big ones.\n\n74\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.210\nMSI and then Click to Run,\n\n75\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.600\nC2R, these are other ways that we also\nhave the installation methods before us.\n\n76\n00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.234\nNow, whenever we start to talk\nabout this idea of using an MSI,\n\n77\n00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:21.395\nit actually is easily deployable.\n\n78\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.450\nThey've kinda packaged everything\nup with the Microsoft Installer and\n\n79\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.170\nonce we have the Microsoft Installer,\nokay, everything is actually great.\n\n80\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.500\nWe can download that\nMSI to a local machine,\n\n81\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.750\nrun that MSI, and then install software.\n\n82\n00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.394\nNow, in that sense, though, Cherokee,\nwhen we start talking about an MSI,\n\n83\n00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:46.742\ncan you think of any drawbacks with\nan MSI, that you might think about?\n\n84\n00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:51.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so kind of going back\nto that old school DVD or\n\n85\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.770\nCD sitting there on the shelf,\n\n86\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.390\nsometimes you have to worry about that\nMSI file not being current or up to date.\n\n87\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthat's kind of the biggest thing, right?\n\n88\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.870\nIs that your MSI,\nyou don't know how old it could be.\n\n89\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.660\nIt's just like the DVD.\n\n90\n00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.640\nHow long has it been sitting on the shelf?\n\n91\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.950\nLet's say, it's been sitting there for\nthree months.\n\n92\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.480\nWell, how old is the MSI?\n\n93\n00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.210\nWell, if I deployed it\nthrough group policy or\n\n94\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.620\neven System Center Configuration Manager.\n\n95\n00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.420\nIf I'm not the most vigilant of admins,\nright,\n\n96\n00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.320\nthat MSI could be sitting there for\nthree months as well.\n\n97\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.940\nI deploy that to a group of computers,\nand immediately that group of computers,\n\n98\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.430\nonce it's actually deployed says,\nhey, you need to run updates.\n\n99\n00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.150\nAnd then you go, okay, well, let's do some\nupdates, and all of the sudden you see\n\n100\n00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.450\nwhere it says 73 updates are available for\nthis software that you've just installed.\n\n101\n00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.880\nAnd then you're kind of like,\n73, are you joking me?\n\n102\n00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.030\nNo, we're not joking you, it does\nhappen where you see stuff like that.\n\n103\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.020\nSo an MSI is good, don't get me wrong,\nbut it does have that lacking feature in\n\n104\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.770\nthat sense in which the update\nof that is not very easy.\n\n105\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.630\nYou have to kind of redeploy a new\nMSI with the updated features and\n\n106\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.310\nthen you're ready to go again.\n\n107\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.700\nNow, that's not as bad as it sounds but\nit is another step that we have.\n\n108\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.973\nWhen we start talking\nabout the Click-To-Run.\n\n109\n00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:10.910\nOkay, the Click-to-Run is actually unusual\n\n110\n00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.100\nin the very fact that it\nis a streaming technology.\n\n111\n00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.940\nThat allows us to go ahead and install but\nyou don’t have to actually fully\n\n112\n00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.400\nfinish an installation before you can use\nthe product that you’re actually running.\n\n113\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.765\nNow, that sounds a little bit\nunusual doesn’t it, Cherokee?\n\n114\n00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:29.485\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I just did that\nyesterday with my Audible books.\n\n115\n00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:30.287\nI love that.\n\n116\n00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:33.075\nYou can start to listen before\nyou download the full feature.\n\n117\n00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:33.895\nAnd that's because, what?\n\n118\n00:06:33.895 --> 00:06:35.445\nIt's based off of streaming, right?\n\n119\n00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:37.725\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because the streaming\ntechnology says, sure,\n\n120\n00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:39.780\nlet's play this while\nyou're installing it.\n\n121\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; To me, coming from over,\n\n122\n00:06:41.245 --> 00:06:42.875\nI'm like, how, what?\n\n123\n00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:45.145\nI can't believe that they're\nreally doing something like that.\n\n124\n00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.240\nBut they are.\n\n125\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.600\n&gt;&gt; And this idea of the Click-to-Run is\npretty much the one that Office 365 says,\n\n126\n00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.290\nthis is what we really want to do.\n\n127\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.830\nNow, in your organization, if you're not\nswitching over 100% and I mean this.\n\n128\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.880\nIf you're not migrating\n100% over to Office 365 for\n\n129\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.830\nthe deployment of your office products.\n\n130\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.720\nThen you're gonna end up seeing maybe\na hybridized approach in this way.\n\n131\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.480\nSome of your organization,\nwhich is still going to be out there\n\n132\n00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.960\nwith infrastructure internally on\nyour network, right, on premises.\n\n133\n00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.350\nYou're still going to be\nrunning off of those MSIs, and\n\n134\n00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.272\nit is very possible that you may see that.\n\n135\n00:07:28.272 --> 00:07:32.876\nBut then it may be your newer users who\nare actually just getting their Office 365\n\n136\n00:07:32.876 --> 00:07:36.232\nsubscription running,\nthat you may see where everything is\n\n137\n00:07:36.232 --> 00:07:39.223\nactually deployed with a C2R,\nor Click-to- run.\n\n138\n00:07:39.223 --> 00:07:45.130\nWhich allows them to simply sign on\nthrough their Office 365 subscription.\n\n139\n00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.874\nClick on the link where it says to click\nso that they can install that software,\n\n140\n00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:49.679\nand then they can begin\nthe installation process.\n\n141\n00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:54.507\nAnd begin using some of those\nproducts that starts to download but\n\n142\n00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:59.259\nthen install, and then you're\nstill using it at the same time.\n\n143\n00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:03.632\nSo it is all possible that his is\nsomething that Office 365 really does\n\n144\n00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:06.820\nlike, and\ndoing something like this, right?\n\n145\n00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.609\nYou might be wondering like I did,\n\n146\n00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:12.621\nlike, why the heck would they choose\nto actually do something like this, and\n\n147\n00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:16.534\nwhy is it something that's actually\nvery valuable to Office 365 to do?\n\n148\n00:08:16.534 --> 00:08:21.295\nAnd those are questions that we'd really\nwant to tackle a little bit at this point\n\n149\n00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:23.796\nbefore we start moving on as well, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:23.796 --> 00:08:28.761\nThe Click-to-Run, it really has\nits advantage in this fact, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:36.109\nAnytime then for Office 365 users, if you\nare running, let's say, Office 2016, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:36.109 --> 00:08:39.913\nWhen you download it from\nthe Office 365 Cloud,\n\n153\n00:08:39.913 --> 00:08:46.460\nyou're not getting the edition that's\n6 months old, or 12 months old, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.540\nYou're not getting that, you're getting\nwhatever the edition is at the end\n\n155\n00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.460\nof that particular channel that you're on.\n\n156\n00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.800\nIn that life cycle, the live,\nthe most up-to-date,\n\n157\n00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.910\none that you can get\nat that point in time.\n\n158\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.920\nSo whenever you download it,\n\n159\n00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.500\nyou're not just downloading from a library\nfile that's out there somewhere.\n\n160\n00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.130\nYou're downloading from Microsoft,\ntheir latest available edition\n\n161\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.710\nin that particular cycle\nof that run that you're on.\n\n162\n00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.472\nAnd so that means you are constantly\npretty much up-to-date when\n\n163\n00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:20.479\nyou download that software\ndirectly to your computer.\n\n164\n00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:26.650\nThink about what that saves us then\nin terms of like security, Cherokee.\n\n165\n00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:32.590\nWhen I think about that idea of an MSI,\nand it's a file that's six months old,\n\n166\n00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.030\nthe security then in six month's\ntime could have lapsed so\n\n167\n00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.780\nbadly that,\nthat may be a vulnerability, right?\n\n168\n00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.180\n&gt;&gt; Most definitely, and at least if I know\nthat I'm getting the most current and\n\n169\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.370\nlatest and greatest version.\n\n170\n00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.120\nI'm hoping that those security\nissues have already been addressed,\n\n171\n00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.660\nthey're from Microsoft's side.\n\n172\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, at lease they have\nactually addressed from that point\n\n173\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.840\nthat they know of.\n\n174\n00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.070\nUp in that point where you're downloading\nit, you're getting that latest feature.\n\n175\n00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.932\nSo in that sense, you'll probably see that\nthe Click-to-Run is gonna be preferred\n\n176\n00:10:01.932 --> 00:10:05.860\nfrom the Microsoft Office standpoint or\nOffice 365 standpoint.\n\n177\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.755\nNow the key here is for\nthe decision maker to understand, right?\n\n178\n00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:14.080\nThe decision maker needs to know this\none thing which is gonna be key.\n\n179\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:21.330\nIf you're trying to, not if you're trying,\nif you're already running the MSI\n\n180\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:28.750\ninstall of Office 2016 on your computer,\nsomehow, some way that you got that, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:34.440\nYou cannot actually run the Click-to-Run\nversion side by side with it,\n\n182\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.230\nit would not work.\n\n183\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.624\nYou'll have to uninstall the previous\none and then run the Click-to-Run.\n\n184\n00:10:39.624 --> 00:10:44.073\nIf you're running the Click-to-Run\nyou can't install the MSI version on\n\n185\n00:10:44.073 --> 00:10:46.250\nthe same computer as well.\n\n186\n00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:51.142\nSo they are not compatible, make sure\nyou understand that before you start to\n\n187\n00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:54.994\nmove forward with your Office\n365 plans and deployment.\n\n188\n00:10:54.994 --> 00:10:59.057\nYou wanna make sure that you talk that\nover with whoever it is that you need to\n\n189\n00:10:59.057 --> 00:11:00.650\nas you move forward.\n\n190\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.360\nIf somebody is sticking\nto their guns saying,\n\n191\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.490\nyou're not getting rid of our\ndeployment now in this, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.980\nWell, that means you gotta consider what\nis gonna happen if people would say,\n\n193\n00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.980\nI wanna run this, and\nthen their office installation fails them\n\n194\n00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.410\nbecause you're running the Click-to-Run,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:24.160\nSo, just kind of be aware of that\nbefore you start to move in a different\n\n196\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.020\ndirection, than what your organization\nis really wanting you to push towards.\n\n197\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.870\nSo, that one fact alone is enough to\nkind of cause a lot of heartaches,\n\n198\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.570\nif you are not paying attention.\n\n199\n00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.407\nAnd you go that's great, yeah, we used to\nthat, but now that we're doing Office 365,\n\n200\n00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.648\njust install right over your old 2013.\n\n201\n00:11:41.648 --> 00:11:44.840\nIt's not gonna work,\nit's not gonna happen that way, so\n\n202\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.245\nyou'll have to remove that first,\nso do that as well, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:51.770\nAll right so, how does this end\nup really working then, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.672\nWith especially the features and\nthe updates, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:55.672 --> 00:12:00.727\nWell, this is where we have to\nmove into the realm of different\n\n206\n00:12:00.727 --> 00:12:05.600\ntypes of support channels,\nthat we want to go into, okay?\n\n207\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.655\nNow, this has changed over the time,\nCherokee, and that's a good reason for\n\n208\n00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:13.345\nus doing this particular course\nat this point in time as well.\n\n209\n00:12:13.345 --> 00:12:17.980\nIs if you've actually taken\nthis say six months or\n\n210\n00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.828\na year ago, usually about a year ago now.\n\n211\n00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:25.809\nIf you've that, you've actually set in\nan instructor like class somewhere, or\n\n212\n00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:28.264\nif you've taken some other training and\n\n213\n00:12:28.264 --> 00:12:32.105\neven the ITProTV previous\noffering on the 70-346 show.\n\n214\n00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:36.950\nYou might have seen us talk about this\nstuff, but in the older terms and formats.\n\n215\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.710\nThis has changed over time,\n\n216\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.900\nand now we actually have to know well,\ntwo things here.\n\n217\n00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.085\nThis is where it gets a little bit tricky\nas you are preparing for the exam.\n\n218\n00:12:46.085 --> 00:12:51.270\nOne, you still have to at least know\na bit about the older way it was done.\n\n219\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.799\nYou're more than likely to still see\nquestions like that on the exam.\n\n220\n00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:57.838\nI wish I could tell you because I\ndon't really know for sure but,\n\n221\n00:12:57.838 --> 00:12:59.430\nI wish I could tell you that.\n\n222\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.605\nThey're gonna get rid of every single\none of those questions that have to\n\n223\n00:13:02.605 --> 00:13:05.485\ndeal with the older technology,\nthere's no guarantee of that.\n\n224\n00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:09.552\nWhen I actually took my\nfirst Windows XP exam,\n\n225\n00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:16.020\nI was still getting questions about,\nWindows Professional 2000.\n\n226\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.560\nI couldn't remember what\nthe name of it was.\n\n227\n00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.590\n&gt;&gt; The version before that?\n\n228\n00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.918\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the version before that.\n\n229\n00:13:19.918 --> 00:13:23.589\nSo don't think that it doesn't happen,\nI mean it does.\n\n230\n00:13:23.589 --> 00:13:27.950\nSo, just kinda be aware, so we'll\ntalk a little bit briefly about that.\n\n231\n00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.220\nBut then we'll also talk about\nthe idea of the updated version\n\n232\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.570\nof what we're also seeing, as well.\n\n233\n00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.297\nSo the way that this turns out and\nwhat we're actually gonna see\n\n234\n00:13:37.297 --> 00:13:40.610\nas far as the updating and\nthe new features here, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.689\nThey don't just kind of put it\nout at the spur of the moment,\n\n236\n00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:47.550\nthey have essentially a yearly\ncycle that they actually work on.\n\n237\n00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.200\nAnd depending on how you choose\nto deploy in your organization,\n\n238\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.720\nthat is gonna be key.\n\n239\n00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.350\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthen we'll\n\n240\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.202\ntalk about some of those different feature\nso we can get used to them as well.\n\n241\n00:14:01.202 --> 00:14:05.030\nAll right Cherokee, so was we take\na look at what we're seeing here.\n\n242\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.430\nI've got the actual link to what we're\nlooking at inside of the show notes,\n\n243\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.120\nso it should appear\nalong with the episode.\n\n244\n00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.750\nIf you wanna click right here and\nfollow this through.\n\n245\n00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.094\nThere's no way you're gonna copy and paste\nthis particular link look at all those\n\n246\n00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:21.337\nnumbers up there, so\nthat should be in the show notes.\n\n247\n00:14:21.337 --> 00:14:28.970\nThis is as of October 4th of 2017, here's\nhow things actually are turning out.\n\n248\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:34.220\nNow, I like this particular table,\nbecause it shows the old terminology\n\n249\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.530\ninside of the parenthesis, along with\nthe new terminology as well, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:44.060\nSo, if you were actually someone that\nwas taking a look at this particular\n\n251\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.930\ntechnology, and\ndeploying the Office 2016 product\n\n252\n00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:53.270\nto your computer,\nyou'd have three different options, okay?\n\n253\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.640\nThere is gonna be the monthly channel now,\nand\n\n254\n00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.625\nthen what they call the semi\nannual channel targeted.\n\n255\n00:15:00.625 --> 00:15:04.400\nAnd then of course there's\nactually the semi annual channel.\n\n256\n00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.375\nAnd here they're calling it deferred\nat this point as well, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:13.029\nSo there's actually a semi annual and\na semi annual targeted as well, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:18.909\nNow, here the earlier edition going way\nback really kind of to the beginning here,\n\n259\n00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:19.501\nright?\n\n260\n00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:24.000\nIs that they used to call the monthly\nchannel the current channel, and\n\n261\n00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.899\nthat is the latest up-to-date thing\nthat we can get from Office 2016.\n\n262\n00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:32.027\nAnd what we mean by that\nis that every month,\n\n263\n00:15:32.027 --> 00:15:36.522\nin that yearly cycle that you'll\nhave there is a possibility.\n\n264\n00:15:36.522 --> 00:15:42.610\nAnd usually a great possibility that you\nwill get a release of whatever it is.\n\n265\n00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.036\nNow this includes things\nlike beta releases too.\n\n266\n00:15:46.036 --> 00:15:48.766\nAnd the reason why that's\nimportant it means that\n\n267\n00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:51.827\nsome of those functionalities\nmay work 100% well.\n\n268\n00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:55.944\nSome of the functionalities that they\nrelease during these monthly kind of\n\n269\n00:15:55.944 --> 00:15:58.245\nreleases, May not work perfectly well.\n\n270\n00:15:58.245 --> 00:16:01.780\n&gt;&gt; And that might not be something that\nyou wanna opt in for your organization.\n\n271\n00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.200\nSo a lot of companies will say, hey,\n\n272\n00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.790\nlet someone else test it out\nbefore we jump on board.\n\n273\n00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.790\n&gt;&gt; That is true, yeah.\n\n274\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.360\nSo if you are one of these people that go,\nno, I just wanted the newest update.\n\n275\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.560\nThat's great for your computer, right?\n\n276\n00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:17.510\nBut remember, for your organization if\nthey need productivity before the idea of\n\n277\n00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:22.680\nupdating immediately, you may have to\nconsider something else instead, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.530\nSo this idea of the formerly current\nchannel, that at least that's\n\n279\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.070\nthe way it used to be called, that's that\nmonthly update is what we have now, okay?\n\n280\n00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:38.830\nNow, the other one that's also out there,\nis what we call the Semi-Annual Channel.\n\n281\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.250\nNow, Semi- Annual Channel\nis exactly like it sounds.\n\n282\n00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:44.980\nIt means once every six months\nyou'll get an update, but\n\n283\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.710\nwhat about all those months in between\nthat the monthly channel's going on?\n\n284\n00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:52.760\nIf they are security related updates,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.780\nThen you'll still get them.\n\n286\n00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.599\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that's what I was gonna ask there\nis if are we still gonna be getting those\n\n287\n00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.233\nany kind of like our hotfixes for\nthose type of issues?\n\n288\n00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:02.270\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nyou'll still be getting those.\n\n289\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.160\nBut any new features or\nany real updates in terms of features,\n\n290\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.740\nyou won't be getting that until it rolls\nout in that next six months process.\n\n291\n00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.200\nNow, this is actually for the person\nthat's on the slower side of things.\n\n292\n00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.930\nNow, that doesn't mean\nthat they don't care,\n\n293\n00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:20.640\nit means that they're willing to put up\nwith some of the slower things that go on\n\n294\n00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.160\nin terms of features and things like that.\n\n295\n00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.180\nThan trying to actually say, I wanna make\nsure that I'm maintaining the latest and\n\n296\n00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.880\nmost up-to-date one that\nwe have available to us.\n\n297\n00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.090\nOkay, so that is another one, so\n\n298\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.230\nthat is the one that is semi-annual,\nnot the one that says targeted.\n\n299\n00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.810\nNow here, they call it deferred at this\npoint but the proper terminology now\n\n300\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.770\nif I go to the actual real one is that\nhere is how its actually is right now.\n\n301\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.840\nIt's semi-annual and\nthen semi-annual targeted.\n\n302\n00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.560\nWe'll get this one just a moment and\nwe'll talk about it as well, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:58.180\nThen there is the semi annual targeted\nwhich is formally first release for\n\n304\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.020\nthe deferred channel.\n\n305\n00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.980\nNow this one's a little bit more unusual.\n\n306\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.880\nIt sounds like it's more specific, right?\n\n307\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.630\nFormally, first release of deferred for\nthe deferred channel.\n\n308\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.030\nDeferred channel means we're waiting for\nup we're waiting for\n\n309\n00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.880\nnew features and stuff like that.\n\n310\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.660\nWe'll continue to update for things like\nsecurity and hot fixes and stuff, but\n\n311\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.660\nthis one, it's weird.\n\n312\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:28.040\nIt begins its particular process and cycle\nthe month after the monthly channel, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.140\nSo it's strange,\nit essentially says, all right,\n\n314\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.450\nlet's let that first channel go in and\nthen, the second month after that,\n\n315\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.680\nwe'll start doing our first release\nof that deferred channel as well.\n\n316\n00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.970\nSo this one's about two months behind or\n\n317\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.640\na month behind that one if you\nwant to take a look at that, okay?\n\n318\n00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.115\nSo a month or\ntwo behind the current channel is what\n\n319\n00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:53.679\nyou're seeing on this idea of\nthe targeted release that we have.\n\n320\n00:18:53.679 --> 00:18:57.215\nSo this one is kind of the key\nhere if you start to take a look\n\n321\n00:18:57.215 --> 00:18:59.840\nat a couple of different things.\n\n322\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.370\nSo you might hear the term fast ring,\nslow ring.\n\n323\n00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.840\nWell, monthly channel would be what,\nfast ring, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.740\nAnyone of them, the semi-annual or\ndeferred, when you hear that term,\n\n325\n00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.710\nthat's a slower a ring process\nis what we ended up seeing up.\n\n326\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:19.630\nToday, all that has pretty much changed\nand now the overview is right here.\n\n327\n00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.960\nMonthly channel provides users\nwith the newest features of\n\n328\n00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.680\nOffice as soon as they\nare available monthly, okay?\n\n329\n00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.559\nSo we'll see that one.\n\n330\n00:19:27.559 --> 00:19:32.276\nSemi-annual, provides users\nwith new features of Office\n\n331\n00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:34.450\nonly a few times a year.\n\n332\n00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.630\nNow, notice that semiannual doesn't\nmean every six months, even though we\n\n333\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.200\nwould think that semi annual would mean\ntwice a year is what we would think.\n\n334\n00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.500\nBut here it says everything few months.\n\n335\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.710\nThe way that it was in the previous\nedition was it actually updates occur\n\n336\n00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:47.700\nthree times a year.\n\n337\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.667\nI was about to give you four,\nthree times a year is what it would do.\n\n338\n00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:54.628\nSo every four months, you would\nactually get that particular update,\n\n339\n00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:55.889\nis what you would see.\n\n340\n00:19:55.889 --> 00:20:01.600\nNow, here they're saying every six months,\nin January and July.\n\n341\n00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.540\nSo it's a little bit confusing in how\nthey talk about a few times a year,\n\n342\n00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.110\nand then refer to January and July,\nwhich is really semi-annual here.\n\n343\n00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.270\n&gt;&gt; And then you've got underneath that,\nthe Semi-Annual Channel target.\n\n344\n00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.340\nSo what's that all about?\n\n345\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one actually does\nhappen every six months but\n\n346\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.140\nnotice how it's two months off.\n\n347\n00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.870\nSo where are this one begins in January,\nthis one actually begins in March.\n\n348\n00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.320\nSo it's staggered in this way to allow for\n\n349\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.350\nus to say, hey even if that old one or\nthat new stabilized one is,\n\n350\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.430\nlet's just also end up realizing that we\ncan kind of hold off a little bit more.\n\n351\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.030\nThis one is more for\ntesting than anything else.\n\n352\n00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.890\nMaking sure that before\nthese new releases come out,\n\n353\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.910\nthat you already have a chance to test\nthem before you even accept it on\n\n354\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.290\nthis particular, which is\nthe slowest ring that we have, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.580\nSo that's what it gives\nyou that ability to do.\n\n356\n00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.430\nSo you might see features, and go, let\nme just run this one on a test computer\n\n357\n00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.850\nhere and see how it actually\nworks on our regular machines.\n\n358\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.330\nEverybody else, in a regular\ngeneral everyday productivity,\n\n359\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.170\nmight do the semi-annual.\n\n360\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.290\nYou, if you wanna actually see anything,\n\n361\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.640\nbefore you push it out, you might choose\nthe monthly one for your own account.\n\n362\n00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.780\nIf you're not super heavily dependent on\nthem, the monthly one seems to be kind of\n\n363\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.000\nthe way to go, just to see what features\nare out there and available to you.\n\n364\n00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.560\nSo all of those are kind of the big ones\nthat you have to pay attention to here.\n\n365\n00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:30.300\nSo if you want new features to happen\nas regularly and as soon they can,\n\n366\n00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.720\nthen you are essentially gonna choose\na monthly channel or in the older version,\n\n367\n00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.210\nwhat they call current channel, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.918\nIf you are actually gonna say look,\nI'm just gonna wait for\n\n369\n00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:46.750\nthe updates as they're supposed to happen.\n\n370\n00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.320\nYou're just gonna choose a Semi-Annual\nChannel, or in the old version,\n\n371\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.370\nit's what they called\nthe deferred channel.\n\n372\n00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.380\nAnd that's what they actually called it.\n\n373\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.189\nAnd then, if you want to do\nthe semi-annual targeted,\n\n374\n00:21:59.189 --> 00:22:04.630\nwhich is staggered about a month or\ntwo behind, the monthly channel releases.\n\n375\n00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.913\nWhich gives you about a month or\n2 of testing,\n\n376\n00:22:06.913 --> 00:22:10.790\nbefore the Semi-Annual Channel\nend up getting released as well.\n\n377\n00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.690\nThen, you are now going to follow\nthe Semi-Annual Channel targeted,\n\n378\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.430\nwhich is formally the first\nrelease of the deferred channel.\n\n379\n00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.088\nThis give you kind of a weird thing here,\nright?\n\n380\n00:22:21.088 --> 00:22:25.683\nBoth of these, the deferred and this idea\nof first release of differed generals,\n\n381\n00:22:25.683 --> 00:22:28.600\nthese are what we consider\nslow ring as well.\n\n382\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.730\nSo you'll hear that terminology,\nslow ring, fast ring, but\n\n383\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.280\nall these stuff you just have to\npay attention to and figure out.\n\n384\n00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.130\nNow what about for your organization?\n\n385\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.580\nWell, everybody has to kind of judge us on\n\n386\n00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.540\nwhat they’re actually\ngonna end up choosing.\n\n387\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.920\nBut normally, not everybody gonna ever\nbe deployed on the fast monthly rate.\n\n388\n00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.507\nI’m not saying you can’t do it, but\n\n389\n00:22:48.507 --> 00:22:54.240\nthat one you’re gonna run into issues\non some machines such as this, right?\n\n390\n00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.810\nIt might be in an organization like\nours where you have a split of Mac users\n\n391\n00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.040\nversus Windows users.\n\n392\n00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.755\nAnd even today,\nwe even have a split of Mac users and\n\n393\n00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:08.660\neven Linux computers are starting\nto appear on our systems as well.\n\n394\n00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.091\nBut Mac users and regular PC users,\n\n395\n00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:15.304\nyou might find out that the fast ring for\nthe Windows users is so\n\n396\n00:23:15.304 --> 00:23:19.540\nmuch faster than what the Mac\nring fast channel is going to be.\n\n397\n00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.374\nAnd then the Mac warning one might\nactually bring you more issues\n\n398\n00:23:23.374 --> 00:23:24.855\nthan you think.\n\n399\n00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:29.823\nSo you have to kinda figure out that\nplay that you want to be able to do.\n\n400\n00:23:29.823 --> 00:23:32.336\nNow, you'll also see, of course,\n\n401\n00:23:32.336 --> 00:23:37.090\nthat means your operating system\nupdates may also affect this.\n\n402\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.190\nSo for example,\nfrom my computer right here.\n\n403\n00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.570\nI'm running this on a MacBook, right, and\n\n404\n00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.120\nI've just updated to\nthe latest operating system.\n\n405\n00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.648\nWell, guess what?\n\n406\n00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:48.698\nMy Outlook did not work and\nI was on the slow,\n\n407\n00:23:48.698 --> 00:23:53.335\nSemi-Annual Channel essentially,\nthe deferred channel here.\n\n408\n00:23:53.335 --> 00:23:57.617\nWell, the only way I could actually get it\nto run was to actually switch mine over to\n\n409\n00:23:57.617 --> 00:24:01.592\nthe Faster, current channel or monthly\nchannel to get the latest update and\n\n410\n00:24:01.592 --> 00:24:05.030\nthen as soon as I did that,\nit was able to actually run.\n\n411\n00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.660\nSo you might figure that out, but\n\n412\n00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.600\nthat's why you actually have these testing\nthings that you have available to you.\n\n413\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.130\nBut each of those is what can give you,\nof course, the ability to prepare for\n\n414\n00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.430\nthat to work.\n\n415\n00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.140\nNow the great thing about this is that\n\n416\n00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.810\nwe still actually need to show\na couple of other things and\n\n417\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.850\ngood thing I was trying to make\nsure that I have the time to do it.\n\n418\n00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.880\nLet me show you where you set this up,\nokay?\n\n419\n00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.690\nFor a user, for your Office 365 here.\n\n420\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:35.760\nLet me go back into my admin center, and\nthen once I do that, let me select, oops.\n\n421\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.330\nHere.\nGive me a second.\n\n422\n00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.680\nI clicked on one too many things.\n\n423\n00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.730\nI'm gonna scroll over here on\nthe left-hand side, down to settings.\n\n424\n00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.390\nAnd under settings, I'm going to\nselect organizational profile,\n\n425\n00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.640\nI believe that is the correct one.\n\n426\n00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.510\nGive it a moment.\n\n427\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.650\nAnd notice that underneath organizational\nprofile, there's this grouping here that\n\n428\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.760\nsays Release preferences, choose how\nyour organization gets new features and\n\n429\n00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.800\nservice updates from Office 365.\n\n430\n00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:14.420\nSo, if I click on Edit,\nthis is where you can see how it's done.\n\n431\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:19.762\nAnd you'll see that even for\nat this point, a couple of things, right?\n\n432\n00:25:19.762 --> 00:25:22.260\nEven though they have\nchanged the terminology,\n\n433\n00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.905\nthey've even changed terminology\nhere inside of Office 365.\n\n434\n00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:28.640\nIt's not the same as what\nwe just talked about.\n\n435\n00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.370\nSo I wish I could say,\nyes this is gonna match up.\n\n436\n00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.640\nBut no it's just standard release,\nif you want everybody to go ahead and\n\n437\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.970\nget early notice first release for\neveryone you can change that.\n\n438\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.430\nYou want to just do a test group\nyou can select this one instead.\n\n439\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.040\nYou name it that's something\nyou can also see and do.\n\n440\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay Ronnie so once you just\nshowed us that configuration change.\n\n441\n00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:51.890\nSince we're already here in\n\n442\n00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.710\nthe interface is there anything\nelse you'd like to share with us?\n\n443\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, there's actually one other\nplace that we need to change this but\n\n444\n00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.200\nin my brand new Office 365 tenet that I've\ncreated, I haven't downloaded anything, so\n\n445\n00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.820\nit's not gonna appear\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n446\n00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.700\nSo I'm gonna switch over to another Office\n365 account right here that we're running.\n\n447\n00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.170\nYes, this is the one for Joey here.\n\n448\n00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.670\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\nlook at the background.\n\n449\n00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.210\n&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, I know, right?\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:16.310\n&gt;&gt; This means that Vaughn is actually\n\n451\n00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.480\nwho's been administrating this one for\nus here.\n\n452\n00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.480\nSo I'm gonna switch on\nover to the admin center.\n\n453\n00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.800\nFrom there I'm going to select,\nwhere as I going?\n\n454\n00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.400\nI was going underneath settings here and\nthen services and add-ins.\n\n455\n00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.490\nAnd under services and add-ins if I\nscroll down I should be able to find this\n\n456\n00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:41.750\nlink right here which says Office\nsoftware download settings.\n\n457\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:48.770\nAnd if I click on that link,\nAnd I scroll down here, okay?\n\n458\n00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:53.170\nNotice that here they show\nthe updated feature ready.\n\n459\n00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:59.830\nHow often do you want users to get\nfeature updates for Office 2016 apps?\n\n460\n00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.740\nSo, notice they really only\ngive me two options here.\n\n461\n00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:08.300\nWhereas before they gave me that\nsemi-annual targeted and that semi annual.\n\n462\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.540\nRemember that semi-annual\nmeans every six months, right?\n\n463\n00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.665\nUsually in January and July.\n\n464\n00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:17.670\nWhereas the targeted staggers\nthat a little bit, so\n\n465\n00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:22.260\nthat you're about two months after\nthe July, or the January release.\n\n466\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.280\nSo, in March is when that semi-annual\ntarget would be, and that gives you\n\n467\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.070\na little bit before the next time that\nthe new update actually releases.\n\n468\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.350\nIt's more for the idea of you testing out\nto see if you want to actually update to\n\n469\n00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.350\nthat new feature or not.\n\n470\n00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.080\nSo you'll have that, too.\n\n471\n00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.720\nAnd notice that the Mac version\ndoesn't actually give us any.\n\n472\n00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.100\nLet me see, if I expand this one out here.\n\n473\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.530\nNo, even the Mac version here doesn't have\nthat particular update for us as well.\n\n474\n00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.020\nSo this is one of those where you wanna\npay attention to both of those settings.\n\n475\n00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.980\nSo whether they're underneath\nyour organizational profile and\n\n476\n00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.480\nthen right here under\nthe release preferences.\n\n477\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.660\nThen you may also have to go\ninto services and add ons and\n\n478\n00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:10.260\nfrom there also office,\nsoftware, download settings.\n\n479\n00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.650\nBoth of those are locations\nthat you may have to check out\n\n480\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.650\nas you're having to reset this if that's\nwhat you're going to do to change your\n\n481\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.040\norganization over into those\npreferences that you want to instead.\n\n482\n00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.080\nSo by understanding that,\nthat will then set up your organization.\n\n483\n00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.590\nEither be on that fast track that we want\nto or the idea of the monthly release.\n\n484\n00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:33.830\nOr the former current releases\nis what they call it, and\n\n485\n00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:36.240\nthen either the semi-annual,\nthe semi-annual target or\n\n486\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.810\nthose two differed channel\nreleases as well, okay?\n\n487\n00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:42.040\nSo take a look at those, remember that\nyou'll actually see the links for\n\n488\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.390\nthose in our show notes as well, and that\nwill give you that ability to compare and\n\n489\n00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:47.180\ncontrast them a little bit more.\n\n490\n00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:50.976\nBut Cherokee, that should help us to\nget started, and at least keep our,\n\n491\n00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:53.747\nyou know, Office 2016 up to date,\nif we need to.\n\n492\n00:28:53.747 --> 00:28:56.053\n&gt;&gt; System up to date, our applications\nthere, so thank you for that.\n\n493\n00:28:56.053 --> 00:29:00.290\nI do feel confident with that, and\nthen at least now I can make the decision.\n\n494\n00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.480\nI have enough education to say, hey,\ndo I want to be on the fast track,\n\n495\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.640\nthe slow track, or\nhow do I want to receive these updates.\n\n496\n00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.920\nSo thank you for that.\n\n497\n00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.520\nAnd thank you for joining us as well,\nbut we are out of time for this episode.\n\n498\n00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.100\nStay tuned for more great information,\nbut for this show, we'll sign out.\n\n499\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.620\nI've been your host, Cherokee

about?\n\n11\n00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, when we take a look at\nthe idea here on Office 365,\n\n12\n00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.054\nwe start to actually realize\nsomething that we already\n\n13\n00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:35.410\ngot an existing infrastructure\nthat we're probably already using.\n\n14\n00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.485\nAnd we are now adding in\nOffice 365 as a component.\n\n15\n00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:43.588\nNow the problem that we\nhave is relatively simple.\n\n16\n00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:46.397\nThat when we start to add\nsomething like this in,\n\n17\n00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:49.206\nit means that, well,\nwhat we need to also figure\n\n18\n00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:53.195\nout how do we get well what we have\nexisting to work along with the new.\n\n19\n00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.522\nIn other words the Office 365 here.\n\n20\n00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:59.450\nSo what we're actually doing when we start\ntalking about configuring an additional\n\n21\n00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.783\ndomain is to take what you\nhave in your work place.\n\n22\n00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:04.813\nSo, for example, right here at ITPro.TV,\n\n23\n00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:08.819\non the Internet it's just ITPro.TV,\nthat's my domain.\n\n24\n00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.394\nBut when we configured the initial setup\nthat we did in previous episodes on\n\n25\n00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:14.419\nOffice 365.\n\n26\n00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:19.075\nWhat we actually ended up\nconfiguring was essentially\n\n27\n00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:25.362\nthe itprotvdemocode.onmicrosoft.com,\nand that is another domain.\n\n28\n00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:29.632\nSo today we're gonna actually kind of take\na look at how we are able to well really\n\n29\n00:01:29.632 --> 00:01:32.134\nstart to use what I\nalready have in existence.\n\n30\n00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:37.901\nMy itprotv.demoaccount and domain name\nto actually work with Office 365 and\n\n31\n00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:42.224\nget things to start rolling there\nwhere I can configure it for\n\n32\n00:01:42.224 --> 00:01:46.060\nthings like email as well as Skype for\nBusiness.\n\n33\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.622\nAnd even some of my files and\nSharePoint stuff that I need to.\n\n34\n00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:54.268\nSo all that has to happen if we really\nwant to kind of have a seamless\n\n35\n00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:57.401\ntransition by using Office 365, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.912\nSo that begins with us\nactually taking a look at,\n\n37\n00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:03.800\nactually configuring something\nlike DNS and making sure it works.\n\n38\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.811\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to be looking\nat human-readable names and\n\n39\n00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:06.762\nthings like that, right?\n\n40\n00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:10.018\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are, so,\nin the idea here, as we begin, so\n\n41\n00:02:10.018 --> 00:02:14.760\nlet's make sure that we have at least\na basic understanding of DNS, right?\n\n42\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.303\nSo we're gonna just do\na little bit of a primer,\n\n43\n00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.728\nwe're not going really\ndeep into DNS at all.\n\n44\n00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:24.254\nBut just as a stand point to get us ready\nand familiar with some of the things that\n\n45\n00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:28.868\nwe'll actually have to actually be able\nto do and get setup to do as well, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:32.870\nSo when you start talking about the idea\nof human readable names, right?\n\n47\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.125\nZach, on the Internet right now there\nare so many different machines out there.\n\n48\n00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:41.501\nBut the way that they communicate is\nthey learn about each other by their IP\n\n49\n00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:42.287\naddresses.\n\n50\n00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.370\nAnd computers can do that,\n\n51\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.593\nit doesn't matter how many\nIP addresses are out there.\n\n52\n00:02:45.593 --> 00:02:50.802\nThere can be billions of them, and\nmy computer, right here in the studio,\n\n53\n00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:55.035\ncan find any one of them if I know\nwhat the other IP address is.\n\n54\n00:02:55.035 --> 00:02:57.864\nSo it can actually do that,\nbut the very fact is,\n\n55\n00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:01.867\nthe computer's not really caring\nwhat machine I really connect to.\n\n56\n00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.297\nI'm the one that cares and\n\n57\n00:03:03.297 --> 00:03:06.619\nI'm not gonna remember every IP\naddress that I need to go to.\n\n58\n00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:11.502\nSo instead there's a naming system that's\nbeen developed out there that allows\n\n59\n00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:16.017\nus to be able to say, when I type this\nname into a browser or when I want to make\n\n60\n00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:20.751\na connection to that machine, I just have\nto type in something that I can read,\n\n61\n00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:24.556\nthat the machine can then translate\ninto those IP addresses and\n\n62\n00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:26.330\nmake the connection for me.\n\n63\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.740\nAnd that system of course is DNS,\n\n64\n00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.879\nDomain Naming System is what that\nparticular service is called.\n\n65\n00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:34.734\n&gt;&gt; DNS.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so\n\n66\n00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:39.544\nDNS exists out there on the Internet, but\nit also exists within our own local area\n\n67\n00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:43.240\nnetwork as well and\nwe have to actually kind of understand it.\n\n68\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.431\nSo let's take a look at our systems and\nmake sure that we understand what we're\n\n69\n00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:49.855\nreally dealing with when\nwe start to do this.\n\n70\n00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:54.491\nSo here is just a very simple example\nthat I have inside of my own local area\n\n71\n00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:55.180\nnetwork.\n\n72\n00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.402\nI have a machine that may want to\ngo out to our own website, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:02.485\nAnd this one's gonna be itprotvdemo.com.\n\n74\n00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:06.853\nNow of course there's so many different\nones that are out there, but we're gonna\n\n75\n00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:11.680\nuse itprotvdemo.com or .org, or something\nlike that, as we continue to move forward.\n\n76\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.911\nIt depends on what's actually\navailable right now.\n\n77\n00:04:13.911 --> 00:04:17.080\nAnd we've got three or four of the names\nregistered, but I know I've used them\n\n78\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.830\nthroughout different services so\nI have to see what's available.\n\n79\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.809\nBut let's say that I want to get here.\n\n80\n00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:23.804\nWell, my machine doesn't really need that.\n\n81\n00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:30.784\nRemember what my machine needs is\nthe IP address to itprotvdemo.com.\n\n82\n00:04:30.784 --> 00:04:37.489\nWell, what if my machine right here\ndoes not have the IP address to it?\n\n83\n00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:39.530\nWell, that's when it goes and\n\n84\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.226\nit makes a request of what we\ncall our DNS server, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:47.109\nThe server is essentially that service\nthat is running on that machine's software\n\n86\n00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:48.499\nthat's running on machine.\n\n87\n00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.648\nThat will answer how this\nmachine can get there.\n\n88\n00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:57.525\nSo this particular machine over here on\nthe left-hand side asks a question, and\n\n89\n00:04:57.525 --> 00:04:59.326\nthe DNS server will respond.\n\n90\n00:04:59.326 --> 00:05:04.476\nAnd the way it does it is by checking\nin its own DNS records to see\n\n91\n00:05:04.476 --> 00:05:09.546\nif it actually has that ability\nto get to itprotvdemo.com.\n\n92\n00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:14.362\nSo that server, whatever the IP address\nis, it can do that and we are off and\n\n93\n00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:15.667\nwe're ready to go.\n\n94\n00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:21.866\nInside of that DNS server it is very\npossible that has a complete zone or\n\n95\n00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:27.769\na database or everything that\nend with itprotvdemo.com, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:31.847\nBut inside of that database\nare a list of different records.\n\n97\n00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:36.162\nNow these records are not super acceptable\nto everything that we're doing, but\n\n98\n00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:37.316\nthey are important.\n\n99\n00:05:37.316 --> 00:05:42.013\nSo we have to understand at least\nthe basic nature of sumlist when we start\n\n100\n00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:42.937\nhere, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:42.937 --> 00:05:45.542\nSo every single zone, or\nevery single database,\n\n102\n00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:49.026\nthe most important record in there\nis what we call an A record here.\n\n103\n00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:53.384\nBut in today's world you may\nalso see quad A records and\n\n104\n00:05:53.384 --> 00:05:58.239\nthat is because it also maps to\nIP version six addresses too.\n\n105\n00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:01.281\nSo a single A maps to IP version 4, and\n\n106\n00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:06.428\nthen you have quad A records that\nmap to IP version 6 addresses.\n\n107\n00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:10.364\nAny time that you have a name,\na fully qualified name here,\n\n108\n00:06:10.364 --> 00:06:16.350\nthat matches up to an IP address, that is\ncalled an A record, is what that's called.\n\n109\n00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.103\nAnd that is by far the most important\nrecord inside of this database.\n\n110\n00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:22.207\nWithout that record the rest of these,\n\n111\n00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:24.966\nit really doesn't work as\nwell as you want them to.\n\n112\n00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:29.868\nSo it really does relate back to\nthe idea of this A record, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:33.103\nThe next one that we have here is a CNAME,\nokay?\n\n114\n00:06:33.103 --> 00:06:35.399\nCNAME stands for canonical name.\n\n115\n00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:38.309\nAnother term for\ncanonical is the term alias.\n\n116\n00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:41.493\nSo what I can do instead is actually say,\nhey,\n\n117\n00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:44.284\nI want this name to also match up to this.\n\n118\n00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:49.580\nSo instead, let's say that instead\nof it going to itprotvdemo.com,\n\n119\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.888\nI might even be able to put www.\n\n120\n00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:57.399\nAnd say, look, if it's actually somebody\nis typing in www.itprotvdemo.com,\n\n121\n00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:01.506\nsend it to whatever is matched\nto this A record as well, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:06.030\nSo, we can create aliases for\ndifferent places that we have, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.479\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And that usually for\n\n124\n00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:10.552\nus again kind of the basics\nthat we have here.\n\n125\n00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:14.154\nNow starting from that point, though,\nokay, there's a couple of other ones.\n\n126\n00:07:14.154 --> 00:07:16.981\nLet me kind of go through\nkinda the generic ones and\n\n127\n00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:19.135\nthen we'll kinda hit the ones that for\n\n128\n00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:23.400\nat least Office 365 is gonna be more\nessential that we pay attention to.\n\n129\n00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.264\nSo I'm gonna skip over the MX record for\nright now, and\n\n130\n00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:30.540\nlet's talk about this idea of the PTR,\nokay?\n\n131\n00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.410\nThe pointer record or the PTR record\nis actually a reverse lookup.\n\n132\n00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.975\nSo instead of me actually needing\nthe name which gets resolved\n\n133\n00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:45.799\nto an IP address what instead I can\nhave is I can actually have the IP\n\n134\n00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:48.718\naddress that resolve itself to a name.\n\n135\n00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:53.158\nAnd that again is gonna be set up ready\nfor us through the system administrator\n\n136\n00:07:53.158 --> 00:07:57.750\nthrough the network administrator on\nthat particular network as well, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.647\nNow believe it or\nnot the other ones right here,\n\n138\n00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:05.441\nthese are the ones that I'm really\nfocusing on Especially for Office 365.\n\n139\n00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:09.800\nWhy don't we talk about the MX records\njust briefly just like I did here.\n\n140\n00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.330\nWe're gonna talk about NS,\nwhich stands for Nameserver Records.\n\n141\n00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.810\nThose are gonna be very important as well,\nokay?\n\n142\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.060\nSo the MX record of course is for\nthe mail exchange.\n\n143\n00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.570\nAnd then the NS records here are for\nthe nameserver records.\n\n144\n00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.270\nNow when we start talking about\nit at the basis here, right?\n\n145\n00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.730\nNS records are important because they\nactually tell us who is authoritative for\n\n146\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.920\nthat particular zone.\n\n147\n00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.450\nNow that doesn't mean much at this point\nif you're not familiar with DNS, so\n\n148\n00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.073\nmy recommendation is if you're\nnot really familiar with it,\n\n149\n00:08:41.073 --> 00:08:45.463\nmake sure you go back and you start\nreviewing the basic concepts of DNS, and\n\n150\n00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:48.342\nhave that in your mind before you move on,\nokay?\n\n151\n00:08:48.342 --> 00:08:52.060\nBecause it's gonna be essential that you\nat least understand the basics of that.\n\n152\n00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.520\nNow this becomes what's authoritative.\n\n153\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.056\nYou can have primary and secondary NS\nrecords that essentially say, hey,\n\n154\n00:08:59.056 --> 00:09:03.736\nhere's the one that's authoritative,\nand if that's not working, here,\n\n155\n00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:05.756\ngo and check this one out as well.\n\n156\n00:09:05.756 --> 00:09:08.260\nYou can have as many NS\nrecords as you want.\n\n157\n00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.950\nBut those are actually gonna be\nessential for us to make sure that we're\n\n158\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.200\npointing to the right DNS servers that we\nwant people to take as they go somewhere.\n\n159\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.985\nSo imagine at this point when\nwe start talking of Office 365,\n\n160\n00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:26.768\nif I want all of my internal end\nusers to be able to use a certain DNS\n\n161\n00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:31.486\nserver to get to services that\nare available on Office 365.\n\n162\n00:09:31.486 --> 00:09:35.627\nI wanna point them to the right\nDNS server that will resolve\n\n163\n00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:39.441\nthe services over inside\nof the Office 365 cloud.\n\n164\n00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:43.980\nSo that's why it's important\nthat we know this as well, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.750\nNow, the other one of course then are what\nare some of those services that I mean and\n\n166\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.150\nI'm talking about?\n\n167\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.650\nWell, MX record is by far probably the\nones that we're probably gonna be setting\n\n168\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.230\nup more often than we think here, which\nof course is the Mail Exchange record,\n\n169\n00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.990\nwhich means for email services.\n\n170\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.670\nSo of course this has been around for\na long time, but\n\n171\n00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.130\nthe great thing is Office 365 offers us so\nmuch great help in setting this up.\n\n172\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.840\nWe'll see exactly how to set this up and\nwhat's required of us to make sure that\n\n173\n00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.350\nall this is working in a way that we want\nto, along with Office 365 as well, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.040\nSo when we get a request for\nan email server,\n\n175\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.450\nthat's the record that's being used here,\nis the MX one as well, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.750\nNow it is important that the MX record at\nthis point, right, is always pointing to\n\n177\n00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:38.470\nthe email servers A record, not to\na canonical name but to an A record.\n\n178\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.280\nIf somehow, some reason, that somebody\nmade a mistake in this configuration at\n\n179\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.290\nthis point, your poignancy email\nis not gonna work very well.\n\n180\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.600\nBut make sure that your MX record is\nalways pointing to the A record there\n\n181\n00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.940\ntoo, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.648\nNow the other ones that we also see\nright here that we'll also have to deal\n\n183\n00:10:56.648 --> 00:10:57.816\nwith is this SPF.\n\n184\n00:10:57.816 --> 00:10:58.970\nAnd make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n185\n00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.160\nCuz I always get the names kind of\nmessed up here, Sender Policy Framework.\n\n186\n00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:09.010\nSo the sender policy framework tells\nus which particular host is actually\n\n187\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.030\nauthorized to use the domain name.\n\n188\n00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:18.220\nSo when it actually gets a hello or a mail\nfrom command, this is what tells it where\n\n189\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.210\nto essentially go and what to do at that\npoint, what server hosting that as well.\n\n190\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.430\nAlso, we have the SRV or\nthe Service Locator Record.\n\n191\n00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.600\nUsually for\nus it points to the domain controller, but\n\n192\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.270\nany other specific types of services that\nwe want to point to, we can also do that.\n\n193\n00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.633\nAnd then lastly, the idea of\nthe text record in DNS allows us\n\n194\n00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:44.104\nto have messages inside of DNS\nthat we need to get ready to go.\n\n195\n00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:49.632\nNow we're gonna see that for\nus this TXT record is really gonna become\n\n196\n00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:54.776\nessential if we want to make sure\nthat everything is gonna line up\n\n197\n00:11:54.776 --> 00:12:00.327\nto where I can actually use my\nexisting DNS along with Office 365.\n\n198\n00:12:00.327 --> 00:12:05.082\nAnd it will tell us exactly how to do\nthat or we'll see that the TXT record is\n\n199\n00:12:05.082 --> 00:12:09.840\nwhat shows us that we actually do have\nownership of that particular domain\n\n200\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.245\nname or that domain when we\nget ready to do so, okay?\n\n201\n00:12:13.245 --> 00:12:17.830\nSo Office 365 even though\nthere's some generic ones here,\n\n202\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.586\nit uses all of this to make sure\nwe're actually gonna be able to not\n\n203\n00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:27.602\nonly stick with the onMicrosoft.com\nrecords that are ready there,\n\n204\n00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:32.035\nbut also with what I have here\nexisting on my network as well.\n\n205\n00:12:32.035 --> 00:12:35.437\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, we've not really\nsetup any of this on DNS right now,\n\n206\n00:12:35.437 --> 00:12:38.910\non your computer here, but\nit seems to be working, right?\n\n207\n00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so in Office 365,\nwe've got it setup.\n\n208\n00:12:41.863 --> 00:12:46.880\nSo let me see if I can go back\nto our Office 365 account now.\n\n209\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.081\nIn the previous episode, because I\ncreated the account under my name,\n\n210\n00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:52.351\nRonnie Wong, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:54.017\nI am the global administrator as well,\n\n212\n00:12:54.017 --> 00:12:57.800\nbut also in a previous episode I showed\nyou where you could create another user.\n\n213\n00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.900\nThat's essentially gonna end up being\nthe global administrator account, okay?\n\n214\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.310\nAnd so if I'm actually the one setting up,\nI probably don't want to use that account,\n\n215\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.300\nso who was hosting with me\npreviously was Cherokee.\n\n216\n00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.670\nAnd I had set up Cherokee as\nbeing the global administrator.\n\n217\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.831\nSo instead we're gonna use Cherokee's\naccount because in the end, right,\n\n218\n00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.887\nif I'm not part of the organization.\n\n219\n00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:23.432\nIn other words, if I'm setting this up for\nsomebody else as a contractor or\n\n220\n00:13:23.432 --> 00:13:26.262\nsomebody is paying my company\nservices to do this, right?\n\n221\n00:13:26.262 --> 00:13:32.165\nI'm going to log in as them instead,\nand set everything up here.\n\n222\n00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:36.622\nI really don't want to use my credentials\ninside of a domain that I'm not gonna have\n\n223\n00:13:36.622 --> 00:13:38.600\nreally any association with.\n\n224\n00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.619\nThe only thing I did was\nhelp them to set it up.\n\n225\n00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:43.575\nSo I don't want any real\nthings actually attached to\n\n226\n00:13:43.575 --> 00:13:44.225\nme-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n227\n00:13:44.225 --> 00:13:46.860\n&gt;&gt; In terms of the setup\nthat we're going to do.\n\n228\n00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.062\nSo from this point on, we're probably\ngonna stay logged in essentially as\n\n229\n00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:54.929\nCherokee or, if we actually want to,\nwe can create another admin and\n\n230\n00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:56.880\nmake that happen instead, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.640\nSo, let's show you what Zach is\ntalking about here to help us out.\n\n232\n00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.029\nRemember, we haven't manipulated or\nchanged any DNS anything.\n\n233\n00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:06.383\n&gt;&gt; No, I didn't see you do that, anyway.\n\n234\n00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:08.680\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's working.\n\n235\n00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.096\nAnd Office 365 is working.\n\n236\n00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:13.940\nBut it's not currently\nworking with my domain.\n\n237\n00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.805\nNow, if I go to the Admin center through\nthe Admin tower that we see right here,\n\n238\n00:14:18.805 --> 00:14:23.818\nif I select Admin, the one thing I don't\nlike about, and I don't know why people\n\n239\n00:14:23.818 --> 00:14:28.568\nkind of love this or hate this, but\nhelp keeps opening up in additional tab.\n\n240\n00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:31.570\nSo even though it's the same thing.\n\n241\n00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.540\nSo, look, notice that there's the original\nplace, and now it actually sends me to\n\n242\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.000\nanother tab, and it's gonna send me to\nmore tabs as we continue to go through.\n\n243\n00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.859\nBut here we're actually in the [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Boxes and windows, yes?\n\n244\n00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:43.247\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I love these tabs,\n\n245\n00:14:43.247 --> 00:14:44.868\nwhatever it does, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:53.040\nSo if I scroll down over here on the\nleft-hand side to Setup, then to Domains.\n\n247\n00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.840\nYou'll notice that there really\nis one domain at this point,\n\n248\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.140\nwhich is our default, okay?\n\n249\n00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.786\nAnd I didn't setting this up,\nthis is what we'll set up with Office 365.\n\n250\n00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:08.440\nBut that is not my domain here.\n\n251\n00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.366\nThis onmicrosoft.com, that is Office 365.\n\n252\n00:15:12.366 --> 00:15:17.764\nAnd even inclusively in Office 365 itself,\nthis is actually all of\n\n253\n00:15:17.764 --> 00:15:23.260\nOffice 365's domain records,\nokay, hosted on their DNS server.\n\n254\n00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.890\nThis is what they are doing, and it allows\nme to go ahead and continue to do that.\n\n255\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.440\nIf I click on these\nDNS Custom Records here,\n\n256\n00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.920\nnotice there aren't really\nany custom records.\n\n257\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.890\nSo in the background of this, even though\nit is setup to run, it is running all\n\n258\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:44.110\noff of whatever the defaults were set for\nOffice 365 to work and run.\n\n259\n00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.292\nBut if I needed to run with my domain\nthat I am gonna choose, then I'm gonna\n\n260\n00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:52.609\nactually need a lot more configuration\nto get something like this done, and\n\n261\n00:15:52.609 --> 00:15:56.328\nthat's what we want to make sure\nthat we understand here, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:56.328 --> 00:16:00.264\nWe are gonna have to be able instead\nto kind off change up some of\n\n263\n00:16:00.264 --> 00:16:02.270\nthe stuff that we need to.\n\n264\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.885\nTo make it actually end up working out,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:07.782\nSo that's what we wanna\ntalk about as well.\n\n266\n00:16:07.782 --> 00:16:11.589\nSo what are some of the changes\nthat we are going to need to do?\n\n267\n00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:15.491\nWell, you have to know some of the\ninformation for your organization, or for\n\n268\n00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:18.568\nwhoever's organization that\nyou're setting this up for.\n\n269\n00:16:18.568 --> 00:16:23.651\nSo, for example,\nI know that I have itprotvdemo.com and\n\n270\n00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:28.531\nitprodemo.org stored in one\nparticular DNS registrar\n\n271\n00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:33.427\nNow these are the DNS servers\nout there on the Internet.\n\n272\n00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:37.410\nSo let me change back to this\nperspective for a moment and\n\n273\n00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.919\nlet's talk about that concept\njust briefly before we move on.\n\n274\n00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:46.506\nSo, I'm just gonna click on this tab\nwhere I've a got a setup for internal and\n\n275\n00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.495\nexternal DNS and\n\n276\n00:16:47.495 --> 00:16:51.328\nmake sure that we understand\nthe same name resolution process.\n\n277\n00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:55.130\nNow Zack, before when we looked\nat it from the inside, right?\n\n278\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.875\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I was just connecting to the DNS server\n\n279\n00:16:57.875 --> 00:16:59.493\ninside of my own network.\n\n280\n00:16:59.493 --> 00:17:00.113\n&gt;&gt; Right right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n281\n00:17:00.113 --> 00:17:03.358\nit worked exactly the same way\nthat I just described, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:03.358 --> 00:17:07.559\nSo we were all going to,\nlet's say www.itprotvdemo.com,\n\n283\n00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:12.185\nnotice that the DNS inside here says hey,\nhere's how you get that.\n\n284\n00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:15.711\nAnd let's say that this is the IP\naddress for that server, okay?\n\n285\n00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:18.660\nBut what if you're outside\non the Internet, okay?\n\n286\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.949\nYou're outside on the Internet and\nnow you want to go to that same location.\n\n287\n00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:26.634\nWell I don't want anybody\non the outside here, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:26.634 --> 00:17:31.457\nComing in an connecting my DNS server\nover here on this side inside of my\n\n289\n00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:34.749\nnetwork to get the IP address to go here,\nokay?\n\n290\n00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:38.761\nSo what I want them to do\ninstead is when they go here,\n\n291\n00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:42.703\nI need to have a DNS record\nout here on the Internet.\n\n292\n00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:48.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that say's, one of that\nrecognizes that hey, this particular\n\n293\n00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:53.520\nserver from this side, you'd get to it\nby using a public IP address instead.\n\n294\n00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.888\nIt's not necessarily recognizing\nthem as much as it's saying,\n\n295\n00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:00.809\nyou're still gonna get there but\nyou're gonna use a different address than\n\n296\n00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.949\nwhat you actually used internally\nif you're on the inside.\n\n297\n00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:04.642\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n298\n00:18:04.642 --> 00:18:08.291\nlet's make sure that we kind of\nunderstand why this is important.\n\n299\n00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:12.569\nThis is important because two\nthings are gonna end up happening\n\n300\n00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:14.675\nultimately in Office 365.\n\n301\n00:18:14.675 --> 00:18:19.128\nThe first one is simple, it's the way that\nwe want to connect from everybody inside\n\n302\n00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:21.496\nmy network we're wanna use Office 365.\n\n303\n00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:26.356\nWell, when we go here we want them to\nhit our own DNS servers get directed\n\n304\n00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.711\nout to the Office 365 content.\n\n305\n00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:31.249\nMakes sense to the cloud and\neverything else.\n\n306\n00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:35.227\nWe want them to hit that first and go out\nthere and be able to get access help.\n\n307\n00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:37.332\nBut what if I take Zach and\n\n308\n00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:42.151\nZach is a travelling sales\nperson in my company, right?\n\n309\n00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:44.900\nWell, Zach if you're\ntraveling out there and\n\n310\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.798\nlet's say we sent you out\nthere to South Dakota.\n\n311\n00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:49.525\n&gt;&gt; My favorite.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, South Dakota.\n\n312\n00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.620\nWe sent you all the way\nout to South Dakota.\n\n313\n00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.191\nAnd now, you need to access\nyour Office 365 account.\n\n314\n00:18:56.191 --> 00:19:00.974\nWell, if you open up a browser,\nI do not want you to have to connect all\n\n315\n00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:05.526\nthe way back over here to my internal\nserver to get access to what?\n\n316\n00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:07.481\nTo Office 365 club.\n\n317\n00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:08.873\nThat wouldn't make sense.\n\n318\n00:19:08.873 --> 00:19:13.579\nSo instead, we actually set up records\nup here that makes sure that they can\n\n319\n00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:15.458\npoint to the right location.\n\n320\n00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:18.812\nAnd the same thing would happen for\nOffice 365 as well.\n\n321\n00:19:18.812 --> 00:19:22.453\nSo if I know what those resources are for\nOffice 365,\n\n322\n00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:25.485\nit means I have to set\nthose records over here.\n\n323\n00:19:25.485 --> 00:19:27.734\nThat point to Office 365.\n\n324\n00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:28.305\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n325\n00:19:28.305 --> 00:19:33.044\n&gt;&gt; And also internally I need to set\nthose records up over here as well, okay?\n\n326\n00:19:33.044 --> 00:19:37.847\nSo I need them on both sides\nof this to be setup correctly.\n\n327\n00:19:37.847 --> 00:19:42.266\nNow, that means I have to access\nmy external, what we call,\n\n328\n00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:48.176\nDNS registrar to make sure that I can do\nthis and that I have access to this, okay?\n\n329\n00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:53.820\nBecause Office 365 in the way that it's\nset up right now is not just gonna say,\n\n330\n00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.234\nwell okay, just set it up with\nanybody's DNS records, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:58.234 --> 00:20:02.635\nSo in other words, you'd have to\nbe able to prove that you have\n\n332\n00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:07.644\nownership of that domain name before\nyou can actually set all this up.\n\n333\n00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:11.649\nIf not, we could actually do this with\nanybody's account and mess around and\n\n334\n00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:13.941\nredirect them to where\nwe wanted them to go.\n\n335\n00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:15.605\nSo that's what you have to be able to do.\n\n336\n00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:17.271\nSo before we get started, and\n\n337\n00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:21.611\ngetting everything set up like what we\nwere talking about right here, okay?\n\n338\n00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:26.470\nWe need to verify, or\nwe need to be able to prove that we have\n\n339\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.957\naccess to our DNS account to do so, okay?\n\n340\n00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:31.290\nSo the great thing is,\n\n341\n00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.365\nsince I told you that there's already\ngood documentation on this and\n\n342\n00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:40.298\ngetting it all set up, that's what we're\nactually gonna take a look at next here.\n\n343\n00:20:40.298 --> 00:20:45.520\nNow, before we do so, I wanna make sure\nwe actually hit a couple of items here.\n\n344\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.394\nAnd this is strictly for\nknowing for the exam, and\n\n345\n00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:52.925\nif I just walk through the wizard I'm\nnot gonna point out, I'm gonna forget.\n\n346\n00:20:52.925 --> 00:20:55.367\nSo let me make sure that\nwe start to do this and\n\n347\n00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:58.211\nstart to talk about a couple\nof things here, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:02.558\nSo, one of the things that you\nwant to make sure of, first and\n\n349\n00:21:02.558 --> 00:21:07.014\nforemost, is that if you\nare working with multiple domains.\n\n350\n00:21:07.014 --> 00:21:11.336\nAnd they're all gonna be accessing and\nusing Office 365,\n\n351\n00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:14.254\nyou have to do this for all those domains.\n\n352\n00:21:14.254 --> 00:21:15.695\nSo even if you just set up one,\n\n353\n00:21:15.695 --> 00:21:19.800\nthat's fine but if you're gonna actually\nhave multiple domains, sub-domains,\n\n354\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.699\nwhatever it is that's gonna be working\nwith it, make sure you set those up too.\n\n355\n00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:26.492\nSo, you might have to run through\nthis wizard two or three times, or\n\n356\n00:21:26.492 --> 00:21:28.409\nmaybe even more,\ndepending on what you have.\n\n357\n00:21:28.409 --> 00:21:32.840\nSo, for example,\nif IT Pro TV continues to grow,\n\n358\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.850\nit might be where we have a us.ipro.tv,\nand\n\n359\n00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.859\nthen let's say we go over to the European,\nor\n\n360\n00:21:40.859 --> 00:21:47.849\nlet's say that we go where Greg is,\nright, to the UK and we go uk.itpro.tv.\n\n361\n00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:50.236\nWell, I need to set both of those up so\n\n362\n00:21:50.236 --> 00:21:54.709\nfirst I would set up itprotvdemo\nbecause that's the parent domain.\n\n363\n00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:58.894\nAnd then I would set up\nus.itprotvdemo.com and\n\n364\n00:21:58.894 --> 00:22:02.986\nthen uk.itprotv.demo.com as well, okay?\n\n365\n00:22:02.986 --> 00:22:07.820\nSo I could do that but I need to make sure\nthat if I'm working with multiple domains,\n\n366\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.841\nthat I have access to all of those.\n\n367\n00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:16.171\nNow you might find yourself in a little\nbit of a conundrum here to a point, right?\n\n368\n00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:19.547\nEven if you're the one in charge\nof setting this up, it doesn't\n\n369\n00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:23.689\nnecessarily mean that you'll be given\naccess to change all of these records.\n\n370\n00:22:23.689 --> 00:22:26.115\nIt'd be nice, don't get me wrong.\n\n371\n00:22:26.115 --> 00:22:27.058\nSo what does this mean?\n\n372\n00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:28.418\nIt means coordination.\n\n373\n00:22:28.418 --> 00:22:32.738\nSo it might mean that you have to be able\nto work with whoever's in charge of those\n\n374\n00:22:32.738 --> 00:22:33.709\nthings instead.\n\n375\n00:22:33.709 --> 00:22:34.622\n&gt;&gt; Delegation.\n&gt;&gt; And yeah,\n\n376\n00:22:34.622 --> 00:22:36.978\nyou'll have to actually kind of go,\nall right,\n\n377\n00:22:36.978 --> 00:22:41.010\nhere's the information that Office 365\nneeds and here's what I need you to do.\n\n378\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.031\nSo you might have to email that\ninformation and then they'll get it put\n\n379\n00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:48.586\nwhere it needs to go and\nthen everything will get put up right.\n\n380\n00:22:48.586 --> 00:22:52.111\nBut if everything works out fine then\nyou'll actually be able to see it\n\n381\n00:22:52.111 --> 00:22:53.377\nwon't take long at all.\n\n382\n00:22:53.377 --> 00:22:55.771\nBut you might see that\nit might take a day or\n\n383\n00:22:55.771 --> 00:23:00.292\ntwo before you're actually able to\ncomplete everything depending on how many\n\n384\n00:23:00.292 --> 00:23:04.009\nlayers of administration you have\nto go through as well, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:07.476\nAll right, the other thing that I wanted\nto make sure that I pointed out here\n\n386\n00:23:07.476 --> 00:23:09.803\ntoo is I know that this\nseems a little bit unusual.\n\n387\n00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:16.173\nBut Zack, there's a maximum limit of\ndomains that you can have set up for\n\n388\n00:23:16.173 --> 00:23:22.345\nIT Pro or for your Office 365 account,\nand that is 600 domains.\n\n389\n00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:26.485\n&gt;&gt; So, at 600 domains,\nyour enterprise location, or\n\n390\n00:23:26.485 --> 00:23:29.489\nyour enterprise business, whatever.\n\n391\n00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:31.003\nJust 600, that's it?\n\n392\n00:23:31.003 --> 00:23:32.249\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Zack, that's right.\n\n393\n00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:35.074\nOnce you get to 601, you're kind of done.\n\n394\n00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:39.590\nSo, I know that it sounds a little\nridiculous, but apparently is enough that\n\n395\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:43.423\nit is in documentation somewhere\nthat they want to know about it.\n\n396\n00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:50.857\nAnd I've never actually helped anybody\ncreate an Office 365 domain for\n\n397\n00:23:50.857 --> 00:23:54.756\nmore than five or ten domains at a time.\n\n398\n00:23:54.756 --> 00:24:00.700\nBut 600 apparently seems to be kind of\nthe upper limit of what you can do.\n\n399\n00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.547\nSo you happen to be working with\na large organic enterprise and\n\n400\n00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:07.104\nthere's than that You might have to kind\nof split that off into even a couple of\n\n401\n00:24:07.104 --> 00:24:08.930\ndifferent accounts to make that work.\n\n402\n00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:13.272\n&gt;&gt; Now, is that according to Office 365,\nor what is this according to?\n\n403\n00:24:13.272 --> 00:24:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is kind of\nthe limit through Office 365, so\n\n404\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.410\njust realize that once you hit 600 and\nthat 600 comes along, yeah, you might have\n\n405\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.080\nto kind of do some other finagling here-\n&gt;&gt; And make it 602.\n\n406\n00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.794\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, well,\nyou just never know but you know you know.\n\n407\n00:24:30.794 --> 00:24:33.397\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; And that's it, you realize that too.\n\n408\n00:24:33.397 --> 00:24:37.540\nThe recommended best practice of course\nis make sure you start up among the root\n\n409\n00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.610\ndomains first if you gonna do this.\n\n410\n00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.357\nOkay and then add in those sub-domains and\nchild domains as well.\n\n411\n00:24:44.357 --> 00:24:47.624\nSo that is really gonna be important for\n\n412\n00:24:47.624 --> 00:24:53.366\nwhat we actually want to be able to\ndo as we continue on as well, okay?\n\n413\n00:24:53.366 --> 00:24:54.200\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n414\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:59.036\n&gt;&gt; So let's make sure that we understand\nthat before we go ahead and do that too.\n\n415\n00:24:59.036 --> 00:25:03.673\nNow Zach, I believe that there's actually\na question that kinda popped up in our\n\n416\n00:25:03.673 --> 00:25:04.636\nchat room here.\n\n417\n00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.426\nSo let's take a look at that question for\na moment as well.\n\n418\n00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:10.483\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, Ronnie, we have a question\nfrom Greg Stewart out of UK and\n\n419\n00:25:10.483 --> 00:25:11.975\nI'm gonna read this little bit.\n\n420\n00:25:11.975 --> 00:25:16.469\nAnd does that mean you can have users\nusing different data centers, or\n\n421\n00:25:16.469 --> 00:25:20.940\nis that controlled by the country\nwhere you set up yesterday?\n\n422\n00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.969\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, actually, that's a great\nquestion here as we start to take a look.\n\n423\n00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:27.982\nBecause of the way that\nOffice 365 ends up working,\n\n424\n00:25:27.982 --> 00:25:31.570\nyou can actually do it in the way\nthat we described it right here.\n\n425\n00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:35.890\nSo it allows us to not worry about\nthe limitations of each data center but\n\n426\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:40.649\nbecause of where your registers are,\nremember that that's a global system.\n\n427\n00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:42.721\nAnd so it may take up to 72 hours or\n\n428\n00:25:42.721 --> 00:25:46.376\nlonger before everything\nconverges the way that we want to.\n\n429\n00:25:46.376 --> 00:25:48.425\nSo it could be where you have in Europe or\n\n430\n00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:51.777\nover in UK where you have those\ndomains where you set them all up,\n\n431\n00:25:51.777 --> 00:25:56.018\nit's still gonna propagate over to us at\nsome point and the same thing over here.\n\n432\n00:25:56.018 --> 00:25:59.775\nIt's gonna propagate over there\nin terms of the DNS records.\n\n433\n00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:05.074\nNow you can also end up using Office 365's\nown DNS servers to get that set up, and\n\n434\n00:26:05.074 --> 00:26:10.318\nall that stuff that through those global\nsystems and through those data centers.\n\n435\n00:26:10.318 --> 00:26:11.430\nBut it should work just fine.\n\n436\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.267\nSo there isn't a limitation globally for\n\n437\n00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:17.515\nthe way that DNS ends up\nworking in this system.\n\n438\n00:26:17.515 --> 00:26:21.372\nSo that should kind of help us out\nwithout having to worry about any type of\n\n439\n00:26:21.372 --> 00:26:23.600\nsegmentation that may end up happening.\n\n440\n00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.265\nNow just when I say that, right?\n\n441\n00:26:25.265 --> 00:26:27.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More than likely somebody will go,\n\n442\n00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:29.311\nno you can't do this through China.\n\n443\n00:26:29.311 --> 00:26:33.099\nWell, I can't stop the way that\nthe political stuff ends up working.\n\n444\n00:26:33.099 --> 00:26:35.431\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But in theory overall though,\n\n445\n00:26:35.431 --> 00:26:40.547\nit should not matter because of the way\nthat DNS is actually propagating.\n\n446\n00:26:40.547 --> 00:26:43.617\nThrough systems that aren't gonna\nbe controlled by Microsoft,\n\n447\n00:26:43.617 --> 00:26:46.240\nthey're really just hitting\nthose servers there and so\n\n448\n00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.440\nwe shouldn't have to worry about\nthe changes at all in that.\n\n449\n00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.283\n&gt;&gt; Yeah great question Greg,\nthanks very much.\n\n450\n00:26:52.283 --> 00:26:54.383\n.Just remember, only 600.\n\n451\n00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:58.444\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know yeah, it's strange\nit sounds like a limitation but\n\n452\n00:26:58.444 --> 00:27:01.375\nI bet just somebody out\nthere has [CROSSTALK] And\n\n453\n00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:06.050\nI could see like governments\nhitting limitations at some point.\n\n454\n00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.980\nBut just kinda realize that is limitation,\nand\n\n455\n00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.545\nmore than likely she's actually\nworking for our government.\n\n456\n00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:12.630\nI'm gonna assume that Office 365 or\n\n457\n00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:16.862\nMicrosoft will make an exception for you\nand they'll figure out how to make that\n\n458\n00:27:16.862 --> 00:27:20.667\nbigger if you are giving them\na million plus, 2 million subscribers.\n\n459\n00:27:20.667 --> 00:27:25.724\nLet's say, 20 bucks a month, I'm gonna say\nthat they're willing to make an exception.\n\n460\n00:27:25.724 --> 00:27:27.574\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n461\n00:27:27.574 --> 00:27:29.439\nOr even a scholastic enterprise for\nthat matter.\n\n462\n00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:31.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.\n\n463\n00:27:31.037 --> 00:27:32.998\n&gt;&gt; Colleges, secondary, tertiary schools.\n\n464\n00:27:32.998 --> 00:27:35.658\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think once you start\ndoing that, at $20 a month,\n\n465\n00:27:35.658 --> 00:27:37.901\nplus a million users and\nyou add that up over a year,\n\n466\n00:27:37.901 --> 00:27:40.846\nthat starts to add up to a little\nbit of change for just one account.\n\n467\n00:27:40.846 --> 00:27:41.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n468\n00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.806\n&gt;&gt; So, I think, that they'll make an\nexception if you do that, but, in general,\n\n469\n00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:47.848\nthe 600 is kind of our limit here.\n\n470\n00:27:47.848 --> 00:27:51.648\nNow there are some other things that\nwe also have to think about, too, and\n\n471\n00:27:51.648 --> 00:27:54.265\nthis depends on your subscription level,\nokay?\n\n472\n00:27:54.265 --> 00:27:58.441\nThough I can say I can walk\nthrough the wizard and\n\n473\n00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:03.043\nthat's fine but\nsubscription level is important.\n\n474\n00:28:03.043 --> 00:28:07.575\nInside of the small, and I'll make sure\nI'm telling you that, inside of the small\n\n475\n00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:11.848\nbusiness plans as well, you may actually\nfind out that don't have the ability\n\n476\n00:28:11.848 --> 00:28:16.580\nto use anything but Office 365 for\nwhat they want you to actually be of use.\n\n477\n00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.793\nSo in other words, you may not\nhave the ability to kind of go,\n\n478\n00:28:19.793 --> 00:28:23.333\nI wanna handle my own DNS records and\nyou use the domain in the wave.\n\n479\n00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:25.254\nYou may actually have to go ahead and\n\n480\n00:28:25.254 --> 00:28:28.399\ntransfer all your DNS stuff\nover to Office 365 as well.\n\n481\n00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:32.495\nEnterprise in mid size, you can still\nmanage your own [INAUDIBLE] we'll get to\n\n482\n00:28:32.495 --> 00:28:36.890\nthat point when we start to get everything\ntogether the way they'd want to.\n\n483\n00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:41.592\nBut just kind realize that you do have\nthat plan for the small business size,\n\n484\n00:28:41.592 --> 00:28:44.310\nyou might find out that they're saying no,\n\n485\n00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:49.234\nwe won't try to mess around with that\nenterprise, and of course governments,\n\n486\n00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:53.519\nthey can manage their own DNS and\nthey're perfectly fine to do that.\n\n487\n00:28:53.519 --> 00:28:58.355\nAll right Zack, so at that point I know\nthere's just a few of those details,\n\n488\n00:28:58.355 --> 00:29:03.343\nWe just have to get in there before we do\nanything but, Zach, now we are ready to\n\n489\n00:29:03.343 --> 00:29:07.654\ngo ahead and start setting an episode\nthat we can bring our domain and\n\n490\n00:29:07.654 --> 00:29:11.240\nmake it actually start\nworking with our Office 365.\n\n491\n00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.376\nBut I noticed something, Zach, is that\nit looks that we are out of time for\n\n492\n00:29:15.376 --> 00:29:18.267\nthis episode, so\nwe may have to carry in a part two.\n\n493\n00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:19.200\nThat's what we'll have to see.\n\n494\n00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.216\n&gt;&gt; And we want to because you're\ndoing such a wonderful job.\n\n495\n00:29:21.216 --> 00:29:25.578\nYou're taking this through this step by\nstep, add a configure, custom domains,\n\n496\n00:29:25.578 --> 00:29:27.151\npart two, this was part one.\n\n497\n00:29:27.151 --> 00:29:32.625\nWatch them both and in fact watch\neverything and the series of Office 365.\n\n498\n00:29:32.625 --> 00:29:34.313\nYou're gonna be very glad that you did.\n\n499\n00:29:34.313 --> 00:29:37.255\nAnd check out our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n500\n00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:39.404\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n501\n00:29:39.404 --> 00:29:40.935\nGreat job Ronnie, thank you.\n\n502\n00:29:40.935 --> 00:29:42.738\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n503\n00:29:42.738 --> 00:29:44.136\nThey're gonna be glad you did.\n\n504\n00:29:44.136 --> 00:29:44.964\nThanks for watching.\n\n505\n00:29:44.964 --> 00:29:45.788\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n506\n00:29:45.788 --> 00:29:46.487\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n507\n00:29:46.487 --> 00:29:48.017\n&gt;&gt; And we will see

00:00:08.247\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.832\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:13.871\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:15.690\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.700\nI’m your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.800\nAnd this is Office 365 as we add and\nconfigure custom domains,\n\n9\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.480\npart two and we've brought along\nRonnie Wong to show us the way.\n\n10\n00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.690\nRonnie good to have you here,\nthanks for being here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.280\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Zach for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.180\nas we continue to take a look at\nthis idea of adding custom domains.\n\n13\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.830\nIn our previous episode, we did talk\na little bit about some of the things you\n\n14\n00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.700\nhave to think about and\nwe gave you a little premier of DNS.\n\n15\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.520\nAnd now that you have at least\na foundational understanding of that,\n\n16\n00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.470\nit means, we can move forward with\nconfiguring additional domains for\n\n17\n00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.690\nour Office 365 account.\n\n18\n00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.150\nNow, if this is your first time doing it,\nit's easy to get confused,\n\n19\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.700\nbecause I remember the first\ntime that I set it up.\n\n20\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.280\nI was a little bit confused about, well\nwhy do I need this particular domain that\n\n21\n00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.190\nends on Microsoft.com, and why do I need\nto add in my own domain if everything is\n\n22\n00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.060\nactually working, and it's kind of\na little bit tricky in your own mind.\n\n23\n00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.110\nBut once you have the solid concepts of\nDNS down, it will make a bit more sense.\n\n24\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.860\nSo, be sure you review that information.\n\n25\n00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.340\nIf you really, if you go like, I really\ndon't think I have a solid grasp of that,\n\n26\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.550\ngo back and watch some of the different\nshows right here in the IT Pro TV library,\n\n27\n00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.110\nbut there's plenty of content\nout there on the internet\n\n28\n00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.300\nthat can help you get a better and\nsolid understanding of that.\n\n29\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.781\nEspecially when you're now trying to\nbring your information to Office 365, and\n\n30\n00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:44.355\nmake it use your particular information,\nas well inside of the Office 365 cloud.\n\n31\n00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:46.120\nSo that is where we are.\n\n32\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.930\nWe are now ready to run through and show\nyou how you add in an additional domain,\n\n33\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.400\nand configure it to work with Office 365.\n\n34\n00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.090\nBut let's go to my screen.\n\n35\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.860\nThat will help us out as we do this.\n\n36\n00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.750\nNow, I've got two different screens\nthat are up that we'll be looking at\n\n37\n00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.180\nprimarily here.\n\n38\n00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.380\nI know it may take us\na little bit of time.\n\n39\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.760\nMy typing abilities are not the greatest,\nespecially when somebody's watching me and\n\n40\n00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.620\nwhen I'm trying to do this on screen here,\nbut you'll actually\n\n41\n00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.790\nend up seeing that we'll have to\ncreate a couple of different records.\n\n42\n00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.440\nI also have, before you, here is\nwhere my domains are as well, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.710\nSo you'll see that I\nhave these two domains.\n\n44\n00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.100\nAnd it just depends on which one,\nI think I've selected itprotvdemo.com.\n\n45\n00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.760\nI'm gonna use this one for us.\n\n46\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.460\nBut if that one doesn't work for\none reason or another,\n\n47\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.100\nif I've used it before and it still kind\nof hanging on in the background somewhere.\n\n48\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.742\nI'll switch over and\nwe'll do the itprotvdemo.org.\n\n49\n00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:44.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; To help us, too, okay?\n\n50\n00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.640\nNow, these are really important, and\nthey're also important inside your\n\n51\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.611\norganization, because if you\nset up active directory and\n\n52\n00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:55.870\nyou're planning on bringing those active\ndirectory accounts and Office 365.\n\n53\n00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.770\nYou've gotta make sure that they match up,\nso\n\n54\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.770\nwhichever one that you're using\nmake sure you're doing that.\n\n55\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.180\nFor me if this one doesn't work,\nthat means I have to go back and I have to\n\n56\n00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.880\nrebuild my domain controller with users\nin it with this particular name instead.\n\n57\n00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.630\nBut that's for another story, so\nlet's just cross our fingers and\n\n58\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.050\nhope that everything actually\nworks the way that I want to.\n\n59\n00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.650\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n60\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.420\n&gt;&gt; So the great thing is, once we get\nhere, so lets, let me remind you of how\n\n61\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.910\nI got to this point sometimes I forget and\nI kinda skip a head a little bit.\n\n62\n00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.070\nOkay, so\nif I wanted to addin an additional domain.\n\n63\n00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.070\nI'm going to select the Admin center tile.\n\n64\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.270\nAnd inside of that Admin center\ntile over on the left hand side,\n\n65\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.190\nI'm gonna scroll down.\n\n66\n00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.350\nTo reset set up.\n\n67\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.110\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm to set up domains.\n\n68\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.390\nAll right?\n\n69\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.140\nNow I'm going to clasp this right hand\non the left hand navigation pinned down.\n\n70\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.450\nHere's a little bit more of screen real\nestate here so that we can see this.\n\n71\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.210\nThe great is I have these two options\nright here that I can select.\n\n72\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.970\nAdd a domain, or buy a domain.\n\n73\n00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.951\nI might not have actually\never done this before, and\n\n74\n00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:07.340\nnow that I'm starting my company and\nusing Office 365,\n\n75\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.428\nI don't want my email addresses being\nronnie@itprotvdemocode.onmicrosoft.com,\n\n76\n00:04:12.428 --> 00:04:16.628\nthat's a long email address, and\nif you printed that on a business card,\n\n77\n00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:20.193\nit's going to take up the entire\nlength of the business card.\n\n78\n00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:20.845\n&gt;&gt; It would.\n\n79\n00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:22.840\n&gt;&gt; Is what's going to end up happening.\n\n80\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.210\nSo, I can buy my own domain and\n\n81\n00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.290\nhave it hosted right there on\nMicrosoft's site if I want to.\n\n82\n00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.880\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n83\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.920\n&gt;&gt; So that's actually a great\none that's right there.\n\n84\n00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.320\nBut let me just select that one to\nhelp us out here just to see this.\n\n85\n00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.900\nNow, notice it says, hey, if you're gonna\ndo this, because I'm running on a trial\n\n86\n00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.680\nplan, because we're only doing\nthis as trial for the show here.\n\n87\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.150\nIt says you need to go ahead and\npurchase your particular account first.\n\n88\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.080\nAnd then you can walk\nthrough those steps to do so.\n\n89\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.460\nSo you may actually have to go ahead and\ndo that first.\n\n90\n00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.960\nSo we're not gonna worry\nabout that one too much.\n\n91\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.350\nAnd that one's not really called\nout on the exam either, but\n\n92\n00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.400\nyou'll be able to walk through that.\n\n93\n00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what you can do and\n\n94\n00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.710\neverything else.\n\n95\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.180\nThe key is to have a unique domain name.\n\n96\n00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.720\nAnd then that's to key.\n\n97\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.390\nSo if you come up with something, and\n\n98\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.210\nZach comes up with the same thing but\nten minutes earlier and he registers his.\n\n99\n00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.990\nWell, more than likely\nhe's actually gonna win,\n\n100\n00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.470\nis actually what's gonna end up happening.\n\n101\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.930\nSo just kind of realize that too,\nall right?\n\n102\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.370\nSo let's add in an additional domain.\n\n103\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.171\nMy goal is to add in\nthe ITProTVdemo.com or\n\n104\n00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:27.830\ndemo.org into this particular\nset right here and\n\n105\n00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.460\nthen to make sure it works along with\nmy DNS registrar records as well, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.710\nSo notice this actually got,\njust really couple of steps here, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.040\nFirst, of course, is to add the domain.\n\n108\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.680\nSecondly, is to verify and\n\n109\n00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.860\nthen third after that is to set\nup your online services, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.780\nSo that's actually pretty good and\n\n111\n00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.960\neverything else that needs to update\nthe final DNS settings to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.920\nNow, all of this other\nstuff right here right?\n\n113\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.740\nIt really doesn't happen\ninside of Office 365 so\n\n114\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.020\nmuch as much as it happens well\nreally on your own register as well.\n\n115\n00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.860\nSo the first thing that\nwe need to do then is,\n\n116\n00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.190\nenter a domain you own and\nthat is the key term right here.\n\n117\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.661\nOne that you own, that's not one\nthat you can experiment with,\n\n118\n00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:18.790\nnot one that you think that you can get.\n\n119\n00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.938\nThis is one that you've already\nessentially you're paying for\n\n120\n00:06:22.938 --> 00:06:26.930\nthat particular domain name, and\nyou know of course that what\n\n121\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.570\nyour particular service is going to be or\nwhere your register is.\n\n122\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.880\nIf you heard of godaddy, another places\nlike that they pretty much do this for\n\n123\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.140\nyou as well, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:45.050\nSo here I'm gonna do itprotvdemo.com,\nall right?\n\n125\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.840\nSo, it actually even tells right me hey\nhere's what your email addresses will look\n\n126\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.800\nlike is this pretty much what\nyou want from that point.\n\n127\n00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.330\nSo if I select next, now it says, we\nactually are going to add that domain in,\n\n128\n00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.530\nand then notice the second step here,\nwhich is to verify the domain.\n\n129\n00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.810\nSo to keep your domain secured we\nneed to prove that you own it,\n\n130\n00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.180\nso it doesn't just allow you\nto add in a record any place.\n\n131\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.660\nOkay, it just says, hey to prove\nthat you can manipulate this and\n\n132\n00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.870\nthat you can actually change this do this.\n\n133\n00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.440\nIt's simply creating a text record or\n\n134\n00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.650\nan MX record inside of your DNS registrar,\nokay?\n\n135\n00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.750\nSo on this one,\nthis is where we have to kind of\n\n136\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.810\nwrite down a little bit of information\nto help us out because if not,\n\n137\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.730\nI wouldnt be all that you should\nsee this on a single screen, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.940\nSo first, notice it actually\nsays I can either a @ symbol,\n\n139\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.610\nor I can skip it and it depends\non your particular provider here.\n\n140\n00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.410\nBut the numbers that I really\nwant to actually write down\n\n141\n00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.970\nis the one that is right here on the MS,\nokay.\n\n142\n00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:02.060\nSo, this is ms, in lower case, 23577200.\n\n143\n00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:08.248\nAnd then for the TTL this is\ngoing to be 3,600 seconds here.\n\n144\n00:08:08.248 --> 00:08:11.950\nSo that's, what is that, an hour or so?\n\n145\n00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.940\nIf I believe I'm correct at that point.\n\n146\n00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:22.110\nThat those are kind of the two, and\nI can do an @ symbol, with a txt name.\n\n147\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.220\nSo I'm just going to use this txt record,\nis actually what I'm going to do.\n\n148\n00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.370\nright.\n\n149\n00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.110\nNotice that we can also get someone\nto help you to do this as well.\n\n150\n00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.830\nNow this is where it can\ntake a bit of time right.\n\n151\n00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:42.990\nOne, if you are not in control of\nthe DNS registrar like I am here okay,\n\n152\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.560\nyou might have to first of all\ncontact whoever it is that\n\n153\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.510\nwill allow you to do this, or\nwhoever it is that will do this for you.\n\n154\n00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.590\nJust give them all of this information\nthat you're seeing right here.\n\n155\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.160\nThen you can go ahead and do that.\n\n156\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.510\nNow or they'll that for you and\nthen they'll enter it in.\n\n157\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.850\nOkay, so once you have that stuff\nset up here, then you're fine.\n\n158\n00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.290\nNow the other one is if you'd\nreally don't know what to do,\n\n159\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.210\nyou can get someone to help you.\n\n160\n00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.360\nAnd normally this will allow,\nit will open up a window and\n\n161\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.630\nyou'll contact Microsoft and they'll have\nsomeone right there to call you back or\n\n162\n00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.770\nto text you or to chat with you.\n\n163\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.120\nSee if they can get you to get\nall this stuff set up, ok?\n\n164\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.860\nNow, just kind of realize,\nit may take longer than you think,\n\n165\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.100\nif you're going to wait on them to do so,\nbecause they're very busy.\n\n166\n00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.970\nSo it may be where you schedule a time for\nthem to call you back.\n\n167\n00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:40.010\nAnd I did that where, not for\nthis in particular, but\n\n168\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.490\nbecause I had issues in\nsetting up a DNS record.\n\n169\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:49.110\nAnd the reason why is, at least for a\ncustomer here when I did this, is, I said,\n\n170\n00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.970\nwell where is the DNS record hosted?\n\n171\n00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.188\nAnd they said, it's hosted over here.\n\n172\n00:09:53.188 --> 00:09:59.190\nI was like, I said, okay, well, let's get\nlogged in, and they said, no, it's fine.\n\n173\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.780\nJust send us the information.\n\n174\n00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.965\nWell, we send them\nthe information that they needed,\n\n175\n00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:04.780\njust from this screen\nright here that we did.\n\n176\n00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.190\nAnd I kept doing this and\nit keeps failing.\n\n177\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.420\nEven though I've added in the record,\nOffice 365 is not recognizing it.\n\n178\n00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.710\nSo we did it two or three times.\n\n179\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.778\nFinally, I had to contact someone\nat Microsoft and say look,\n\n180\n00:10:16.778 --> 00:10:17.960\nwe've got the record.\n\n181\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.320\nAt least the guy says it's open and\neverything's ready to go, but\n\n182\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.460\nI can't get in there.\n\n183\n00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.150\nI can't do anything and\nit doesn't look like it's adding it in.\n\n184\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.450\nWell, we realize or\n\n185\n00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.530\nat least the person realizes and\nhe's like I know what ended up happening.\n\n186\n00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.250\nSo we find out they had\nmoved the DNS records or\n\n187\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.010\nthe ownership of that DNS from\none registrar to another one.\n\n188\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.720\nSo we thought we were actually working\nwith say for example with GoDaddy, but\n\n189\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.310\nit ended up being over at Hover, or it\nended up being at AWS or whatever it was.\n\n190\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.300\n&gt;&gt; So we were trying to\nmodify the wrong records.\n\n191\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.870\nOr I wasn't even told that\nthe records were actually modified.\n\n192\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.840\nThey just said we took care of it.\n\n193\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.200\nso you get it sometimes you\nactually get that too, but\n\n194\n00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.370\njust kind of realize you can get\nsomeone to help you as well.\n\n195\n00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.450\nAlright.\nSo here it is.\n\n196\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.760\nFollow these step-by-step instructions,\nAdd the TXT record values below at Hover.\n\n197\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.810\nSo the great thing is it already saw\nthat it was at hover and if I select\n\n198\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.960\nthat notice,\nit takes me right here and it says,\n\n199\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.930\nhere it is, you can see,\nwe'll add that in so it actually did,\n\n200\n00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:27.020\nwas able to take me here and see all\nof that information here on this one.\n\n201\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:35.130\nSo if I now select edit on IT Pro TV\nDemo Now I can go come in here and\n\n202\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.010\nstart to actually see some of\nthe different records that we can add it,\n\n203\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.350\nall right.\n\n204\n00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.170\nSo it's at this point that\nthat's what we wanna do.\n\n205\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.920\nWe wanna go ahead and begin to do this and\n\n206\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.120\nto add in at least a couple of\nrecords that is going to help us out.\n\n207\n00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:57.460\nSo for me to do that, let me see where I\nneed to go at this particular point here.\n\n208\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.460\nThere we go, okay.\n\n209\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.510\nSo notice that it actually ask\nabout the records right here.\n\n210\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:07.290\nName servers, DNSSEC, glue records,\nauthorization code, registrar.\n\n211\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.270\nSee what we can do here on DNS.\n\n212\n00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.200\nAll right, so it's right here that\nI need to add in that record with\n\n213\n00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.380\nthe txt values that I'm seeing right here,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.870\nSo notice that there's a couple of them,\nhere's one with the symbol and\n\n215\n00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.580\nan A record and of course, even the IP\naddress, that's perfectly fine.\n\n216\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.750\nNow I select add new, and\nit's gonna say the host name.\n\n217\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.470\nAnd on this one it says we can\nenter a nickname if we want to, but\n\n218\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.530\nlet's say I'm gonna assign the @ symbol\nbecause that's what it said to do.\n\n219\n00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.170\nOn the record type here\nit's gonna be a TXT, and\n\n220\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.690\nthe only value that it wants\nme to do Is gonna be ms.\n\n221\n00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.195\nLet me see if I can copy that instead.\n\n222\n00:13:01.304 --> 00:13:03.008\nLet's see if it'll allow\nme to copy it over here.\n\n223\n00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:08.010\nThere we go.\n\n224\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.310\nI can add that value in there and\nclick Save.\n\n225\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.170\nOnce I do that,\nI can take a look down here and\n\n226\n00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.520\nsee where it's actually been added in.\n\n227\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.150\nAnd notice that I don't get\nthe chance to add in like the TTL,\n\n228\n00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.450\nthe Time To Live value as well.\n\n229\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.370\nSo here, it allowed me to do that and\nadd that record right in here.\n\n230\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.366\nI'm just gonna leave that up and\nopen for right now.\n\n231\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.840\nAnd then, once everything is done,\nwhatever it actually says, so\n\n232\n00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.718\nhowever much value I can do,\nif I select verify,\n\n233\n00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:51.210\nAnd now it actually shows me\na couple of different things.\n\n234\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.930\nOne or more of these records have not yet\nbeen added.\n\n235\n00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:57.690\nSo here is actually saying this is not yet\nbeen correctly added so\n\n236\n00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.140\nI need dash adding that MS= apparently.\n\n237\n00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.480\nThat's what I need to do.\n\n238\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.442\nSo let me go back here and edit this.\n\n239\n00:14:07.663 --> 00:14:09.402\nMS=.\n\n240\n00:14:12.736 --> 00:14:13.994\nAnd now let's see.\n\n241\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.947\nIf that ends up working for us.\n\n242\n00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.480\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie it looks like you're\ndoing everything correctly.\n\n243\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.120\nWhat seems to be the problem here?\n\n244\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.870\n&gt;&gt; All right Zach, I believe that it is,\nbut I could be wrong.\n\n245\n00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.750\nLet me test it out and make sure.\n\n246\n00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.160\nLet's go back in to domains and then.\n\n247\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.800\nRight here, if I select IT Pro TV\ndemo.com, maybe underneath this\n\n248\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.110\nDNS management tab but it looks like its\nbringing me through the same exact setup.\n\n249\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.940\nAnd this is not what I really need to do.\n\n250\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.300\nSo now that my mind is kind of hovering\nthrough this The idea of actually\n\n251\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:59.010\ntransferring it over and allowing the DNS\nservers for Office 365 to take over,\n\n252\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.450\nI realize I need to go ahead and\ninstead go to my own DNS registrar.\n\n253\n00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.520\nSo if I select at the top here\nmy Hover account, then I go and\n\n254\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.160\nfind my itprotvdemo.com account,\nNow I need to go in, and there it is.\n\n255\n00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.980\nNotice that there is a link right here for\nnameservers.\n\n256\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:26.450\nIf I select edit now, it's right here\nthat I can add in the information, and\n\n257\n00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.440\nthis is where you want to write this stuff\ndown or get ready to do a screenshot,\n\n258\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.350\nwhatever it is-\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n\n259\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.190\n&gt;&gt; That you like your preference to be.\n\n260\n00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:40.444\nAnd we'll see we're gonna reuse that ns1,\nokay, for nameserver1 here.\n\n261\n00:15:40.444 --> 00:15:48.361\nThen it's gonna be\n.bdm.microsoftonline.com,\n\n262\n00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:52.365\nand it's pretty much going to\nbe the same thing down here.\n\n263\n00:15:52.365 --> 00:15:56.000\n.bdm Microsoftonline.com.\n\n264\n00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.700\nOkay?\n\n265\n00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.910\nSo this will go ahead and\ngive you that information as well.\n\n266\n00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.770\nSo, by adding this in,\nwe begin that first step in doing those.\n\n267\n00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.460\nNow, remember, I'm not actually\ngoing to change this for right now.\n\n268\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.210\nIt says save the name server,\nI would save it.\n\n269\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.740\nAnd I have to now allow for that\nthe propagate through everything, right?\n\n270\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.610\nSo this can take sometime.\n\n271\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.280\nYou wanna be careful in doing this\nespecially in the production network\n\n272\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.780\nbecause this has dramatic changes on\nwhere all of your external DNS servers\n\n273\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.870\nare gonna be pointed, and if you don't\nhave all that set up inside of your DNS.\n\n274\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.680\nTheir Office 365 to handle that, well\nyou're going to start missing some things.\n\n275\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.470\n&gt;&gt; So you do want to be careful here\nwhen you're doing this in a production\n\n276\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.410\nenvironment, because it can affect\nhow DNS is used out on the internet.\n\n277\n00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:55.210\nWhere people are trying to get to you as\nwell, if you're not careful at this point.\n\n278\n00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.630\nNow if you are using\nan internal DNS server.\n\n279\n00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:04.250\nAs well as an external DNS server too\nin your network like what we're using.\n\n280\n00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.780\nIf we're actually going to do that\nwe would change it here okay?\n\n281\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:14.070\nIn our hover registration but\nalso on my internal DNS server as well.\n\n282\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.390\nWe would add this in as being\nof the forwarding servers..\n\n283\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.570\nThat we also need to be able to do,\ntoo, okay?\n\n284\n00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.440\nNow, if we're gonna do this we wanna\nhold off in adding in our MX record\n\n285\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.210\nto match and\ndo everything up Office Online as well.\n\n286\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.040\nIt's Best practice at this\npoint to hold off until\n\n287\n00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.850\nyou feel comfortable that\nall the migration is done.\n\n288\n00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.430\nAnd then switch that on over as well,\nokay.\n\n289\n00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.680\nSo a couple of different things if you\nare starting to transfer, or getting all\n\n290\n00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:48.320\nthe set up so that you can essentially\nmove the ownership of those DNS records\n\n291\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.870\nover to Office 365 But this is the process\nthat it begins with right here, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.560\nI would make sure I pay attention to these\nlines especially in getting ready for\n\n293\n00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.540\nthe exam.\n\n294\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.930\nIt's going to help you out.\n\n295\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:05.040\nAnd there is no real one button that\nallows you to transfer the names,\n\n296\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:11.520\nthe DNS ownership all the way over\nto office 365 Inside of Office 365.\n\n297\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.930\nSo make sure you realize that\nit's not gonna be there.\n\n298\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.370\nIt does take a manual process and\njust about everything that we've done\n\n299\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.790\nin these couple of episodes\nhas been a manual process.\n\n300\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.070\nSo once we actually get all of\nthat done you have now been\n\n301\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:30.180\nable to successfully see some of that\ninformation Handed over and ready to do.\n\n302\n00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.830\nNow, because we didn't actually\nhave all those services set up yet,\n\n303\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.920\nI'm going to wait until we get some of\nthose services set up, and then add those\n\n304\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.210\nDNS records along the way, making\nsure that we are up and ready to go.\n\n305\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.240\nNow, if you do not have any of\nthat configured, such as Skype for\n\n306\n00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.560\nbusiness online, and your email is not up,\nand you're not using SharePoint and\n\n307\n00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.420\nstuff, Setting it all up now is\nprobably the better thing to do because\n\n308\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.740\nit means it's ready to go\nwhen you're ready to go,\n\n309\n00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.150\nand everything will be\npretty much handled for you.\n\n310\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.120\nBut for our sake, we're just gonna kind\nof leave it as is for right now and\n\n311\n00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.380\nhave it actually kind of build up as\nwe move along through our series here.\n\n312\n00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.490\n&gt;&gt; Doing a great job, Ronnie, as usual.\n\n313\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:12.100\nAdd and configure custom domains,\npart one and two.\n\n314\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.760\nWatch them both.\n\n315\n00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.840\nIt's for the exam.\n\n316\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.380\nAnd make sure you see everything in\nthe Microsoft Office 365 series,\n\n317\n00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.440\nalso good for you.\n\n318\n00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.400\nAnd check out our course library,\nhundreds of videos,\n\n319\n00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.870\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n320\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.450\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n321\n00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.140\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n322\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.840\nThanks

You're watching, ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:13.079\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\n\n5\n00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.968\nchoosing ITProTV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:21.864\nI'm your host Zach Memos, and this is\nOffice 365, Pilot Users and Workloads.\n\n7\n00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:22.830\nWonderful episode, and\n\n8\n00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.730\ngiving us all the information we need,\nit's the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.200\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n10\n00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.806\nThanks.\n\n11\n00:00:27.806 --> 00:00:31.937\n&gt;&gt; Well Zach, thank you again for having\nme back on the show, as we continue to\n\n12\n00:00:31.937 --> 00:00:36.332\nlearn a little bit more of course,\nabout getting Office 365 set up Now, even\n\n13\n00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:40.946\nthrough the number of episodes that you've\nactually probably seen at this point.\n\n14\n00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:45.385\nIf you've been following along from the\ntop of the order like we normally see in\n\n15\n00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:46.203\nour library.\n\n16\n00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:49.930\nWell, we are now at this point and saying\nhey, we really haven't seen a lot but\n\n17\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.452\nyou have.\n\n18\n00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:54.857\nRemember that you've actually taken a look\nat how to get started in setting up\n\n19\n00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:56.710\nan Office 365 tenet.\n\n20\n00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.650\nWe showed you of course, how to create\ndifferent user accounts, at least one\n\n21\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.190\nuser account as well, and assign\ndifferent administrative roles, as well.\n\n22\n00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.090\nWe've even showed you how to make sure\nthat you can add in a domain that you're\n\n23\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.530\nalready using into your Office 365.\n\n24\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.620\nSo there's a lot of steps that\nare involved in just a few\n\n25\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.210\nepisodes that we've already take and\nlook at too.\n\n26\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.986\nNow, when it gets down to that point,\n\n27\n00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.439\nthere's still some other\nthings that are going on.\n\n28\n00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.782\nCuz ultimately,\nthis is not just the idea of a sandbox and\n\n29\n00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:30.210\na play station for me to be able to learn.\n\n30\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.300\nEven though you might be getting ready for\nyour exam, itself.\n\n31\n00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.860\nUltimately, right, the end result,\nthe certification, but\n\n32\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.070\nas well as you understanding how you're\ngonna help the customer to get ready for\n\n33\n00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.610\na migration to Office 365, as well.\n\n34\n00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.400\nSo that means that at this point Zach,\n\n35\n00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.670\nwe really have not really considered\nthe organization, itself.\n\n36\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.210\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n37\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.665\n&gt;&gt; We haven't considered any of that.\n\n38\n00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:56.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And as we do so,\n\n39\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.640\nthere's really two approaches\nthat we can take, Zach.\n\n40\n00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.164\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n41\n00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:02.982\n&gt;&gt; One is simple, we just go,\nall right everybody, so whoever you are,\n\n42\n00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:04.620\nI've got 5,000 users.\n\n43\n00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.742\nHere's what's gonna happen next week,\nwe're gonna switch over to Office 365.\n\n44\n00:02:08.742 --> 00:02:12.500\nWell Zach, imagine some of the panic\nthat may go on at that point.\n\n45\n00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.850\nSome of the comments that you get from\npeople just being thrown this information\n\n46\n00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.390\nand just told,\nhere's what's gonna happen next week.\n\n47\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.930\nGet used to it.\n\n48\n00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.626\n&gt;&gt; Might be a little rough, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n49\n00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:24.231\nthe idea of rough is kind of\nan understatement, right?\n\n50\n00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might get more than you actually\n\n51\n00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440\nbargained for at that point in time.\n\n52\n00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.277\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And if you do something like that,\n\n53\n00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:34.305\nthat also mean Zach that you and I we're\nactually the support team for this.\n\n54\n00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:38.060\nThere's a lot in our plate to get\nready before that point in time.\n\n55\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.535\nAnd then, to also think about the users\nand what their experiences gonna be like.\n\n56\n00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:44.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; As well as actually understand when\n\n57\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.930\nthey running issues, why the issues\nare happening that way that they are.\n\n58\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.020\nSo instead, one of the best things\nthat we can do is to actually\n\n59\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.160\nthink about planning what we\ncall a pilot in Office 365.\n\n60\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.520\nNow, that in itself, Zach,\nthat sounds a little bit confusing.\n\n61\n00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.048\nWhat do you think when you hear the term,\na pilot?\n\n62\n00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:07.494\n&gt;&gt; Well, my very first thought is a pilot\nlike when you have a pilot error,\n\n63\n00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:09.570\nwell it wasn't, there was a pilot error.\n\n64\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.970\nI made that mistake.\n\n65\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.670\nBut in this case,\nwe're talking about it being a project.\n\n66\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.865\nWe talked about a pilot as a test.\n\n67\n00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nthat's exactly what we're talking about.\n\n68\n00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.290\nSo, it's not a sandbox per se, right?\n\n69\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.630\nWe're not just trying to go, I like\nthat feature, or I like this feature.\n\n70\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.410\nWe're now actually saying,\nwhat can we do, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.410\nTo get ready for\nour organization to really adopt this and\n\n72\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.419\nto get everything in place.\n\n73\n00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.752\nA pilot really begins with\na sampling of real users that\n\n74\n00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:42.567\nare out there on our network.\n\n75\n00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:45.540\nBut at the same time\nallowing them to preview,\n\n76\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.190\nallowing them to test out the features.\n\n77\n00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.840\nAllowing them to see the benefits\nas well as, actually,\n\n78\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.510\nget their user experience\nabout what is going on.\n\n79\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.110\nNow, behind all this, Zach, it says,\nyou kind of think about it and go, well,\n\n80\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.820\nwhy not just toss it\nout to everybody then?\n\n81\n00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.630\nWell, there's a good reason, okay.\n\n82\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.338\nIf I am trying to get this all set up,\nZach, for\n\n83\n00:04:07.338 --> 00:04:10.820\nan organization,\nlet's say again of 5,000 people.\n\n84\n00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.918\nOkay, and now we toss it out there\nnext week and we get that to happen.\n\n85\n00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.515\nWhat happens, Zach,\nif all of a sudden we come back and\n\n86\n00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:23.900\n50% of our users are not able to get\nlogged in, and to get their email?\n\n87\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.700\nWhat happens to their productivity?\n\n88\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.940\nWhat do you think happens to their\nproductivity at least in that day?\n\n89\n00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.610\n&gt;&gt; Time lost is money lost.\n\n90\n00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nlet's say it's 50% of our users.\n\n91\n00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That would be a lot.\n\n92\n00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.660\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot to actually\nhave to deal with, and\n\n93\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.240\nnow you're trying to figure\nout a couple of other things.\n\n94\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.470\nOne, of course,\nhow to get productivity back?\n\n95\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.420\nTwo, why did it happen?\n\n96\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.420\nIs it the same thing that everybody\njust forget their password?\n\n97\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.560\nIt's possible, or is there\nan underlying infrastructure issue\n\n98\n00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.080\nthat somewhere I'm gonna blame Zachary.\n\n99\n00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.770\nSomewhere Zach didn't\nget it setup correctly.\n\n100\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.404\n&gt;&gt; It's all my fault, always is.\n\n101\n00:04:55.404 --> 00:04:57.306\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So in that sense, right,\n\n102\n00:04:57.306 --> 00:05:00.830\nwhat we would rather do is\nto do something like this.\n\n103\n00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.570\nWe take a portion of our users, and\nwe actually run them as a pilot program.\n\n104\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.972\nIn other words, there's a very small and\nlimited idea here, of saying,\n\n105\n00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.956\nhere's what we believe\nthat it should work like.\n\n106\n00:05:12.956 --> 00:05:17.220\nNow when we do that, Zach,\nif I go ahead and take this for example.\n\n107\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.820\nAnd do something like this,\n\n108\n00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.700\nI'm not really affecting the overall\nproductivity of my company, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.651\nIt allows me to set it up, verify,\nget good feedback coming back in.\n\n110\n00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:32.228\nMaking sure that things are tested out,\nmaking sure that we get what we need to.\n\n111\n00:05:32.228 --> 00:05:36.870\nBut at the same time not really bringing\nproductivity down, but figuring out also\n\n112\n00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.930\nsome of the kinks that we haven't thought\nabout when we start adding users in.\n\n113\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.260\nAt this point, we've added in two users.\n\n114\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.450\nOkay, you've seen how to at least\nget the tenant up and operating.\n\n115\n00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.680\nIt's not the most difficult\nthing in the world.\n\n116\n00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.298\nBut when you start adding in users and\nthen having start managing them-\n\n117\n00:05:54.298 --> 00:05:54.927\n&gt;&gt; Multiple users, yeah.\n\n118\n00:05:54.927 --> 00:05:58.927\n&gt;&gt; And then, start adding in services\nthat need to be turned on and\n\n119\n00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:01.271\nturned off and restricting access.\n\n120\n00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:05.278\nIt begins to become a little bit\nmore overwhelming at that point.\n\n121\n00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:10.116\nAnd me, at least as an example,\nI would rather start doing that with,\n\n122\n00:06:10.116 --> 00:06:11.926\nlet's say, 50 users.\n\n123\n00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:15.166\nOr maybe just 15 users,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n124\n00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:19.120\nrather than 5,000 at a time\nright at the beginning.\n\n125\n00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.735\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n126\n00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:25.238\nplanning out a pilot is an essential\npart of what you can do, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:29.292\nTo make sure that everything is gonna\ngo right when we start to think about\n\n128\n00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:33.710\nthe idea of ultimately deploying\nOffice 365 to our entire company.\n\n129\n00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.350\n&gt;&gt; So here we're thinking about\na pilot as a test, or a test group, or\n\n130\n00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.810\na test program.\n\n131\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.540\nTesting it up.\n\n132\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.650\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what we're gonna do.\n\n133\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.250\nSo, let's talk about it these ideas Zach,\njust briefly here\n\n134\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.850\nabout some of the activities that were\nprobably gonna see during our pilot.\n\n135\n00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.630\nSo, I've made a list some of\nthese different activities\n\n136\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.862\nthat should help us out a little bit.\n\n137\n00:06:54.862 --> 00:06:58.270\nNow it's just a simple list, there's\nnothing really exciting about this list,\n\n138\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.620\nand nothing really important\nin terms of the exam.\n\n139\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.510\nIt is is important that you think about\nsome of the things that you're more than\n\n140\n00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.715\nlikely to see here, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:05.479\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, some of\n\n142\n00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:08.890\nthe more common activities that we\nwanna make sure that we understand.\n\n143\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.320\nIs that the real kind of goal as we\nget started, right, is to check for\n\n144\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.100\nthe readiness.\n\n145\n00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.790\nIs my organization ready to do this?\n\n146\n00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.269\nAnd so that is a big part.\n\n147\n00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:22.330\nNow that's not the only part, we're\nreally focusing in on this kinda third\n\n148\n00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.370\nbullet point right here in this show.\n\n149\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.410\nBut I wanted to kinda give\nan overview before we started here.\n\n150\n00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.400\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, but we're gonna be checking for\n\n151\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.130\nthe readiness.\n\n152\n00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.790\nNow readiness means,\nis my organization ready?\n\n153\n00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.850\nBut also, what about the infrastructure\nthat I just set up for Office 365?\n\n154\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.610\nDid I get all those configurations right\nat this point and ready to go, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.810\nI may have, I may not have.\n\n156\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.833\nSecondly, is to set up that pilot domain.\n\n157\n00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:52.409\nThe great thing is, we've already talked\nabout adding in more domain names, and\n\n158\n00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.676\nshowed you how to also do that, as well.\n\n159\n00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:56.723\nSo getting that ready to go and testing,\n\n160\n00:07:56.723 --> 00:08:00.713\nverifying that those are actually Working\nthe way that we expect them to work.\n\n161\n00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.083\nAll that is actually great, as well.\n\n162\n00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.929\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna be focusing on this\n\n163\n00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:09.660\nadding users, or in other words,\nDesignate Pilot Users here, okay?\n\n164\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.605\nWe don't want to add in every single\nuser in my organization to a pilot.\n\n165\n00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:15.970\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; What I want to do is actually select\n\n166\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.430\njust a few, and we'll talk about\nthe selection criteria in a moment.\n\n167\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.210\nOf course,\n\n168\n00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.120\nwe wanna take a look at the existing\nservices that are running in our network.\n\n169\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.020\nSo, when we actually set up the pilot, and\n\n170\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.780\nwe now have our designated pilot\nusers that are gonna be part of this.\n\n171\n00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.750\nCan they still get access to email, okay?\n\n172\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.820\nIn other words, can they still\ndo their work once this is done?\n\n173\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.105\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's easier to do this\n\n174\n00:08:40.105 --> 00:08:44.979\nwith again like five, 15, 50, if we need\nto, rather than 5,000 that one time.\n\n175\n00:08:44.979 --> 00:08:45.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n176\n00:08:45.966 --> 00:08:50.339\n&gt;&gt; That way we can go ahead and\njust verify this also out too, okay?\n\n177\n00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.142\nCollaboration sites, if we're using\nsomething like SharePoint for\n\n178\n00:08:54.142 --> 00:08:55.693\na collaboration, Yammer.\n\n179\n00:08:55.693 --> 00:08:59.722\nWhatever it is that we have available\nto us, if all that's a part of it,\n\n180\n00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:03.753\nmaking sure that those users inside\nof Office 365 are also still able\n\n181\n00:09:03.753 --> 00:09:05.980\nto use that, as well, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.485\nThe other thing that we'll also of course,\n\n183\n00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:11.450\nsee during this time is\npreparing the pilot user.\n\n184\n00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.635\nAnd that means of course,\nwell basic idea of giving them the test,\n\n185\n00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:20.592\nnot the testing, the training that we\nneed to provide for that user, as well.\n\n186\n00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:24.050\nNow this is essential,\nwe don't want to just go right, Zach,\n\n187\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.320\npick out five people and then,\nZach just goes, you, you, you, you, you.\n\n188\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.400\nThis what's gonna happen next.\n\n189\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.773\nYou're probably gonna\nsurprise him a little bit,\n\n190\n00:09:32.773 --> 00:09:37.190\nespecially like somebody that's\na salesperson over there.\n\n191\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.860\nFor your company,\nthat's a multi-million dollar company, and\n\n192\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.320\nhe tells you next week.\n\n193\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:47.150\nHe's got a possible six digit\nfigure deal that's going on and\n\n194\n00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.550\nnow Zach, what have you done?\n\n195\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.750\nYou've just assigned\nthem to a pilot program.\n\n196\n00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.980\nHow do you think that, that person feels?\n\n197\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.732\n&gt;&gt; I think he might be a bit stress.\n\n198\n00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:55.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.220\n&gt;&gt; Because there's possibility, right?\n\n200\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; A new system.\n\n201\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.250\n&gt;&gt; This is a new system.\n\n202\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.080\n&gt;&gt; There's a new system.\n\n203\n00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.620\nMaybe the email works, maybe it doesn't.\n\n204\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.440\nWhat about the phone\nsystem as you were saying?\n\n205\n00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.020\nYou're moving to\nSkype Business right away,\n\n206\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.490\nand you haven't tested it all out, okay?\n\n207\n00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.449\nWell, all of a sudden,\nthat six figure deal,\n\n208\n00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:14.900\n[INAUDIBLE] that person's\nsweating a little bit.\n\n209\n00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.110\nAnd Zach, are you still insistent upon\nputting that person into a pilot program?\n\n210\n00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.465\n&gt;&gt; I might let him go on\nan older system for a while.\n\n211\n00:10:21.465 --> 00:10:24.055\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Till the said deal is done.\n\n212\n00:10:24.055 --> 00:10:26.190\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well see it makes sense, right?\n\n213\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:30.010\nSo that's why we talked about\nthe idea of preparing somebody and\n\n214\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.580\nverifying that it happens, okay?\n\n215\n00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.855\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then of course,\n\n216\n00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:35.313\nwe're gonna run through\nthe testing of the pilot,\n\n217\n00:10:35.313 --> 00:10:37.790\nmaking sure the system's\nwork the way you want to.\n\n218\n00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.490\nYou aren't going to run it,\nas if you're actually on a daily basis.\n\n219\n00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.340\nAnd you were gonna start\nmonitoring that system, as well.\n\n220\n00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.400\nVerifying, see how well it works.\n\n221\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.900\nSee if everybody is actually doing\nthe collaboration, the communication,\n\n222\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.010\nwhatever it is.\n\n223\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.720\nAnd then lastly here,\nwhen everything is done,\n\n224\n00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.140\nthe completion of this pilot is\nlike the completion of a project.\n\n225\n00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.320\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We want to have a report.\n\n226\n00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.890\nNow it doesn't have to be formal.\n\n227\n00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.120\nIt can be.\n\n228\n00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.370\nDepends on your organization.\n\n229\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.650\nIt doesn't have to be as formal as\na report like a written report.\n\n230\n00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.850\nBut it needs to be a report that's saying,\n\n231\n00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.865\nhere are the good things\nabout what we did.\n\n232\n00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; You know\n\n233\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.798\nit's kinda the things that we did okay in.\n\n234\n00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:18.450\nAnd here's where it might be worth us\n\n235\n00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.145\ntaking a look at another system,\nif we need to.\n\n236\n00:11:22.145 --> 00:11:24.960\nNow, nobody likes to\ntalk about that aspect.\n\n237\n00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.782\nBut it is possible where it may not\nbe the fit that we want it to be.\n\n238\n00:11:28.782 --> 00:11:32.780\nMicrosoft of course, goes no there's\nno other fit than Office 365.\n\n239\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.220\nAnd pretty much, it does a majority\nof what most businesses need for\n\n240\n00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.550\ntheir end users to be able to do.\n\n241\n00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.850\nBut the reality, right?\n\n242\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.973\nIs that at the end of this pilot program,\nwe should have all those facts in hand.\n\n243\n00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:50.675\nAnd that is what will give us\nthe ammunition that we need to proceed\n\n244\n00:11:50.675 --> 00:11:52.080\nforward.\n\n245\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.850\nOr give us the actual knowledge that we\nneed to move either at a slower pace or\n\n246\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.380\nto actually say, I don't know if\nthis is really right for us, right?\n\n247\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.170\nBut in the end, if you run through\nall this in the pilot, and\n\n248\n00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:07.930\neverything goes smoothly,\nit really gives you that ability side.\n\n249\n00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.485\nNot only do we need this,\nwe can transition to it fairly easily.\n\n250\n00:12:12.485 --> 00:12:15.619\nWhy, why can you do that with 5,000 users?\n\n251\n00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:16.620\nBecause I've already done it with 50.\n\n252\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.130\nAnd to tell you the truth,\nin the background,\n\n253\n00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.910\nI've already been transitioning\nlet's say 50 more over to it.\n\n254\n00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.405\nNow all of a sudden it's like,\nyou mean people have been on this.\n\n255\n00:12:25.405 --> 00:12:28.900\nYeah, people have been on this for\ntwo weeks now, three weeks.\n\n256\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.740\nAnd now all of a sudden, and\nthey haven't noticed anything different.\n\n257\n00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.870\nNot really, not any difference at all.\n\n258\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.950\nSo, it allows you to\nbe able to have again,\n\n259\n00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:42.240\ngood solid basis of saying hey,\nmy pilot program is beginning.\n\n260\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.710\nBut having said all that, right,\n\n261\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.200\nbecause I told you we were\nfocusing on users at this point.\n\n262\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.838\nWe need to kind of do that instead.\n\n263\n00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:53.685\nSo, we're coming back here to this third\nstage, right here, on adding user ship.\n\n264\n00:12:53.685 --> 00:12:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; What makes for a good pilot user?\n\n265\n00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.028\nAnd that's what we want to be able to do,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:02.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, Zach, when it comes down to it,\n\n267\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.780\nMicrosoft or Office 365\nrecommendation is something like this.\n\n268\n00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.070\nDepending on the number of users in\nyour organization, about 5% is ideal.\n\n269\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.052\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So if we have a hundred users,\n\n270\n00:13:15.052 --> 00:13:17.015\nthat's five users, right?\n\n271\n00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:20.605\nSo in theory,\na thousand users would be 50?\n\n272\n00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:21.115\n&gt;&gt; 50.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah 50,\n\n273\n00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:25.035\nI'm going to go with Zach,\nbecause he's better at Math than I.\n\n274\n00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.955\nSo 50 users, right?\n\n275\n00:13:26.955 --> 00:13:30.805\nBut you want this to be a sampling\nacross all departments, okay?\n\n276\n00:13:30.805 --> 00:13:35.030\nSo don't just do it in one department,\nand not in another department.\n\n277\n00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.570\nThere are some IT teams that\ndo this particular idea.\n\n278\n00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.720\nAnd you can do it this way, but\nOffice 365 doesn't recommend this way.\n\n279\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.990\nBut I know there are some IT\nmanagement teams out there that say,\n\n280\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.920\nhere's what we do.\n\n281\n00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.440\nWe deploy it all to one department first.\n\n282\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.610\nAnd then we'll deploy it\nto another department, and\n\n283\n00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.670\nthen we'll deploy it to another\ndepartment, and another department.\n\n284\n00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.860\nAnd don't get me wrong, you can do that.\n\n285\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.100\nBut what if each department really\nis using things a little bit\n\n286\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.550\ndifferently, okay?\n\n287\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.030\nThey're not really accessing all\nthe resources at the same time.\n\n288\n00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.680\nSometimes, you actually see that they're\nnot using this particular resource at all.\n\n289\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.880\nWell so, the idea though, is to get\na good spread across all of them,\n\n290\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.090\nso that you get a sampling\nof how every department.\n\n291\n00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.080\nWell, really essentially end\nup using the products and\n\n292\n00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.850\nthe services that are part of Office 365.\n\n293\n00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.630\nSo that's the idea that we have here,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.450\nThe other thing of course, and\n\n295\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.450\nthis is now where it becomes a little bit\nmore subjective in this sense, right?\n\n296\n00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.070\nThe idea of actually using a percentage\nis actually fairly objective.\n\n297\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.510\nYou're not trying to discriminate\nbased on a lot of other things.\n\n298\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.390\nBut the rest of this stuff is\nrelatively subjective, so take it for\n\n299\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.490\nwhat it is here.\n\n300\n00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.600\nBut this what Microsoft recommends,\nright?.\n\n301\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.370\nOr Office 365 recommends here.\n\n302\n00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.460\nFull time employees, longer than\nsix months that they've been there.\n\n303\n00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.830\nNow, it doesn't mean that\nyou can't do this for\n\n304\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.920\npeople that haven't been there for\nsix months.\n\n305\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.120\nBut it doesn't make sense, okay?\n\n306\n00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.680\nYou're really making this\na long term solution for you.\n\n307\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.271\nAnd even in your pilot program,\nthat's what you wanna do.\n\n308\n00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:14.342\nIf they haven't been there for six months,\nmore than likely for your company,\n\n309\n00:15:14.342 --> 00:15:17.578\ntheir workload is not where\neverybody's workload is, okay?\n\n310\n00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:22.769\nThey're kind of given a lighter workload\nto make sure that they learn the system.\n\n311\n00:15:22.769 --> 00:15:26.870\nThey're not on the phones as\noften if they're sales people.\n\n312\n00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.780\nThey're not trying to really use\nthis system to their advantage here.\n\n313\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.850\nThey are just really learning\nthe ropes and the basics.\n\n314\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.310\nThat's not what we're doing here, right?\n\n315\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.500\nWhat we're actually doing of course,\nis we want this to work regardless, okay?\n\n316\n00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.950\nSo you're gonna pick those\nemployees that actually have\n\n317\n00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.010\na little bit of tenure in terms\nof the track that they're on.\n\n318\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.152\nBut they'll really giving you\na full performance all the time.\n\n319\n00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:56.333\nAnd they're actually using the system\nlike you expect a regular user would use\n\n320\n00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:56.976\nit, okay?\n\n321\n00:15:56.976 --> 00:15:57.521\n&gt;&gt; That's great.\n\n322\n00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.031\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we want, as well.\n\n323\n00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:03.420\nOkay, now, we've already mentioned\nthis idea of trained workers.\n\n324\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.820\nRemember that if you don't do this, you're\nsetting yourself up for a disadvantage.\n\n325\n00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.750\nThe users may come back and\njust complain like, I know it's brand new,\n\n326\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.010\nI know it's supposed to be the best thing\nout there, I have no clue how to use it.\n\n327\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.580\nWell, that is a waste of your time, and\n\n328\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.600\nall the effort that you\nput into the pilot so far.\n\n329\n00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.210\nTo now actually pick 50 users\nout of your thousand, and\n\n330\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.390\nyou don't provide them the training, okay?\n\n331\n00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.640\nWell, that's a little bit of kind of an\nunusual way to set yourself up for defeat.\n\n332\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.390\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n333\n00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.390\n&gt;&gt; But, it doesn't always have to\nbe the most formalized training.\n\n334\n00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.990\nSo for example, when I helped set this\nup for a small company right away.\n\n335\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.880\nThat was essentially using kind of the\nvery old style system where everything was\n\n336\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.170\nOn Premises, email,\nExchange, all that stuff.\n\n337\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.760\nFile servers, all that was internal.\n\n338\n00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.650\nEverything was set up the way\nthat they wanted to and\n\n339\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.320\nthey started to migrate\ntowards Office 365.\n\n340\n00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.950\nI didn't have to kind of do,\nall right, so here's what we'll do,\n\n341\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.380\nI'm going to set up the classroom and make\nsure that everybody runs through this.\n\n342\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.140\nI simply showed them at least one at\na time as they came in one morning.\n\n343\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.148\nHey, I want you to log\nin to this right here.\n\n344\n00:17:12.148 --> 00:17:15.890\nAnd I showed them how you can\nactually log in just about a similar\n\n345\n00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.470\nas I would regularly\non the desktop system.\n\n346\n00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.215\nI just showed them the new name\nthat they were using instead, okay?\n\n347\n00:17:21.215 --> 00:17:22.000\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n348\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.148\n&gt;&gt; Once I do that, that's that?\n\n349\n00:17:23.148 --> 00:17:26.150\nI'm like pretty much\nthat's all you have to do.\n\n350\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.670\nAnd then I showed those people\nthat were traveling for\n\n351\n00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:33.240\nthe company as well that they could\nget access to the same system\n\n352\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.050\nwithout having to actually go\nthrough a lot of other things here.\n\n353\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.022\nBut all they had to do was log in to\nOffice 365, show them where to go, and\n\n354\n00:17:41.022 --> 00:17:42.170\nwhere to log in from.\n\n355\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.887\nFrom that point on, they were able to\nstart exploring for themselves, and\n\n356\n00:17:45.887 --> 00:17:47.542\nthey asked questions as needed.\n\n357\n00:17:47.542 --> 00:17:51.328\nSo it showed them where they, it didn't\nmatter any more that they were not at\n\n358\n00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:53.290\ntheir office computer sitting there.\n\n359\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.220\nThat they didn't have to have this VPN\nclient that had to be up and running.\n\n360\n00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.350\nDon't get me wrong that'd be nice.\n\n361\n00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.700\nBut they could actually do all this\nthrough a web browser if they chose to.\n\n362\n00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.340\nAnd still get access to those systems, and\n\n363\n00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.940\nmake it actually work\nthe way that they need it to.\n\n364\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.450\nSo it can be just kind of\nat least basic training\n\n365\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.280\nin terms of what they're\nactually going to see.\n\n366\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.150\nAnd, also,\nwhat you're expecting from them too.\n\n367\n00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.330\nAnd that's a big part,\ndon't just go right,\n\n368\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.100\njust use it, and\nif you have any issues report back to me.\n\n369\n00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.000\nWe want those issues, but we also want\ntheir particular user experience too.\n\n370\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.850\nOkay, how did they like it?\n\n371\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.380\nWhat did they find difficult about things?\n\n372\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.520\nWhat was easier, what was not easier?\n\n373\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.380\nWhat could we do to make this a better\ntransition if we were to move this system?\n\n374\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.350\nWe want stuff like that, as well, okay?\n\n375\n00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.360\nAlso, of course, the mix of ages and\nexperience is also good too.\n\n376\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.840\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nwhy the age, and\n\n377\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.070\nwhat's this about the experience here,\nokay?\n\n378\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:56.230\nSome people in terms of experience,\nthey won't need any guidance at all, okay?\n\n379\n00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:59.550\nYou want those users to\nfeel right at home, okay?\n\n380\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.230\nSo you want them to actually go,\nall right,\n\n381\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.080\nI understand what's going on here,\nI'll ask questions if I need to.\n\n382\n00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.250\nYou want that person, because you want\nto know how seamless it is for that guy.\n\n383\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.830\nYou also want the person that maybe not so\n\n384\n00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.170\nas far as exploring everything\nthat's also out there.\n\n385\n00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.880\nBecause you're gonna have new\nusers that are going to be, well,\n\n386\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.520\nhired almost brand new and\ngiving the access.\n\n387\n00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.810\nYou want their experiences well too.\n\n388\n00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.500\nSo a lot of times that is\nassociated with the ID of age.\n\n389\n00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.810\nRemember that everybody learns\ndifferently at different ages.\n\n390\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.029\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they do.\n&gt;&gt; So that's why you want to make sure\n\n391\n00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:39.140\nthat you have that nice mix of age and\nexperience that also goes in that.\n\n392\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.970\nAnd then I was just talking about\nthe idea of providing feedback.\n\n393\n00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.000\nYou provide the training, you provide\nwhat you're actually allowing them to do.\n\n394\n00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.070\nIt will give you kind of the sense of who\nshould be, who should belong to this.\n\n395\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.710\nAll of us have run into this,\nwhere we do want feedback, but\n\n396\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:59.070\nthe first one we get feedback from is\nthe guy that simply says, yeah, it worked.\n\n397\n00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:02.360\nOr no, I didn't like it and\nthere's no other feedback.\n\n398\n00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.530\nThere's almost no feedback.\n\n399\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.440\nJust getting stuff like that.\n\n400\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.330\n&gt;&gt; Not useful.\n\n401\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.820\n&gt;&gt; Now, I mean, what's the use in\nthat except for you to know that hey,\n\n402\n00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.340\nsomething didn't work.\n\n403\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.570\nWell, that doesn't really help you\nas much as, okay, well, thanks.\n\n404\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.670\nI mean, what else can you do besides\ntry to drag information out?\n\n405\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.670\nYou don't need that during a pilot,\nyou want the pilot to run.\n\n406\n00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.140\nYou don't wanna slow down anything,\nwhat you want to do, of course,\n\n407\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.940\nis have somebody that's willing to talk.\n\n408\n00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.100\nYou also don't need the guy that's\nwilling to take six hours to give you\n\n409\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.650\nan explanation that you really\nonly need 20 minutes on either.\n\n410\n00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.560\nSo you gotta be careful in that idea, and\n\n411\n00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.950\nthat's why I said this is subjective,\nright?\n\n412\n00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.990\nThere are people that\ncan add stories to it.\n\n413\n00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.150\nThis guy right here is kind of the long\nwinded guy, you hear me right now.\n\n414\n00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.170\nSo, you can probably figure,\nI'm probably not great for\n\n415\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.490\na pilot program when it comes down to it.\n\n416\n00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.364\nBut that's the idea, okay?\n\n417\n00:20:50.364 --> 00:20:55.830\nSo figuring out the user and the user\ntype when we start to take a look there.\n\n418\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:01.500\nIs something else that is going to be\nreally necessary, because, remember.\n\n419\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.670\nThis is not about the technology so much,\n\n420\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.810\nbut integrating the technology with the\nusers that are really gonna be using it.\n\n421\n00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.880\nSo that user experience\nthat we're talking about,\n\n422\n00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.770\nright there in the middle between that,\nokay?\n\n423\n00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.915\nThat is why it's important for\nthis pilot to move forward, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:16.915 --> 00:21:18.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Now, along with this,\n\n425\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.910\nwe're not done, right?\n\n426\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:24.097\nThere's still a lot of set up for us to\nactually be able to do and to get going.\n\n427\n00:21:24.097 --> 00:21:29.318\nBut the user picking the right pilots\nusers right there are really gonna\n\n428\n00:21:29.318 --> 00:21:34.128\nbe on the central part of what has\nto happen for our organization.\n\n429\n00:21:34.128 --> 00:21:37.180\nOr we're gonna end up with either people\n\n430\n00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.310\nnot willing to kind of do\nany more than they need to.\n\n431\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.990\nOr we're gonna end up with somebody that's\nreally not gonna be very focused or\n\n432\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.440\neven half-hearted about trying with there.\n\n433\n00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.960\nThere's no use in spending money\nif people aren't gonna even try.\n\n434\n00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.530\nSo make sure you get a good,\nsolid, understanding, and\n\n435\n00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.230\na good designation of those\nproduct users that need to happen.\n\n436\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.210\nYou might end up finding out\nthat the best solution is\n\n437\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.330\nget some supervisor and requirement.\n\n438\n00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.190\nBut, hey,\nwho is going to be assigned to this?\n\n439\n00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.422\nAnd it may be that way, and\nthen they come back and\n\n440\n00:22:06.422 --> 00:22:08.992\nthey say,\nwe're gonna assign Zach Memos to this.\n\n441\n00:22:08.992 --> 00:22:14.302\nAnd you might go, I already have someone\nwith Zach's work experience here.\n\n442\n00:22:14.302 --> 00:22:17.315\nDo you have anybody else in your\ndepartment that has less or more, okay?\n\n443\n00:22:17.315 --> 00:22:20.740\nIt might be something like that\nwhere you go, I really need this,\n\n444\n00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.400\nbecause I already have somebody else\nlike that in the program for this point.\n\n445\n00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.060\nSo, it may help you out in that sense.\n\n446\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.490\nAnd we start to actually see and\ndo some of those things.\n\n447\n00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.230\nBut this right here is a primary step.\n\n448\n00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.110\nIf you wanna see whether or not this is\nactually worth pushing forward Office 365.\n\n449\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.652\nSo the pilot as far as selecting users,\n\n450\n00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:43.975\nthat's really kind of\nthe first step that we want.\n\n451\n00:22:43.975 --> 00:22:46.340\nBur, remember, even though I'm\ntelling you all this, right?\n\n452\n00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.500\nIt really is about project management\nto get all this stuff done.\n\n453\n00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.710\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it really comes down to that.\n\n454\n00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.140\nYou can't just go, all right,\nI've got all this stuff here.\n\n455\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.380\nSo let's just kind of do what we need to.\n\n456\n00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.790\nYou really need to manage it as a project.\n\n457\n00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.380\nMake sure that it actually\ncontinues to roll forward,\n\n458\n00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.750\nbecause there is gonna be a completion\nin this project time that you have.\n\n459\n00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:11.030\nFor me, what we're actually doing right\nnow, Zach, is kind of the same thing.\n\n460\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.510\nWe're getting it all setup.\n\n461\n00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.340\nBut I need to finish this by the end\nof that 30 day trial period I have.\n\n462\n00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.715\nBecause if not, I have to start paying for\neverything that I'm seeing right here.\n\n463\n00:23:19.715 --> 00:23:21.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I really don't wanna do that.\n\n464\n00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n465\n00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.410\n&gt;&gt; So\nthere is a time limit on certain things.\n\n466\n00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That we also have to actually think\n\n467\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.680\nabout when we start to work with\nthis idea of the pilot too.\n\n468\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.702\nOkay, so\nthat kind of coverage at least this idea\n\n469\n00:23:33.702 --> 00:23:37.398\nof designating these types of\npilot users for what we want.\n\n470\n00:23:37.398 --> 00:23:41.090\nNow Zach, the other part that\nI told you about, right,\n\n471\n00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.320\nis once I select the right people for\nthis pilot, okay?\n\n472\n00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.920\nThere also then at this point,\n\n473\n00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.550\nsince I don't have anybody else\ninside of my Office 365 organization.\n\n474\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.810\n&gt;&gt; Your workload.\n\n475\n00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.438\n&gt;&gt; Yep, is to talk about this idea\nof workloads here a little bit.\n\n476\n00:23:55.438 --> 00:23:58.596\nAnd when we start taking a look\nwill at this idea of workloads.\n\n477\n00:23:58.596 --> 00:24:02.407\nZach, this is kind of a weird one\nbecause The exam objective sounds\n\n478\n00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:07.119\nspecifically caught what workloads\nare gonna be migrated over to Office 365.\n\n479\n00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:11.555\nBut it really makes us to or\ntells us essentially to think about what\n\n480\n00:24:11.555 --> 00:24:15.430\nworkloads should not be\nmigrated over instead.\n\n481\n00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.580\nSo when we talk about workloads,\n\n482\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.950\nwhat we're really talking about of course\nare services that may end up running.\n\n483\n00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:25.820\nAnd this idea of services here,\nwhen we start to take a look here.\n\n484\n00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.770\nWe have to kind of understand this\nfirst thing that I typed up here\n\n485\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.360\nas a summarization.\n\n486\n00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.110\nWe must understand that not everything\nthat we have going on right now in our\n\n487\n00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:39.118\norganization may ever need to\nbe migrated over to Office 365.\n\n488\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.710\nIt's new, it's shiny, you hear about\nall the great things it can do.\n\n489\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.470\nBut remember what if your system\nright now is working very well.\n\n490\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.930\nEverybody has actually\nfairly well into it.\n\n491\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.040\nThey seem to love the system\nthat's existing right now.\n\n492\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.788\nAnd what are you gonna do.\n\n493\n00:24:55.788 --> 00:24:57.219\nYou're gonna change it, okay?\n\n494\n00:24:57.219 --> 00:25:00.833\nBut you might find out something that\nyou're not gonna be able to change it very\n\n495\n00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:02.148\neasily because it's been so\n\n496\n00:25:02.148 --> 00:25:05.467\nadapted into the system already\nthat you're already running, okay?\n\n497\n00:25:05.467 --> 00:25:09.202\nSo what you may end up finding out,\nwhich is something that can happen,\n\n498\n00:25:09.202 --> 00:25:13.820\nis you may have to build what is called\na hybrid environment to make this happen.\n\n499\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.600\nWhere not everything is actually going\nto be existing in the office 365 Cloud,\n\n500\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.050\nbut you'll have some things there, and\nthen you'll have other things inside of\n\n501\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:26.200\nwhat we call our On-premises\nenvironment instead.\n\n502\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.440\nWhen we actually add\nboth of those together,\n\n503\n00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.140\nthat is what we call a hybrid solution,\nis what it's called, right?\n\n504\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.845\nSo we have existing infrastructure\nwhere I am locally, and\n\n505\n00:25:35.845 --> 00:25:40.006\nthen I have things that exist in\nthe cloud itself that I have there.\n\n506\n00:25:40.006 --> 00:25:45.624\nAnd if I'm actually gonna continue to use\nboth, it may require that hybrid solution.\n\n507\n00:25:45.624 --> 00:25:50.032\nThe time to figure this out, Zach,\nlike I put right here, okay?\n\n508\n00:25:50.032 --> 00:25:50.871\nIt is during the pilot, okay?\n\n509\n00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:52.303\n&gt;&gt; During the pilot, yes.\n\n510\n00:25:52.303 --> 00:25:56.151\n&gt;&gt; The time to not figure it out is\nwhen Zach is now saying I have already\n\n511\n00:25:56.151 --> 00:26:00.690\ntransferred 2,500 users in this,\nand I'm realizing something.\n\n512\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:04.808\nWe may not actually be able to do\neverything that we wanted to do, okay?\n\n513\n00:26:04.808 --> 00:26:06.415\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And-\n\n514\n00:26:06.415 --> 00:26:06.967\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n\n515\n00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:09.143\n&gt;&gt; Once you're already half way there,\n\n516\n00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:11.252\nit's kind of that victory.\n\n517\n00:26:11.252 --> 00:26:15.646\nYou still got to proceed on to victory\nthat it may cost you more than yes you\n\n518\n00:26:15.646 --> 00:26:17.680\nrealize in the very end.\n\n519\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.700\nSo in the pilot is the time to identify.\n\n520\n00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.380\nThis workload is definitely never gonna\nactually be managed in Office 365.\n\n521\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.148\nNow when I have something like this,\n\n522\n00:26:27.148 --> 00:26:31.619\nlet me kind of tell you our own\npersonal solution that we also find.\n\n523\n00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:35.520\nNow we've actually kind of moved on\nto a different solution as well.\n\n524\n00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.164\nSo one of the first things that\nwe dealt with here at ITProTV,\n\n525\n00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:42.800\nZach, as we started to be able to\ngenerate more and more content.\n\n526\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.130\nSo once we got up and running,\ncontent was kind of dribbling out.\n\n527\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:52.308\nWe could get, a few shows a day\ncuz we were a much smaller staff.\n\n528\n00:26:52.308 --> 00:26:53.803\nIt took a lot longer times to get edited.\n\n529\n00:26:53.803 --> 00:26:56.586\nIt took some time to get everything up and\nrunning and\n\n530\n00:26:56.586 --> 00:27:00.790\nthen to upload into the Cloud cuz\nthese are large files that we have.\n\n531\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.450\nSo in that day,\nit was kinda no big deal to keep\n\n532\n00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.930\neverything as far as files\ngo stored locally, okay?\n\n533\n00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.330\nSo we just had a machine and\nwe store them locally.\n\n534\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:15.790\nBut then, once we started ramping up and\nstarted building content rapidly,\n\n535\n00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.400\nall of a sudden we ran\nout of space quickly.\n\n536\n00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.280\nIt was just like a matter of four or\nfive days and\n\n537\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.840\nwe were like, how many shows,\nand all of a sudden, there it is.\n\n538\n00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.230\nWe ran out of space.\n\n539\n00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:31.420\nWell, we could have continued to try to\nbuild another storage solution here but\n\n540\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.660\ninstead what ended up happening\nis we said let's go to the Cloud.\n\n541\n00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.773\nSo we went to Office 365.\n\n542\n00:27:37.773 --> 00:27:42.196\nWe started moving into the OneDrive for\nBusiness stuff and trying to actually make\n\n543\n00:27:42.196 --> 00:27:47.110\nsure that everything would actually go\nup there and do what we wanted to do.\n\n544\n00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:51.790\nWell, it seemed like it was working,\nbut at the same time we weren't\n\n545\n00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:56.150\nable to ever get it working in the way\nthat we really wanted it to, okay?\n\n546\n00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.380\nIt's not a blame on Office 365,\nit could be on our side, okay?\n\n547\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.670\nIt just never seemed to be\nthe way that we really wanted\n\n548\n00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:08.110\nto go when we started uploading and\ngetting stuffed away that we wanted to.\n\n549\n00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:12.280\nSo we said no, let's go ahead and\ndo this to save us time.\n\n550\n00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.660\nLet's just go ahead and\nimplement a local solution at this point,\n\n551\n00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.600\nuntil we find the solution\nthat's ready for us.\n\n552\n00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.810\nBut the pilot is the time identify that.\n\n553\n00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:21.590\n&gt;&gt; I would think so.\n\n554\n00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.138\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n555\n00:28:22.138 --> 00:28:26.670\nit's not the time to do it when everything\nin production is ready to go, okay?\n\n556\n00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.910\nSo just kinda realize that.\n\n557\n00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.160\nAlso, you have to consider some\nother things that might require\n\n558\n00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.650\na hybrid solution as well.\n\n559\n00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.790\nThe region and the location.\n\n560\n00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.020\nThere may be legal requirements\ndepending on the type of information.\n\n561\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:44.655\nIf there's personally identifiable\ninformation like medical information.\n\n562\n00:28:44.655 --> 00:28:47.040\nAgain, legal requirements that are there.\n\n563\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.680\nPrivacy information.\n\n564\n00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:53.230\nYou may find that out that the location\ndoesn't allow you to store all\n\n565\n00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.070\nthe data someplace else on this planet,\nrather than where you are locally.\n\n566\n00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.580\nAnd then the type of data as well.\n\n567\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.370\nAll that has to be considered and\n\n568\n00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.800\nyou might find yourself where a local\nsolution is the way to go instead, okay?\n\n569\n00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.240\nSo when we start to take a look,\n\n570\n00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.280\nthat pretty much is a big part of\nwhat we have to actually think about\n\n571\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:18.380\nwhen we start dealing with this idea right\nhere of trying to get a workloads or\n\n572\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.710\nunderstanding what doesn't need to be\nmigrated, as well as the pilot solution.\n\n573\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:27.630\nNow I've got a few minutes left,\nZach, so there's also one other very\n\n574\n00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.460\nsmall element that we also want to tackle\nright here at the end of our show.\n\n575\n00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.290\nWhich is that we've got all this\nkind of figured out at this point,\n\n576\n00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.630\nhow do I get started?\n\n577\n00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:38.591\nWhat do I really need to do-\n&gt;&gt; I was just\n\n578\n00:29:38.591 --> 00:29:40.494\ngonna ask how do you get\nstarted with all of this.\n\n579\n00:29:40.494 --> 00:29:42.380\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what we have to do.\n\n580\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.130\nWe have to actually kind\nof figure this out.\n\n581\n00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.540\nWell, just because I've set it up,\n\n582\n00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.770\nit doesn't mean that everything\nis ready to go for users, okay?\n\n583\n00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:56.040\nSo what I need to do is actually verify\nmy configuration is ready to go, okay?\n\n584\n00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.490\nAnd there's actually a tool\nout there that we can use.\n\n585\n00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.780\nLet me see if I can actually log in here.\n\n586\n00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.600\nAnd this tool only runs inside\nof a windows environment.\n\n587\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.650\nI've been using a Mac environment\nall the way up in this point here.\n\n588\n00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.910\nBut this actually involves\na Windows environment instead.\n\n589\n00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:19.881\nAnd if I bring up this webpage, and then\nI go to a particular webpage right here.\n\n590\n00:30:19.881 --> 00:30:22.666\nAnd I'll zoom in so that we can see.\n\n591\n00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:25.650\nThat's not,\nI'll zoom back in here in a moment.\n\n592\n00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.951\nLet me log in for Cherokee here.\n\n593\n00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:29.520\nLet me make sure I can get her password.\n\n594\n00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.176\nI had to write it out.\n\n595\n00:30:31.176 --> 00:30:34.160\nIt was a little bit long here.\n\n596\n00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.520\n&gt;&gt; Those passwords.\n\n597\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.260\n&gt;&gt; It is a little bit here.\n\n598\n00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.020\nSo, let me get this typed out.\n\n599\n00:30:48.142 --> 00:30:49.740\nSo more than likely, yeah.\n\n600\n00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.370\nSo I knew I was like, I know that\nthis is not gonna be right here.\n\n601\n00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.850\nThere we go.\n\n602\n00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.764\nSo there it is.\n\n603\n00:30:55.764 --> 00:30:58.940\nI told you my typing is\nnot exactly the best here.\n\n604\n00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.512\nThe link that you want to go to or\nthe webs URL that you wanna\n\n605\n00:31:05.512 --> 00:31:10.425\ngo to is right here,\nportal.office.com/tools.\n\n606\n00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:12.460\nNow, remember,\nyou have to run a Windows machine.\n\n607\n00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:17.410\nThere has to be that .net 4.5 or\n4.0, whatever it might have to be.\n\n608\n00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.790\nThose are pretty much the requirements.\n\n609\n00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.980\nWindows machine and\n\n610\n00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.280\nthat framework that you have to have\nrunning on that machine to do so.\n\n611\n00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.130\nWell, there's different checks\nthat we can have to make sure\n\n612\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.750\nthat we've got everything\nrunning the way they want to.\n\n613\n00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.054\nWell, at this point I haven't really\nconfigured anything except for\n\n614\n00:31:32.054 --> 00:31:34.303\nthe Office 365 environment itself, okay?\n\n615\n00:31:34.303 --> 00:31:38.544\nSo here, check your office 365\nconfiguration with the Office\n\n616\n00:31:38.544 --> 00:31:42.500\n365 health readiness and\nconnectivity check.\n\n617\n00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:48.130\nWhen I click there, it's going to bring\nme to, well, another site here, okay?\n\n618\n00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.978\nNow when I do this, it is actually\nasking which of these two checks that\n\n619\n00:31:51.978 --> 00:31:53.686\nI want to be able to run, okay?\n\n620\n00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:58.727\nSo it is saying, hey, let's make sure that\nyou're ready to get this all set up for\n\n621\n00:31:58.727 --> 00:32:00.189\nusers to get added in and\n\n622\n00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:05.325\neverything's going along I'm going to just\nselect the quick check at this point.\n\n623\n00:32:05.325 --> 00:32:07.600\nNotice the advanced one\ncan take up to an hour.\n\n624\n00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.450\nFor the sake of this show,\n\n625\n00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.285\nsince I only had like two minutes\nleft here, we're gonna do the quick.\n\n626\n00:32:11.285 --> 00:32:12.060\n[LAUGH] Yes.\n\n627\n00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.800\n&gt;&gt;

so we'll just give it a moment or\ntwo here, just see what we can do.\n\n646\n00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.160\nAll right, so\n\n647\n00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.480\nwe had to wait just a few minutes before\neverything actually did get started here.\n\n648\n00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.410\nLet's take a look at my screen as\nwe're finally at the next step here.\n\n649\n00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:19.910\nOkay??\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n650\n00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.730\n&gt;&gt; So it did end up\n\n651\n00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.030\nlaunching the application,\nnow it's asking me to run.\n\n652\n00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.870\nNow if this doesn't work, close out of it.\n\n653\n00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.110\nClear out the cache in your browser.\n\n654\n00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:30.940\nThat's probably what will also help.\n\n655\n00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.910\nAnd click run at that point,\nand then we'll see.\n\n656\n00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.955\nSo, once everything is done there,\nwe are now I'll actually still, well,\n\n657\n00:33:37.955 --> 00:33:41.845\nI hope I clicked run and not cancel.\n\n658\n00:33:41.845 --> 00:33:42.642\nThere it goes.\n\n659\n00:33:42.642 --> 00:33:45.542\nSo now, there it is,\nit's starting to run the check, okay?\n\n660\n00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:46.220\n&gt;&gt; Green bars are nice.\n\n661\n00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.772\n&gt;&gt; So it is actually taking that and\n\n662\n00:33:47.772 --> 00:33:50.565\nit's looking at how\nthe organization would set up.\n\n663\n00:33:50.565 --> 00:33:54.355\nAnd it's all based on, of course,\nthe use of that one account,\n\n664\n00:33:54.355 --> 00:33:57.655\nwhich is Cherokee's account,\nthe Global Administrator.\n\n665\n00:33:57.655 --> 00:33:59.760\nSo now, I should run through and\ngive us to check.\n\n666\n00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.828\nSo we need to, it might just take a few\nminutes before that is actually done.\n\n667\n00:34:04.828 --> 00:34:08.240\nSo let's go ahead and do this, as well.\n\n668\n00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.840\nWe'll just kinda wait this one out and,\n\n669\n00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:13.510\nthrough the magic of TV here,\nit should be ready in just a moment.\n\n670\n00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.660\nAll right, just as soon as we took\nthat kind of TV magic time-out break,\n\n671\n00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.650\nit did end up finishing\nwhich is ironic here.\n\n672\n00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.150\nSo at the very end,\nyou actually do see where it says,\n\n673\n00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.840\ndetailed information about\nyour results listed below.\n\n674\n00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.230\nCritical issues that have to be fixed.\n\n675\n00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.170\nSix.\n\n676\n00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:31.700\nOkay?\n\n677\n00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.130\nIssues that should be investigated, one.\n\n678\n00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.520\nExpand any section to see more.\n\n679\n00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.880\nGet trouble shooting problems,\nyou name it.\n\n680\n00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.970\nSo here it shows me domain.\n\n681\n00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.790\nSo if I click on that expansion,\nyou can see where there it is.\n\n682\n00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:49.810\nThere's actually quite a few pieces\nof information that's saying hey,\n\n683\n00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:51.440\nsomething else here failed.\n\n684\n00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:56.630\nSo I need to go back and check all this\nadditional information, the warning.\n\n685\n00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.370\nSo it's saying hey,\nI can't find a particular record and\n\n686\n00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.610\nthat's because in a previous episode,\nI didn't set up all the records for\n\n687\n00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.380\nDNS to make sure that everything ran.\n\n688\n00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.890\nSo we could actually see this part here,\ntoo.\n\n689\n00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.260\nSo, it actually gives us that information.\n\n690\n00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:16.720\nAnd now, under network passed, we're good\nto go on the connect center as well.\n\n691\n00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.170\nLet me see if I can scroll down here.\n\n692\n00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.940\nHelp us out as well as to failed event.\n\n693\n00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.549\nAnd now, says we couldn't connect\nOffice365 from your on-premises using\n\n694\n00:35:26.549 --> 00:35:30.691\nPowerShell, so it says you still need\nto actually open up these ports.\n\n695\n00:35:30.691 --> 00:35:34.634\nSo the great thing is, it's showing\nme what else I might need to do.\n\n696\n00:35:34.634 --> 00:35:38.070\n&gt;&gt; Right, right, right.\n&gt;&gt; To get my pilot setup and ready to go.\n\n697\n00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.110\n&gt;&gt; It's very helpful.\n\n698\n00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.372\n&gt;&gt; So at least at that beginning, I get\nsome guidance when I'm not exactly sure,\n\n699\n00:35:43.372 --> 00:35:47.377\nso I can check on its readiness and\nat this point, I'm not really ready for\n\n700\n00:35:47.377 --> 00:35:51.640\neverything else to actually go and I knew\nthat because of the way that I had set up\n\n701\n00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.811\nthe DNS, and that's pretty much what\nthe main complaint really was for us.\n\n702\n00:35:55.811 --> 00:35:59.622\nBut there are still a few things here\nthat I can now go back and check and\n\n703\n00:35:59.622 --> 00:36:04.027\nthat's what we want because that is what\nwill make our pilot more of a success and\n\n704\n00:36:04.027 --> 00:36:07.475\nget everything lined up for\nus to actually see the residence.\n\n705\n00:36:07.475 --> 00:36:10.925\nSo there's still several steps for\nus to go in getting this pilot and\n\n706\n00:36:10.925 --> 00:36:13.051\nplanning at all and making sure it works.\n\n707\n00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:16.813\nBut up in this point here, we're at least\nseeing the tools that are available, and\n\n708\n00:36:16.813 --> 00:36:20.555\nunderstand some of the foundational\nconcepts in getting this pilot set up.\n\n709\n00:36:20.555 --> 00:36:22.035\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, once again, thanks very much.\n\n710\n00:36:22.035 --> 00:36:22.775\nWonderful job.\n\n711\n00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:24.478\nPilot users and workloads.\n\n712\n00:36:24.478 --> 00:36:25.548\nGreat episode.\n\n713\n00:36:25.548 --> 00:36:28.737\nMake sure you watch everything\non the Office 365 series and\n\n714\n00:36:28.737 --> 00:36:30.096\ngo to our course library.\n\n715\n00:36:30.096 --> 00:36:32.276\nThere's hundreds of videos there, and\n\n716\n00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:34.783\nthey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n717\n00:36:34.783 --> 00:36:36.963\nAnd tell somebody you know about ITProTV.\n\n718\n00:36:36.963 --> 00:36:38.177\nTell everybody you know.\n\n719\n00:36:38.177 --> 00:36:39.203\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n720\n00:36:39.203 --> 00:36:40.183\nI'm Zack Memos.\n\n721\n00:36:40.183 --> 00:36:40.994\n&gt;&gt;

ITPROTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.594\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:19.514\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nthis is Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.514 --> 00:00:23.990\nAnd we're gonna run IdFix with our\nOffice 365 expert Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.560\nRonnie, thanks for being here.\n\n10\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.838\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me on\nthis show, Zach, as we continue journey\n\n11\n00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:33.991\nthrough, of course, the idea here\nof getting set up in Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:38.810\nAnd we're kind of a little stage\ndevelopment where we've been talking about\n\n13\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.971\nplanning out of course a pilot as\nwhat we've been taking a look at.\n\n14\n00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:48.093\nAnd so in the last episode, we together,\nyou and me, we did end up seeing where\n\n15\n00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:54.210\nwe're talking about, of course, the idea\nof picking the right type of pilot users.\n\n16\n00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.710\nAnd also running a readiness check\non the Office 365 side itself.\n\n17\n00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.264\nNow that's a configuration check\nthat allows us to verify that,\n\n18\n00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:07.270\nup until this point as we're getting\nready for everything else, right,\n\n19\n00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.902\nwe've set up Office 365.\n\n20\n00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:13.228\nWe really haven't actually started\nonboarding anybody into our pilot,\n\n21\n00:01:13.228 --> 00:01:13.793\nas well.\n\n22\n00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:16.360\nWe now need, of course, pick those users.\n\n23\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.700\nBut we're also seeing,\n\n24\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.130\nwhere are some configuration\nissues that we have to deal with?\n\n25\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.700\nAnd then the end result, what we saw from\nthat, of course, is a lot of DNS issues.\n\n26\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.544\nAnd we also picked that up from an earlier\nepisode that we did before that, too.\n\n27\n00:01:30.544 --> 00:01:33.998\nBecause I said, even though\nwe've got it set up where we can\n\n28\n00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:37.604\nnow start using the domain name,\nI left it undone on purpose.\n\n29\n00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:42.154\nCuz we wanna actually add some of those\ndifferent records in during the show so\n\n30\n00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:45.024\nthat you can see how to do\nthat on your own as well,\n\n31\n00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:49.390\ndepending on the registrar that\nyou're also doing as well, okay?\n\n32\n00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.523\nNow, here it is, Zach's actually\nmentioned the idea of using a tool,\n\n33\n00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:56.300\nokay, that we call IdFix.\n\n34\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.950\nAnd so we actually do need to kind\nof think about using that as well.\n\n35\n00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.830\nSo when we start to\nactually think about that,\n\n36\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.630\nwe do have to actually think\nabout a question here.\n\n37\n00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.980\nSo Zach, I think you do have this for\nus too, right?\n\n38\n00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.800\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do have a question.\n\n39\n00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.270\nSo if we have to run an Office\n365 configuration check,\n\n40\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.172\ndo we need to check the on-premise Active\nDirectory, is that where we would check?\n\n41\n00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:27.322\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's a question in\nwhich we have to think about, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.238\nI've ran an ID check now, right?\n\n43\n00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:33.012\nI'm ready to run through the tool\nthat was available to me,\n\n44\n00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:36.116\nto check the Office 365\nconfiguration side.\n\n45\n00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:38.409\nAnd hopefully up in that point, right,\n\n46\n00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.420\nthat I fixed all those things that\nthat check has told me, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.300\nThat everything is actually okay,\nand that site is ready for us is\n\n48\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.070\nready to do what we want to do in terms of\nthe pilot that we want to be able to do.\n\n49\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.100\nBut what if I am now moving on in this\nidea of the pilot and now we are also\n\n50\n00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.270\nready that we have our group of users\nthat's going to be our test group, right?\n\n51\n00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.630\nThe pilot users group here that\nwe're actually gonna add in.\n\n52\n00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.730\nNow we need to actually figure\nout the other side of it as well.\n\n53\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.230\nIf I'm gonna be adding in some different\nthings from my network that's on-premises,\n\n54\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.180\nwell, what are some of the things\nI have to consider and\n\n55\n00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.180\nhave to get ready for Office 365?\n\n56\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.460\nSo, is there a check for this side of the\nsolution, the local side of the solution?\n\n57\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.350\nAnd that's what we're talking about here,\n\n58\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.550\nis that IdFix is really what we would\nrun on our side at the beginning.\n\n59\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.290\nWhen we're running this pilot, especially\nnow that we've identified our pilot users.\n\n60\n00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.047\n&gt;&gt; Right, so this is taking a look\nat the local enterprise environment\n\n61\n00:03:44.047 --> 00:03:47.142\nright here at our enterprise, our office.\n\n62\n00:03:47.142 --> 00:03:51.651\n&gt;&gt; Right, because most of us, if we've\nactually have to set up as a system\n\n63\n00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:55.486\nadministrator or\nthe company that we're setting this up for\n\n64\n00:03:55.486 --> 00:04:00.446\nhere is actually got this set up, it may\nbe that it was actually developed a long\n\n65\n00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:05.140\ntime ago before even the thought of\nOffice 365 was even a possibility.\n\n66\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.373\nAnd so now that we are talking about maybe\nbeing able to run a hybrid solution,\n\n67\n00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:15.868\nright, where we have users that are ready\nin my Active directory on-premises.\n\n68\n00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:20.380\nAnd now I have a place for\nusers inside of Office 365,\n\n69\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.340\nI need for them to really\nwork together at some point.\n\n70\n00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.638\nBut is my side locally ready as\nmuch as that side is ready for\n\n71\n00:04:29.638 --> 00:04:34.219\nme to start accepting users and\neverything else that goes on?\n\n72\n00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:35.239\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And if it's not,\n\n73\n00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:37.360\nwe're gonna actually run into some issues.\n\n74\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.700\nSo the great thing is Office 365 has\nhelped us by developing a few tools\n\n75\n00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.210\nout there, just like we saw with the idea\nof the Office 365 tools that we can see.\n\n76\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.160\nBut now we're actually gonna\ntake a look from the user side,\n\n77\n00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.260\nright, the on-premises side and use a tool\nthat we call IdFix to help us out, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.110\nSo inside of our screen here, okay,\nthe first thing that I'm gonna do,\n\n79\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.710\nnow that you know about the tool IdFix,\nis that I need to be able to run this.\n\n80\n00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.660\nNow, before I do that, okay, I want to\nbring up a diagram that I've created, and\n\n81\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.360\nI wanna talk about some of the\nrequirements here as we move through this.\n\n82\n00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.890\nSo let's first focus in on this idea of\n\n83\n00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.720\nthe actual hardware requirements itself so\nthat we could take look.\n\n84\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.120\nSo I'll kinda change that and let us\nfocus in on it a little bit here, okay?\n\n85\n00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.650\nSo IdFix Hardware requirements,\nthe key here that I also didn't add in but\n\n86\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.090\nI'll add it in now, okay, is that we\nhave to actually do one more thing here.\n\n87\n00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.530\nSo let me add this one in and\nwe'll talk about it first, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.620\nIt's not gonna really be run\nfrom a Mac computer, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.560\nSo it probably requires Windows,\nis what it's gonna require.\n\n90\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.336\nSo normally today, of course,\nprobably at least Windows 7 and above.\n\n91\n00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:56.754\nAnd if it asks you to run\nit on something later,\n\n92\n00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:59.049\nagain run to your latest operating system.\n\n93\n00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:03.308\nFor me, it'd be Windows 10 or Server 2016\nis probably what I would run it from.\n\n94\n00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:04.840\nSo it's gonna be Windows-based.\n\n95\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.000\nYou're probably not gonna be able to\nrun this from a Mac computer, okay?\n\n96\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.740\nSecondly, that computer has to have\na minimum of four gigs of RAM.\n\n97\n00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.620\nNow that's pretty hefty for\n\n98\n00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.490\na utility that's gonna be run,\nbut it is that requirement.\n\n99\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.240\nNow it used to be where it was only\ntwo gigs of RAM at some point.\n\n100\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.895\nBut somewhere along the line, whenever\nthey actually decided to add this in here,\n\n101\n00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:31.901\nit requires four gigs of RAM to run.\n\n102\n00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:35.445\nAnd that's because they've gotta search\nthrough everything in Active Directory,\n\n103\n00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:37.475\nmight as well spread it\nout over four gigs of RAM.\n\n104\n00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:38.707\n&gt;&gt; So that's four dedicated gigs?\n\n105\n00:06:38.707 --> 00:06:43.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need to at least have four\ngigs of RAM on that machine to run it.\n\n106\n00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.660\nSo, it might be that but\nthat's what it requires.\n\n107\n00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.470\nThe other one, though,\nis a minimum of ten gigs of free space\n\n108\n00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.310\nthat you have to also\nhave available to you.\n\n109\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.492\nNow this actually may be the one,\nwe talked about two gigs earlier, and\n\n110\n00:06:56.492 --> 00:06:58.480\nI think it always required four gigs.\n\n111\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.012\nBut it used to be a minimum of two gigs of\nfree space, but today it says ten gigs,\n\n112\n00:07:03.012 --> 00:07:04.260\nis kinda the change.\n\n113\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.930\nSo a few changes have happened over the\nperiod of time that we've actually seen.\n\n114\n00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.795\nAnd of course .NET Framework 4.0.\n\n115\n00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:16.769\nAnd the strange thing is it's really not a\nlot different than what we saw when we ran\n\n116\n00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.500\nthat configuration check,\n\n117\n00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.845\nagainst our Office 365 configuration\nfrom our own local computer.\n\n118\n00:07:22.845 --> 00:07:25.879\nThat still required at least a .NET 4.0.\n\n119\n00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.707\nRequired you to have that RAM\nis more normally on the server,\n\n120\n00:07:31.707 --> 00:07:36.070\nyou'll probably have that much anyways.\n\n121\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.270\nAnd running a Windows environment, that's\nnot gonna be on a Mac computer as well.\n\n122\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.260\n&gt;&gt; And so, Ronnie, this information\ncould possibly end up on the exam?\n\n123\n00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.422\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, that's kinda the key here.\n\n124\n00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.743\nIf you can't get the system run,\ncheck your minimum requirements and\n\n125\n00:07:47.743 --> 00:07:51.232\nfigure out whether or not you have all\nthese requirements to run if you're\n\n126\n00:07:51.232 --> 00:07:53.275\nactually running into that issue, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:58.234\nNow the other requirement that we\nalso can take a look at Is that there\n\n128\n00:07:58.234 --> 00:08:01.111\nare permission requirements as well.\n\n129\n00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:05.530\nNow for us specifically is actually\none particular permission requirement.\n\n130\n00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.996\nWhich is the ID fix permission\nrequirement, right here.\n\n131\n00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:14.090\nWhat ever account that you sign into on\nthat computer, needs to have read and\n\n132\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.030\nwrite access to the Active Directory.\n\n133\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.340\nWell, normally that's the only type of\naccess you generally have to, of course,\n\n134\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.000\nActive Directory unless you\nthink that you can try and\n\n135\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.555\ndo this on a read-only domain controller,\nwhich you cannot do, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:34.000\nCuz that only gives you read-only\naccess into the Active Directory.\n\n137\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.480\nSo it doesn't matter if you have read and\nwrite access in your log to a read only\n\n138\n00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.300\ndomain controller,\nit's not gonna allow you to do so.\n\n139\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.440\nSo make sure that you do have an account\nif you're running this as read and\n\n140\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.710\nwrite access to Active Directory.\n\n141\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.140\nMost of the time there's very few\npeople that really do get access in\n\n142\n00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.920\nActive Directory, but you just wanna make\nsure that they do have that read, write.\n\n143\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.173\nNow this one, this last one here is\na little bit more strange and I have\n\n144\n00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:06.353\nseen this kind of over time end up being\nsomething that is sometimes not this way.\n\n145\n00:09:06.353 --> 00:09:10.953\nWhen you download ID Fix wherever you\nactually download it from over a period of\n\n146\n00:09:10.953 --> 00:09:13.950\ntime it has changed\na couple of times here.\n\n147\n00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.880\nUsed to just be an executable, but\n\n148\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.780\nwhat you're also likely to see today\nis that it downloads as a zip, okay?\n\n149\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:26.480\nAnd then when you extract it you might\nfind out something there is not a .exe\n\n150\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.840\nfile for an executable, it just kinda\ngives you whatever it wants to give you.\n\n151\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.450\nSo it could be an MSI,\nit could be something else.\n\n152\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.390\nBut the recommended practice,\nthat if you do this,\n\n153\n00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.170\nyou may actually need to instead of,\nit doesn't give you an executable,\n\n154\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:47.170\nrename that extension on that\nexecutable file to a .exe.\n\n155\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.390\nMaybe that's been all fixed now and\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n156\n00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.030\nBut it is possible that you\nwill have to do that too.\n\n157\n00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.210\nNow that's probably not\ngonna end up on the exam so\n\n158\n00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.810\nmuch, that's just something personal\nthat I've ran into over time.\n\n159\n00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.120\nBut, so, that's why I call it\nweirdness possibility here.\n\n160\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.360\nSo, I don't think you'll normally\nhave a lot of issues with it, but\n\n161\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.690\nif you do see that, and\n\n162\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.395\ngo, I don't know why they gave me this\nzip file that has no executable in it.\n\n163\n00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:16.920\nWell take a look and see if the,\nif Explorer shows it as an application,\n\n164\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.810\nrename that one to a .exe and\nthen try and run that as well.\n\n165\n00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.570\n&gt;&gt; In fact, aren't we gonna be running\nan episode soon about Ronnie Wong's\n\n166\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.910\nweirdest possibilities?\n\n167\n00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.236\n&gt;&gt; It's very possible.\n\n168\n00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:27.332\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS]\n&gt;&gt; And if that happens,\n\n169\n00:10:27.332 --> 00:10:29.590\nit's probably not one\nthat you wanna watch.\n\n170\n00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.710\nSo just kinda be aware of that.\n\n171\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.420\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\n\n172\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:38.000\n&gt;&gt; So those are just kind of the basics\nbefore we get started here, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.569\nOnce we understand those requirements\nessentially that we have to have,\n\n174\n00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:45.230\nwe need to go ahead and\ndownload the ID Fix.\n\n175\n00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:50.044\nSo let me scroll back over here to\nmy domain controller that I'm on and\n\n176\n00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:53.696\nI'm simply gonna have the browser up and\nrunning and\n\n177\n00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:58.180\nI'm going to type in download,\nif I can spell download.\n\n178\n00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.620\nDownload ID fix right in\nthe address bar there.\n\n179\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.930\nAnd the very first one you see I've\nactually gone here a couple of\n\n180\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.320\ntimes to verify.\n\n181\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.417\nDownload IdFix DirSync Error\nRemediation Tool, okay?\n\n182\n00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:15.214\nSo if I select that link, I'm trying to.\n\n183\n00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:16.860\nThere we go, okay.\n\n184\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.980\nThis is the page that you'll normally\nend up seeing, right here and\n\n185\n00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.840\nit will give you this.\n\n186\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.530\nIt used to perform discovery and\nremediation of identity objects and\n\n187\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:34.700\ntheir attributes in an on-premises.\n\n188\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.495\nI'm not gonna read that.\n\n189\n00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:37.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Active Directory environment,\n\n190\n00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:40.673\nokay, in preparation for\nmigration to Office 365.\n\n191\n00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:41.327\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n192\n00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:47.206\n&gt;&gt; So ID Fix, this particular tool itself,\nthat is what it's designed to do.\n\n193\n00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:51.140\nNow if you're going, well, how do I\nknow whether I need to run this or not?\n\n194\n00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.930\nWell, think about this\nway of doing things and\n\n195\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.390\nwe'll talk about it when we get into our\ntest case scenario a little bit more.\n\n196\n00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.540\nBut if you know that there are a lot\nof Active Directory users that you have\n\n197\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.280\nright now, well think about there's\n\n198\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.550\nreally a couple of ways that you're\ngonna have to deal with this, right?\n\n199\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:14.000\nOne, is that I can just do\nthis go Zach all 5,000 users,\n\n200\n00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.510\nI need you to go into Office 365 and\nadd those users in there one at a time.\n\n201\n00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.530\nSo now I've assigned that responsibility\nto Zach and it doesn't hurt me at all,\n\n202\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.540\nbut Zach has the work to do, okay?\n\n203\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.130\nSo, that's gonna take him awhile, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.960\nSo it is possible,\nwe could do something like that.\n\n205\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.722\nBut the other one though, is to have\na sync up the actual directory on-premises\n\n206\n00:12:35.722 --> 00:12:40.629\nwith an Azure Active Directory\nthat then plugs in to Office 365.\n\n207\n00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:43.930\nNow that should sounds more doable-\n&gt;&gt; And seemless.\n\n208\n00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.571\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little bit of almost\nseemless, let's put it that way, right?\n\n209\n00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:51.071\nThere are still a few-\n&gt;&gt; Better than me bringing more than\n\n210\n00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.740\na dime\n&gt;&gt; There's gonna be a few scenes that\n\n211\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.130\nwill pop up here and\nthere, I guarantee you.\n\n212\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.420\nBut overall though,\nit really is gonna be more helpful.\n\n213\n00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.640\nWell, this is just trying to get ready,\nget everything happening.\n\n214\n00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.338\nSo notice how it actually\nsays it discovers them and\n\n215\n00:13:06.338 --> 00:13:10.474\nthen performs remediation\nof identity objects, okay?\n\n216\n00:13:10.474 --> 00:13:12.560\nSo those are things that are inside\nof your Active Directory.\n\n217\n00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.400\nThat's what an identity object is.\n\n218\n00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.300\nAnd with the way that they're\ndescribed in Active Directory,\n\n219\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.320\nthese are what we call the attributes.\n\n220\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.210\nSo all the little descriptions\nattached to that object\n\n221\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.190\nis exactly the idea of an attribute here.\n\n222\n00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.720\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n223\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.130\n&gt;&gt; And it's all designed for us to be\nable to migrate over to Office 365, okay?\n\n224\n00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.850\nSo verify and also notice the intent\nof what this tool is for as well, okay?\n\n225\n00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:43.300\nID fix is intended for Active Directory\nadministrators responsible for\n\n226\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.541\nDirSync with Office 365.\n\n227\n00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:48.700\nNow, this DirSync over here, right?\n\n228\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.510\nThat's an older utility that\nwas out there for a long time,\n\n229\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.160\nokay, that allowed for\nActive Directory synchronization.\n\n230\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.410\nThis has changed over time.\n\n231\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.900\nSo, don't think it's,\nit is kind of gone today.\n\n232\n00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.760\nBut in the background, that's\nthe way that they still refer to it,\n\n233\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.565\nas directory sync, is what you're seeing.\n\n234\n00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:13.425\nSo you simply download this, and then\nyou have some install instructions here.\n\n235\n00:14:13.425 --> 00:14:18.437\nSo, let's see if I can expand out those\ninstall instructions to see here and\n\n236\n00:14:18.437 --> 00:14:19.390\nthere you go.\n\n237\n00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.840\nSo notice it says,\nonce you extract the zip,\n\n238\n00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.010\ncopy all of them into a folder\non the local hard drive.\n\n239\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.490\nRename the executable file in\nthe end to an exe extension.\n\n240\n00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.500\nSo they've added, included that in.\n\n241\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.190\nSo earlier, like the DirSync you didn't\nhave to worry about it too much.\n\n242\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.770\nBut now they've actually changed it and\n\n243\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.100\nthey're saying you have\nto be able to do this.\n\n244\n00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.780\nSo pay attention just like I said\nsome weirdness that ends up happening\n\n245\n00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.230\nwhere you get a little bit confusion.\n\n246\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.341\nI know what a zip file is.\n\n247\n00:14:49.341 --> 00:14:50.531\nI don't have to worry about.\n\n248\n00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:53.590\nYou're downloaded it,\nthere's not an executable file in there.\n\n249\n00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.116\nSo just kinda realize that you\nmight see that, too, okay?\n\n250\n00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:59.858\nValidate the workstation\nis running .Net 4 or later.\n\n251\n00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.570\nDouble click .exe after you named it and\n\n252\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.380\nthere you go,\nyou are ready to go at that point.\n\n253\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.790\nThe great thing is,\nI already previously downloaded this.\n\n254\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.700\nSo I'm going to minimize my browser,\nopen up, of course,\n\n255\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:19.470\nthe file explorer here,\nand go to downloads.\n\n256\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.552\nAnd inside of downloads,\n\n257\n00:15:22.552 --> 00:15:28.290\nhere is that extracted\nID Fix zipped folder.\n\n258\n00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.580\nSo if I right click and I Extract All.\n\n259\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.780\nI'm going to go ahead and tell it to\ndownload it into the ID Fix folder itself,\n\n260\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.010\nwhich is fine.\n\n261\n00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.104\nAnd show the extracted\nfiles when complete.\n\n262\n00:15:42.104 --> 00:15:43.173\nClick Extract.\n\n263\n00:15:45.623 --> 00:15:52.590\nAnd now, I'm gonna open up that\nfolder again and there it is.\n\n264\n00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.746\nIt's an application.\n\n265\n00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:58.150\nIf I right click and\ngo to Properties, let's see here.\n\n266\n00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.977\nAnd it does tell me it is\nan application type file.\n\n267\n00:16:01.977 --> 00:16:08.940\nNow, let me see if I can take\na look at the attributes here.\n\n268\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.690\nJust a moment,\nlet's see if I can find a view.\n\n269\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.080\nI was gonna say, I know where this is.\n\n270\n00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.870\nChange and search folder options view.\n\n271\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.089\nLet's show the hidden ones and\nthe extensions here.\n\n272\n00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:31.920\nOkay, now notice this one\nactually says idfix.exe ready.\n\n273\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.450\nSo, it looks like it even fix it even\nthough the instructions say to do that.\n\n274\n00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.670\nNow the only difference though\nthat I have between mine, and\n\n275\n00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.580\nthe instructions, is that it says\nI should name it to a capital.exe.\n\n276\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.320\nThat's the only thing that it says,\nbut this one'll probably run fine.\n\n277\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.490\nBut just in case,\nlet's go ahead and do this.\n\n278\n00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.960\nAnd just in case, for one reason or\nanother, it makes a difference.\n\n279\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.440\nI don't know if it really does, or not.\n\n280\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.100\nI don't think it does, but let's just do\nit exactly the way that instructions say.\n\n281\n00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.130\n&gt;&gt; They instructed you to do that.\n\n282\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:00.810\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n283\n00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:05.460\n&gt;&gt; So once we have that, am I logged\nin with an account that has read and\n\n284\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.400\nwrite access into my active directory,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.399\nNow currently,\nthis is just to show you that I am on\n\n286\n00:17:12.399 --> 00:17:16.790\nthat domain controller here,\nso that we can run this.\n\n287\n00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:24.887\nNot domains and trusts, that would work,\nbut I want active directory users and\n\n288\n00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:26.080\ncomputers just now.\n\n289\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.012\nI selected the wrong one again,\nmy eyes keep saying Ronnie,\n\n290\n00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:31.870\nselect that one right away.\n\n291\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.970\nI'm wanting users and computers here.\n\n292\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.270\nSo in a moment, there we go, okay, now,\n\n293\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:45.870\nI've already populated some different OUs,\nso, that way we can see it, right?\n\n294\n00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.110\nSo this is where it changes\nfrom the default, right?\n\n295\n00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.120\nEverything is pretty much at\nthe beginning, here, users and\n\n296\n00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.910\nthen you have domain controllers up there,\nmanaged service accounts.\n\n297\n00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.740\nBut all these other ones here,\ndevelopment, marketing, member services,\n\n298\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:06.160\noperations, production, you name it, those\nare actually users accounting here and\n\n299\n00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.240\nI've given everybody essentially the same\nlast name as what the OU is, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.690\nSo that's pretty much everybody that\nworks here, is what we have, right?\n\n301\n00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.470\nSo we do have an active directory\nset up and ready to go, okay?\n\n302\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.720\nSo now it has something to examine and\nto see and\n\n303\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.280\nto be able to test and see what else\nactually needs to be done at this point.\n\n304\n00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.610\nSo once I have that,\nI can now go ahead and right-click and\n\n305\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.920\nI'm gonna run as an administrator.\n\n306\n00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.755\nNow when I do that it says,\nprivacy statement applies only for this.\n\n307\n00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:40.720\nIt's perfectly fine.\n\n308\n00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.280\nClick okay.\n\n309\n00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.530\nAnd here it is ready to run, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.373\nSo at this point if I go ahead and query.\n\n311\n00:18:52.649 --> 00:18:58.794\nWhat we're hoping to not see and actually\nthis is good news as far as I know Mike,\n\n312\n00:18:58.794 --> 00:19:03.687\nis that at the bottom,\nit did query 79 an error count of zero.\n\n313\n00:19:03.687 --> 00:19:05.170\nSo that's actually really good.\n\n314\n00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.190\nIt's not showing me anything that it\nactually found as a particular error.\n\n315\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.829\n&gt;&gt; That's good\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n316\n00:19:11.829 --> 00:19:13.900\nare you sure you wish to\naccept all suggestions?\n\n317\n00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.020\nWell I don't not have\nany suggestion there.\n\n318\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.470\nSo once you actually run the query, right?\n\n319\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.290\nYou're telling it to go against that.\n\n320\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.460\nExcept whatever that she shows you\nis being issues that you might have.\n\n321\n00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.240\nThen you of course can apply\nif it actually can fix it.\n\n322\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.560\nIt will try and fix it for\n\n323\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.610\nyou essentially what they call remediate\nthe object is what it will do.\n\n324\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Then of course you can export this to\n\n325\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.400\na CSV and even Office 365 you can\nactually use that now to upload in there.\n\n326\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.321\nBut we'll get to that a little bit later,\nI'm jumping ahead of the game here.\n\n327\n00:19:44.321 --> 00:19:48.900\nImport in more, undo if we need to, but\nnotice that there is a settings here.\n\n328\n00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.140\nLet's select this idea of settings for\na moment and\n\n329\n00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.260\nsee a couple of other things too.\n\n330\n00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.530\nSo inside of the,\nlet me make sure I can click on this.\n\n331\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.060\nNotice they have rules for\na multi tenant and dedicated as well.\n\n332\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.090\nNow the idea of multitenancy to\nsomeone that's setting this up for\n\n333\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.470\nmultiple different\ncompanies it makes sense.\n\n334\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.790\nBut for most of us that are setting\nthis up for our own company\n\n335\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:17.180\nwill probably end up using rules for\ndedicated more than anything else, okay?\n\n336\n00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.730\nBut multitenancy is if you\nare actually doing this for\n\n337\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.640\nmultiple different\ncompanies at the same time.\n\n338\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.190\nIt can go in there and\nfind your different directories and\n\n339\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.830\nyou wanna make sure that your\ndirectory name is listed here too.\n\n340\n00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.640\nAnd then if you have to actually have\nother credentials before you can run this,\n\n341\n00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.550\nyou'll also add those in as well.\n\n342\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.090\nSo you may find out that you're\nonly given a limited user account.\n\n343\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.910\nLet's say that you're setting this up.\n\n344\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.390\nFor a company and they say, all right,\n\n345\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.550\nwe'll set you up with this particular\ntype of account, you need to run this but\n\n346\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:56.468\nnow you come to this point and maybe where\nsomebody else comes along and they add in\n\n347\n00:20:56.468 --> 00:21:00.938\ntheir username and credentials to allow\nyou to run this tool as well, okay?\n\n348\n00:21:00.938 --> 00:21:05.060\nSo let's see if this changes anything\nwhen I changes over to dedicated and\n\n349\n00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.790\nI click okay and\nlet's run the query again and\n\n350\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.270\nlet's see, we didn't like that for\nthe single-tenancy there, okay?\n\n351\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.650\nSo multi tenant it is,\nand there we go, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.510\nSo ran through all of my objects, it\ndidn't find anything in terms of an error.\n\n353\n00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.340\nBut you can see that if it did, it would\nactually show up right here in this column\n\n354\n00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.630\nand gives us a list and then we could try\nand remediate it from that point, okay?\n\n355\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.250\nSo the great thing is, that means just\nabout everything that I have set up and\n\n356\n00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.300\nready to go.\n\n357\n00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.960\nIt should be fine, so\n\n358\n00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.645\nnow I have not only Office 365 in the\nconfiguration, I've got it in right now.\n\n359\n00:21:41.645 --> 00:21:42.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.550\n&gt;&gt; And this says\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\n\n361\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.255\nyou've got a few DNS issues that\nyou'll have to take care of.\n\n362\n00:21:46.255 --> 00:21:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:51.230\n&gt;&gt; But you know once you take care of\nthat we're probably good and fine.\n\n364\n00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:55.960\nOver on my side though as far as getting\nusers into my pilot that I wanted to\n\n365\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.070\ntry this where it we're actually pulling\npeople in from the active directory and\n\n366\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.970\ndoing that.\n\n367\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.900\nWell, it's probably saying, look\neverything looks like it lines up already.\n\n368\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.480\nSo we are good here too.\n\n369\n00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.450\nBut the ID fix is one of\nthe first tools you wanna run\n\n370\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.760\nto make sure that we have just those\nthings configured correctly to at least\n\n371\n00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.870\nget them to talk though to make sure that\nthings can really get setup at this point.\n\n372\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:24.060\nSo that ID fix is gonna be a very\ngood one for us to think about, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.056\nAll right, so\n\n374\n00:22:25.056 --> 00:22:29.962\nthat's actually a pretty good little\nrun down on how that tool works.\n\n375\n00:22:29.962 --> 00:22:34.389\nIt doesn't look impressive, but in the\nbackground it really is just making sure\n\n376\n00:22:34.389 --> 00:22:39.030\nat least according to everything that\nOffice 365 needs, that we are ready to go.\n\n377\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.872\nNow you'll also notice here\nis a verbose output here.\n\n378\n00:22:42.872 --> 00:22:48.101\nSo if I open this you can see even the log\nfile, and what ended up happening,\n\n379\n00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:53.413\nand what it actually looked at as well,\nand a couple of times I hit it on zero,\n\n380\n00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:58.490\nand then all of it, what it actually\nfiltered out here, too, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.020\n&gt;&gt; It looks verbose.\n\n382\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.920\n&gt;&gt; So yep, it actually does tell us\nessentially a log of all the activity that\n\n383\n00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.900\nit did, and so that's actually\na good thing for you to keep.\n\n384\n00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.570\nWord documentation later on, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.960\nNow we still got a few\nminutes thought Zack.\n\n386\n00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.702\nSo let's go ahead and also talk about\nanother example objective to help us out.\n\n387\n00:23:16.702 --> 00:23:20.090\nCuz we've already cover this probably\nin the previous episode a little bit.\n\n388\n00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.760\nBut it's a great place to\nkind of be reminded as well\n\n389\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.810\nat the same time about the idea now of\n\n390\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.010\ngetting everything set up like a project\na little bit more in our pilot.\n\n391\n00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.230\n&gt;&gt; All right, in our pilot.\n\n392\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.920\n&gt;&gt; And this is where we move into what\nwe call a creating a test plan, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.250\nSo, I went ahead and\ntried the focus in and\n\n394\n00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:44.760\nyou know zoom in on some of the things\nthat we need a to at least do here, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.010\nWhen we start talking about this idea\nof creating a test plan itself, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:54.070\nWell all of this is actually fairly\nimportant for us to think about and\n\n397\n00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.107\nto document along the way, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:56.107 --> 00:23:56.950\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n399\n00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.136\n&gt;&gt; The hard part about this right\nis that all of us are smart, okay,\n\n400\n00:24:00.136 --> 00:24:03.631\nif you're watching this episode\nYou're a pretty bright guy, okay?\n\n401\n00:24:03.631 --> 00:24:06.158\nIf you're teaching this episode,\nmaybe not so much.\n\n402\n00:24:06.158 --> 00:24:08.050\nBut if you're watching it,\nyou're pretty smart, okay?\n\n403\n00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.446\n&gt;&gt; You're pretty smart too, by golly.\n\n404\n00:24:09.446 --> 00:24:14.760\n&gt;&gt; So at this point what I'm trying to\nsay is, you might depend on that ability\n\n405\n00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.110\nto keep everything in your mind and most\nof you all are probably fairly good at it.\n\n406\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.950\nBut when you have so\n\n407\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.020\nmany other moving parts going on,\nyou're still doing your regular day job.\n\n408\n00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.502\nYou're now running this pilot,\n\n409\n00:24:25.502 --> 00:24:28.930\nyou're still having to\ntroubleshoot fires that go on.\n\n410\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.920\nIt can get a little bit\ncrowded inside of that,\n\n411\n00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.230\nwhat is it that they call it, the brain.\n\n412\n00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Brainstorm?\n\n413\n00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.510\n&gt;&gt; Brain map, map, mind mapping,\nI couldn't remember.\n\n414\n00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.830\nThere's that technique,\nthat study technique.\n\n415\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.680\n&gt;&gt; You have to brainstorm in mind mapping.\n\n416\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of mind mapping, right?\n\n417\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.220\nPeople have mind maps,\nhave houses and stuff.\n\n418\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.670\nIf you watch Sherlock from the BBC,\nyou have a mind palace.\n\n419\n00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.450\nYour particular memory\npalace that you have.\n\n420\n00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.200\nBut some of us though, like me,\n\n421\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.420\nyou have to kinda depend on notes\nis what you have to depend on.\n\n422\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.350\nSo when we start talking about the\nbeginnings here of creating a test plan,\n\n423\n00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.370\nwhat I really mean is documentation\nof this test plan as well.\n\n424\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.310\nAnd some of the things that we want\nto consider right from the beginning.\n\n425\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.070\nWe've already talked about that group of\nusers that we are gonna add in, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:25.340\nThere's no doubts about it, so\nalong with that, here's those users here.\n\n427\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:30.040\nWe might also want to include in some\npreliminary details about the tenancy or\n\n428\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.480\nabout your Office 365.\n\n429\n00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.320\nWhat you think it's gonna end up\nlooking like in the end, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:40.320\nSo at least for the pilot, what do you\nreally want to test out at this point?\n\n431\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.230\nIs it enough that you\njust have accounts and\n\n432\n00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:48.270\nthat your users can just get\nOffice 2016 on their computers?\n\n433\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.950\nWell, if it is,\nyou're probably ready to go and\n\n434\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.660\nnot have to worry about anything else.\n\n435\n00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.077\nYou can say,\nall my emails can be handled inside.\n\n436\n00:25:55.077 --> 00:25:57.390\nWe're not gonna kind of do\nany of that other stuff.\n\n437\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.120\nWell, then you're ready to go,\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n438\n00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.686\nBut if it includes in those services,\nthat means that you\n\n439\n00:26:03.686 --> 00:26:07.792\nalso have to think about how to\nconfigure those services to work.\n\n440\n00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:10.740\nAnd how to make sure that\neverybody is actually using them.\n\n441\n00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.605\nSo make sure that,\nin your preliminary details,\n\n442\n00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:15.658\nwhat you expect to include in that.\n\n443\n00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:19.541\nRemember the more stuff that you add in,\nthe longer it's gonna take for\n\n444\n00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:22.257\nyou to get set up and\nto get everything pushed out so\n\n445\n00:26:22.257 --> 00:26:25.890\nthat users can actually be\nable to do what they need to.\n\n446\n00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.352\nThe other one, of course, is also\nthe administrators that you may need.\n\n447\n00:26:29.352 --> 00:26:34.143\nRemember that even though there's five\nparticular default administrative roles,\n\n448\n00:26:34.143 --> 00:26:37.211\nif you start adding in\ndifferent components in there.\n\n449\n00:26:37.211 --> 00:26:42.139\nEspecially the customer relation\nmanagement software and all the business\n\n450\n00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:47.160\nintelligence products, there's a lot\nmore administrators that in there.\n\n451\n00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.211\nNow that doesn't mean that you can't\ntake someone like Zach and add five or\n\n452\n00:26:51.211 --> 00:26:54.061\nsix different administrator roles to Zach,\nokay?\n\n453\n00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:55.620\nYou can definitely do that.\n\n454\n00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.910\nBut what you need to do is\nplan that out as well and\n\n455\n00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.210\nsay, here's what I'm gonna need\nas I start adding in more.\n\n456\n00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.620\nI need to be able to assign different\nadministrative roles to other people.\n\n457\n00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.110\nIt is never good, remember what I've said\nand I've said this throughout the series,\n\n458\n00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.500\nat least at the beginning,\nin setting it up.\n\n459\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.329\nEven though I might have used a personal\naccount that really I'm not gonna do\n\n460\n00:27:16.329 --> 00:27:20.789\nanything else with it, just to set\nup Office 365 at the beginning.\n\n461\n00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:24.704\nOne of the very first things\nI did once I got access in,\n\n462\n00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:30.012\nis I created another user account and\ngave a user inside the organization\n\n463\n00:27:30.012 --> 00:27:35.159\nthat I'm setting this up for\nthe global administrative privileges.\n\n464\n00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:38.485\nAnd I'm not signing back in as\nthe original person that opened up\n\n465\n00:27:38.485 --> 00:27:39.780\nthe account.\n\n466\n00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.993\nIf I'm doing this for another company,\nI shouldn't have any other rights inside.\n\n467\n00:27:43.993 --> 00:27:48.015\nCurrently right now I have every right,\nbecause I'm a global administrator.\n\n468\n00:27:48.015 --> 00:27:51.920\nBut I really don't need to be the one\nthat's configuring everything, because if\n\n469\n00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.993\nI'm the one that's configuring everything,\nthat means that after I let go of that,\n\n470\n00:27:55.993 --> 00:27:58.160\nthey still have to depend\non my credentials.\n\n471\n00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.770\nI don't want them depending on my\ncredentials except for one thing.\n\n472\n00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.708\nIf that global administrator,\n\n473\n00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:07.520\nwho in our particular scenario\nhere is Cherokee, okay?\n\n474\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.840\nIf she ends up forgetting\nher particular credentials,\n\n475\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.360\nthen when it actually says hey,\nyou need to reset your credentials.\n\n476\n00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.510\nIt's gonna send to me an email that says,\nreset the credentials, okay?\n\n477\n00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.410\nThat's the only thing that that\naccount should be good for.\n\n478\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.200\nEverything else should be done\nunderneath that administrator.\n\n479\n00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.080\nSo make sure you include some details\nabout how that also works as well.\n\n480\n00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:33.176\nThis is what I was talking about when I\nwas using Zach as an example a little bit\n\n481\n00:28:33.176 --> 00:28:33.755\nearlier.\n\n482\n00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:35.808\nEven though we've got everything set up,\n\n483\n00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:38.097\nwe know who our pilot users are gonna be,\nokay?\n\n484\n00:28:38.097 --> 00:28:44.733\nWe wanna also talk about how the account\ncreation is going to be done.\n\n485\n00:28:44.733 --> 00:28:49.271\nAnd this is an important part right now,\nbecause I've seen this happen and\n\n486\n00:28:49.271 --> 00:28:51.949\nit's been bad when it's happened, Zach.\n\n487\n00:28:51.949 --> 00:28:54.604\n&gt;&gt; Trust me when I say it's been bad,\nokay?\n\n488\n00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:55.500\n&gt;&gt; I believe you.\n\n489\n00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.610\n&gt;&gt; So everybody has this idea that they\nknow exactly how account creation works\n\n490\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.080\nin Office 365 and it's not hard, okay?\n\n491\n00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.340\nBut I've seen this happen with\nan organization of 50 people or\n\n492\n00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:11.200\nmore, where they said,\nwe're gonna migrate over to Office 365.\n\n493\n00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.500\nAnd I had just finished doing a migration\nfor a smaller company in doing this.\n\n494\n00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.807\nAnd what one person decided to do,\nonce he actually created this tenancy,\n\n495\n00:29:20.807 --> 00:29:23.334\nis he took a whole entire evening and\n\n496\n00:29:23.334 --> 00:29:28.829\nhe started entering in every single\nuser in this company into Office 365.\n\n497\n00:29:28.829 --> 00:29:33.817\nAnd that's perfectly fine, but\nthen he wanted to actually sync up\n\n498\n00:29:33.817 --> 00:29:38.716\nhis on-premises Active Directory\nto make sure that they only had\n\n499\n00:29:38.716 --> 00:29:43.890\nto use their Active Directory\ncredentials along with that.\n\n500\n00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.010\nAnd all of a sudden he realized something\ntoo, that as he added in new users, when\n\n501\n00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.091\nhe added them into the cloud, it didn't\nwork on the on-premises side either.\n\n502\n00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:54.110\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n503\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.060\nSo that's why we have this show\nas we talk about this issue,\n\n504\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:01.190\nwe show you why it's actually important\nthat you do this in the right order.\n\n505\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.138\nIf you start manually creating everything,\n\n506\n00:30:04.138 --> 00:30:08.179\nthen expect to manually create everything,\nand I mean that.\n\n507\n00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:11.917\nYou can import them in in CSV files,\nyou can do that.\n\n508\n00:30:11.917 --> 00:30:14.010\nBut you wanna make sure\nthat you have a plan.\n\n509\n00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.480\nDon't just haphazardly guess\non what you want to do.\n\n510\n00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.260\nYou can do a mix of them,\nand that's we're gonna do.\n\n511\n00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.217\nWe're gonna do a mix of them as well,\n\n512\n00:30:21.217 --> 00:30:25.655\ncuz I've got an entire Active Directory\nthat we're also gonna be doing this with.\n\n513\n00:30:25.655 --> 00:30:29.592\nBut also I'm gonna add in a few people,\nlike Zach and myself, and\n\n514\n00:30:29.592 --> 00:30:33.350\na couple of others in there\nmanually inside of Office 365.\n\n515\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.170\nAnd then we're gonna sync things up and\n\n516\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.220\nsee how it actually populates and\ndoes all that.\n\n517\n00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.362\nBut if you don't know how it works,\nthen you're actually go,\n\n518\n00:30:41.362 --> 00:30:44.818\nwell all I have to do is add in a user\naccount up there at Office 365.\n\n519\n00:30:44.818 --> 00:30:48.520\nThat should populate down to my\nActive Directory and we should be fine.\n\n520\n00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.600\nYou might find out that that doesn't\nwork the way that you want to.\n\n521\n00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.550\nSo pay attention and\nthink about it now, okay?\n\n522\n00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.834\nAre we gonna start\nmanually entering it in?\n\n523\n00:30:57.834 --> 00:31:02.698\nOr are we gonna think about this idea\nof doing some type of Active Directory\n\n524\n00:31:02.698 --> 00:31:04.250\nsyncing, okay?\n\n525\n00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.192\nIs what we are actually going to do.\n\n526\n00:31:06.192 --> 00:31:12.090\nSo that's some of the things you want to\nconsider during this test plan, okay?\n\n527\n00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.150\nIf you know that, in the end,\nit's gonna be where you're gonna do that\n\n528\n00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.030\nActive Directory sync,\nonly do a few accounts in the manual way,\n\n529\n00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.000\nlike I did, and\nthen do the rest by Active Directory sync.\n\n530\n00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.560\nWhich means you have to kind of skip\naround a few steps to make this work, but\n\n531\n00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.740\nit will end up working for you.\n\n532\n00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.440\nThe other part, of course,\nis deploying the software, okay?\n\n533\n00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.660\nSo when we start taking look at this idea\nof deploying the Office 2016 software,\n\n534\n00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:43.370\ndo you actually have to worry\nabout both Mac and PC users?\n\n535\n00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.650\nIt does make a difference at times.\n\n536\n00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:51.852\nAnd at the same time, are you working with\nsomething like your deployment server?\n\n537\n00:31:51.852 --> 00:31:54.910\nI couldn't remember what it was\ncalled here, your WDS here.\n\n538\n00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.413\nIs that actually gonna work\nout the way that you want to?\n\n539\n00:31:57.413 --> 00:31:59.418\nThink about that particular process.\n\n540\n00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.200\nHow are users gonna be on\nboarded to this process as well?\n\n541\n00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.490\nAnother scenario here, okay?\n\n542\n00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.090\nDuring this time when I'm\ncreating the pilot users,\n\n543\n00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.270\nis it something that I want to pre-create?\n\n544\n00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.840\nIn other words, I just tell Zach,\nmake all of them, and\n\n545\n00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.540\nthen just tell the users,\nhere's how you can log in.\n\n546\n00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.170\nOr do I want them to have the experience\nfrom the very beginning, okay?\n\n547\n00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:21.000\nDo we want those pilot users, and\n\n548\n00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.500\ndo I want to essentially just send\nZach around, hey Zach, show them how\n\n549\n00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.190\nthey're just gonna be on-boarded if\nthey were just brand new to the company.\n\n550\n00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.900\nAnd he actually walks them\nthrough that particular state.\n\n551\n00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.330\nYou have to think about that,\n\n552\n00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.700\nbecause if not, users are gonna\nexpect different experiences and\n\n553\n00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.532\nthat's pretty bad, because we won't have\na consistent feedback on the experience.\n\n554\n00:32:39.532 --> 00:32:43.805\nOne, because we might have\ndone it differently for\n\n555\n00:32:43.805 --> 00:32:46.970\nthe pilot users than what we did for\neveryone else.\n\n556\n00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:53.100\nSo, in that sense all this planning goes\ninto kind of a mini project management\n\n557\n00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.890\nwhere you are planning and you're\nactually taking those considerations.\n\n558\n00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:02.530\nAnd all this may break down into different\nphases of what needs to be done, okay?\n\n559\n00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:07.040\nSo the plan itself and the pilot itself,\nit can be insanely simple, okay?\n\n560\n00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.910\nDon't get me wrong, it doesn't have\nto be all these different steps.\n\n561\n00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:11.440\nBut these are some of the considerations,\n\n562\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.980\nat least generically, that you also\nwant to make sure that we consider,\n\n563\n00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.490\nas we continue moving forward\nwith our pilot as well, okay?\n\n564\n00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.110\nSo Zach, in this episode,\nwe did end up taking a look,\n\n565\n00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.540\nof course,\nat the local side of things, right?\n\n566\n00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Running IdFix and\n\n567\n00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.735\nmaking sure that we understand what\nit can show us and what it doesn't.\n\n568\n00:33:29.735 --> 00:33:32.090\nOurs, it didn't really show\nus a lot because well,\n\n569\n00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.800\nI really just created\nthat active directory.\n\n570\n00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.300\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n571\n00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:37.010\n&gt;&gt; And added in users into\norganizational units and\n\n572\n00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.410\ndidn't have to worry about\ntoo much at that point.\n\n573\n00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:43.860\nBut it may be if your organization of\ncourse, has been around for a long time,\n\n574\n00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.850\nand it's been administrated by multiple,\ndifferent people over time,\n\n575\n00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.240\nyou might find that there are some other\nerrors that may have to be remediated.\n\n576\n00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.040\nThe great thing is that tool will help you\nand give you guidance in how to do that.\n\n577\n00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.710\nAnd also this test case\nscenario is another portion\n\n578\n00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:05.110\nof what you also have to consider as\na pilot continues to move forward.\n\n579\n00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.780\nSo you might be wondering, why didn't you\njust include all that in at one time?\n\n580\n00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.200\nWell, it's just the way that it\nlays out in the objectives, and\n\n581\n00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.860\nI tend not to take them too\ndifferently in that way.\n\n582\n00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.813\nBut overall, though, it's because it's\na great place and a great reminder for\n\n583\n00:34:18.813 --> 00:34:22.181\nus as we go throughout this plan to\nthink about more and more here, and\n\n584\n00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:24.994\nto also show you some stuff\nthat we absolutely have to do.\n\n585\n00:34:24.994 --> 00:34:28.960\nSo, Zach, that really does wrap up\nthis episode for us fairly nicely.\n\n586\n00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.450\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n&gt;&gt; And it means we are ready to move on\n\n587\n00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:31.300\nto another topic.\n\n588\n00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Ronny, we trust you implicitly,\nyou do a marvelous job.\n\n589\n00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.350\nRun IdFix, hopefully,\nthat's some information you can use,\n\n590\n00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.090\nin fact, we know it is.\n\n591\n00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:41.030\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 series,\n\n592\n00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.140\nvisit our course libraries,\nthere's hundreds of videos there and\n\n593\n00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.330\nthey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n594\n00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.460\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro.TV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n595\n00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.875\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n596\n00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:51.600\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n597\n00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.270\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:12.293\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:16.080\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for choosing ITPro.TV,\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n5\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.975\nI'm you host Zach Memos,\nthis is Office 365.\n\n6\n00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:21.751\nWe're gonna set up an email for\npilot users, and\n\n7\n00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:26.300\nour Office 365 expert Ronnie Wong is here\nto help us every step along the way.\n\n8\n00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.730\nAren't you, Ronnie?\n\n9\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.167\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I am, and thank you.\n\n10\n00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:31.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You wouldn't leave our side,\nI know.\n\n11\n00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.656\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back\non the show as we continue on.\n\n12\n00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:38.395\nAnd now we are at this point where we need\nto do a little bit of manipulation and\n\n13\n00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:41.350\nget email up and running for pilot users.\n\n14\n00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.156\nSo once we have, of course,\nour pilot users up and\n\n15\n00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:50.065\nwe're now feeling comfortable\nthat our pilot is ready to roll.\n\n16\n00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:53.319\nWe, of course, want to start setting\nup the communication process.\n\n17\n00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.668\nAnd for every organization\nthat exists out there today,\n\n18\n00:00:56.668 --> 00:00:59.330\nemail is pretty much the heart of it,\nright?\n\n19\n00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.510\nThe very fact it's the blood, it's the\nheart, it's what keeps our company going.\n\n20\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.580\nAnd I've said this just about in every\nshow that I've ever dealt with in terms of\n\n21\n00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.782\ngetting people upset\nat you as being an IT.\n\n22\n00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.190\nTwo things have to happen, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.860\nOne of two things actually have to happen.\n\n24\n00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.201\nOne is if the printer is down and\nyou can't fix it.\n\n25\n00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:19.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You might as well just give up, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.635\nThe printers are just going to kill you.\n\n27\n00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.043\nTwo, another one that will\nsend everybody screaming and\n\n28\n00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:28.381\nrunning at you like there's\nno tomorrow is with email.\n\n29\n00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.170\nAnd if it doesn't work,\nthen you're toast as well.\n\n30\n00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.790\nSo those two items in itself sound\nsimple enough, but they really are.\n\n31\n00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.570\nThat's the thing that gets\neverybody screaming right away.\n\n32\n00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.320\nAnd today the third one is wireless,\n\n33\n00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.700\nall it takes is one ping of a drop in\nwireless, somebody will notice that.\n\n34\n00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.600\nAnd once that happens, people get upset\nabout that too, but not as much as email,\n\n35\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.400\nof somebody believing\nthey don't have email.\n\n36\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.930\nAnd not as much as if they can't print\nsomething then, you're really toast.\n\n37\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380\nSo let's make sure we take care at\nleast one of those three, Zach,\n\n38\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.830\nas we get started,\nespecially with our pilot users here.\n\n39\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.508\nSo when we start to take a look at\ndealing with this, one of the first\n\n40\n00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:12.936\nthings that we want to do,\nas we get set up here, is to go back and\n\n41\n00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:18.311\ndeal with some of those DNS records\nthat we just didn't get converted over.\n\n42\n00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:22.150\nSo let's take a look at our screen, and\nthis will help us to get started here.\n\n43\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.790\nSo I am logged back in as our global\nadministrator Cherokee at this point.\n\n44\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.090\nAnd what Cherokee would end up doing\nnormally is to go to the admin portal.\n\n45\n00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.211\nAnd if she is getting all setup here,\n\n46\n00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:37.640\nit means that the DNS records also\nneed to be setup for email as well.\n\n47\n00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.460\nNow in previous episodes,\nwe at least connected so\n\n48\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.230\nthat we can use our own domain.\n\n49\n00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.353\nBut now if I go back to setup over here on\nthe left-hand side and then into domains.\n\n50\n00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:53.965\nWe can see that right now I\nhave possible service issues\n\n51\n00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.779\nwith my particular domain name.\n\n52\n00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:03.450\nAnd if I select that one, it is right\nhere that I can see DNS errors detected.\n\n53\n00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.911\nAnd what's going on right\nhere at the bottom,\n\n54\n00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:12.677\nis it shows me all the records that really\nneed to be set up for, essentially,\n\n55\n00:03:12.677 --> 00:03:17.317\neverything that I want set up\ninside of Office 365 to work.\n\n56\n00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:21.741\nAll of this really does need to be\nset up at this point when we start to\n\n57\n00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:23.610\nsee all this, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.060\nSo when we get to this point,\nI can select check DNS here.\n\n59\n00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.850\nAnd now it's actually checking for\nDNS issues, and\n\n60\n00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.070\nit should give me about the same list,\nor fairly close here.\n\n61\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.405\nAnd we're only gonna take\ncare of a portion of it.\n\n62\n00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:37.617\nActually the other portion,\nI went ahead and manually added it in, so\n\n63\n00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.804\nwe wouldn't get as many errors as well,\nokay?\n\n64\n00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:44.500\nSo once we get to this point,\nthis is what we're looking for, right?\n\n65\n00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.690\nSo it gives me, of course,\nthe manage domain outside of Office 365,\n\n66\n00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.160\nbecause I have mine actually\nestablished at hover.com.\n\n67\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.320\nAnd right here at the very beginning\nyou can see, especially for\n\n68\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.190\nemail, these MX records.\n\n69\n00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.060\nAnd it's saying here's what the records\nshould be, the expected record.\n\n70\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.058\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin a little bit there,\n\n71\n00:04:07.058 --> 00:04:10.961\nhere's what it's expecting\nto see over at hover.com.\n\n72\n00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:13.888\nIt says the record we detected\ndoesn't match what we expected.\n\n73\n00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:17.400\nSo what it's saying is it looked and\nhere's what the actual record is.\n\n74\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.290\nSo I need to go in and\nI need to change that particular record.\n\n75\n00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.620\nLet me see if I can, not zoom in,\nlet me zoom out to try and\n\n76\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.470\nsee if I can move that up a little\nbit here so that we can see it.\n\n77\n00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.570\nSo I want to actually make sure\nthat I check that one out.\n\n78\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.120\nThe other one here is CNAME record, which\nessentially is an alias record as well.\n\n79\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.865\nAnd it's telling me that, right now\nit's expecting to see a record for\n\n80\n00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.120\nsomething called autodiscover,\nand it's not seeing that.\n\n81\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200\nAnd the other record's actually\nmissing is also what we're seeing.\n\n82\n00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.840\nSo if I scroll that up,\nwe can see that too.\n\n83\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.260\nSo I need to add in\nthis record right here.\n\n84\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.930\nAnd if I scroll on down,\nnotice there's also another TXT record.\n\n85\n00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.867\nNow this TXT record is actually\na very special record right here,\n\n86\n00:05:05.867 --> 00:05:07.584\nZach, as we see this.\n\n87\n00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:10.499\nAnd the reason why this record exists is,\n\n88\n00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:15.661\nthe initial one that we created to make\nsure that we could use our DNS name,\n\n89\n00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.310\nit was just to verify that\nI own itprotvdemo.com.\n\n90\n00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.690\nSo when I added that record\ninto my DNS registrar,\n\n91\n00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.340\nOffice 365 was able to say,\nI see the change I was expecting to see.\n\n92\n00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.077\nSo yes,\nonly an owner could be able to do that.\n\n93\n00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:32.066\nBut this one right here though,\n\n94\n00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:35.610\nwhat it actually wants me to\ndo on this particular value.\n\n95\n00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.014\nAnd the way that it has it laid out,\nnotice it says\n\n96\n00:05:39.014 --> 00:05:44.310\nit includes spf.protection.outlook.com and\nthen a -all here.\n\n97\n00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.350\nWell, this is more of an anti-spam text\ninside of DNS that we're setting up.\n\n98\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.709\nSo it actually helps to provide us\na little bit of spam protection when we\n\n99\n00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:57.973\nactually want to get all this set up.\n\n100\n00:05:57.973 --> 00:06:01.496\nCuz more than likely spam is pretty\nmuch still the king of email\n\n101\n00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.330\nout there on the world.\n\n102\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.360\nSo we're gonna set up three records,\nis what we are going to do, right?\n\n103\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.530\nWe're gonna set up an MX record.\n\n104\n00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.550\nWe're gonna set up a CNAME record,\nand a text record as well, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.990\nNow inside of DNS and what we saw earlier,\nthere was a whole litany of\n\n106\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.120\nother things for us in terms of service\nrecords and some of the other ones.\n\n107\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.760\nBut I went ahead and I set that up.\n\n108\n00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.833\nYou can see down here where I've set up\nall of the actual SIP services here for\n\n109\n00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:30.266\nSkype for Business.\n\n110\n00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:33.874\nAnd some of these other\nrecords up here are, again,\n\n111\n00:06:33.874 --> 00:06:37.494\nother ones that are here for\nmanaging, you name it.\n\n112\n00:06:37.494 --> 00:06:41.310\nI just kinda made it a little bit easier,\nbut those are three samples of different\n\n113\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.170\nrecords that you might actually\nhave to at least set up here,\n\n114\n00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.210\nthat kind of cover all\nthe records as well.\n\n115\n00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.310\nAnd whenever you actually need a list\nof everything, make sure you go back\n\n116\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.210\nin here and see the list of the records\nthat they're expecting to see.\n\n117\n00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.297\nEach one of these has the stability for\nyou to copy that element to the clipboard.\n\n118\n00:06:59.297 --> 00:07:01.609\nAnd then you can just open\nup another window and\n\n119\n00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:04.140\npaste it right into\nthe fields that we want.\n\n120\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.681\nNow to help us to save a little bit\nof time, I'm not going to do that,\n\n121\n00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:10.244\ncuz I'll get us dizzy\ntrying to figure this out.\n\n122\n00:07:10.244 --> 00:07:12.844\nSo I went ahead and\nprinted out these records and\n\n123\n00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:14.806\nI simply just did a screen capture.\n\n124\n00:07:14.806 --> 00:07:18.451\nNow, you're not gonna be able to see\neverything here, but I just did a screen\n\n125\n00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:22.056\ncapture of it and sent you that top\nsection of the records that were missing.\n\n126\n00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:26.320\nSo I'm gonna use that and\ngo over to hover.com here, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.125\nAnd at hover.com,\nI am going to find my DNS management, and\n\n128\n00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:38.260\non the left-hand side, which I don't know\nwhy I was about to say right-hand side.\n\n129\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.920\nI want to change a couple of things.\n\n130\n00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.270\nI know I'm gonna add in\nat least one record, but\n\n131\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.210\nright here where it says\nthe MX record at this point.\n\n132\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.702\nI'm going to edit the MS record instead,\nokay?\n\n133\n00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:51.748\nNow I have two options here,\nI can try to edit this one.\n\n134\n00:07:51.748 --> 00:07:53.470\nLet me not do that,\nlet me not edit this one.\n\n135\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.469\nI'm going to get rid of this record\nis what I'm going to do, but\n\n136\n00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:01.100\nbefore I do that I'm gonna add\nin the new MX record first.\n\n137\n00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.060\nSo I'm gonna click on Add a Record.\n\n138\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.720\nAnd notice, it's fairly simple.\n\n139\n00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.403\nWe followed the directions here.\n\n140\n00:08:08.403 --> 00:08:11.091\nIt's supposed to be\nan MX Record at this point.\n\n141\n00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:17.963\nAnd it's gonna ask me for a host name, and\nthe host name is gonna be the @ symbol.\n\n142\n00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:22.810\nThe priority is 0,\nwhich makes it the highest priority.\n\n143\n00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.863\nAnd now the mail server itself,\n\n144\n00:08:26.863 --> 00:08:34.072\na little bit long to type in,\nitprotvdemo-com.mail,\n\n145\n00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:38.277\nmail have to spell it correctly,\n\n146\n00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:42.497\n.protection.outlook.com.\n\n147\n00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:48.027\nNow, if I'm not sure, right, in other\nwords if I'm not sure about the spelling,\n\n148\n00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:52.846\nI can always go back on my admin center\nand scroll back up here to the top and\n\n149\n00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:55.710\nnow go, all right, here it is and select.\n\n150\n00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.190\nI can select, copy to clipboard, right?\n\n151\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.420\nAnd so I was like, hey,\nare you sure you want to do this?\n\n152\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.510\nAnd they say yes.\n\n153\n00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.671\nThen I can go over to manage domains,\nhighlight this whole thing,\n\n154\n00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.212\nright click and paste, and there we go.\n\n155\n00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:13.739\nSo you can do that, but on the show, if I\nhad two browsers that I could kind of do\n\n156\n00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:19.010\nit, side by side, but our screen doesn't\nactually lend ourselves to doing that.\n\n157\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.795\nSo that's why I'm just trying to type\nit in but be very careful of doing so.\n\n158\n00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:22.745\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n159\n00:09:22.745 --> 00:09:25.877\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the other thing that it\nrecommends I can probably leave\n\n160\n00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:28.020\nthe default values here.\n\n161\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.580\nBut according to what Office 365 wants,\nit wants to set at an hour.\n\n162\n00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.250\nI'm gonna add a new MX record in there.\n\n163\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.230\nAnd it was just a s simple as that.\n\n164\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.810\nAnd you can now see I have two and\n\n165\n00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.410\nthat's records that are actually\navailable to me, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.980\nNow, even though I have these two,\nI don't want two.\n\n167\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.500\nOkay, so if I've just changed that and\n\n168\n00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.130\nI'll go back to the Office Admin center,\ndoes that affect anything?\n\n169\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.520\nWell, let me refresh this.\n\n170\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.235\nNow, sometimes this can\ntake a bit of time, okay?\n\n171\n00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:02.770\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Before it actually is refreshed and\n\n172\n00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.380\nit comes back through\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n173\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.948\ndon't expect this to just be immediate,\nsometimes it is immediate.\n\n174\n00:10:07.948 --> 00:10:10.550\nBut just can realize it\nmight take a few moments, or\n\n175\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.390\nyou may find out it takes 15 minutes for\nall we know.\n\n176\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.689\nI hoping this one doesn't\ntake us 15 minutes, but\n\n177\n00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:19.465\nif it does we'll actually just continue to\nmove on and we'll see what happen, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:19.465 --> 00:10:23.706\nSo this flash sheet takes some time\nbecause it has to reach out from Office\n\n179\n00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.531\n365 over to hover.net and\nit's inspecting those records and\n\n180\n00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:30.845\ntrying to give us what we're\nactually able to see here.\n\n181\n00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:33.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n&gt;&gt; So, that's what happens.\n\n182\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.170\nSo, while it's actually taking its\ntime and doing what it wants to,\n\n183\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.460\nwe'll come back and we'll check this\nin a little bit later here, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.990\nI'm gonna go back to\nManage Domains at this point and\n\n185\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.770\nwe're going to create a new text record.\n\n186\n00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:53.171\nSo, if I select New Record,\nthen I go down to type of TXT,\n\n187\n00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:59.063\nand on the host name here,\nthis is the same thing as the @ symbol,\n\n188\n00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:02.599\nand the contents here; this, again,\n\n189\n00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:06.884\nis where its a little bit\nmore tricky to type in so\n\n190\n00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:11.965\nI'm go back and use let me go back and\nfind the TXT value.\n\n191\n00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:15.944\nSo I'm gonna copy that,\ngo back to manage domains,\n\n192\n00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:21.245\nAnd add all that information in there,\nokay?\n\n193\n00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:24.190\nSo every part of this,\nwe wanna add back in.\n\n194\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.480\nAnd this one also is gonna be an hour,\nand it's time to live.\n\n195\n00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.500\nAnd you'll get these check boxes here\nthat will validate the fields and\n\n196\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.956\nlet's add that record in there as well.\n\n197\n00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:38.430\nAnd uncheck these two for right now.\n\n198\n00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.500\nSo that should be added in and then we\nhave one much which is a CNAME record.\n\n199\n00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.300\nSo if I select add a record and\n\n200\n00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:53.000\nan alias at this point,\nthis one should be auto discover.\n\n201\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:02.673\nAnd the target here,\nthis one is easy enough,\n\n202\n00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:07.383\nat least I think it is, for me to type in\n\n203\n00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:13.010\nautodiscover.outlook.com and one hour.\n\n204\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.355\nNow, if you haven't actually seen be\ntype before on screen, it's a horror.\n\n205\n00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:18.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's absolutely horrifying.\n\n206\n00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.865\n&gt;&gt; It's entertaining I think.\n\n207\n00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:22.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So I try not to type\n&gt;&gt; Who I don't have to but\n\n208\n00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.065\nevery once in a while, it's like do\nI try to do this or do I try and\n\n209\n00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:29.605\nget people get work lash as I put back and\nforth on the screen here.\n\n210\n00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:32.655\nSo I have to make a decision sometimes and\nI saved you from everything except for\n\n211\n00:12:32.655 --> 00:12:33.425\nthat last one.\n\n212\n00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:36.715\n&gt;&gt; You do it well.\n&gt;&gt; As well, right so let's select that and\n\n213\n00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:40.235\nnow we've added then all those records,\ntoo.\n\n214\n00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:44.020\nSo this time, let me scroll back and\nshow you look,\n\n215\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.710\nnotice now the MX record is exactly\nwhat it actually needs to be here.\n\n216\n00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:49.238\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n217\n00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:53.020\nnow it's actually seeing the expected\nrecord, okay, which is fine and\n\n218\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.250\nI didn't even have to get rid of the other\nrecord which you may have to do, right?\n\n219\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.040\nSo you may see where it\nactually lists to and\n\n220\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.650\nsaying, hey I'm expecting to see one of\nthese, you may have to get rid of them.\n\n221\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.290\nNow, let's run the actual test again.\n\n222\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.520\nWe'll refresh one more time and\nallow it to check through.\n\n223\n00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.670\nAs long as I get the green\ncheckmarks that I'm looking for,\n\n224\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:18.770\nI know that I'm at least set up for\nall of the exchange stuff that I need to,\n\n225\n00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.950\nin other words, for\nthe email stuff that I need.\n\n226\n00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.450\nAnd then we are ready to go, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.260\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n228\n00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.120\n&gt;&gt; So that is pretty much kind of\na big part of what has happened.\n\n229\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.600\nNow let's kind of slow down for\na moment, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.030\nAnd remember this, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.950\nIf you do not have permission to\nchange these particular DNS records,\n\n232\n00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.070\nmake sure you do a copy and\npaste to an email and\n\n233\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.730\nsend it to whoever actually\nis administrating DNS.\n\n234\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:44.340\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that\n\n235\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.900\nthey can get the records\nin there that they need to.\n\n236\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.875\nDon't expect it to be relatively fast.\n\n237\n00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:54.005\nSometimes people do take a little\nbit of time in checking their email.\n\n238\n00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:58.337\nIt's not always there and look at that,\nZach, when we take a look at the screen,\n\n239\n00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.070\nthat is what we are looking for.\n\n240\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; All DNS records are correct, and\n\n241\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.350\nno errors are actually found.\n\n242\n00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:12.320\nNow, that's a pretty good sign that we\nnow have at least Office 365 ready to go.\n\n243\n00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.730\nNow, remember what I've said here.\n\n244\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:18.330\nI've just used exchange as an example,\nbut I went ahead and previously,\n\n245\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.854\nactually even before this show,\nset up the ones for Skype for Business,\n\n246\n00:14:22.854 --> 00:14:26.214\nset up the other ones there for\nthe SharePoint stuff.\n\n247\n00:14:26.214 --> 00:14:30.748\nBecause this was actually enough of an\nexample, you'll still have to do the same\n\n248\n00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:34.295\nthing for each one of these\ngroupings here but this is the goal.\n\n249\n00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:38.690\nThis is what you want to see in terms\nof DNS that everything is ready to go.\n\n250\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:39.331\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n251\n00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:43.427\n&gt;&gt; All right, so now that we've\ngot DNS essentially set up the way\n\n252\n00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:48.293\nthat we want to and everything is correct\nthere we go required settings, so\n\n253\n00:14:48.293 --> 00:14:52.120\nall of the other records\nunder on Skype for Business.\n\n254\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.332\nMobile Device Management,\nAdditional Office Records,\n\n255\n00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:57.767\nthose were already\npreviously set up by me.\n\n256\n00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:00.810\nAnd, hey, look,\nthat's another confirmation right here.\n\n257\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.430\nInstead of, incomplete, may work,\nor may have issues here, notice\n\n258\n00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.350\nthat it actually says setup complete,\nthat is what we were hoping to see.\n\n259\n00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.940\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Because we're actually focusing on\n\n260\n00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.640\nan email, we now need to go into,\nof course The admin center again and\n\n261\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.080\nactually scroll down to\nanother admin center.\n\n262\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.989\nSo inside of the Office 365 Admin Center\nthere are multiple admin centers.\n\n263\n00:15:22.989 --> 00:15:24.840\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; So go figure that they would do this.\n\n264\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.030\nAnd they literally actually\nchose to do this here.\n\n265\n00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:29.900\nNotice the actual menu that we're in or\n\n266\n00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.300\nthe view that we're in is admin center,\nright?\n\n267\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.390\nBut who would of thought of actually\nnaming your sub admin centers.\n\n268\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:39.745\nLook, admin centers.\n\n269\n00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:41.246\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So who would have guessed\n\n270\n00:15:41.246 --> 00:15:43.710\nthat that would be a great way to do this?\n\n271\n00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:50.490\nSo if I select that and now, underneath\nadmin center, admin centers go figure.\n\n272\n00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.582\nThat seems not confusing at all.\n\n273\n00:15:52.582 --> 00:15:53.446\nI don't know.\n\n274\n00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:54.673\nLet's-\n&gt;&gt; From the department of\n\n275\n00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:55.361\nredundancy department.\n\n276\n00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:56.650\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n277\n00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:57.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n278\n00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.482\n&gt;&gt; So let's select Exchange.\n\n279\n00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.513\nBecause Exchange essentially is gonna be\n\n280\n00:16:00.513 --> 00:16:05.005\nwhere we have to set a few things up.\nSo inside of the Exchange Admin center,\n\n281\n00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:09.944\nthis is now where we are going to make\nsure that once we've got this done.\n\n282\n00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:11.840\nWe need to mark the domain\n\n283\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.860\nas being shared inside of Exchange online.\n\n284\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.020\nAnd that's what we're given the privilege\nof being able to see right now.\n\n285\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.430\nWhich is what we call Exchange online,\nokay?\n\n286\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.030\nSo from this point what I want\nto do is over on the left\n\n287\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.790\nhand side in the navigation pane.\n\n288\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.340\nI'm going to scroll down to Mail Flow and\n\n289\n00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.310\nthen underneath Mail Flow here,\nbecause we're setting up for DNS, right?\n\n290\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.950\nIt's gonna be one of these two,\naccepted domains or remote domains.\n\n291\n00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.540\nRight now we're just gonna\nchoose the accepted domains.\n\n292\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.740\nAnd once I do that,\nyou can now see there it is itprotv.\n\n293\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.530\nIt's gonna be our default domain for\nExchange for right now, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.390\nAnd so I have itprotvdemo and\n\n295\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.280\nit's authoritative which is perfectly\nfine, that's what I want to be able to do.\n\n296\n00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.650\nI'm going to select it and\n\n297\n00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.339\nclick on the Edit button which\nis in the form of a pencil.\n\n298\n00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:11.300\nAnd now I have a choice to make for\nitprotvdemo, okay?\n\n299\n00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.540\nSo notice the three choices here,\nthis accepted domain is Authoritative,\n\n300\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.140\nemails delivered only to valid recipients\nin this Exchange organization.\n\n301\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.320\nAll email for\nunknown recipients is rejected.\n\n302\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.382\nWell, that works as long as I'm only\ndoing internal email between everybody in\n\n303\n00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.350\nitprotvdemo.com, okay?\n\n304\n00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:37.616\nBut what if I'm actually sending to other\npeople that are out there in the world,\n\n305\n00:17:37.616 --> 00:17:38.475\nnot so much.\n\n306\n00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.430\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; So the way that it's doing, so\n\n307\n00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.270\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna\nchange us to internal relay.\n\n308\n00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.645\nEmail is delivered to recipients and\nexchange organization or\n\n309\n00:17:47.645 --> 00:17:53.250\nrelayedto an email server at another\nphysical or logical location.\n\n310\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.450\nThis will allow me to talk\nto other Exchange servers.\n\n311\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.675\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we want to be able to do,\n\n312\n00:17:57.675 --> 00:17:58.270\nokay?.\n\n313\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.790\nSo we can also do this as well.\n\n314\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:06.710\nSo setting it up for our internal relay\nis kind of a key in what we need to do.\n\n315\n00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:13.680\nNow this can take several minutes,\nso don't fret over that.\n\n316\n00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.560\nIt does take a little bit of time\ndepending on all the setup that\n\n317\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.830\nhas to be done.\n\n318\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.200\nSo you might see like I am here,\nit's taking longer.\n\n319\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.010\nI'd love for\nit to just be snap and over and\n\n320\n00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.710\nready to go, but\nyou may see where it does do this.\n\n321\n00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:31.510\nSo once everything is kind of set up,\neverything will do that.\n\n322\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.168\nNow you'll actually notice that right\nnow it's giving a warning cuz I haven't\n\n323\n00:18:34.168 --> 00:18:35.400\nset everything else up.\n\n324\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.050\nThere is no outbound connector to\ndeliver this mail for the domain.\n\n325\n00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.960\nMake sure there's an outbound\nconnector of the type on-premises\n\n326\n00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.450\nthat matches to every internal relay.\n\n327\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.993\nThe connector can either have all\naccepted domains enabled, etc.\n\n328\n00:18:48.993 --> 00:18:51.650\nSo it's actually giving\nme some information here.\n\n329\n00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.385\nIt's saying you're not complete yet.\n\n330\n00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:56.980\nYou still need an outbound connector and\nthat's fine for right now, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.540\nSo we're gonna click OK here.\n\n332\n00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.600\nAnd once we've got that done,\n\n333\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.390\nwe already know that there's another part\nof it that we have to be able to do.\n\n334\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:12.050\nBut we're gonna leave that for right now,\nbecause I don't really have another\n\n335\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:17.560\nemail for us to go to for right now,\nso we'll kinda leave it as is for now.\n\n336\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.970\nNow there is another step that we can\nadd in here if we choose to, okay?\n\n337\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:27.496\nWhich is to make sure that when we take\na look at how Exchange online is working,\n\n338\n00:19:27.496 --> 00:19:33.728\nit is working through a server that really\nis like protection.outlook.com, right?\n\n339\n00:19:33.728 --> 00:19:38.323\nSo that's actually working through\na system that's designed to help us for\n\n340\n00:19:38.323 --> 00:19:41.820\nspam protection is what\nit can actually be, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.050\nSo whenever we actually do\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.690\nThis is what we also want\nto take a look at as well.\n\n343\n00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.300\nIf I need to set that up for\nhandling spam,\n\n344\n00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.760\nI'm gonna go over to the left hand side on\nthe navigation pane a select Protection\n\n345\n00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.110\nand in the Protection area I\ncan select Connection Filter.\n\n346\n00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.760\nAnd underneath Connection Filter here,\n\n347\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:09.840\nthis is where we would add in our\nparticular connection filtering.\n\n348\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.080\nThe IP address of\nessentially our spam server,\n\n349\n00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.621\nthe one that blocks our spam is what\nwe will also add in here, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:17.621 --> 00:20:19.503\nSo we actually I'm lied to you, okay?\n\n351\n00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:22.580\nAlways except messages from\nthe following IP addresses.\n\n352\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.914\nSo this is where you would actually\ntake your Exchange Server and\n\n353\n00:20:25.914 --> 00:20:28.457\nadd that in there for\nyour on-premises as well.\n\n354\n00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:31.674\nAll right, so\nif you don't know what the IP address is,\n\n355\n00:20:31.674 --> 00:20:36.890\nyou can always get this from whoever your\ncurrent email provided is going to be.\n\n356\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.750\nAll right, so at that point everything but\n\n357\n00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.420\nthat outbound connector is\nsetup which is perfectly fine.\n\n358\n00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.530\nWe're not really trying to make sure\nthat everything is getting everything\n\n359\n00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.750\ndone the way that we want to, cuz I\ndon't have everything setup in that way.\n\n360\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.190\nBut we now need to make sure\nthat we can connect here\n\n361\n00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.680\nin a couple of different ways.\n\n362\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.470\nSo let me go back to\nthe original admin center.\n\n363\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.370\nAnd this is what keeps making more and\nmore tabs.\n\n364\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.100\nSo let me see if I can get back\nto just a single tab here.\n\n365\n00:21:10.155 --> 00:21:12.100\nClose out of that as well.\n\n366\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.560\nNow, I want to get back into\nadding in a couple of users here.\n\n367\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.160\nSo let's go ahead and\ncreate a couple of different users.\n\n368\n00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.650\nI'll add Zach in this time.\n\n369\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.979\nSo on the homepage\nunderneath the User tile\n\n370\n00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:33.899\nhere in the moment,\nyou can select Add a User and\n\n371\n00:21:33.899 --> 00:21:38.950\nnow we can select Zachary, oops Memos.\n\n372\n00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:43.810\nUsername is can be Zach for this point and\n\n373\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.780\nnotice I have these two options\nhere that I can select.\n\n374\n00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.700\nEither the itprotvdemo, or of course,\n\n375\n00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:55.370\nthe itprotvdemoco.onmicrosoft.com,\nwe'll just leave it at the default.\n\n376\n00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.540\nAnd any particular role,\naccess at this point?\n\n377\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.755\nLet's see, we can assign\ncustomize administrator role,\n\n378\n00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:09.669\nand I do service administrator as well,\nand click Add.\n\n379\n00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:17.705\nAll right, so\nnow that we've actually got one,\n\n380\n00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:22.020\nlet's see, and do that.\n\n381\n00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.660\nLet's add another user here, oops,\nyou know what I forgot to do?\n\n382\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.980\nI forgot to check out your password.\n\n383\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.883\nThat's fine, but\nyou'll kind of get the idea.\n\n384\n00:22:35.883 --> 00:22:37.363\nSo let's not add me in there.\n\n385\n00:22:37.363 --> 00:22:40.340\nLet's see who else can we actually\npick on at this point here.\n\n386\n00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.423\nSo let's do Wes Brian.\n\n387\n00:22:42.423 --> 00:22:43.804\nThat's a good one.\n\n388\n00:22:46.195 --> 00:22:49.710\nAnd then we'll do Wes, and then Wes, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.050\nAnd once again, notice I'm not\nreally doing anything in particular.\n\n390\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.680\nWe'll just make him a regular user\nfrom this point and click Add as well.\n\n391\n00:23:09.517 --> 00:23:14.120\nAll right, so once that's all done here,\nI should actually be paying attention to\n\n392\n00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.710\nthese, but\nwe'll not worry about it so much.\n\n393\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.100\nThat should get us set up to\nwhat we actually need to do.\n\n394\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.020\nSo now that we've created that and now\nwe've set our primary addresses up, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.570\nAnd our DNS records\nare actually up to date, okay?\n\n396\n00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.180\nWe should, at this point,\nbe ready to start sending emails back and\n\n397\n00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:37.830\nfort between us and\nthat organization as well.\n\n398\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.923\nNow, the issue that I had though\nwas that outbound connector and\n\n399\n00:23:40.923 --> 00:23:44.814\nthat provider which means at that point I\nstill need to actually kinda figure that\n\n400\n00:23:44.814 --> 00:23:46.262\none out if I continue to go on.\n\n401\n00:23:46.262 --> 00:23:50.764\nBut when everything is actually said and\ndone right,\n\n402\n00:23:50.764 --> 00:23:55.365\nwe should be able to okay,\nverify by sending emails and\n\n403\n00:23:55.365 --> 00:24:02.487\nlet's see what happens if I now go Into,\nlet's just use Cherokee's for right now.\n\n404\n00:24:02.487 --> 00:24:05.338\nAnd watch, you'll be able to use,\nsince I'm logged in as her, and\n\n405\n00:24:05.338 --> 00:24:08.003\nI can't remember everybody\nelse's email address right now.\n\n406\n00:24:08.003 --> 00:24:11.723\nLet's see what happens if\nI just send a new one,\n\n407\n00:24:11.723 --> 00:24:15.540\nI'm gonna send this one to Zach here.\n\n408\n00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.710\nAnd notice, Zach's is actually\nalready coming up, which is good.\n\n409\n00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.628\nAnd then I will say this is a test or\n\n410\n00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:30.249\nmaybe, can't type, there it is,\n\n411\n00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:35.534\nT-E-S-T, this is a test message\n\n412\n00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:45.510\nSee what happens here,\nif we end up getting a sent item.\n\n413\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.958\nSo it at least says that it ended\nup getting sent over to Zach.\n\n414\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:52.350\nNow at this point, right,\nI would need to log in as Zach.\n\n415\n00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.007\nAnd the issue that I have there is that I\ndon't remember his particular password,\n\n416\n00:24:56.007 --> 00:24:57.410\nto be able to log in.\n\n417\n00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.860\nSo then when we actually check it,\nthat's what we would end up doing.\n\n418\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:06.840\nSo let's see if we can get Zach's\nemail up and running as well, okay?\n\n419\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.900\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nhow are we gonna test this out?\n\n420\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully what I can do,\nright, is I've reset your password, so\n\n421\n00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.667\nnow I should be able\nto log back in as you.\n\n422\n00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:19.340\nNow, because I was logged in as Cherokee,\nI had to kind of log Cherokee back out.\n\n423\n00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.308\nSo let's take a look at my screen, and\nthat way we don't get confused here,\n\n424\n00:25:23.308 --> 00:25:23.993\nthere it is.\n\n425\n00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:28.106\nCherokee's signed out now, so\nin theory, I should be able to take and\n\n426\n00:25:28.106 --> 00:25:30.000\nswitch to a different account.\n\n427\n00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.764\nAnd now signing in, now let's see,\n\n428\n00:25:34.764 --> 00:25:39.683\nif I now type in zach@itprotvedemo,\n\n429\n00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:44.006\nif I spelled that right, .com.\n\n430\n00:25:44.006 --> 00:25:49.107\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now it should ask me\n\n431\n00:25:49.107 --> 00:25:55.099\nto enter your password in.\n\n432\n00:25:55.099 --> 00:25:57.888\nYeah, that actually, that's one of those\nthings where, like I said, I couldn't\n\n433\n00:25:57.888 --> 00:26:00.660\nactually remember what the password was,\nand there it is, I'm trying to do that.\n\n434\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.469\nNow all I should be able\nto check here is mail.\n\n435\n00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:07.375\nAnd we should get an email from Cherokee\nasking me to select the time zone,\n\n436\n00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.763\ncuz we haven't actually logged in before.\n\n437\n00:26:09.763 --> 00:26:16.420\nAnd now it's gonna kick me out of\nOffice and do everything else here.\n\n438\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.250\nSo there we go, so\n\n439\n00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.250\nwe now have, where email is pretty\nmuch functioning internally.\n\n440\n00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.320\nNow I'm not sending anything\noutside of my organization,\n\n441\n00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.590\nright, but we know at least\nit's functioning internally.\n\n442\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.160\nOnce I get that outbound connector set up,\n\n443\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.740\nthen everything else will also\nfunction that way as well, okay?\n\n444\n00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.563\nSo getting those DNS records in\nthere are pretty much the key.\n\n445\n00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:43.770\nGoing into Exchange and\ngetting the mail flow connector set up.\n\n446\n00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.561\nAnd then setting on the outbound\nconnector, especially for\n\n447\n00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:49.089\nthe regular email,\nthat's also gonna be key as well.\n\n448\n00:26:49.089 --> 00:26:53.664\nBut the great thing is now that we have\nat least the inkling of what needs to\n\n449\n00:26:53.664 --> 00:26:54.265\nbe done.\n\n450\n00:26:54.265 --> 00:26:58.820\nNow we can just continue to add users and\nverify that the email is working.\n\n451\n00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:59.490\nAnd that means for\n\n452\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.590\nour pilot program, email users should\nend up having their email access.\n\n453\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.240\nAnd shouldn't be affected any more,\nby whether or\n\n454\n00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.890\nnot things are actually working.\n\n455\n00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.800\nSo it's a great step in completing\nout this idea of at least the pilot,\n\n456\n00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.240\nand getting it started.\n\n457\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.890\nAnd, of course, from that point,\nyou do that for\n\n458\n00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.937\nall the different services\nthat you wanna run.\n\n459\n00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:18.640\n&gt;&gt; Sure, it make sense.\n\n460\n00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.600\n&gt;&gt; So, make sure that everybody\ncan get access those services and\n\n461\n00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.990\ndo the same thing.\n\n462\n00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.560\nSo it does help once you actually\nget that happening and going, but\n\n463\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.171\nyou're seeing the process.\n\n464\n00:27:28.171 --> 00:27:32.959\nNow, to actually get set up with the rest\nof the email in the way that we would\n\n465\n00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:34.300\nnormally want to?\n\n466\n00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.470\nTake a look at the 70-346, not 346,\n347 show, that we also ended up doing.\n\n467\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.988\nBecause that will help you to\nsee where we went ahead and\n\n468\n00:27:40.988 --> 00:27:44.841\nenabled all the rest of that services, to\nget everything the way that we want it to.\n\n469\n00:27:44.841 --> 00:27:48.609\nFor establishing the email, and\nworking out the way we wanted to,\n\n470\n00:27:48.609 --> 00:27:51.280\nto connect out to the rest of the world.\n\n471\n00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.698\nBut at this point, Zach, it's actually\na good place for us to end this episode.\n\n472\n00:27:54.698 --> 00:28:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, wow, set up email for pilot\nusers, that makes a lot of sense to me.\n\n473\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.750\nIs there gonna be a part two, Ronnie?\n\n474\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.010\n&gt;&gt; There's not gonna be a part two.\n\n475\n00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.370\n&gt;&gt; But we're gonna move on and\nshow us more, right?\n\n476\n00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.409\n&gt;&gt; Right, got a lot more, yep.\n\n477\n00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:08.457\n&gt;&gt; In the Office 365 environment,\nwhiich leads me to this point.\n\n478\n00:28:08.457 --> 00:28:11.672\nMake sure you watch every\nsingle episode of Office 365,\n\n479\n00:28:11.672 --> 00:28:14.380\nit'll help you with the exam and\nso much more.\n\n480\n00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.240\nAlso visit our course library,\nhundreds of videos there,\n\n481\n00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.800\nthey are all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n482\n00:28:19.800 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:13.773\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.773 --> 00:00:15.791\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:19.358\nI'm Zach Memos your host for Office 365.\n\n7\n00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:22.457\nAnd we're going to engage\nFastTrack Center for\n\n8\n00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:27.431\nOffice 365 with our Office 365 expert,\nthe one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.215\nRonnie, great to have you here,\nthanks for coming on by.\n\n10\n00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.351\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for\nhaving me on the show, Zach.\n\n11\n00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.180\nAs we continue to take a look of course\nat getting ready with Office 365 for\n\n12\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.390\nour organization to get\nthat set up as well.\n\n13\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.140\nAnd now we're starting to take a look,\neven though we've been talking\n\n14\n00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.230\nabout this idea of planning a pilot we're\nalso needing to take a look at some of\n\n15\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.710\nthe utilities that are out there to help\nus to get started a little bit quicker.\n\n16\n00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.540\nNow you might be wondering like, if I can\nget started quicker why do I need to take\n\n17\n00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.670\na look at doing everything else\nthat you're talking about?\n\n18\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.310\nWell, if you're gonna\nbe the administrator,\n\n19\n00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.190\nif you're the one that's really gonna be\ndoing everything on your own then yes,\n\n20\n00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.840\ntaking kinda a slower approach, planning\nout the pilot, doing everything that we're\n\n21\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.985\ngonna be doing along this show,\nas well as the Office show for\n\n22\n00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:21.500\n70-347, is gonna help you become a better\nadministrator at all the stuff and\n\n23\n00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.940\nyou'll really get to know\nOffice 365 inside and out.\n\n24\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.560\nBut we do understand that sometimes you\ndo have to as you get stuff started\n\n25\n00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.340\na little bit quicker here, so that's what\nwe actually have to think about as well.\n\n26\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.480\nSo up into this point, right, we already\nshown you just a couple of things, right?\n\n27\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.430\nIn getting setup, talking amount of\ncourses idea of planning the pilot.\n\n28\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.498\nGetting everything up in this point but\nnow we're going to give you kind of the,\n\n29\n00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:49.244\nlike all right,\nI don't think this is for me, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:49.244 --> 00:01:50.445\nBut I still need it.\n\n31\n00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:53.017\nOkay, I still need it but what can I do?\n\n32\n00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:57.587\nOkay, what is it that I can do to really\nhelp me to kind of get started and\n\n33\n00:01:57.587 --> 00:02:02.091\ndo what I need to do and that is what\nwe're actually looking at today.\n\n34\n00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.700\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat is the goal of Microsoft FastTrack?\n\n35\n00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Microsoft FastTrack\nitself is a center, okay.\n\n36\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.170\nIt's got people in it that are really\nthere to help provide you with a way\n\n37\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.130\nto get Office 365 pretty much up and\nrunning as far as guidance goes, right?\n\n38\n00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.610\nIt gives you what we call, of course, some\nof these things that are best practices.\n\n39\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.540\nBut the whole goal behind it\nis to actually give you quick\n\n40\n00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.100\nthings that you can do and\npredictable outcomes.\n\n41\n00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.050\nThat doesn't sound like\nanything really neat but\n\n42\n00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.800\nit's the neatest thing in the world.\n\n43\n00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.410\nIf you haven't ever tried to install\na particular service and get it up and\n\n44\n00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.070\nrunning by yourself and a couple of\ntimes in row, you might go, hey,\n\n45\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.780\nthe first time I try,\nit worked perfectly fine.\n\n46\n00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.050\nSecond time you try two years later,\nyou might go,\n\n47\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.450\nI don't know why this doesn't\nwork the same way it did before.\n\n48\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.420\nAnd notice that you're actually not as\nfast, nor is your outcome as predictable\n\n49\n00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.550\nwhich means it takes a longer time for\nyou to get up and started.\n\n50\n00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.093\nSo the goal of FastTrack overall,\nand everything that it provides for\n\n51\n00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:15.100\nyou is guidance for setting up Office 365.\n\n52\n00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.620\nIt has the goal of quick things and\nit has the goal of predictable outcomes.\n\n53\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.290\nIn other words, whatever you try It should\ngive you the outcome you're looking for\n\n54\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.630\nand it should be predictable.\n\n55\n00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.680\nSo it's not a guess, like,\nwhen I actually do shows,\n\n56\n00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.900\nas long as I did everything\ncorrectly it should show me this.\n\n57\n00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.863\nSo I'm really trying to let you know.\n\n58\n00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:39.160\nNow, does that mean that I haven't tried?\n\n59\n00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.920\nNo, I'm just letting you know\nthat sometimes things happen\n\n60\n00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.140\ndifferently on shows than they do\nwhen you're actually even preparing.\n\n61\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.260\nSo there are a lot of times where\nI can run through something two or\n\n62\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.950\nthree times get on the show and\nget ready to go, doesn't work.\n\n63\n00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.180\nEspecially running in a cloud environment\nyou can't predict how long something may\n\n64\n00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.170\ntake to sync up and how, it may tell you,\nit shouldn't take longer then five minutes\n\n65\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.180\nand all of a sudden\nit's taking 15 minutes.\n\n66\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.830\nSo there's no predictability in\nsome of the stuff we end up doing.\n\n67\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.078\nBut, imagine having a complete\ncenter that's right there, ready and\n\n68\n00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:11.004\navailable to help.\n\n69\n00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:15.945\nNow, just when I say that, even though\nthose goals are actually kinda the key\n\n70\n00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:19.976\nelement behind what FastTrack\nreally wants to provide for us,\n\n71\n00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:24.490\nthere is something, Zach,\nthough it doesn't do for us, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.650\nSo, just like everything else,\nright, that we actually go,\n\n73\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.030\nshould I take advantage of it?\n\n74\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.370\nYou have to kinda weigh\nout what it does for you.\n\n75\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.670\nAnd then the other side that we\ndon't like to think about, Zach,\n\n76\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.544\nis what it doesn't do for you right?\n\n77\n00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.590\n&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I like looking at the nice shiny,\n\n78\n00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.620\nnew object.\n\n79\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.120\nI like going, man this is great, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.957\nIt's sorta like buying a new car,\nright Zach?\n\n81\n00:04:42.957 --> 00:04:43.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You go and go man,\n\n82\n00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:48.870\nthat's the greatest car in the world, I\nwant one, I'd love to have one right now.\n\n83\n00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.100\nAnd then we sit down,\nyou talk with the sales person.\n\n84\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.570\nSounds great, right?\n\n85\n00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.900\nThen he shows you the bottom and,\nZach, all of the sudden,\n\n86\n00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.100\nhow does the great sound?\n\n87\n00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.215\n&gt;&gt; It didn't sound so good anymore.\n\n88\n00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.321\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That 1996 Volvo looks a lot more\n\n89\n00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.030\nattractive at that point.\n\n90\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.849\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all of the sudden we kind, whoa,\n\n91\n00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.095\nwhoa, wait a minute.\n\n92\n00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:08.882\nWasn't thinking about that so\nmuch anymore.\n\n93\n00:05:08.882 --> 00:05:10.823\nSo the same thing happens too.\n\n94\n00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.370\nNow what do I mean by that?\n\n95\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.342\nIt's not that what they don't give you\ndoesn't work because that's what it's\n\n96\n00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:15.958\ndesigned to do.\n\n97\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.566\nThe design will say you follow our steps,\nit's gonna go up and working.\n\n98\n00:05:19.566 --> 00:05:20.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nRight.\n\n99\n00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:24.460\n&gt;&gt; But the key is to understand\nwhat they said right?\n\n100\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.360\nIf you follow the steps.\n\n101\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.450\nNow what I'm I trying to get to?\n\n102\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.550\nThey're not gonna implement it for\nyou, Zach, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.645\nSo in that sense, they're not sending\nthe team out to your place and saying,\n\n104\n00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:39.122\njust let us handle it and\nlet us configure it, and we'll be fine.\n\n105\n00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:40.770\n&gt;&gt; We'll do it all for you.\n\n106\n00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.920\n&gt;&gt; We'll do it all for you.\n\n107\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.860\n&gt;&gt; They will provide you good,\nsolid guidance on what you need to do,\n\n108\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.320\nto give you the predictable outcome that\nyou can do, you'll follow the steps.\n\n109\n00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.600\nIts a lot quicker than you having\nto learn, and trial and error,\n\n110\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.800\nand figure it out on your own, okay.\n\n111\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.350\nSo you have to weigh\nthat out of whether or\n\n112\n00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.780\nnot is it worth the time for me to try and\nlearn everything that I can about this?\n\n113\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.370\nGuarantee you it's going to be work for\nyou and\n\n114\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.440\nthen in the future people\nare just gonna be, they are,\n\n115\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.020\nthey're just gonna be migrating\nover to Office 365 more and more.\n\n116\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.260\nSo to be an expert in that\nalready at this time,\n\n117\n00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.640\neven though the field is\nalready ramping up hard,\n\n118\n00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.270\nyou still got plenty of time because\nthere's tons of companies up there.\n\n119\n00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.510\nThey're still on that kinda, ugh, yeah,\nI know we need to, but I'm not yet there.\n\n120\n00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.250\nWell imagine being ahead of the game.\n\n121\n00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.690\nYou still want to do that.\n\n122\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.500\nYou may also of course want to have that\nquick and predictable outcome sometimes\n\n123\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.752\nwhen people absolutely need\nit to be up and running too.\n\n124\n00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:42.310\nSo FastTrack is designed to\nhelp us to do that, okay.\n\n125\n00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.930\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n126\n00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.290\n&gt;&gt; Now, Zach, when we start to\nactually think about that though, okay\n\n127\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.053\n&gt;&gt; He'd say it's no for everybody.\n\n128\n00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:49.802\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n129\n00:06:49.802 --> 00:06:53.290\nWell who's eligible for\na FastTrack onboarding?\n\n130\n00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.170\n&gt;&gt; When we start to think about that,\nthat's where it becomes a little bit more\n\n131\n00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.130\nof, Ronnie is it true it's not for,\nyes it's not for everybody.\n\n132\n00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.080\nSo I went ahead and on my screen\nI listed kinda the eligibility.\n\n133\n00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.901\nTo be able to use FastTrack here.\n\n134\n00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:15.826\nIf you look, it does come down to\nthe idea of subscriptions, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:17.129\nSo for example,\n\n136\n00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:23.190\nwhat is normally required here in terms\nof FastTrack Eligibility is simple.\n\n137\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:28.621\nIf you have 50 or more seats, and\nthat's the same as subscriptions so\n\n138\n00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:32.605\nOffice 365 seats in\na business particular plan or\n\n139\n00:07:32.605 --> 00:07:37.857\nan Enterprise plan, Government,\nKiosk or Non-profits, all of,\n\n140\n00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:41.418\nsee you have a 50 or more of those-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n141\n00:07:41.418 --> 00:07:46.008\n&gt;&gt; You're eligible to essentially use\nFastTrack to help you to get started and\n\n142\n00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:48.890\nto get up and\nrunning in the way that you want to.\n\n143\n00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:54.531\nNow remember that is really just\nproviding you guidance and information.\n\n144\n00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:57.821\nIt is not going to get you up and running.\n\n145\n00:07:57.821 --> 00:07:59.850\nIt's not going to make it hands free.\n\n146\n00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.402\nIt's not a turn key solution, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:02.402 --> 00:08:05.420\nBut what it is though is\nactually gonna give you what?\n\n148\n00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.053\nOnce again, quick things.\n\n149\n00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:11.378\nThere's kind of almost the steps\nthat you need to take,\n\n150\n00:08:11.378 --> 00:08:15.001\nbut then in the end have super\npredictable outcomes as well.\n\n151\n00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:17.134\nNow, if you need more than that, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:17.134 --> 00:08:19.642\nWhich most of us are going to also do, so\n\n153\n00:08:19.642 --> 00:08:23.830\njust getting set up is not exactly\nthe hardest thing in the world.\n\n154\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.418\nYou've seen me do it, so\n\n155\n00:08:25.418 --> 00:08:29.745\nyou know it isn't the most difficult\ntask in the world to do, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:33.947\nBut what is you also need to\nmigrate over from your email?\n\n157\n00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:39.495\nYou wanna move from your on premises\nsolution to a fully Office 365 solution,\n\n158\n00:08:39.495 --> 00:08:41.299\nbut not as much downtime.\n\n159\n00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:45.679\nYou wanna move all your file servers\ninternally up into the one drive for\n\n160\n00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:49.699\nbusiness and all that stuff, and\nget everything up and running.\n\n161\n00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:53.119\nWell you're not gonna\nbe really eligible for\n\n162\n00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:57.988\nthat until you have more than 500 seats,\nthat's a big jump.\n\n163\n00:08:57.988 --> 00:09:02.185\nYeah, so that means even though\nyou can ramp up pretty fast, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:02.185 --> 00:09:06.099\nFor you to get the faster ramp up for\neverything else though,\n\n165\n00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:09.191\nit really requires you to\nhave a lot more there.\n\n166\n00:09:09.191 --> 00:09:12.692\nAnd that's because the instructions\nare a bit more detailed and at this point.\n\n167\n00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:15.683\nYou're probably getting a lot\nmore help from them because all\n\n168\n00:09:15.683 --> 00:09:18.300\nthese features are different\nin this sense.\n\n169\n00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.800\nEvery organization has\ntheir own tweaks and\n\n170\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.780\nset up things a little bit differently.\n\n171\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.971\nThen the way that that\nnext organization did,\n\n172\n00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:26.835\nthen the way that they previously did.\n\n173\n00:09:26.835 --> 00:09:32.486\nWhereas at the beginning in terms of just\nconfiguring Office 365 to get it ready for\n\n174\n00:09:32.486 --> 00:09:36.500\njust about every organization\nis fairly identical, okay?\n\n175\n00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.318\nI'm not gonna say it's\ncompletely identical, but\n\n176\n00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:41.182\nthe steps are fairly repetitive.\n\n177\n00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:44.455\nBut when you start talking about\nhow your email servers are set up,\n\n178\n00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:47.862\nin a large organization,\nyou might have clusters of email servers.\n\n179\n00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:51.372\nOr if you're in a small one, you might\nhave a single email server, right?\n\n180\n00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:55.801\nThe same thing with your particular\nfile storage that you have available for\n\n181\n00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.790\nyour system as well, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.470\nHow people access it is\ndifferent in every way.\n\n183\n00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.976\nSo in that sense, you still have to\nactually get all that stuff over there.\n\n184\n00:10:03.976 --> 00:10:07.654\nThere still has to be much more\nguidance to help you to do so,\n\n185\n00:10:07.654 --> 00:10:10.830\nto give you the predictable\noutcome that you want.\n\n186\n00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.283\nSo in doing that, that's actually neat.\n\n187\n00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:16.980\nThe other advantage of also using\ntheir particular fast track in\n\n188\n00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.289\nterms of mail, okay?\n\n189\n00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:20.384\nIs gonna help you out in this way.\n\n190\n00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:24.066\nEmail essentially can be moved from\nmultiple different types of service.\n\n191\n00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:28.358\nSo most of the time when we talk about it\nin terms of big business we're normally\n\n192\n00:10:28.358 --> 00:10:29.863\ngoing to exchange, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:32.056\nCuz that's kinda the big\nguy that's out there.\n\n194\n00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:34.994\nHe's the 500 pound gorilla\nin the business, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:39.201\nBut if you had IBM's Domino server, okay?\n\n196\n00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:43.887\nLotus Domino, I hate to say this, I've set\nup one of these Domino servers before way\n\n197\n00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:45.714\nback when I say way back-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:10:45.714 --> 00:10:47.855\n&gt;&gt; Early 2000s, okay?\n\n199\n00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:49.072\n&gt;&gt; Anciently.\n\n200\n00:10:49.072 --> 00:10:51.661\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, setting up Domino servers, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.237\nNot exactly easiest task in the world,\nbut can it be done?\n\n202\n00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.302\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz this guy did it,\nso I know it can be done.\n\n203\n00:10:56.302 --> 00:10:56.904\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n204\n00:10:56.904 --> 00:11:01.099\nif you're still running a Domino server\nand you're migrating in Office 365,\n\n205\n00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.206\nyou can do so, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:02.206 --> 00:11:04.849\nIt's pretty darn impressive,\ncuz I don't know,\n\n207\n00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:08.426\nI know of one organization that might\nstill be using a Domino server.\n\n208\n00:11:08.426 --> 00:11:10.772\nNow that doesn't mean that\nthey're not out there,\n\n209\n00:11:10.772 --> 00:11:12.540\nit just means I only know of one, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.651\nGoogle Apps for work,\nyou can do that, Novo Group wise.\n\n211\n00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:19.857\nOr any IMAP system, all that can\nactually be out there as well, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:24.013\nSo this is something that you really\nwant to actually be able to do,\n\n213\n00:11:24.013 --> 00:11:27.813\nwhen you actually have something\nlike this going on, okay?\n\n214\n00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:31.842\nThe other thing about your file servers\nas well, they want you to know that.\n\n215\n00:11:31.842 --> 00:11:33.015\nThey're ready and\n\n216\n00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:37.860\nwilling to help you to migrate all your\nstuff over into one drive for business.\n\n217\n00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.684\nFiles can be moved even from other\nthird party storage providers as well.\n\n218\n00:11:42.684 --> 00:11:47.852\nIf you have accounts in Box, you have them\nin Dropbox, excuse me, Google Business.\n\n219\n00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:50.537\nOr even your own basic file shares,\n\n220\n00:11:50.537 --> 00:11:54.483\nall that's also gonna be\navailable as well, okay?\n\n221\n00:11:54.483 --> 00:11:58.724\nSo you do have information\nlike this at your hand, but\n\n222\n00:11:58.724 --> 00:12:03.546\nremember, it comes at the idea\nhere of eligibility, okay?\n\n223\n00:12:03.546 --> 00:12:07.396\nSo all of these are different\nsolutions that might have to be,\n\n224\n00:12:07.396 --> 00:12:11.033\njust a little bit more customized for\nyour organization.\n\n225\n00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.497\nNow that doesn't mean that\nthey can't help you out,\n\n226\n00:12:13.497 --> 00:12:15.972\nit just means that you know\nyou might have to find out.\n\n227\n00:12:15.972 --> 00:12:20.729\nAnd give them more details about what\nyou're doing before they can help you out\n\n228\n00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:21.317\nas well.\n\n229\n00:12:21.317 --> 00:12:25.686\nSo that's also gonna be a key\nin what we're doing too.\n\n230\n00:12:25.686 --> 00:12:29.850\nNow Zach, I believe there is actually\na question in our chatroom that is very\n\n231\n00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.592\nrelevant to what we're\ntalking about right now.\n\n232\n00:12:32.592 --> 00:12:34.924\nSo let's take a look at that\nparticular question too.\n\n233\n00:12:34.924 --> 00:12:36.068\n&gt;&gt; Okay, Ronnie, so\n\n234\n00:12:36.068 --> 00:12:40.076\nthe question is Microsoft is really\npushing FastTrack at Ignite.\n\n235\n00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:42.176\nAnd do we know if it's\ntailored information?\n\n236\n00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:46.799\nDid they give out to companies, or was it\nall just generic, generic information?\n\n237\n00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:49.166\n&gt;&gt; Well there's kind of\na mix of things here, right?\n\n238\n00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:52.890\nIf you probably have this 500 seat or\nmore, okay?\n\n239\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.895\nIt's gonna be relatively tailored,\n\n240\n00:12:54.895 --> 00:12:59.284\nyou'll actually end up getting a meeting\nwith one of their engineers that will help\n\n241\n00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:02.497\nyou to set up the success plan and\nget everything ready to go.\n\n242\n00:13:02.497 --> 00:13:04.526\nBut Ronnie,\nthey can't implement everything for you.\n\n243\n00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:07.176\nBut they can provide you\nthe guidance to make sure, and\n\n244\n00:13:07.176 --> 00:13:10.992\nyou can even test out solutions against\nthem, and see what ends up happening.\n\n245\n00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:14.821\nSo it is relatively tailored,\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n246\n00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:16.822\nNow if you do need more help,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n247\n00:13:16.822 --> 00:13:19.312\nthey'll probably actually give\nyou as much help as they can.\n\n248\n00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:21.652\nBut certain things that you\ndon't want to reveal to them,\n\n249\n00:13:21.652 --> 00:13:23.678\nyou'll kind of have to\nkind of talk that through.\n\n250\n00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:27.571\nBut yes, it is essentially\na tailored solution and of course,\n\n251\n00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:30.811\nthey want you to actually\npurchase whatever plans.\n\n252\n00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:34.296\nI bet you there's an up sell inside\nonce you get to that point like, hey,\n\n253\n00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:35.911\ndo you want this type of support?\n\n254\n00:13:35.911 --> 00:13:37.451\nAnd they'll probably actually push-\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n255\n00:13:37.451 --> 00:13:38.498\n&gt;&gt; It a little bit more.\n\n256\n00:13:38.498 --> 00:13:40.183\nWell it's the same thing, right?\n\n257\n00:13:40.183 --> 00:13:42.383\nEvery sell actually has\nan up sell at some point-\n\n258\n00:13:42.383 --> 00:13:43.676\n&gt;&gt; Always.\n\n259\n00:13:43.676 --> 00:13:46.548\n&gt;&gt; So just like when you're looking\nat that newest model of car.\n\n260\n00:13:46.548 --> 00:13:50.088\nThere's always the custom\nseats that are in there or\n\n261\n00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:53.482\nthe white trim instead of the darker-\n&gt;&gt; Heated seats.\n\n262\n00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:55.862\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, heated seats,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n263\n00:13:55.862 --> 00:13:57.284\nSo just kinda realize,\n\n264\n00:13:57.284 --> 00:14:01.560\nit is fairly custom in terms of\nthe solution that's available, okay?\n\n265\n00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.110\nSo it's a great product.\n\n266\n00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n267\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.522\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it, right?\n\n268\n00:14:04.522 --> 00:14:08.285\nIt's like having somebody\nright over your shoulder, and\n\n269\n00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:12.135\nthat you can reach out to that's\ngiven you a a success plan.\n\n270\n00:14:12.135 --> 00:14:14.109\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why I can't say that.\n\n271\n00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:15.772\nAnd has given you that plan, and\n\n272\n00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:19.104\nyou just simply have to follow\nthose steps along to help you out.\n\n273\n00:14:19.104 --> 00:14:24.145\nAnd any obstacles along the way, you do\nhave that ability to contact them again,\n\n274\n00:14:24.145 --> 00:14:28.017\nand to make sure that success\nplan continues to flow through.\n\n275\n00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:31.637\nAnd they'll help you out as much\nas possible, so it is great.\n\n276\n00:14:31.637 --> 00:14:35.324\nAnd that's a great question that we had\nfrom Greg [CROSSTALK] to think about.\n\n277\n00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:36.435\nSo is it worth it?\n\n278\n00:14:36.435 --> 00:14:37.793\nYes, probably, right?\n\n279\n00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:41.798\nIf you go hey, I need this up in\nthe next three weeks or four weeks, and\n\n280\n00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:42.777\nI've got this.\n\n281\n00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:45.770\nYeah, it might be worth\nall your time to do so.\n\n282\n00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.721\nIf you can take the time to\nrun through the pilot and\n\n283\n00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.034\nget everything that you want to.\n\n284\n00:14:49.034 --> 00:14:52.905\nAnd get it set up on your own and\nyour pacing is good that you need,\n\n285\n00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:56.370\nthen it's probably worth you\ntaking the time to do that.\n\n286\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.792\nBut if you really just need\nto get it up and running,\n\n287\n00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:04.808\nthat's why people do turn to other\ncompanies that are specializing inside\n\n288\n00:15:04.808 --> 00:15:09.360\nof their own company, excuse me,\nof helping people migrate over.\n\n289\n00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.967\nSo Microsoft is trying to take a portion\nof that back from these third party\n\n290\n00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:17.404\ncompanies that are essentially\ndoing the same thing.\n\n291\n00:15:17.404 --> 00:15:20.826\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a better closer\nlook at that sticker on the window.\n\n292\n00:15:20.826 --> 00:15:22.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They took services,\n\n293\n00:15:22.242 --> 00:15:24.338\nthese Office 365 Services offer.\n\n294\n00:15:24.338 --> 00:15:26.711\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwhen we start to get to this point, right?\n\n295\n00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.340\nAnd we need help especially in\nFastTrack services here, okay?\n\n296\n00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.605\nMicrosoft really does help us to get\nstarted with all these services and\n\n297\n00:15:34.605 --> 00:15:38.174\nfast tracking these things\nwill really help us out, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:38.174 --> 00:15:39.337\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n299\n00:15:39.337 --> 00:15:42.214\n&gt;&gt; Now the majority of what we're\nreally gonna be spending our time on in\n\n300\n00:15:42.214 --> 00:15:43.664\nthis particular series, right?\n\n301\n00:15:43.664 --> 00:15:48.431\nIs really gonna be the idea of exchange,\nwe'll talk a little bit about OneDrive and\n\n302\n00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:50.147\nthe Skype for Business here.\n\n303\n00:15:50.147 --> 00:15:53.983\nBut actually Office 365, I was trying to\nthink of which one was the third one.\n\n304\n00:15:53.983 --> 00:15:58.659\nSo Exchange, OneDrive and\nprobably Office 365 ProPlus.\n\n305\n00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:03.887\nThe rest of the stuff, we do se more\nof this inside of the 70 dash 347.\n\n306\n00:16:03.887 --> 00:16:07.640\nNot so much of the business\nintelligence stuff or Project Online.\n\n307\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.260\nBut we will talk about setting\nup Yammer and not Teams,\n\n308\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.410\ncuz that one's just kinda been\nthrown in there recently here.\n\n309\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.320\nBut all the rest of the stuff you do\nend up seeing a little bit more on,\n\n310\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.030\nespecially on the SharePoint\nside of things as well.\n\n311\n00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.060\nSo we'll get in that, especially exchange,\n\n312\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.090\nwe'll talk about that a little\nmore once we get there.\n\n313\n00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.610\nBut overall though, okay,\ngetting FastTrack Services for\n\n314\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.800\nall these additional services,\nokay, will, again,\n\n315\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.650\nprovide you with that predictable\noutcome that really looking for.\n\n316\n00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.240\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n317\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.980\n&gt;&gt; So if you need that up and running,\nokay, the way that you actually want it to\n\n318\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.370\nbe, that's how that will end up\nhappening at the beginning, okay.\n\n319\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.710\nSo, it does require you to have\na certain eligibility, okay,\n\n320\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.690\nwhich we've talked about.\n\n321\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.800\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And you can get help for any of this,\n\n322\n00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.050\nas well as just a set up.\n\n323\n00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.070\nRemember, this is a generic set up,\nyou can get again,\n\n324\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.090\nkind of generic guidance on it.\n\n325\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.270\nTo be able to run and do, but just kind of\nrealize that if you really have that 500\n\n326\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:10.930\nplus, you're gonna get a particular\nengineer assigned to you to help\n\n327\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.590\nyou to walk through and get the process\ndone quickly, is what's gonna happen.\n\n328\n00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:17.719\n&gt;&gt; Peace of mind,\nthat sounds great to me, so\n\n329\n00:17:17.719 --> 00:17:20.508\nhow do I get started with\nFastTrack onboarding Ronnie?\n\n330\n00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:23.193\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so when we start to take a look,\nespecially for\n\n331\n00:17:23.193 --> 00:17:26.314\nthe exam objectives what we're\ntalking about here, okay.\n\n332\n00:17:26.314 --> 00:17:30.715\nIs that we wanna FastTrack\nthe onboarding process itself, so\n\n333\n00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:35.562\nhow users really get to start with us and\nwhat we want to be able to do.\n\n334\n00:17:35.562 --> 00:17:38.650\nWell, you wanna turn in a couple\nof different places here.\n\n335\n00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.110\nSo let me see that can bring up,\nwhere is my machine here?\n\n336\n00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.650\nSo here is the actual machine\nthat we've been using.\n\n337\n00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.710\nIf I can run the password,\nthis what happens.\n\n338\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.090\nAnd I can't remember my\nsuper fast password here.\n\n339\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.014\nNow when I say that there's a couple\nplaces, we'll have to full screen our\n\n340\n00:17:58.014 --> 00:18:01.385\ncomputer shot here to help us out just for\na moment.\n\n341\n00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:05.256\nWhen we start to take a look, the most\ngeneric information that really is\n\n342\n00:18:05.256 --> 00:18:08.053\nalso coming from FastTrack\nis a little bit unusual.\n\n343\n00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:13.929\nIn this what you can barely see,\nnotice this little red kind of a dialogue,\n\n344\n00:18:13.929 --> 00:18:17.730\npop up little thing right\nthere that says help?\n\n345\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:24.710\n[LAUGH] So if I click on help here,\nthis is part of a FastTrack.\n\n346\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.500\nNow, it's not the FastTrack itself, and\n\n347\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.000\nwhat we want, but\nit at least gets us here.\n\n348\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.970\nSo, votice that it says Need help?\n\n349\n00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.890\nSo I'm just gonna type in like,\nonboarding.\n\n350\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:40.570\nIf I could spell it, onboarding users.\n\n351\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.200\nSo let's see if we can actually get any\nhelp at all when we start to take a look\n\n352\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.080\nat this.\n\n353\n00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.930\nAnd now you can see that it pretty much\nprovides me some generic guidance,\n\n354\n00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.730\nso here's where I said it was\na hybrid type of solution.\n\n355\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; To a point.\n\n356\n00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:58.620\nI can get some generic guidance here\nif I'm onboarding I need CSV files from\n\n357\n00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:04.230\nMailbox migration,\nI can Manage migration in Office 365.\n\n358\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.390\nI can even Plan for\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n359\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.810\nWe can actually reach out through there\nin terms of just regular guidance.\n\n360\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.520\nBut notice this last thing down here,\nokay,\n\n361\n00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.830\nLet us call you is what\nwe'll actually see.\n\n362\n00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.160\nAnd now you can go ahead and\nhave this and type it in.\n\n363\n00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.060\nSays expected wait time is 10 minutes.\n\n364\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.913\nAnd they'll call you bac, is what they'll\ndo if you enter in a phone number,\n\n365\n00:19:30.913 --> 00:19:34.233\nthey'll call you back in that 10\nminutes to try and help you out,\n\n366\n00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:36.331\nat least that's what the way time is now.\n\n367\n00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:40.872\nThe longer that you wait,\nespecially during a business day here,\n\n368\n00:19:40.872 --> 00:19:42.827\nusually in US time, right.\n\n369\n00:19:42.827 --> 00:19:46.060\nSo, Eastern time all the way through,\nof course the Pacific time for\n\n370\n00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.959\nus here in the states when you\nhave that regular business day,\n\n371\n00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:51.824\nthat's probably the busiest\ntime of the day for Microsoft.\n\n372\n00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:55.866\nCuz the majority of private users that\nthey're having to deal with in terms of\n\n373\n00:19:55.866 --> 00:19:58.990\nsupport in FastTrack is probably\nright here in the states.\n\n374\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:04.090\nSo you'll probably see that that time will\ncontinue to go up throughout the day for\n\n375\n00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.170\nthem as they actually\nstart to do this as well.\n\n376\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.220\nSo you can go ahead and do that if you\nwant to, okay, and that will give you\n\n377\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.052\nsome of the more generic types of\nsolutions that may help you out.\n\n378\n00:20:14.052 --> 00:20:18.560\nAll right, now what if you go all\nright I need more help than that.\n\n379\n00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.875\nThe good thing is if I click on\nthis link over here where it says\n\n380\n00:20:21.875 --> 00:20:23.820\nMicrosoft FastTrack.\n\n381\n00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.632\nOr for you at home, okay,\nif you are taking a look at that,\n\n382\n00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:35.130\nhere is the address that I've typed in,\nas well, the URL which is FastTrack.\n\n383\n00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.010\nNotice two t's in there,\n\n384\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:42.320\nfasttrack.microsoft.com that will\nlead you to their website, okay.\n\n385\n00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.830\nNow at their website for you,\nnotice it gives you a lot more.\n\n386\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.539\nSo this is Microsoft's complete FastTrack,\n\n387\n00:20:51.539 --> 00:20:58.640\nif I select Microsoft 365 right now,\nand then I scroll down.\n\n388\n00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.190\nGet started here with resources and\ntools for\n\n389\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.229\nmaximizing your success with Office 365,\nWindows 10, and etc.\n\n390\n00:21:05.229 --> 00:21:08.976\nSo if I select Office 365 right here, and\n\n391\n00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:13.653\nthat brings me to fast track for\nOffice 365, okay.\n\n392\n00:21:13.653 --> 00:21:14.910\n&gt;&gt; How convenient.\n\n393\n00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.450\n&gt;&gt; So it took a few steps,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n394\n00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:23.970\nBut you can see here, and if you wanna\nactually the direct link instead,\n\n395\n00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.430\nyou can,\nlet me see if I can zoom in on that so\n\n396\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.240\nthat everybody can see\nthat a little bit better.\n\n397\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:35.200\nThere it is, fasttrack, two T's,\nremember, okay, .microsoft.com/office.\n\n398\n00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.780\nThat will get you to the FastTrack for\nOffice.\n\n399\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.560\nMake your rollout of Office 365 a success.\n\n400\n00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.550\nNow notice that they're not\nsaying try your rollout,\n\n401\n00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.160\nfigure out your rollout here, okay.\n\n402\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.380\nVery bold language, right?\n\n403\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.286\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, make your rollout a success.\n\n404\n00:21:53.286 --> 00:21:57.740\n[LAUGH] Okay, so it's not like,\ntry to make your rollout a success.\n\n405\n00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.220\nIt is absolutely make\nyour rollout a success.\n\n406\n00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.350\nSpeed implementation, drive adoption,\n\n407\n00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:08.840\nhelp users get the most from their\npremier cloud productivity suite.\n\n408\n00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.860\nBoy it sounds like a lot of\npromises right there okay, but\n\n409\n00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.175\nthey are willing to deliver.\n\n410\n00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:16.010\nNow here's where I got some\nof those details from that\n\n411\n00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.410\nwe talked about in terms\nof eligibility okay.\n\n412\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.190\nSo you can also see all this\ninformation right there again.\n\n413\n00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.840\nAnd the other thing, of course, that I\ndidn't point out, let me see if I can\n\n414\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.620\nzoom in on this one without driving\nus all nuts at the same time, okay.\n\n415\n00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.130\nSo here,\nnotice I've kind of highlighted this.\n\n416\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:44.165\nAs long as you have current and\neligible Office 365 plan subscriptions,\n\n417\n00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:48.597\nyou can start using FastTrack\nonboarding migration and\n\n418\n00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:53.043\nadoption services or\nuse them again at any time, okay.\n\n419\n00:22:53.043 --> 00:22:57.791\nSo it gives you that too, and\nnow notice, go to FastTrack for\n\n420\n00:22:57.791 --> 00:23:02.277\nOffice 365 Resources,\nI'm gonna select that link.\n\n421\n00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:07.760\nLet's see, any other, there we go,\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n422\n00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.320\nNow at this point, you can see some\nof the generic options, right.\n\n423\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.950\nOnboarding is specifically what we are\ntalking about, as far as the exam here.\n\n424\n00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:24.160\nSo here on the onboarding, to get engaged,\nthat’s what we would select here.\n\n425\n00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.010\nAnd it leads you to a business\npartner that can help you.\n\n426\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.830\nNow this is probably not what\nyou’re normally looking for.\n\n427\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.830\nBut here’s where you can\nactually go at this point,\n\n428\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.250\nif you actually need to select that.\n\n429\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.000\nSo if you wanna learn more about it,\nyou select here.\n\n430\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.320\nAnd let’s see what other tools are there.\n\n431\n00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.060\nSo here's kind of the generic\noptions that are available.\n\n432\n00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:51.460\nNow, if I go into Microsoft FastTrack here\nand I sign in, let me select the Sign In.\n\n433\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:55.320\nIt says, hey, sign in and\nread your profile.\n\n434\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.500\nSo it says I am signed in, and\nI already did this a little bit earlier so\n\n435\n00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.110\nI wouldn't have to try and\ntype in that password.\n\n436\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.345\nCuz it was a long password.\n\n437\n00:24:02.345 --> 00:24:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n438\n00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.690\n&gt;&gt; So here it should give me some\ninformation as it's now reading and\n\n439\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.390\nsetting me up here.\n\n440\n00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:12.230\nYou still have to go through and\nyou still have to register and\n\n441\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.190\ndo all the rest of this information\nas you need the FastTrack here, okay.\n\n442\n00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:21.200\nSo you'll simply fill out at information\nand then you'll tell them what you need\n\n443\n00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.632\nand you'll either get either\ngeneric responses back or,\n\n444\n00:24:24.632 --> 00:24:27.290\nyou'll actually get the service\nperson to call you back.\n\n445\n00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.355\nAnd to set up everything that you need for\n\n446\n00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:32.400\nFastTrack to get started in\ndoing what we want to, okay.\n\n447\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.330\nNow I'm not gonna set this up because\nI don't really qualify, okay,\n\n448\n00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.880\nI'm using a free account, okay.\n\n449\n00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.630\nAnd not only that, I don't have 25 seats,\n\n450\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:44.040\nso even though they show me as being\nregistered here, more than likely,\n\n451\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.380\nthey're probably gonna look and\ngo, that's a free one.\n\n452\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.900\nFor right now and probably not do this.\n\n453\n00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.150\nBut this is where you begin, and\nthe steps after this is relatively easy.\n\n454\n00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.393\nJust follow the directions and\nthat will get you started.\n\n455\n00:24:56.393 --> 00:24:59.417\nIn terms of the engagement,\nyou'll either get, like I said,\n\n456\n00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:03.241\nassigned to an engineer or they'll lead\nyou to a library of great resources that\n\n457\n00:25:03.241 --> 00:25:05.771\nyou can actually be able\nto pull from as well, okay.\n\n458\n00:25:05.771 --> 00:25:09.933\nSo Zach That is how we\nreally do get started with\n\n459\n00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:14.649\nthis process of using FastTrack for\nOffice 365.\n\n460\n00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:18.960\nAnd help us bring our onboarding\nprocess as we continue to move forward.\n\n461\n00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.250\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that was a great episode,\nengage FastTrack Center for Office 365.\n\n462\n00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.200\nI learned an awful lot,\nI'm sure you did, too.\n\n463\n00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.711\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 series,\n\n464\n00:25:29.711 --> 00:25:31.263\nalso go to our course library.\n\n465\n00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:34.852\nThere's hundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n466\n00:25:34.852 --> 00:25:38.130\nAnd tell everybody know about ITPro TV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n467\n00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.280\nThanks for watching,

--> 00:00:16.621\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.190\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.939\nAnd this is Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.220\nWe're going to enable client connectivity,\nwith the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.710\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.730\nThanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for inviting me back\non the show, Zach, as we continue on and\n\n13\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.790\nlearn more about of course, getting\nOffice 365 set up for our organization.\n\n14\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.310\nAnd of course connecting to, well,\nthe Office 365 cloud as well.\n\n15\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.286\nSo during our series we'll really\ntalk now about setting it up, and\n\n16\n00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:47.623\ngone through the ideas of actually\nmaking sure that a pilot is ready to go.\n\n17\n00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:51.844\nBut some of the other things that we now\nneed to begin to think about as well of\n\n18\n00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:54.520\ncourse is the idea of client connectivity.\n\n19\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.588\nNow, when we start talking about that for\nan organization is not just enough to say,\n\n20\n00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:01.705\nokay, I'm connected to the Internet and\nthat's good enough.\n\n21\n00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:06.248\nBut inside of an organization you may\nactually connect with a couple of\n\n22\n00:01:06.248 --> 00:01:11.253\ndifferent devices in between, and\nthose devices may need to be configured so\n\n23\n00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:16.267\nthat we get the best possible user\nexperience that we can with Office 365.\n\n24\n00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:20.630\nAnd what we're gonna be specifically\nreferring to today, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.640\nIs really gonna be of course\ntwo different devices.\n\n26\n00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.150\nWhat we're gonna talk proxy servers\nas well the idea of firewalls.\n\n27\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.850\nNow, when it comes down to both of them\nthe proxy server is probably the one\n\n28\n00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.240\nthat's bit more mysterious in\nthe connections that we have.\n\n29\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.780\nSo we're probably gonna\nfocus in on that one too.\n\n30\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.555\n&gt;&gt; So in fact,\nmy very first question to you, sir,\n\n31\n00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:46.230\nis help us understand more about the proxy\nserver, and how that might be applied or\n\n32\n00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.567\nused in the Office 365 environment?\n\n33\n00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually something\nthat we have to consider,\n\n34\n00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:53.920\nespecially if we are actually\nusing a proxy server.\n\n35\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.650\nThere is no doubt,\n\n36\n00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.860\nthat lot of organisations like the use of\na proxy server and what it does for us.\n\n37\n00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.090\nSo let's take a look at my screen\nhopefully this will help us a little bit\n\n38\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.525\nto understand what's going on, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:11.144\nSo when we have a couple of different\nthings happen right, so here it is,\n\n40\n00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:14.496\neverybody inside of my\nitprotvdemo.com network.\n\n41\n00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:15.081\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n42\n00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:19.550\nwhat I may have of course then as we\nconnect out to the rest of the world.\n\n43\n00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.661\nThere's websites out there,\nthere's Office 365,\n\n44\n00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:26.949\nthere's other places beyond the edge\nof my network that's out there, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.864\nTo simplify that I've removed\nevery other object in between,\n\n46\n00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:32.948\nbut let's say that what's right\nhere of course is a proxy server.\n\n47\n00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:35.849\nNow what does a proxy server really do?\n\n48\n00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.235\nNotice that all of my devices internally\nthey go through the proxy server\n\n49\n00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:46.900\nitself Before it goes out to websites,\nand possibly even to Office 365.\n\n50\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.485\nBut let's focus in on\nthe website aspect first,\n\n51\n00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:54.380\nand talk about why this\nis also important too.\n\n52\n00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.160\nSo when my clients connect\nout to a particular website,\n\n53\n00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.860\nthey are not connecting\ndirectly to those websites.\n\n54\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.672\nRight in between,\nthey're gonna hit the proxy server, and\n\n55\n00:03:06.672 --> 00:03:09.973\nthe idea of the proxy server\nis to act on behalf of me.\n\n56\n00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:14.687\nSo if I'm on that machine,\nit is acting on my behalf to then\n\n57\n00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:19.120\ncontact what that other\nwebsite is going to be?\n\n58\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.060\nNow when that website responds,\nit returns the information back,\n\n59\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.030\nnot directly to me but\nit returns it back to the proxy server.\n\n60\n00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.170\nThe proxy server then also acts\non behalf of the web server\n\n61\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.360\nto return that response back.\n\n62\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.970\nNotice that what this does is\nit abstracts us a little bit.\n\n63\n00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.490\nIn other words, it puts another device\nin between that when I'm never really\n\n64\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.980\ndirectly connecting to is pretty much any\nmachine that is out there somewhere else.\n\n65\n00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.290\nOn my particular edge of the entire world\nreally resides at this proxy server.\n\n66\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.330\nSo it adds a kind of layer\nof defense in a sense here.\n\n67\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.780\nIt's not the best layer of defense, but it\nadds a little bit of a defensive layer in\n\n68\n00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.010\nthat sense is that nobody's ever\ndirectly connecting out there.\n\n69\n00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.690\nWe're connecting through this\nidea of the proxy server.\n\n70\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was gonna say it's like\na defense and it's also like a liaison.\n\n71\n00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it kind of works in that\nsame aspect and that same way.\n\n72\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.020\nNow, the key though to understanding\nhow or this working out, right?\n\n73\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.420\nYou got to think about what\na proxy server does, okay?\n\n74\n00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.974\nNow, when we start thinking about what\na proxy server does, there's three or\n\n75\n00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:34.946\nfour things that a proxy\nserver really does for us.\n\n76\n00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:39.936\nAnd the reason why I'm actually focusing\nin on this, because this is what's going\n\n77\n00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:44.160\nto affect our particular user experience,\nalso with Office 365.\n\n78\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.390\nSo, in the very first sense, in the way\nthat I talked about right here, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.058\nSo far when we actually start doing this,\nokay?\n\n80\n00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:56.600\nWell, a proxy server can do like\nI said three or four things,okay?\n\n81\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.790\nSo when it comes down to one of the first\nthings that it does is what we call\n\n82\n00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.120\nend point inspection.\n\n83\n00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.300\nNow, that's kind of sound like\na technical thing but really isn't.\n\n84\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.100\nWhen we are connecting from\nITProTV demo machine over here.\n\n85\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.200\nIt hits the proxy server, and\nsays hey, you wanna go this website?\n\n86\n00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.049\nWell, it has to actually take a look and\ngo,\n\n87\n00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:21.131\ndo I really want to make\nthat connection or not?\n\n88\n00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:25.340\nIn other words, it actually goes to that\nendpoint and kinda decides whether it's\n\n89\n00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.817\ngood or whether it's bad, and\nit allow us to make that connection or\n\n90\n00:05:28.817 --> 00:05:31.755\nit allows a proxy server to\nmake that connection, okay?\n\n91\n00:05:31.755 --> 00:05:35.725\nSo it does that idea of what we call\nend point inspection to that point.\n\n92\n00:05:35.725 --> 00:05:37.630\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; The other thing it can do though,\n\n93\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.010\nis again, talked about the good and\nthe bad, it can do content filtering.\n\n94\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.520\nSo let's say we go to that website, but\n\n95\n00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.030\nI have already set up some\nrules here on the proxy server.\n\n96\n00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.185\nSay, if that website shows something I\ndon't want show internally in my network.\n\n97\n00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:52.860\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n98\n00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.010\n&gt;&gt; Then, I want to filter it out.\n\n99\n00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.913\nSo it allows me to actually do\nsome content filtering as well.\n\n100\n00:05:58.913 --> 00:06:04.193\nThe third thing which is prior why a lot\nof organizations do also do this, okay?\n\n101\n00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:08.650\nIs the ability to do what we call caching,\nokay?\n\n102\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.320\nWhat does caching actually do for us?\n\n103\n00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.140\nIt allows me to request\nwhatever that information is.\n\n104\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.628\nAnd from that website, it stores it\nlocally on the proxy server, okay?\n\n105\n00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:20.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n106\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.130\n&gt;&gt; When we do that, what does that mean\nfor all the other devices internally?\n\n107\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.140\nIt means that if go to very same website,\nokay, that this guy just went to,\n\n108\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.910\nthey don't always have to actually\nget another request from the website.\n\n109\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.970\nThey simply pull it down from\nthe proxy server itself and\n\n110\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.940\nit speeds things up incredibly.\n\n111\n00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.470\nSo it really can do that or us.\n\n112\n00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.220\nSo the idea of speed is a big one.\n\n113\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.280\nThe idea that actually being to do\nthe things that we talk about content\n\n114\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.030\nfiltering doing basic\nend point inspection.\n\n115\n00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.060\nAll that really is kind of key, and\n\n116\n00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.750\nthen of course along with the end\npoint inspection essentially routing.\n\n117\n00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.930\nDo we wanted to go here or\n\n118\n00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.950\nnot it actually has a routing table\nthat can help us to be able to do that?\n\n119\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.160\nSo Zach,\n\n120\n00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.710\nthose are kinds of the basic things\nthat a proxy server does for us here.\n\n121\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.478\nAnd this also means that it does it for\nany other website,\n\n122\n00:07:18.478 --> 00:07:22.954\nwe also have to think about it in terms\nof the context of it doing it for\n\n123\n00:07:22.954 --> 00:07:26.344\nus when we connect to Office 365 as well,\nokay?\n\n124\n00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:27.064\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n125\n00:07:27.064 --> 00:07:29.714\n&gt;&gt; So\nthis is something that's important for\n\n126\n00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:32.950\nus to think about as we\nbegin to proceed on.\n\n127\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:40.740\nThe reason why is that in Office 365,\nit is a different environment, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.609\nAnd this is why it's actually important.\n\n129\n00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:48.272\nSo when we actually try to\nconnect to Office 365, well,\n\n130\n00:07:48.272 --> 00:07:54.641\nwe've gotta think about some of the things\nthat Office 365 is already doing.\n\n131\n00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.651\nAnd we gotta think that some of\nthe traffic that Office 365 is\n\n132\n00:07:58.651 --> 00:07:59.869\ndelivering to us.\n\n133\n00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:03.104\nAnd what can happen here if\nwe actually start to do this.\n\n134\n00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:05.640\nSo that is what we want to\ntake a look at next here.\n\n135\n00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.190\nIs actually think about this idea and\nthis process as well okay?\n\n136\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.690\nSo, first and foremost then Zach,\nas we start to take a look at this.\n\n137\n00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.930\nOne of the things that\nends up happening right?\n\n138\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.230\nWhen we start talking\nabout the proxy server.\n\n139\n00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.176\nIs a couple of other things\nthat end up going on too.\n\n140\n00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:29.310\nBetween my network itprotvdemo and\n\n141\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:35.960\nthe Office 365 connection,\nthere is no open connection.\n\n142\n00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.770\nIn the sense that not anything\nis sent in clear text, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.760\nAnd that means that everything\nin between itprotvdemo and\n\n144\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.160\nOffice 365 is pretty much encrypted.\n\n145\n00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n146\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.870\n&gt;&gt; Well what does a proxy server\ndo with the encrypted content?\n\n147\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.270\nNot really much it can do, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:02.740\nIf you want it to do the content\nfiltering, it can't, okay?\n\n149\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.170\nIt can't do that because\nit doesn't have a way\n\n150\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.450\nto break that encryption right then and\nthere, okay?\n\n151\n00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.650\nNow if you want it to, can it do that?\n\n152\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.670\nYes but you have to actually set up\nsomething else if you want that to happen.\n\n153\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.610\nIf you wanted to inspect\nencrypted content in between\n\n154\n00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.830\nyou have to actually set up certificates,\nokay?\n\n155\n00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.600\nSo that there's an end point\ncertificate that is, excuse me,\n\n156\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.340\nthat is handed out by the proxy\nserver of the machines over here.\n\n157\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.820\nAnd you also have to allow for\nOffice 365 to issue out, or\n\n158\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.330\nallow for\nthem to accept your certificate as well.\n\n159\n00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.900\nAnd that way,\nin between the proxy server can do what?\n\n160\n00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.390\nDecrypt the content and\n\n161\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.130\nthen say okay I can take a look at the\nstuff in between to do that if I want to.\n\n162\n00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.200\nNow, you're probably not gonna\nbe able to do that, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:58.710\nCan you do that?\n\n164\n00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.440\nYes but, what you're doing is a man in\nthe middle attack on your own traffic,\n\n165\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.960\nis what's happened.\n\n166\n00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.500\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] is that actually why?\n\n167\n00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.400\nDoes Microsoft recommend using\nthe proxy server then, or no?\n\n168\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.785\n&gt;&gt; No, not really, okay?\n\n169\n00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:13.710\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But let's make sure that we understand\n\n170\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.350\nthe basics, here.\n\n171\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay as we go on but, yes.\n\n172\n00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.810\nWe're gonna see that there's a reason why\nMicrosoft doesn't recommend using it,\n\n173\n00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.310\nokay but here at that sense, right?\n\n174\n00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.210\nIf all the content is actually\nalready encrypted in-between well\n\n175\n00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.920\nthen there is no need for\nme to have that extra protection of\n\n176\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.790\nthe proxy server cuz it's not gonna\nreally do anything else for us, okay?\n\n177\n00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n178\n00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.680\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that we also have,\nokay?\n\n179\n00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.990\nIs that we take a look\nat the idea of caching.\n\n180\n00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.890\nWe'll, let just take Email for\n\n181\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.360\nexample with Office 365 in\nexchange online as well okay?\n\n182\n00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.780\nWIth that on hand,\nyou don't actually to do that anyways.\n\n183\n00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.815\nMore than likely on your clients and\nof course in Office 365.\n\n184\n00:10:56.815 --> 00:11:01.870\nYou're working in what we call\nthat exchanged cache mode.\n\n185\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.370\nWell if you're already running\na cached mode anyways,\n\n186\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.010\nwhy do we need another caching?\n\n187\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.205\nCaching cached content\nmakes no real sense.\n\n188\n00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n189\n00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.300\nwe don't need it to do\nthe caching as well, okay?\n\n190\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.630\nSo there is no real good reason so\n\n191\n00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.270\nfar that we can think of\nto help us to do this.\n\n192\n00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.980\nSo we can continue to add up the list,\nbut as you start to talk about it and\n\n193\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.380\nthink about it, that's where it\nreally begins is to think about that.\n\n194\n00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.860\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So because Zach did set this up for\n\n195\n00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.360\nus and Microsoft doesn't\nnecessarily recommend a caching or\n\n196\n00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.760\na proxy server in between.\n\n197\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.130\nLet me see if I can actually get\neverything here to move up a little bit,\n\n198\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.420\nit kinda shifted when I closed out\nof it and put it back in okay?\n\n199\n00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.970\nIt doesn't mean you can't use a proxy but\nhere's the way that we would do this okay?\n\n200\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.570\nSo here it is I kinda summarized\nthis a little bit more,\n\n201\n00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.300\nremember what a proxy server does.\n\n202\n00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.630\nEnd point inspection,\ncontent filtering, and\n\n203\n00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.940\nthen essentially reusing\nthe actual content here, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.630\nSo whatever is actually\ncached we can do that.\n\n205\n00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.090\nSo if I don't want this to\nhappen with Office 365 and\n\n206\n00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:17.600\nI still have a proxy server\nI have three options, okay.\n\n207\n00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.930\nOne is to bypass the proxy.\n\n208\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.490\nSo how can we do that?\n\n209\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.750\nWe actually can send out\na different gateway.\n\n210\n00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.650\nWe can put an exception in\nthe proxy server if we want to.\n\n211\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.380\nOr we can simply actually say, hey,\n\n212\n00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.080\nyou're gonna go out of this path\ninstead of through the proxy server.\n\n213\n00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.040\nSo you can do that if you\nchoose to do that and\n\n214\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.340\nthe reasons why is a couple of things.\n\n215\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.160\nRemember that everything inside of\nOffice 365 when we make that connection\n\n216\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.010\nthat is absolutely gonna be encrypted.\n\n217\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.520\nSo there is protection already there.\n\n218\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.292\nThe second thing between Office 365 and\nmy computers right here\n\n219\n00:12:55.292 --> 00:13:01.010\non ITProTVdownload.com is there's\ngonna be a persistent connection.\n\n220\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.560\nWell in the way that webpages\nessentially work at websites, right.\n\n221\n00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.950\nWe make the connection.\n\n222\n00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.910\nWhen we make that connection,\n\n223\n00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:15.120\nwhat ends up happening is that we retrieve\nthat content and we break the connection.\n\n224\n00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.170\nSo it's not persistent.\n\n225\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.340\nOffice 365 continues to\nmaintain that connection\n\n226\n00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.090\nduring the whole time it is up and\nrunning.\n\n227\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:29.180\nSo on my machine, cuz I'm running\nOutlook as a client on my machine,\n\n228\n00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:34.050\nit is constantly contacting\nthe Office 365 site, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.700\nBecause I'm running Skype for\nBusiness in the background for\n\n230\n00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.060\nour messaging contact, right?\n\n231\n00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.570\nAll that is actually constantly running\nand doing that across that to Office 365.\n\n232\n00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.320\n&gt;&gt; We have persistence.\n\n233\n00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.020\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that actually is kind\n\n234\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.100\nof indicative of the way that\nthis actually works out for us.\n\n235\n00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:00.170\nAnd what that means is if I run this\nthrough a particular proxy server as well,\n\n236\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:05.370\nthat's a lot of data for a single proxy\nserver to have to be able to keep up with.\n\n237\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.150\nAs well as a lot of ports to keep\nup with for all the cash and\n\n238\n00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.080\nwe'll talk about the bandwidth usage on\nthat in just a little bit later here too.\n\n239\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.370\nAnd finally, what cashable data is there?\n\n240\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.970\nNot really a lot.\n\n241\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.300\nIf you send me an email message\nwith an attachment, and\n\n242\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.960\nyou send Zack an email message with the\nexact same attachment, you just added our\n\n243\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.880\nnames to both those, well,\nthat sounds like it's identical content.\n\n244\n00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.550\nBut because you addressed\nthem to two different people,\n\n245\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.590\nit's actually two different\npieces of content there.\n\n246\n00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.390\nSo there is nothing that can be\ncached on the proxy server anyways.\n\n247\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.110\nSo there's not a lot of\nre-cacheable content or\n\n248\n00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.240\ncacheable content that\nwe're really running.\n\n249\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.500\nSo the idea of bypassing that\nproxy is probably a good idea,\n\n250\n00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.190\nnow just when I say that, right?\n\n251\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.190\nWhat if I have to run the proxy?\n\n252\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.680\nWell then you have to do\na couple things Zach.\n\n253\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.610\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; If your company says,\n\n254\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.800\nyou've got to run the proxy, okay, there's\na couple of things that has to be done.\n\n255\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.820\nAnd one of them is simple,\nyou need to start scaling up your proxy\n\n256\n00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.000\nservers to handle the number of\nconnections that are gonna be needed.\n\n257\n00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.940\nSo for example,\nwith the way that Office 365 is now,\n\n258\n00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.570\nthere's at least one persistent\nconnection all the time, okay?\n\n259\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.110\nSo if you have 5,000 users,\nthat's 5,000 persistent connections, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.500\nBut that's at least a minimum of one.\n\n261\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.264\nIf you start using things\nlike instant messaging,\n\n262\n00:15:36.264 --> 00:15:41.787\nthat could include up to five additional\nport connections for every user.\n\n263\n00:15:41.787 --> 00:15:45.944\nWell now you start adding that up and\ngo, wait a minute,\n\n264\n00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:50.191\nthat was 5,000 and\nnow I have 5 25,000 plus,\n\n265\n00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:55.695\n30,000 possible connections just\nin keeping that connection up.\n\n266\n00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:57.876\nThat doesn't include all the data.\n\n267\n00:15:57.876 --> 00:16:02.216\nAnd now your proxy server also has\nto go through all that as well.\n\n268\n00:16:02.216 --> 00:16:07.130\nAnd your particular proxy server\nmay not be scaled up to do that.\n\n269\n00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:13.215\nSo if you are going to do this, you\nare going to need to try and think about\n\n270\n00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:18.910\nscaling up those proxy servers to make\nthem more the way that you want to, okay?\n\n271\n00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.450\nIf not,\ndoes Office 365 continue to work for you?\n\n272\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.130\nYes, okay.\n\n273\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.080\nWill the user have the best\nexperience at all?\n\n274\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.730\nNever.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.640\n&gt;&gt; And it's just because it is\n\n276\n00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.920\na bottleneck at this point.\n\n277\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:32.855\n&gt;&gt; I would think it would be a bottleneck,\nyeah.\n\n278\n00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:36.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the bottleneck at\nthis point is really severe.\n\n279\n00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.800\nSo if you're going to do that,\n\n280\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.660\nyou're going to need to\nactually think about that idea.\n\n281\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.030\nWell, what about inspecting\nall the traffic?\n\n282\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:48.130\nWell, once again, if you need that\nto keep control of all that traffic,\n\n283\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.660\nyou're in trouble anyways, right?\n\n284\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.720\nThe content filtering you're not gonna be\nable to do since everything is encrypted.\n\n285\n00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.450\nSo now you do have to do some type\nof SSL inspection to do that.\n\n286\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.490\nAnd that means you have to\nestablish that certificate.\n\n287\n00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.140\nSo another infrastructure on top of\nwhat you already have to do this.\n\n288\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.900\nWell, remember that even though that\ndoesn't really mean that you'll probably\n\n289\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.990\nlook at every single piece of email that\ncomes through, for you to have an option\n\n290\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.700\nto do so means setting up\nadditional infrastructure to do so.\n\n291\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.750\nSo is your organization willing to\nmake sure that that happens as well?\n\n292\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.940\nOkay, so it's not that it can't be done,\nbut do not expect for\n\n293\n00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.540\nthe user to have the best\nexperience possible, okay?\n\n294\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:32.600\nThe goal is simple.\n\n295\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.742\nEliminate as many of the hops\nin-between that we can, okay?\n\n296\n00:17:36.742 --> 00:17:40.870\nTwo, be able to go ahead and\nconnect to Office 365.\n\n297\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.350\nSo regardless of where you are in\nthe world, what you want to do is get on\n\n298\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.830\nthe Office 365 backbone\nnetwork as quickly as you can.\n\n299\n00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.000\nWell, what is left if we're\nnot doing endpoint inspection?\n\n300\n00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.523\nBecause we already know where we're\ngoing which is to Office 365.\n\n301\n00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:02.997\nIf I'm not doing content inspection\nbecause, or filtering because my data is\n\n302\n00:18:02.997 --> 00:18:07.590\nalready encrypted and I don't have\nany cacheable content available.\n\n303\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.400\nThe only thing that we've just added\nin then is essentially a router, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.980\nSo the proxy server just is another hop\nalong that path to the Office 365 network.\n\n305\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.888\nAnd the additional hop\ncauses more latency,\n\n306\n00:18:21.888 --> 00:18:27.450\nmore latency causes the user experience\nto not be as good as it needs to be.\n\n307\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.370\nSo take that into consideration\nwhen we begin to think about this\n\n308\n00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.900\nidea of running something like\na proxy server to help us out, okay?\n\n309\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.180\nSo that pretty much covers the idea\nhere when we start the thing up.\n\n310\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.483\nSo remember that even though\nit's very possible, right,\n\n311\n00:18:44.483 --> 00:18:48.314\nthat we could get by without the proxy\nserver, if there is a reason for\n\n312\n00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:52.034\nyou to use it, and there's usually\na good reason for you to use it.\n\n313\n00:18:52.034 --> 00:18:57.558\nYou may choose just to only use it for\neverything else but Office 365.\n\n314\n00:18:57.558 --> 00:18:59.391\nAnd that may be another\npossibility as well.\n\n315\n00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:00.581\n&gt;&gt; So and\nactually I was just gonna ask that.\n\n316\n00:19:00.581 --> 00:19:05.929\nSo we don't have to use a proxy\nserver if we have Office 365.\n\n317\n00:19:05.929 --> 00:19:10.665\nWe can and it can be configured so that\nthe proxy server that we're using isn't\n\n318\n00:19:10.665 --> 00:19:13.700\ngoing to be funneling\nthe information to 365.\n\n319\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, and\nthat may be what you wanna do.\n\n320\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.070\nAnd that's something that you would\ncall like split tunneling, right?\n\n321\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.950\nThe very fact that you allow some\ncontent to go through it and\n\n322\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.350\nyou don't allow other\ncontent to go through it,\n\n323\n00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.760\nyou'll probably have a much better\nexperience of doing that as well.\n\n324\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.800\nNow in getting all that set up, that's\na little beyond the technical scope,\n\n325\n00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.840\neven configuring the proxy servers\nthemselves, is beyond the scope of what\n\n326\n00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.220\nwe're talking about right now for\nthis show, that we're doing.\n\n327\n00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.620\nBut understand that concept that\nonce you actually remember that,\n\n328\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.870\nthat there's at least one or\ntwo persistent connections.\n\n329\n00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.058\nSo if you think about backward and\nforward, there's probably two persistent\n\n330\n00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:53.478\nconnections that end\nup happening per user.\n\n331\n00:19:53.478 --> 00:19:57.340\nBut then when you add in, like I said, the\nadditional services, it begins to add up.\n\n332\n00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.410\nAnd let's say it's about five or\nsix persistent connections for every user.\n\n333\n00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:06.690\nAnd then you realize that your proxy\nserver can only handle 5,000 of these, and\n\n334\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.510\nyou've already hit your base.\n\n335\n00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.290\nWell, what does that mean for all those\nother additional ones if I don't scale up?\n\n336\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:14.420\nIt means they have to slow down.\n\n337\n00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.060\nThey have to wait for\nan open opportunity to jump in.\n\n338\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.820\nIt's just like trying to merge\ninto traffic on a busy highway.\n\n339\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.580\nYou just have to wait until you can do so,\nokay?\n\n340\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.940\nSo that's kind of the thing\nthat we want to note.\n\n341\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.220\nOkay, all right, Zach,\n\n342\n00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.430\nso as far as proxy servers go,\nthat's kind of a good run down.\n\n343\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.930\nIf we do have them, for us to consider\na specially inclined connectivity because\n\n344\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.655\nit's all about the end user experience,\nokay?\n\n345\n00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:44.220\nNow in doing this, okay, we're also\ngonna learn something else, too, okay?\n\n346\n00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.250\nSo this is where we're getting to as well.\n\n347\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.563\nAnd we need to talk about firewalls here.\n\n348\n00:20:49.563 --> 00:20:54.162\nBut one of the things that's starting to\nhappen that you're gonna have to realize,\n\n349\n00:20:54.162 --> 00:20:59.300\nright, as you move into the cloud world,\nokay, the cloud service stuff, okay?\n\n350\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.590\nFor you to do any of the filtering and the\nstuff that you wanna do, it's not gonna be\n\n351\n00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:09.840\nable to be based solely on layer three and\nlayer four of the OSI model.\n\n352\n00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.650\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n353\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.980\nIt works to a point, but\nit's not completely scalable.\n\n354\n00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.542\nSo if you wanna do this,\nthe best place for\n\n355\n00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:20.774\nyou to do this is essentially\nat layer seven, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:24.280\nAnd that is at\nthe application layer itself.\n\n357\n00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.570\nAnd that's what you're gonna find out.\n\n358\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:31.240\nIs that everything you can do to control\nthat is gonna be based on layer seven.\n\n359\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.710\nSo don't really look at layer three and\nlayer four solutions too much.\n\n360\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.620\nBut don't get me wrong, you'll\nprobably be forced to do it anyways.\n\n361\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.940\nBut if you want to actually\ntruly be effective,\n\n362\n00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.970\nit's gonna be layer\nseven that helps us out.\n\n363\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:42.675\nAll right, so\n\n364\n00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:47.000\nZach, we've talked about this idea of\nthinking about firewalls, here too, right?\n\n365\n00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I was gonna say,\nlet's talk about firewalls.\n\n366\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.720\nAnd how does that fit into\nthe Microsoft Office 365 environment?\n\n367\n00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when we start to move into the\nrealm of firewalls, there is just no doubt\n\n368\n00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:02.150\nthat you have to allow for certain things\nto pass through on your firewalls.\n\n369\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.640\nYour firewalls are very good devices,\nright?\n\n370\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.720\nThey allow us to block based on IP\naddresses and that port number as well.\n\n371\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.090\nThey give us that combination or they\nallow us to base it just on IP address.\n\n372\n00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.100\nBut that's blocking at layer three and\nlayer four.\n\n373\n00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.620\nAnd don't get me wrong.\n\n374\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.710\nIt can be effective, okay, but\nit's not gonna be the most effective,\n\n375\n00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:27.490\nespecially if you have traffic\nthat's coming back to you.\n\n376\n00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.840\nSo you gotta be very careful, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.410\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthese different ports here, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:36.360\nWhen it boils down to everything, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.622\nHere's what it boils down to of what\nneeds to be allowed through your firewall\n\n380\n00:22:40.622 --> 00:22:42.242\nessentially, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:42.242 --> 00:22:47.380\nSo notice that here that tcp port 80 and\nport 443, right?\n\n382\n00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.132\nNow it's amazing, right?\n\n383\n00:22:49.132 --> 00:22:53.910\nHere we are, and we're in October of\n2017 as of the recording of this show.\n\n384\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n385\n00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.150\n&gt;&gt; Very, I say very little, fewer.\n\n386\n00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:02.370\nI don't even remember in the past year,\nyear and a half that I've actually gone to\n\n387\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:08.520\na website that hasn't already been enabled\nwith a little security lock, right?\n\n388\n00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.000\nSo in other words,\nevery website seems to be secure.\n\n389\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.730\nSo why in the world do I have to\nopen up port 80 to go through?\n\n390\n00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.570\nWell, this is more of just a convenience\nidea when we start to do this.\n\n391\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:28.150\nSo when your users open up a web\nbrowser to connect in to the portal,\n\n392\n00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:37.090\nMost of them don't type in\nhttps://portal.office.com.\n\n393\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.467\nMost of the time they just open up and\n\n394\n00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:43.528\nthey pick whatever their\nparticular browser is going to be.\n\n395\n00:23:43.528 --> 00:23:47.650\nAnd when they do that, they just\ntype what I do, portal.office.com.\n\n396\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.950\nThey get to my log in page.\n\n397\n00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.210\nThere it is, I'm ready to go, okay?\n\n398\n00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.420\nOften doing that.\n\n399\n00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.554\nWell, truly, when I do that, right,\n\n400\n00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:59.030\nwhat it's actually expecting to connect\non through the web browser is port 80.\n\n401\n00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.306\nBut in Office 365, it says hey,\nif it comes in on port 80,\n\n402\n00:24:03.306 --> 00:24:06.970\nflip it over to port 443 anyways, okay?\n\n403\n00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.310\nSo, it is just a matter of\nconvenience that we allow for\n\n404\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.840\nsomething like that to happen.\n\n405\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.640\nSo then that way, somebody doesn't just\nget an error that comes back to them\n\n406\n00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.410\nsaying, you can't connect\nto portal reality, right?\n\n407\n00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.805\nThe whole thing is you are not,\nwe give an error,\n\n408\n00:24:21.805 --> 00:24:24.035\nwe don't actually allow\nit to come through.\n\n409\n00:24:24.035 --> 00:24:29.072\nYou're not connecting to\nhttp://portal.office.com,\n\n410\n00:24:29.072 --> 00:24:34.540\nand it just tells you,\nyou're supposed to connect to HTTPS.\n\n411\n00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.775\nSo by doing along to port 80, it just\nallows for that to happen and then for\n\n412\n00:24:38.775 --> 00:24:41.009\nthem to automatically flip that over.\n\n413\n00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:44.280\nAnd that's what you wanna do,\nand allow them to connect in.\n\n414\n00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.980\nSo port 80 is really for the user or\nthe end user's convenience, okay?\n\n415\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.180\nNow the other thing that we also\nwant to remember is that port 443,\n\n416\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.280\nthat's just about 99% of everything\nthat's gonna go through Office 365.\n\n417\n00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.257\nAnd that's the reality of it, okay?\n\n418\n00:25:00.257 --> 00:25:02.006\nNow that's not always HTTPS,\n\n419\n00:25:02.006 --> 00:25:06.790\nthere's a lot of other stuff that's\nalso connecting through here as well.\n\n420\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.230\nThere is tons of stuff that is\nessentially is encapsulated inside\n\n421\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.870\nof 443 to allow for\nthis connection to go on.\n\n422\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.450\nSo, if you allow for 443, you're not just\nallowing for HTTPS, you're allowing for\n\n423\n00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.690\neverything that's encapsulated\ninside of port 443 as well.\n\n424\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.358\nSo that's why you also want to allow for\nthat to go on too.\n\n425\n00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:32.440\n3378 and 5223,\nthis is all Skype for Business.\n\n426\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.820\nYou've gotta allow those for\nSkype for Business.\n\n427\n00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.450\nAnd for those particular sections to\nbe done, you also wanna allow these for\n\n428\n00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.980\nSkype for Business as well.\n\n429\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.666\nThis kind of dynamic one is 50,000\nall the way through 59,999 and\n\n430\n00:25:46.666 --> 00:25:49.825\nmake sure you allow for udp 59,999.\n\n431\n00:25:49.825 --> 00:25:53.880\nCan you run all of Office 365 over TCP?\n\n432\n00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.264\nYes, you can, okay?\n\n433\n00:25:56.264 --> 00:26:01.427\nBut you are gonna find out something\nthat that means that on your void calls,\n\n434\n00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:03.130\nyou are gonna get echos.\n\n435\n00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.534\nYou are gonna get these\nkind of weird artifacts.\n\n436\n00:26:05.534 --> 00:26:11.800\nYou are gonna do that because that TCP\nconnection has a ton of overhead into it.\n\n437\n00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.660\nWhat you want though is\nyour udp connections to\n\n438\n00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.140\nhandle those faster types for\ntraffic to be able to do that.\n\n439\n00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.050\nSo if you only allow for\nTCP here, it will work, okay?\n\n440\n00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:26.222\nYou'll do that, but if you wanna allow for\nthe best user experience,\n\n441\n00:26:26.222 --> 00:26:31.255\nmake sure you'll also allow for\nudp 50000 through 59999 as well, okay?\n\n442\n00:26:31.255 --> 00:26:36.650\nNow, down here at the bottom, I have this\nlast kind of little pieces here too, okay?\n\n443\n00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.320\nEvery once in a while, okay?\n\n444\n00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.830\nYou may also end up with what\nwe call host based filter, okay?\n\n445\n00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.910\nWhere you need to allow for this hostname\nbased types of filtering instead and\n\n446\n00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.030\nespecially these three here.\n\n447\n00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.650\nNow, this can change over time.\n\n448\n00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:56.070\nSo in other words make sure you\ncheck the Office 365 website, and\n\n449\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.620\nsee if they're still requiring this or\nnot.\n\n450\n00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.450\nSo some of these may change like,\nI think earlier in time was like r1, r2,\n\n451\n00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.370\nres outlook, stuff.\n\n452\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.935\nBut today is r3, r4 and\nthen the production msocdn,\n\n453\n00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:13.078\ncuz we need that cdn\ntraffic to come in too.\n\n454\n00:27:13.078 --> 00:27:15.560\nSo just realized that you\nmay also need to do that and\n\n455\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.350\nopen those up on your firewall too.\n\n456\n00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.760\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat about bandwidth considerations?\n\n457\n00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.540\nAre there any,\nwhat do we need to understand it?\n\n458\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are some bandwidth\nconsiderations that we need to take a look\n\n459\n00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.720\nat here just briefly before the end of our\nshow which is just a few minutes away.\n\n460\n00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.380\nSo I gave you an example\nright here on the screen.\n\n461\n00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.890\nAnd I typed most of it out because\nthere's no other way to do that.\n\n462\n00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.629\nI was trying to think like\nhow can I shorten this out.\n\n463\n00:27:40.629 --> 00:27:43.671\n&gt;&gt; No, it's great you did this-\n&gt;&gt; But we'll need to do this, okay?\n\n464\n00:27:43.671 --> 00:27:47.080\nSo at this point here,\nI always said one but here, okay?\n\n465\n00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.830\nBe aware that for\nOffice 365 per client, okay?\n\n466\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.910\nTwo connections as a minimum\nare required for basic connectivity for\n\n467\n00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:55.590\na single mailbox.\n\n468\n00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.820\nThat's for sending and\nreceiving that, okay?\n\n469\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.600\nSo two connections.\n\n470\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.529\nMost companies that use IP\naddresses private ones, right?\n\n471\n00:28:02.529 --> 00:28:05.780\nAre also ending up using that, okay?\n\n472\n00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:10.730\nAnd so notice what this means, that all\nprivate IP addresses are hidden normally\n\n473\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.490\nbehind a single public IP address.\n\n474\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.420\nSo that's normal.\n\n475\n00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.420\nThat's not anything that's different.\n\n476\n00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.778\nSo we have a single IP\naddress here at ITProTV.\n\n477\n00:28:18.778 --> 00:28:22.305\nWe have hundreds of different devices\ninside of our network that use IP\n\n478\n00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:23.330\naddresses, okay?\n\n479\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.090\nBut they're all hidden behind and\n\n480\n00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.220\nthe way that they do that\nis by using port numbers.\n\n481\n00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.608\nThere's approximately 65,535 or\n\n482\n00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:38.130\n536 ports that every IP\naddress can end up using.\n\n483\n00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.430\nAnd let's say that some of those\nare not gonna be available.\n\n484\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:45.937\nSo here, notice it says that NAT,\nNetwork Address Translation,\n\n485\n00:28:45.937 --> 00:28:50.776\ngives us about 64,000 ports for\nevery public IP address, okay?\n\n486\n00:28:50.776 --> 00:28:56.952\nAnd that also means then that\nwe can have approximately 64,000\n\n487\n00:28:56.952 --> 00:29:02.250\npossible individual connections\nto that one IP address.\n\n488\n00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.570\nPossibly, but is that for real?\n\n489\n00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.972\nIs that absolutely true?\n\n490\n00:29:05.972 --> 00:29:10.840\nIs not per user,\nis a possible connection here, okay?\n\n491\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.476\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand what this balls down to.\n\n492\n00:29:13.476 --> 00:29:17.550\nIf I have 64,000 ports, okay?\n\n493\n00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.139\nLet's say there's about 4,000 ports that\n\n494\n00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:24.190\nare gonna be restricted by\nthe Operating System here, okay?\n\n495\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.750\nAnd the highest consumption,\n\n496\n00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.120\nlet's say that we're just\ndoing an average here, okay?\n\n497\n00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.431\nPeak port consumption per device.\n\n498\n00:29:30.431 --> 00:29:34.132\nLet's say we're gonna say six\npossible connections per device.\n\n499\n00:29:34.132 --> 00:29:39.067\nAnd peak port factor, I wanna say pork,\n\n500\n00:29:39.067 --> 00:29:42.970\nP-O-R-K, X at one time.\n\n501\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.790\nHow many are we actually using in\nany one particular time, okay?\n\n502\n00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.510\nWell, the way that we've ball\nthat down is right over here.\n\n503\n00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.896\nSo I had changed it into\na mathematical problem.\n\n504\n00:29:51.896 --> 00:29:55.610\nIf I take 64,000 ports,\nI subtract out the ones I can't use,\n\n505\n00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:59.730\nrestricted by the Operating System,\nthat gives me 60,000, okay?\n\n506\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.670\nThen, I take the ports that\nare actually available per device, and\n\n507\n00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.910\nI add that together with the ports that\nI've probably been using at any one time\n\n508\n00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:13.820\nabout four per time here,\nand that gives me 10.\n\n509\n00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.800\nSo when I do that, and\nI do the division between them,\n\n510\n00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.810\nin theory my maximum number\nof devices behind one public\n\n511\n00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.950\nIP address might be around 6,000 instead.\n\n512\n00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.630\nSo it's not what we think, you go,\nI can have 64,000 different PCs.\n\n513\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.670\nNo, every different PC that's gonna\nconnect is probably gonna consume a bit\n\n514\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.670\nof different ports that\nthey're gonna actually do and\n\n515\n00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:45.200\nthat will end up again kinda of colliding\nright there with a single IP address.\n\n516\n00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.710\nIf you start experiencing\nsome connectivity issues\n\n517\n00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.300\nmake sure you check NAT and\nsee what's happening there as well.\n\n518\n00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.210\nSo checking NAT, making sure your\nfirewall rules are up and available.\n\n519\n00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:02.050\nVerifying how your proxy servers, if they\nare actually spread out, in other words,\n\n520\n00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.270\nif they're sized correctly for the number\nof connections that you're making.\n\n521\n00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:11.660\nAll that will help enable the client\nconnectivity that you want to have for\n\n522\n00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.530\nOffice 365 and for\n\n523\n00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:17.105\nyour end users to have the best\npossible user experience to do so.\n\n524\n00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:20.870\nSo all that will actually\nend up helping you as well.\n\n525\n00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.630\nNow, there's only one other\nthing that I'm wanna show here.\n\n526\n00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.362\nI know I'm running just\na little bit late on time.\n\n527\n00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:28.848\nAnd that there's a website that\ncan also help you out too.\n\n528\n00:31:28.848 --> 00:31:29.579\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n\n529\n00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:33.470\n&gt;&gt; Now let me just bring up\na website here just briefly.\n\n530\n00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:42.240\nAnd this one is\ntestconnectivity.microsoft.com.\n\n531\n00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.140\nAnd this is something that's\nactually very nice for us.\n\n532\n00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.421\nWhere it gives you this ability to\nbe able to test and see what your\n\n533\n00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:54.435\nconnection is over microsoft.com\nbased on your connectivity right now.\n\n534\n00:31:54.435 --> 00:31:59.159\nSo if I select Office 365,\nnotice I can do general test here,\n\n535\n00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:06.390\nOffice 365 Exchange domain connectivity,\nlink, single sign-on test, you name it.\n\n536\n00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:09.681\nThis can help verify if you\nare actually getting what you want.\n\n537\n00:32:09.681 --> 00:32:11.391\nAnd it will actually run through and\n\n538\n00:32:11.391 --> 00:32:14.583\ngive you some of those different\ndynamics that will test whether or\n\n539\n00:32:14.583 --> 00:32:19.120\nnot you're actually handling everything\nthe way that everything was set up, okay?\n\n540\n00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.780\nAnd if everything is good or not,\nat least the most basics there.\n\n541\n00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.820\nSo use this in conjunction with some of\nthose other things that we talked about.\n\n542\n00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.840\nAnd you'll see that you'll\nprobably at least be able to\n\n543\n00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.124\nguess your best guess at this point,\nright?\n\n544\n00:32:33.124 --> 00:32:37.410\nHow to actually make sure that your\nclients will get the best possible user\n\n545\n00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.520\nexperience with Office 365 as well.\n\n546\n00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, Ronnie.\n\n547\n00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.130\nMore great information,\nenable client connectivity.\n\n548\n00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.870\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of Office 365 that Ronnie is\n\n549\n00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.680\npart of, because you gonna love them all\nand they're gonna help you with the exam.\n\n550\n00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.200\nThat's number one of course.\n\n551\n00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.920\nAnd then, go visit our course library.\n\n552\n00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.893\nThere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n553\n00:32:55.893 --> 00:32:58.403\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n554\n00:32:58.403 --> 00:33:00.783\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n555\n00:33:00.783 --> 00:33:02.224\nThey will be mighty glad you did.\n\n556\n00:33:02.224 --> 00:33:03.036\nThanks for watching.\n\n557\n00:33:03.036 --> 00:33:03.930\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n558\n00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.962\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

You are watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.229\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:16.066\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.518\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nthis is Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:23.690\nAnd in this episode we're going to\nadminister Azure Rights Management.\n\n10\n00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.050\nWhat's that [LAUGH] all about?\n\n11\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050\nWe're gonna find out, we've asked\nRonnie Wong to come in and help us.\n\n12\n00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.450\nRonnie, thanks for being here,\nappreciate it very much.\n\n13\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.010\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on in Office 365,\n\n14\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610\nmaking sure that we understand that\nthere are a lot of details here.\n\n15\n00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.133\nAs we're getting set up, of course, for\n\n16\n00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.328\nour organization to have Office 365\nrun in the way that we need to.\n\n17\n00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.996\nAnd we're up in this point where we need\nto begin talking about this idea of rights\n\n18\n00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:51.190\nmanagement.\n\n19\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.120\nAnd that's something that\nwe really want to get into.\n\n20\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.300\n&gt;&gt; So what is Azure Rights Management,\nRonnie?\n\n21\n00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.826\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthat's actually a great place to begin.\n\n22\n00:00:58.826 --> 00:00:59.499\n&gt;&gt; It is!\n\n23\n00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.100\n&gt;&gt; And that's because most of us don't\nreally understand what this is about.\n\n24\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.306\nBut the simple nature of this,\nZach, when we get started,\n\n25\n00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:10.177\nis the way that we think about security.\n\n26\n00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:13.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and securing our own data.\n\n27\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.790\nWell, when we secure our own data,\n\n28\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.985\nour own files that we have existing\nright now on our network, it's simple.\n\n29\n00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:20.849\nIt's on my network,\nit's on our network, right?\n\n30\n00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:23.680\nAnd as long as I can\ndefend the perimeter and\n\n31\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.330\nas long as I'm using things like\nthe permissions that are available to me\n\n32\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.002\nwithin my network,\nI can control access to them.\n\n33\n00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.091\nIf you're not a member of that network,\n\n34\n00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:35.742\nyou're pretty much denied\naccess to them as well.\n\n35\n00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:37.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So if I think about it,\n\n36\n00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.079\nit's essentially like my home,\nmy castle, that I can defend and\n\n37\n00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.090\nthat I have protection of\nthe data that exist, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.820\nAnd that always works,\nokay, until it doesn't.\n\n39\n00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.530\nAgain, a favorite phrase of\na professor that I used to, said yeah,\n\n40\n00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.890\nthat always works until it doesn't.\n\n41\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.800\nAnd you might be going, well,\nwhat the heck does that actually mean?\n\n42\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.730\nWell, remember that today\nwhat you're starting to see,\n\n43\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.070\nand especially with Office 365,\nis this migration or\n\n44\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.360\nhybridization of things that\nare beginning to happen.\n\n45\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.521\nNot only are we storing files on premises,\nbut we're also cloud-dependent.\n\n46\n00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:16.785\nAnd that means we actually\nhave some of our services,\n\n47\n00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:20.929\nif not even some of our files,\nstored somewhere else in this world.\n\n48\n00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.472\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:23.680\n&gt;&gt; In a cloud service somewhere.\n\n50\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.606\nWell, now when you start talking\nabout the protection of the data,\n\n51\n00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:31.440\nokay, we can no longer protect\nit at where it resides anymore.\n\n52\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.325\nSo even in my Office 365\ntenancy that I have, okay,\n\n53\n00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:37.230\nand I go, it's stored in OneDrive for\nBusiness.\n\n54\n00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.025\nThat sounds great, Zach,\nI trust OneDrive for Business.\n\n55\n00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.801\nDo I know anybody that works at OneDrive?\n\n56\n00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:44.515\nNo, I don't know a single\nperson that works at OneDrive.\n\n57\n00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:46.561\nI don't know anybody\nthat works at Microsoft.\n\n58\n00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:48.809\nI'm lying to you, I do know a couple\nof people that work at Microsoft.\n\n59\n00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:49.649\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I bet you do.\n\n60\n00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.821\n&gt;&gt; But what I'm saying is I just\ndon't really know anybody there\n\n61\n00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:54.836\nthat works with that infrastructure.\n\n62\n00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:57.432\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And even if I did, it doesn't mean I\n\n63\n00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:02.122\ncan call the person up and go, hey,\nwhere is my data stored in the cloud?\n\n64\n00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:04.418\nWhere is that file actually\nstored in the cloud?\n\n65\n00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:05.201\n&gt;&gt; The physical location.\n\n66\n00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they can't tell me\nexactly where it's stored.\n\n67\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.198\nAnd in that sense, that means they can't\nput their hand on it to be able to say,\n\n68\n00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:15.400\nit's stored right here and\nI see the hard drive right now.\n\n69\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.160\nNobody else has accessed that data, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.890\nSo rights management fits into\nthis particular arena and realm.\n\n71\n00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.420\nWhere we can protect our data,\nregardless of where it\n\n72\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.580\nmay be on this planet, pretty much,\nis what we're actually talking about.\n\n73\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.570\nAnd the reason why is because of the way\nthat rights management works is it\n\n74\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.030\nactually creates different policies for\nus that go along with the data itself.\n\n75\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.200\nWe can create encryption policies,\nwe can create identity policies as well.\n\n76\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.160\nAnd even authorization policies\nthat go along with the data.\n\n77\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.401\nRemember the example I\nwas just using before.\n\n78\n00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:00.617\nInside of my own network I can run\nthings like the group policy objects and\n\n79\n00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:02.225\ngroup policy management.\n\n80\n00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:07.250\nWell, that means it's dependent upon\nthe infrastructure that I have set up.\n\n81\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.330\nBut in rights management though,\nI'm actually saying we take\n\n82\n00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.750\nall those different policies and\nwe attach them to the data itself.\n\n83\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.780\nSo that if something were to happen,\nit automatically locks it down, okay,\n\n84\n00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.430\nto where it has to maintain contact\nwith the actual infrastructure\n\n85\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.050\nbefore you can actually use those\npolicies to get access to them as well.\n\n86\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.550\nSo it really does help in this sense,\nokay, that now,\n\n87\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.860\nregardless of where it resides, okay,\nand when we start talking about that,\n\n88\n00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.820\nwe have that basic protection to do so,\nokay?\n\n89\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.380\n&gt;&gt; So another question then for\nyou though, Ronnie,\n\n90\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.670\nis with all the other protections in\nplace, firewalls, whatnot, policies and\n\n91\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.110\nthat sort of thing, why would we even\nneed the Azure Rights Management?\n\n92\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Well, the reason why we need it today\nis not only because of where we tend to\n\n93\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.600\nstore data, okay, but it's also where\nour users also tend to store data.\n\n94\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.617\nWell, remember that today's world,\nright, especially in networking and\n\n95\n00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:08.220\nbusiness networking, we not only\nallow devices that we authorize.\n\n96\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.596\nAt one point it's just workstations,\nright?\n\n97\n00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.189\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n98\n00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.501\n&gt;&gt; You come, you sit at your cubicle or\nyou sit in your office,\n\n99\n00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.697\nthat machine is joined to the network.\n\n100\n00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:19.681\nAnd we can set whatever policies we want\non there and make sure that they really\n\n101\n00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:23.873\ndon't have that much control or they have\nas much control as we want to give them.\n\n102\n00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.627\nBut what about their smartphone, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:29.880\nWhat about tablets that they\nbring onto our network?\n\n104\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.940\nWhat if they're checking their email\nusing the tablet or using the smartphone?\n\n105\n00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.645\nThere's no control on those devices, okay.\n\n106\n00:05:36.645 --> 00:05:39.520\nWhat about my Mac computer\nsitting right here?\n\n107\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.100\nAnd I'm using email on that system.\n\n108\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.007\nIs there any real protection as far as\nthe controls that we've just been talking\n\n109\n00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:48.763\nabout that are pretty much\ninside of that environment?\n\n110\n00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:50.932\nNo, it doesn't exist.\n\n111\n00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:55.216\nSo the reason why we might choose\nthis is that the data resides in many\n\n112\n00:05:55.216 --> 00:05:56.504\ndifferent places.\n\n113\n00:05:56.504 --> 00:05:57.385\n&gt;&gt; Multiple places.\n\n114\n00:05:57.385 --> 00:06:01.643\n&gt;&gt; So not just in protected storage like\nwhat we might see in OneDrive, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:01.643 --> 00:06:04.540\nAnd even though I don't know anybody\nthere, I still want it protected.\n\n116\n00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.800\nBut what about those devices that I\ndon't know what the protection level\n\n117\n00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.760\ncould actually be, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.410\nAnd I don't even know how long it's been\nthere, or where it's actually been, or\n\n119\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.550\nwho's had access to that device.\n\n120\n00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.440\nWell, now it becomes a little\nbit more incumbent upon me\n\n121\n00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.540\nas I start to set up this\nidea of moving toward either\n\n122\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.190\na hybrid environment where I maintain\nsome onsite as well and using the cloud.\n\n123\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.097\nOr fully migrating data from what I\nhave here onsite over to complete\n\n124\n00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:38.262\ncloud storage at some point.\n\n125\n00:06:38.262 --> 00:06:44.646\nI want to make sure the data is protected,\nregardless of where it goes, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:44.646 --> 00:06:46.896\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, makes sense.\n&gt;&gt; So in that sense, that's why,\n\n127\n00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:49.913\nbecause we don't know what\ndevices can access them and\n\n128\n00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:52.990\nwhat devices are gonna\nactually be doing that.\n\n129\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.560\nSo there's a lot of stuff there, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.009\nAccess control,\nsuch as using file permissions and all.\n\n131\n00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:02.788\nThat works until you move it\noff of that one partition, and\n\n132\n00:07:02.788 --> 00:07:04.558\nthen you move it over to another one.\n\n133\n00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:08.540\nSo that doesn't protect you after you\nactually move it off of that partition.\n\n134\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.333\nIf I move files off of an NTFS partition,\n\n135\n00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:14.958\nagain that sounded weird in\nmy mind when I said that.\n\n136\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.009\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That gives you that ability to set\n\n137\n00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:18.290\nthose permissions.\n\n138\n00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.601\nWhat if I moved them over to another\ndrive or to a USB thumb drive that only\n\n139\n00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:29.723\nsupports the file allocation table,\nthe FAT32 files, okay, or file system.\n\n140\n00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:32.467\nWell, that doesn't support any\nof those permissions at all.\n\n141\n00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:33.046\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.590\n&gt;&gt; So now I don't have anything protected.\n\n143\n00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.666\nSo when you start talking about this,\nrights management is a good thing, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:41.944\nAt the same time,\n\n145\n00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:46.554\nis it a hassle if you really want\nto actually try and get the data?\n\n146\n00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:48.567\nYes, and it's designed to be that way.\n\n147\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:50.755\nIt's not designed to make it easy for\n\n148\n00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:55.132\nanybody that is trying to get access\nto the data that doesn't follow along\n\n149\n00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:58.731\nthe lines Of being the identity\nthat we said that they are, or\n\n150\n00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:03.560\nI've actually having access to it when\nthey shouldn't have access to it.\n\n151\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.550\nSo it is designed to be very painful, for\nsomebody to essentially break through.\n\n152\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.710\nNow, does that does mean it can't be done?\n\n153\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.250\nNo, just in this, today's world,\nwe just can't believe it, but\n\n154\n00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.570\neverybody's working towards\nsome way to crack it.\n\n155\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.730\nBut at least at this point.\n\n156\n00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.600\nIt really does help out\nas far as all files go.\n\n157\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.820\nAll of us have dealt with\nthis in some way or another,\n\n158\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.920\nespecially if you've downloaded,\nyou bought an album off of whatever,\n\n159\n00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.400\nAmazon or the Google Play Store,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n160\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.620\nIf you done that,\nit kinda locks it to your use account so,\n\n161\n00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.810\nZach he even lied down let it on my phone\nand I said, hey, here's a copy of it Zach.\n\n162\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.980\nUnless it's actually legally shared out\nin that way and your supposed to have it.\n\n163\n00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.416\nYou can have those files on your phone,\nbut it may not play.\n\n164\n00:08:51.416 --> 00:08:54.272\nAnd that's really part of that\nrights management system as well.\n\n165\n00:08:54.272 --> 00:08:58.020\nNow let's not talking about Azure\nrights management to that specific one.\n\n166\n00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.760\nBut that's that digital rights management,\nfor music management and stuff like that.\n\n167\n00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So it can do that, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.957\nWe can actually have stuff\nlike that that goes on.\n\n169\n00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:10.221\nBut that's exactly what\nwe're really focusing in on,\n\n170\n00:09:10.221 --> 00:09:14.392\nto essentially give us a nutshell\nof why we need it, and\n\n171\n00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:17.586\nof course the idea of what it actually is.\n\n172\n00:09:17.586 --> 00:09:20.212\n&gt;&gt; And one more thing,\nhow do we activate it?\n\n173\n00:09:20.212 --> 00:09:25.669\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's another great question\ntoo, especially inside of Office 365.\n\n174\n00:09:25.669 --> 00:09:29.193\nSo there's a couple of different\nthings that you have to be able to do,\n\n175\n00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:31.070\nto make sure that it's done.\n\n176\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.540\nAnd one of course is you have to\nconfigure the Office 365 side.\n\n177\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.820\nAnd what I mean by that,\nis going into the Office Portal itself.\n\n178\n00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.300\nAnd then, making sure it's turned on and\n\n179\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.670\nmaking sure that you have\naccess to what you need.\n\n180\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.120\nAnd then of course the administration\nside of it though,\n\n181\n00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.840\nis not normally from the interface\ninside of Office 365.\n\n182\n00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.720\nThere's two different ways to do that,\nI want to\n\n183\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.290\ntake a look at just the basic setup\non the administration side right now.\n\n184\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.150\nIf you're looking at it from\nthe standpoint of the end user and\n\n185\n00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.720\nhow it affects them, take a look\nat the 70.347 show that we did,\n\n186\n00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.610\nand we'll see how it affects the end\nuser at that particular point instead.\n\n187\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.890\nSo that's where you'll go and find out.\n\n188\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:23.441\nSo let's go ahead and see if I can get\naccess into our Office portal here.\n\n189\n00:10:26.287 --> 00:10:29.326\nSo as I sign in, I'm gonna sign in as\nthe tenant administrator right now,\n\n190\n00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:30.960\nwhich is gonna be Cherokee.\n\n191\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.579\nAnd type in her super-long\npassword at this point.\n\n192\n00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:34.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Here we go again.\n\n193\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.760\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nThere is no ending to this password.\n\n194\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:45.220\nBut it is worth it, because it is\nactually going to be publicized here.\n\n195\n00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.910\nSo I wanted to make sure there's\nactually a fairly complex password,\n\n196\n00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.820\nit's weird right?\n\n197\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.450\nWhen you hear people say that, no people\ncan actually, by hearing the click over\n\n198\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.270\nthe microphone, they can tell\nwhat keys that you're pressing.\n\n199\n00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.440\nI did not know that,\n\n200\n00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.290\nbut apparently there are people smart\nenough to do even stuff like that.\n\n201\n00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.670\n&gt;&gt; That is crazy.\n\n202\n00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.670\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nGo figure.\n\n203\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.087\nWell, if the one that I just-\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a Q to me.\n\n204\n00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:07.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n205\n00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.886\nIf the one that I just typed in somehow\nspelled out Oreo cookies are good,\n\n206\n00:11:12.886 --> 00:11:13.910\nyou're wrong.\n\n207\n00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.740\nI didn't even type anywhere close to that.\n\n208\n00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.830\nBut you can kind of figure it out there,\nokay?\n\n209\n00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.160\nBut it was a relatively long one.\n\n210\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.750\nSo, if you're able to hear every single\nclick there and you're able to do that.\n\n211\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.610\nThen, yeah,\nI can't stop you from getting it.\n\n212\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.105\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe name Pan the Monkey was not in there.\n\n213\n00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:27.910\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n214\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as far as Zack\nknows it wasn't there, okay.\n\n215\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.358\n&gt;&gt; Ow yeah.\n\n216\n00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:36.761\n&gt;&gt; So now, [LAUGH] let's take a look\nat where we setup this Rise management.\n\n217\n00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:41.267\nSo the place that we're going to head\ninto once we log in as Cherokee,\n\n218\n00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:43.221\nis gonna be the admin center.\n\n219\n00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:44.685\nSo I'm gonna start with the admin tile.\n\n220\n00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:49.400\nAnd then once that comes up,\nit's going to give me the admin center.\n\n221\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.120\nNow once I'm in the admin center, over on\nthe left-hand side in navigation pane,\n\n222\n00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.600\nI'm going to scroll down to settings.\n\n223\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.897\nAnd in the settings grouping here,\nI'm looking for services and add-ins.\n\n224\n00:12:05.897 --> 00:12:09.410\nSo I'm gonna select services and add-ins.\n\n225\n00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:10.950\nAnd instead of services and add-ins,\n\n226\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.380\nnotice that there are a bunch of different\nservices that are listed right down here,\n\n227\n00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:21.970\nand what you might think is that we're\nlooking for Azure Rights Management.\n\n228\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.020\nSo if I scroll down through here\non this list of different things.\n\n229\n00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.390\nSo that's close.\n\n230\n00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.350\nAzure and multi factor authentication.\n\n231\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.835\nAnd I have at least Azure up here.\n\n232\n00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:35.876\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; As I scroll down through here, Cortana,\n\n233\n00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:38.468\ndirectly synchronization,\n\n234\n00:12:38.468 --> 00:12:43.358\nDots dynamic,customer insights,\nintegrated mail.\n\n235\n00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:45.200\nLet me scroll back up here.\n\n236\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.660\nI apparently went too\nfast at some of them.\n\n237\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.980\nThere we go.\nLet me go back here.\n\n238\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.130\nLet's see.\n\n239\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.290\nAzure information protection,\nMicrosoft forms,\n\n240\n00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.610\nMicrosoft teams, Zack, it looks like\nthat is not in this list at all.\n\n241\n00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.403\n&gt;&gt; Unless, it has a different name.\n\n242\n00:13:02.403 --> 00:13:02.961\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n243\n00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:07.119\nthis is actually something that we want\nto make sure that we understand as well.\n\n244\n00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:14.075\nSo, even though, I've called it Azure\nactive directory writes management.\n\n245\n00:13:14.075 --> 00:13:17.090\nOr azure writes management here.\n\n246\n00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.830\nNotice that in the realm of Office 365,\n\n247\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.620\nwhat you're gonna zoom in on\nunder services and of course,\n\n248\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:29.210\nsettings, excuse me, under settings and\nthen services and add ins, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.460\nIs gonna be the Microsoft\nAzure Information Protection.\n\n250\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.250\nNow, you might be wondering like,\nare you joking me?\n\n251\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.690\nNo, I am not, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.478\nSo, what the heck is going on?\n\n253\n00:13:42.478 --> 00:13:45.703\nWell, this is what Office 365 calls them.\n\n254\n00:13:45.703 --> 00:13:48.568\nBut, remember that this show\nhas two different prong, or\n\n255\n00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:49.921\ntwo different objective.\n\n256\n00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:50.665\n&gt;&gt; Two components.\n\n257\n00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:54.063\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of course it to\nget you ready to work, and\n\n258\n00:13:54.063 --> 00:13:57.340\nbe able to do and\nmanage this type of thing.\n\n259\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.550\nAnd the second one of course is the exam.\n\n260\n00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.530\n&gt;&gt; Pass that exam.\n\n261\n00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:05.450\nAnd on the exam objective for this,\nthey call it as your rights management.\n\n262\n00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.710\nDo you need to know that?\n\n263\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:08.290\nAbsolutely.\n\n264\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:08.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you do.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n265\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.480\nSo, regardless of what it's called\ninside of Office 365 right now?\n\n266\n00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.170\nBe aware and map up or\nlink up Azure Rights Management\n\n267\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.690\nto Microsoft Azure Information Protection.\n\n268\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.520\nSo just drill that into\nyour head at this point.\n\n269\n00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.190\nThat is where we are actually going\nto take a look at the setting.\n\n270\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.100\nSo if I click on\nAzure Information Protection here.\n\n271\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.490\nWell, notice it actually\ngives us a nice detail.\n\n272\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.640\nIt says Azure Information Protection\nright here.\n\n273\n00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.820\nAnd then of course keep\nyour information safe, and\n\n274\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.420\nnotice the way they describe it,\nonline or offline.\n\n275\n00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.140\nSo regardless of whether you're actually\non an online device, one that's connected\n\n276\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.840\nto the internet or offline,\nis saying it can protect your data.\n\n277\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.860\nSo even if you disconnect\nfrom the internet?\n\n278\n00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.375\nYes, it actually can protect your data,\n\n279\n00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:06.050\nand that file can to just let you know,\nor whatever it is that you're accessing.\n\n280\n00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.950\nNo, I can't contact the server which\nmeans you don't have access to this.\n\n281\n00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.630\nSo, too bad for you,\nit's what it actually gets you.\n\n282\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.840\nSo here, with\nMicrosoft Azure Information Protection,\n\n283\n00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.000\nyou can add another layer of protection to\nyour data that you store in Office 365,\n\n284\n00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.490\nthe rules you set to protect your file,\n\n285\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:32.430\nwhether there are viewed using Office\nOnline or downloaded to a users device.\n\n286\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.890\nSound good so far, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:39.770\nThe policies and the encryption let\nyou safely share files and email.\n\n288\n00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.261\nOneDrive and\nsafe guard confidential information,\n\n289\n00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:48.040\nthat sounds like something that\nwe really want to be able to do.\n\n290\n00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.072\nNow, when you take a look here, you might\njust think there's only a close button.\n\n291\n00:15:52.072 --> 00:15:56.326\nBut notice they actually have\nthis link here that says,\n\n292\n00:15:56.326 --> 00:16:01.930\nmanage Microsoft Azure Information\nProtection settings, okay?\n\n293\n00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.620\nWell, if we want to actually set this,\nand get it up and\n\n294\n00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.300\nready to go, this is the link that\nwe are going to choose, okay.\n\n295\n00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.260\nSo that is what we are gonna click next.\n\n296\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.100\nSo there it is.\n\n297\n00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.730\nI've clicked on it and then it brings\nme to, well, now we're getting closer.\n\n298\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.110\nNow, Zach, we take a look.\n\n299\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.750\nNotice that we've been talking about what\nAzure Information Protection, right.\n\n300\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.060\nA couple of screens in a row and\n\n301\n00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.670\nI can see that because of\nthe tab just opened up, right.\n\n302\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.360\nSo if we start right here at the\nbeginning, notice even up in this point,\n\n303\n00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.230\nAzure Information Protection.\n\n304\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:38.800\nLook at the link, the link even says\nAzure Information Protection settings.\n\n305\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.330\nBut then when I clicked on it,\nfinally that, okay?\n\n306\n00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.790\nIs that this point notices it says what?\n\n307\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.690\n&gt;&gt; Azure rights management.\n\n308\n00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit finally says Azure rights management.\n\n309\n00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.180\nNow, you might wanna be like,\nwhat in the world?\n\n310\n00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.700\nWhat's going on with this interface?\n\n311\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.690\n&gt;&gt; What's going on, Ronnie?\n\n312\n00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:58.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is a little bit tricky, right?\n\n313\n00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.310\nOkay, well, things like this\nhappen over Microsoft's time,\n\n314\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.340\nis that they started naming stuff and\nthen they decided to change name.\n\n315\n00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.550\nAnd they changed some of it for\nthe end user but\n\n316\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.390\nthen in the background, there are certain\nthings that they just didn't change.\n\n317\n00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.010\nNow, doesn't mean that it will stay\nlike this, it could, but more and\n\n318\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.100\nlikely eventually.\n\n319\n00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.320\nLike even this screen will get changed,\nin terms of the name, so\n\n320\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.900\nit will end up matching up at some point.\n\n321\n00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.840\nBut you may find out that as soon as\nthey do that, they'll change the other\n\n322\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.410\none because they've decided to give it\nanother name again, and so it does happen.\n\n323\n00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.380\n&gt;&gt; And\nthe main thing here is very important is\n\n324\n00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.810\nit's the Azure rights management that\nyou're gonna focus on and see on the exam.\n\n325\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.203\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n\n326\n00:17:39.203 --> 00:17:42.720\nSo don't think that this is unusual, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.330\nSo for someone, and I don't know if this\nis how you watch the episode or not.\n\n328\n00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.350\nBut let's say that you kind of thought the\nvery beginning when I was talking a lot,\n\n329\n00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.885\nokay, it got really boring so\nyou kinda zoomed ahead.\n\n330\n00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:56.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, you kinda heard me\n\n331\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.060\nsay hey, we've been talking about\nAzure Information Protection,\n\n332\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.010\nand then the screen's flipped\nover to rights management.\n\n333\n00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.280\nYou're not seeing things.\n\n334\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.590\nIt literally, actually did that.\n\n335\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.820\nSo it wasn't that we\nspliced together anything.\n\n336\n00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.090\nThis is exactly how it appears inside\nof the Office 365 Center, okay,\n\n337\n00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.260\nas we start seeing this.\n\n338\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.068\nThe right management currently\nis not activated, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:22.030\nRights manager that safeguards\nyour email and documents,\n\n340\n00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.220\nhelps you securely share this\ndata with your colleagues.\n\n341\n00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.470\nAnd that's important, okay.\n\n342\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.690\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Go share your data with\n\n343\n00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.220\nyour colleagues.\n\n344\n00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.910\nSo enable Rights Management,\nclick activate.\n\n345\n00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.160\nNow, Zach, that seems that's\ngotta be the thing to do.\n\n346\n00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.390\n&gt;&gt; That's straightforward.\n\n347\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.830\n&gt;&gt; When we actually end up seeing this.\n\n348\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.990\nNow, in this particular activation,\n\n349\n00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.090\nwe're not really activating everything,\nthough, okay?\n\n350\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.710\nI know that that sounds weird.\n\n351\n00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.850\nIt is kind of the most basic of\nthe protection that we can do.\n\n352\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.890\nIf you need more granularity and\nmore fine tuning\n\n353\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:58.000\nin terms of how this is gonna work and\nmuch more control behind us.\n\n354\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.820\nNotice that directly underneath,\nwhere it says activate,\n\n355\n00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.940\nit says additional configuration, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.750\nUp in this point everything that we're\ndoing is part of your Office 365,\n\n357\n00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.269\nbasic subscription that job-\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n358\n00:19:12.269 --> 00:19:13.842\nyou'd downgrade your subscription,\nwouldn't you?\n\n359\n00:19:13.842 --> 00:19:16.850\n&gt;&gt; So, it may be, okay, but\nwhat we're actually seeing here\n\n360\n00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.350\nis if you need that and this is what\nZach is talking about right here, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.210\nSo notice there is, let me get that more\nonto the screen a little bit, there we go.\n\n362\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.743\nOkay, you can configure\nadvanced features for\n\n363\n00:19:28.743 --> 00:19:31.462\nrights management using Microsoft Azure.\n\n364\n00:19:31.462 --> 00:19:33.430\nSounds great, sounds wonderful.\n\n365\n00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.900\n&gt;&gt; Yay!\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yay!\n\n366\n00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.190\nYou don't have an Azure\nsubscription [LAUGH] look at that.\n\n367\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.640\n&gt;&gt; Boom!\n&gt;&gt; They went ahead and bolded that one.\n\n368\n00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.270\nYou don't have one.\n\n369\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.740\nWell, before you do that,\nsign up for a free trail.\n\n370\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.610\nNow notice, Zach,\nit doesn't say free trial forever.\n\n371\n00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.487\nOkay, the 30 days, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:51.770\nSo what does that mean at\nthe end of 30 days, Zach?\n\n373\n00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:52.675\n&gt;&gt; It's time to pay.\n\n374\n00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:55.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's time to pay the piper.\n\n375\n00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nit's actually an incredible ploy I get.\n\n376\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.680\nI don't want to call it a ploy cuz\nthat sounds like there is something\n\n377\n00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.570\ninsidious about it.\n\n378\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.595\nBut it's a way to get you to\nuse the product and so what.\n\n379\n00:20:07.595 --> 00:20:10.780\nComf with it so Zach here does 30 days\nyou've been using it, and it's going so\n\n380\n00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.870\nwell.\n\n381\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.340\nAnd now you get the little warning that\npops up, you've been in your trial for\n\n382\n00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.090\n29 days.\n\n383\n00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.416\nDo you want it to continue to\nprotect your data in this way?\n\n384\n00:20:20.416 --> 00:20:23.877\nAnd then there's a link, of course,\nin that email, they're saying,\n\n385\n00:20:23.877 --> 00:20:25.484\nto purchase your subscription.\n\n386\n00:20:25.484 --> 00:20:27.010\nWhat is Zach going to do?\n\n387\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.580\n&gt;&gt; Purchase it.\n\n388\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.440\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna purchase it.\n\n389\n00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's pretty much what it is.\n\n390\n00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.720\nHe's already got you for 30 days, why not?\n\n391\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.700\nBecause you've already been doing that.\n\n392\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.590\nSo that's actually what you see there.\n\n393\n00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.350\nNow, we're not gonna worry about\nthis advanced feature though, okay?\n\n394\n00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:42.510\nCuz I'm not gonna sign up for\na 30-day free trail at this point.\n\n395\n00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.250\nI may later on, but for right now,\nnow, let me go instead and\n\n396\n00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.700\njust select activate.\n\n397\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.250\nAnd now, it didn't activate it yet, Zach.\n\n398\n00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.730\nLook at that, I click a button\nthat actually gives me a verb,\n\n399\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.155\nwhich I love verbs, right?\n\n400\n00:20:57.155 --> 00:20:57.940\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, but\n\n401\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.550\nit's actually led me to\nanother question here, okay?\n\n402\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.930\n&gt;&gt; It's not what you think,\nit's what you do.\n\n403\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.645\n&gt;&gt; I know, it was so weird, right?\n\n404\n00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:06.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when you activate Rights Management,\n\n405\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.070\nyour organization can start to\nprotect important documents and\n\n406\n00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.790\nemails using Azure RMS, okay?\n\n407\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.640\nRights management service,\nI'm sure you understand that there, okay?\n\n408\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.240\nRights management service.\n\n409\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.120\nThis information protection solution\nintegrates with applications,\n\n410\n00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.570\nexchange online, SharePoint online.\n\n411\n00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.890\nServers such as Microsoft Exchange and\nSharePoint as well, you name it.\n\n412\n00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.620\nSo here's, once again,\n\n413\n00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.210\nkinda some of the duplication that they\nprobably didn't mean to happen, okay?\n\n414\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.720\nBut, it was just the original way it did\nand then finally, they ran out of verbs,\n\n415\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.272\nI guess.\n\n416\n00:21:42.272 --> 00:21:45.011\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They couldn't do something\n\n417\n00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:48.770\nlike to authorize activation or\nsomething like that.\n\n418\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.450\nThey had to do activate right here,\nand then activate again.\n\n419\n00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.670\nSo we have to do a double activation,\nokay.\n\n420\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.190\nNow, does that actually turn off stuff\nwhen you do a double activation?\n\n421\n00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.070\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n&gt;&gt; When you activate and then activate,\n\n422\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.945\nno, I don't know, okay.\n\n423\n00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.230\n&gt;&gt; Just make certain you've activated it.\n\n424\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.205\n&gt;&gt; So here's where you get the green check\nmark which proves that you do have rights\n\n425\n00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:09.390\nmanagement activated, okay.\n\n426\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:14.800\nAnd that everything at this point\non the Office 365 side, okay,\n\n427\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.403\nis pretty much set up as far as just\nthe basic activation that rights manager.\n\n428\n00:22:22.403 --> 00:22:24.271\nNow what does this do for the end unit.\n\n429\n00:22:24.271 --> 00:22:28.370\nWell, let me just describe that for\njust a minute or so here, okay?\n\n430\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.086\nOnce we have this set up, if now,\n\n431\n00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:36.131\nZach has downloaded the Office\n2016 to his own computer,\n\n432\n00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:40.315\nokay, and\nhe has installed Office 2016 on it.\n\n433\n00:22:40.315 --> 00:22:44.010\nWe'll end up seeing that when he\nruns like Word or whatever it is.\n\n434\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.540\nIt will give him a protection option for\nall of the data that he has there.\n\n435\n00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.530\nAnd he'll actually be able to enable\nit on the documents that he absolutely\n\n436\n00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.670\nwants to make sure.\n\n437\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.156\nSo even if Zach is actually saying,\nI want this but\n\n438\n00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:00.896\nI wanna store it on my OneDrive online.\n\n439\n00:23:00.896 --> 00:23:02.240\nOkay, he can do that.\n\n440\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.920\nZach decides to share out that file\nbecause he thinks it's the greatest short\n\n441\n00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.520\nstory that he's every written or\na screen play that he's written.\n\n442\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.850\nAnd he wants to share that\nwith somebody else but\n\n443\n00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.190\nhe wants to protect it from being copied.\n\n444\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.510\nHe wants to protect it from being printed.\n\n445\n00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.470\nHe wants to ensure that it's only\ngoing to go to this one person that he\n\n446\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.780\nemails it to and it's not gonna be\nable to get shared out to everybody.\n\n447\n00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.150\nHe can even do stuff like that.\n\n448\n00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.470\nNow, that may come underneath\nthe additional configuration here.\n\n449\n00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.410\nBut he can actually do stuff like that,\nokay?\n\n450\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.230\nSo the end user has that type of control,\n\n451\n00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.078\nonce we get the rights management stuff\nall set up the way that we want to, okay?\n\n452\n00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:42.060\nSo, that's what the end user result\nwon't end up essentially being.\n\n453\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.988\nIf you get everything set up\nthe way that you really want, okay?\n\n454\n00:23:45.988 --> 00:23:51.046\nNow, once this is done, notice,\nZach, there really isn't an option or\n\n455\n00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:55.711\na feature here For any other\nadministration or management, okay?\n\n456\n00:23:55.711 --> 00:23:58.183\n&gt;&gt; Mm-mh, mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So here it is, all right so\n\n457\n00:23:58.183 --> 00:24:02.860\nI just turn it on and\nhow I am supposed to configure it?\n\n458\n00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.820\nWhat if I didn't want\nthe global administrator\n\n459\n00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.070\nto be the one to manage all this, right?\n\n460\n00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.198\nSo up here, Cherokee,\nwhat if I didn't want her,\n\n461\n00:24:11.198 --> 00:24:13.682\nwhat if I wanted to actually\nhand that off to somebody else?\n\n462\n00:24:13.682 --> 00:24:16.041\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Well this is where, instead,\n\n463\n00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:20.993\nyou will have to actually control this\nfrom your particular own services on\n\n464\n00:24:20.993 --> 00:24:22.900\nyour network, okay?\n\n465\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.760\nAnd that means that you're gonna be on\na machine that is probably gonna be\n\n466\n00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.196\nconnected to your own domain, so\nthis is a domain joined machine here.\n\n467\n00:24:31.196 --> 00:24:35.520\nAnd then you are going to need to download\na couple of different components to\n\n468\n00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.610\nhelp you out.\n\n469\n00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.120\nWhich is,\nI don't wanna say sad to say,, okay,\n\n470\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.610\na little bit challenging for some people.\n\n471\n00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.199\nWhich is gonna be, of course,\n\n472\n00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:48.020\nusing PowerShell to do some\nof the management, okay.\n\n473\n00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n474\n00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:53.114\n&gt;&gt; And yeah, there is not a big GUI\ninterface, a graphical user interface, for\n\n475\n00:24:53.114 --> 00:24:55.840\nyou to just point and\nclick and do all this stuff\n\n476\n00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.790\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n477\n00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.780\n&gt;&gt; A lot of this has to be\ndone through PowerShell.\n\n478\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.652\nNow, we're not gonna give you a full\nfledged rights management administration\n\n479\n00:25:04.652 --> 00:25:06.310\ncourse here, okay?\n\n480\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.340\nWe're just gonna show you\na few of the basics but\n\n481\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.410\nlet's start by doing this here, okay?\n\n482\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.720\nLet's show you what you have to\nmake sure that you download and\n\n483\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.750\nget ready to install, okay?\n\n484\n00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.980\nThere's a few components here and\none of the first ones is gonna be\n\n485\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.100\nthe Azure Rights Management\nAdministration Tool, okay?\n\n486\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.650\nWithout this, it doesn't work at all.\n\n487\n00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.010\nYou don't even have the components.\n\n488\n00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:32.790\nYou can try and\ntype in the commands that you need to,\n\n489\n00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.110\nthe commands aren't gonna show, okay?\n\n490\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:39.520\nSo you need the Azure Rights\nManagement Administration Tool, okay?\n\n491\n00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.610\nNow we'll include the links inside\nof the show notes for this show.\n\n492\n00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.099\nBut just in case, let me do this as well.\n\n493\n00:25:46.099 --> 00:25:54.319\nLet me, Let me zoom in right here on\nthe URL just for a brief moment, okay.\n\n494\n00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:57.967\nSo that will give you a little bit of time\nmaybe if you wanna screenshot this as you\n\n495\n00:25:57.967 --> 00:26:00.532\nare watching this,\ninstead of trying to write it down.\n\n496\n00:26:00.532 --> 00:26:01.246\n&gt;&gt; Kinda shrewd idea, by the way.\n\n497\n00:26:01.246 --> 00:26:05.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good idea, so\nyou can actually download that, okay.\n\n498\n00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.360\nSo you get that downloaded,\n\n499\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.710\nthat's actually one of the components\nthat you actually want.\n\n500\n00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:14.674\nThe other one offers you some guidance\nbecause we're actually gonna be running\n\n501\n00:26:14.674 --> 00:26:16.696\nthis inside of PowerShell here, okay.\n\n502\n00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:18.573\n&gt;&gt; Inline stuff.\n&gt;&gt; Inside of PowerShell,\n\n503\n00:26:18.573 --> 00:26:22.079\nlet me go ahead and zoom in on\nthis one as well just briefly and\n\n504\n00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:24.338\nthen we'll talk about it too, okay.\n\n505\n00:26:24.338 --> 00:26:29.192\nSo this particular link right\nhere will also help you out to\n\n506\n00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:33.170\nmanage Office 365 well, with PowerShell.\n\n507\n00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:38.119\nNow,remember, we're not\nreally deep diving into this\n\n508\n00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:41.940\ninside of Office 365 for 70-347.\n\n509\n00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.462\nWe do this over and\nover and over again, okay,\n\n510\n00:26:44.462 --> 00:26:47.889\nto the nth degree to where you're\ngonna memorize the process,\n\n511\n00:26:47.889 --> 00:26:52.650\nI guarantee you, you'll memorize the very\nbeginning and the opening of this.\n\n512\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.090\nBut once you get there,\nit gives you some guidance.\n\n513\n00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.402\nGetting started with Office 365,\nPowerShell, you name it and\n\n514\n00:27:00.402 --> 00:27:04.160\nyou select that, oops,\nwhere did I want to go here?\n\n515\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.030\nOn the PowerShell,\nlet me select that link.\n\n516\n00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.408\nTrying to make sure I lead you\nto the right place, there we go.\n\n517\n00:27:11.408 --> 00:27:12.050\nWell, where's the link?\n\n518\n00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.890\nLet's select that one instead.\n\n519\n00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.520\nAt some point that's gonna give me,\nall right, there we go.\n\n520\n00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.450\nYou want to connect to\nOffice 365 PowerShell.\n\n521\n00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:26.950\nSo of course it tells you what you need\nbut what we want is right here in Step 1.\n\n522\n00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.220\nOkay, install the required software.\n\n523\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.617\nSo along with what I just\nshowed you in the previous tab,\n\n524\n00:27:32.617 --> 00:27:35.594\nmake sure you download these two as well,\nokay.\n\n525\n00:27:35.594 --> 00:27:39.270\nThe 64 bit version cuz that's\nprobably what you'll end up running.\n\n526\n00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.380\nThe Microsoft Online Services Sign-in\nAssistant, and here's a link for it, okay?\n\n527\n00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.420\nAnd then also, of course, the Azure\nActive Directory Module for PowerShell.\n\n528\n00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.870\nAnd it gives you step-by-steps on how to\ndo this and download this as well, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.791\nAnd then in the end when\nyou're ready to start,\n\n530\n00:27:57.791 --> 00:28:02.408\nyou of course can then open a window and\nthen start actually connecting in.\n\n531\n00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:06.091\nAnd we are actually going to do this,\nat least in the beginning here,\n\n532\n00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:09.660\nto show some of the administration\nprocess that we are going to do.\n\n533\n00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.880\nBut I've already downloaded this and\n\n534\n00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.731\nessentially installed these utilities for\nus.\n\n535\n00:28:14.731 --> 00:28:19.375\nSo that means we're just about ready to\nget started to show you some of these\n\n536\n00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:20.870\nPowerShell commands.\n\n537\n00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.470\nBut Zach, it looks like that I\nhave actually run out of time.\n\n538\n00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:26.621\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say, is it possible\nwe could go to a part two, Ronnie?\n\n539\n00:28:26.621 --> 00:28:30.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are going to have to\nbecause I have absolutely done that.\n\n540\n00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.906\nAnd we definitely need to at least take\na look at the basic administration\n\n541\n00:28:33.906 --> 00:28:36.030\nhere using PowerShell to do this.\n\n542\n00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.770\nAnd this is a great spot for\nus because it is a perfect timing as well.\n\n543\n00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.610\n&gt;&gt; Marvelous, great job again, Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.320\nAnd Administer Azure Rights Management\npart two coming your way.\n\n545\n00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.555\nThanks for watching part one.\n\n546\n00:28:46.555 --> 00:28:50.870\nAnd see everything in the Office\n365 series, it's good for you.\n\n547\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.020\nHelp you with the exam,\ngood for the brain too.\n\n548\n00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.820\nAnd make sure you visit\nour course library.\n\n549\n00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.701\nThere's hundreds of videos there and\nthey are all designed for one purpose,\n\n550\n00:28:58.701 --> 00:28:59.905\nto help you go further.\n\n551\n00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:03.079\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n552\n00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:05.695\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos,\n&gt;&gt;

Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:16.262\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.628\nI'm your host Zach Memos and\nthis is Office 365,\n\n7\n00:00:19.628 --> 00:00:24.160\nand this is part two of\nAdminister Azure Rights Management.\n\n8\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.285\nAnd Ronnie Wong is on board to\nshow us the rest of the way,\n\n9\n00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.320\nRonnie good to have you here sir.\n\n10\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.201\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back\non board as we continue to take\n\n11\n00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:35.563\na look at this idea of administering\nAzure rights management, and\n\n12\n00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:39.241\nwe're at this part where we have to\ndo a little bit more administration.\n\n13\n00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:44.021\nIn the previous episode we did\nshow you how you ensure that it\n\n14\n00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.514\nwill work with Office 365.\n\n15\n00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:49.895\nSo there was of course the Office\n365 side that was set up, and\n\n16\n00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:53.160\nshowed you what is just simply\na button click that we had to do.\n\n17\n00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.936\nBut finding it might be a little bit\nchallenging since the names have changed\n\n18\n00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:59.064\nover time, so you might find that as well.\n\n19\n00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:02.644\nAnd also remember that if you\nneed more granular control and\n\n20\n00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:06.868\nmore detail that might be an upsell\ninside of Office 365 as well, so\n\n21\n00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:10.315\ndon't be surprised [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But you have a free 30 day trial.\n\n22\n00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:11.296\n&gt;&gt; Yes you do, yeah, and\n\n23\n00:01:11.296 --> 00:01:14.731\nthat again will help as long as you're\nwilling to give that up after 30 days.\n\n24\n00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.459\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n25\n00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.853\n&gt;&gt; So that is something else, too.\n\n26\n00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:21.087\nNow remember that the other side of this,\nright,\n\n27\n00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:25.861\nis that after we do enable it and we need\nto start to administrate it a little\n\n28\n00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:30.690\nbit more it's not gonna be done\nusing the Office 365 portal.\n\n29\n00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.046\nSo if I don't have anything that\nallows me to administer rights\n\n30\n00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:39.250\nmanagement there where do I go\nto do this as an organization?\n\n31\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.842\nWell it means you'll actually\nhave to connect in Office 365 and\n\n32\n00:01:43.842 --> 00:01:47.871\nof course Azure rights\nmanagement using the PowerShell.\n\n33\n00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:53.332\nAnd so at the end of a previous episode we\nshowed you utilities that you will have\n\n34\n00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:59.290\nto download and install on your Windows\nmachine to make this work for you, okay.\n\n35\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.030\nSo let's kind of review that for\na moment and then we'll proceed on here.\n\n36\n00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.002\nSo one of the things that we did as we\ntake a look at the computer screen is that\n\n37\n00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:11.060\nwe downloaded of course the Azure\nRights Management Administration tool.\n\n38\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.030\nAnd I downloaded it and\n\n39\n00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.920\nsimply followed the instructions\nas it asked me to install.\n\n40\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.800\nIt really wasn't exactly a gigantic\nbig celebration of anything,\n\n41\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.450\nin the end it didn't seem like\nit did anything spectacular.\n\n42\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.730\nBut in the background it really did load\nin the additional tools that I need to,\n\n43\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.970\nthe commands that I needed to, so\n\n44\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.661\nI can run some of the other\nthings I need as well, okay.\n\n45\n00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:39.950\nThe other thing that we also\ntook guidance from of course,\n\n46\n00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.179\nis this link right here where it shows us\nto connect to the Office 365 PowerShell.\n\n47\n00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:50.088\nRemember that, in both of those episodes\nI did kind of leave the screen up and\n\n48\n00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:52.370\nallowed you to take\na look at the link there.\n\n49\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.540\nAnd these will also be in the show notes\nas well so you'll be able to follow them.\n\n50\n00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.450\nAnd we wanted to make sure that\nyou saw step number one here,\n\n51\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.380\ninstalling the required software, so\n\n52\n00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.720\ntwo additional pieces of software,\nthree altogether, okay.\n\n53\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.440\nThe Azure Rights Management Administration\ntools as well as\n\n54\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.280\nthe Microsoft Online Services Sign-in\nAssistant, make sure that happens.\n\n55\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.790\nAnd then of course even\nthe Azure Active Directory Module for\n\n56\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.960\nWindows PowerShell, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.140\nAnd there's a link right here that\nwill lead you to the right place, and\n\n58\n00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.400\nthen you'll download the proper\nconfiguration tool and\n\n59\n00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.430\nthat will allow you to install that.\n\n60\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.330\nNow once all of that is installed, and\n\n61\n00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.210\nwhich I already have done here,\nyou should end up with this icon and\n\n62\n00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.440\nyou'll see the name of that module and\nthe link to the module there.\n\n63\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.485\nThat's a pretty long name here,\n\n64\n00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:48.580\nright, Microsoft Azure Active Directory\nModule for Windows PowerShell.\n\n65\n00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.780\n&gt;&gt; Well you can't miss that though,\ncan you?\n\n66\n00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.825\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not exactly an easy\none to ever kind of forget there.\n\n67\n00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:58.446\nSo you'll get that particular\ninstallation right there, so\n\n68\n00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.892\nthat is the one we are going to run, okay.\n\n69\n00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:05.279\nNow is there PowerShell built in this,\nyes, this is a Server 2016 machine.\n\n70\n00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.932\nBut this one is specially,\nagain, designed for\n\n71\n00:04:07.932 --> 00:04:10.846\ngoing to the Azure Active Directory\nmodule instead,\n\n72\n00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.423\nwhich means it loads up the tools\nthat it needs to in there for you.\n\n73\n00:04:14.423 --> 00:04:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n74\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.450\n&gt;&gt; So I'm going to right click and\nselect Run as administrator, and\n\n75\n00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.150\nclick Yes here, okay.\n\n76\n00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.560\nNow previously I've gone ahead and\n\n77\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.495\nmade sure that the font size was large\nenough for us to see, and so that's why\n\n78\n00:04:28.495 --> 00:04:33.100\nyou're actually seeing it in the size\nthat you're seeing it in right now, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.306\nNow once we've got this all set up\nthe way that we've showed you, and\n\n80\n00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.790\nI've full screened this so\nthat we can see it a little bit better,\n\n81\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.160\nis that we need to import in\na couple of modules here.\n\n82\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.440\nSo if I do an import dash module, now I've\nonly partially spelled out module and\n\n83\n00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.140\nI used the tab auto complete that allows\nit to auto fill in the right commands.\n\n84\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.150\nMy suggestion is that you use that,\n\n85\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.760\nokay, because you at least\nknow it's the proper syntax.\n\n86\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.280\nIf you hit it part way through and it\ndoesn't try and add in a couple letters,\n\n87\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.131\nand once it actually gets to a point of\nunambiguousness, I know that sounds weird,\n\n88\n00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:12.496\nin other words it can\nidentify what the command is,\n\n89\n00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:14.860\nit will automatically fill it in for you.\n\n90\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.480\nThere are some commands\nthat are insanely long so\n\n91\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.390\nI like using the auto complete\nitself to make it work, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.988\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n93\n00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:27.807\n&gt;&gt; So here I'm gonna do MS online,\nso notice that I've got partial and\n\n94\n00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:31.626\nthen I'm hitting the tab key here,\nand now notice it filled it in and\n\n95\n00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:36.006\nit even put it in the proper case for\nus and made sure that everything was fine.\n\n96\n00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:38.083\nAnd I press Enter, if it accepts it,\n\n97\n00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:42.639\nright away you're not gonna get anything\nthat says you're successful in this,\n\n98\n00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.999\nit just gives you the next line and\nthat's what you're hoping to see, okay.\n\n99\n00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.756\nNow that I've got that there,\nokay, I now need for my machine,\n\n100\n00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:55.282\nthe one that you're actually seeing me\ntype on, to connect essentially up to\n\n101\n00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:59.680\nthe Microsoft online services,\nin other words Office 365.\n\n102\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.120\nAnd the way that we run that there's\na couple of things here, okay.\n\n103\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.620\nI need to actually run a connect command\nand then it's gonna say connect to\n\n104\n00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.900\nthe Microsoft online services, but it's\ngonna ask me for credentials to do so.\n\n105\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.875\nSo before I do that I'm\ngonna create a variable now,\n\n106\n00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.378\nand we'll just call it credentials here or\ncredential.\n\n107\n00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:27.010\nAnd then I'm gonna tell it I want it\nto get credentials or get credential,\n\n108\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.870\nand I again use the PowerShell auto fill\nto help us to do that or auto complete.\n\n109\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.921\nNow inside of this little credential\nrequest window we're gonna actually use\n\n110\n00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:45.064\nour global administrator, that's a part\nof the company ITProTVDemo.com and\n\n111\n00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:49.386\nnow I have to do Cherokee's\nlong insane password here.\n\n112\n00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:55.861\nOops, I just kinda knew I\nmisspelled it right there.\n\n113\n00:06:58.549 --> 00:07:01.620\nAnd this will help us out.\n\n114\n00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.324\nI did it again,\nright at the same place too.\n\n115\n00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:06.834\nThat's what you get for\ntalking here at the same time.\n\n116\n00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.390\nAll right, so\nhopefully I've spelled it correctly.\n\n117\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.700\nNow on that one, right,\n\n118\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.370\nas you do that it's storing inside of RAM,\nyou do need to be careful.\n\n119\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.305\nIf you misspell it it will take it\nanyways, so the only way you'll know is at\n\n120\n00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:32.180\nthe end when we type in the command and\nwe call upon that variable.\n\n121\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.070\nIf it errors out and tells you that\nthere's something wrong with the user name\n\n122\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.050\nor the password then you'll know.\n\n123\n00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.122\nAnd you'll just have to rerun that\ncommand again, the one with the green and\n\n124\n00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:43.055\nthe yellow here, and then enter in\nthe right credentials again, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:49.801\nSo once I've gotten that now\nthe second thing that I wanna do,\n\n126\n00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:56.704\nlike I said, is connect -msol for\nMicrosoft online service.\n\n127\n00:07:56.704 --> 00:08:01.167\nI want a verbose output And\nI want to call upon some credentials, so\n\n128\n00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.092\nit doesn't ask me for them.\n\n129\n00:08:03.092 --> 00:08:09.040\nNow, I'm going to select credential, and\nthen use the variable that I created.\n\n130\n00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.560\nOnce again, using the tab auto fill,\nor auto complete to help us out, okay?\n\n131\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.500\nSo, there it is.\n\n132\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.200\nGreat thing is, it means I typed\nin the credentials correctly.\n\n133\n00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.330\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I'm happy.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am too.\n\n134\n00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.230\nBecause usually there's a big old red\nstain of words there when I normally type.\n\n135\n00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:31.180\nSo it is allowing me to now be connected\ninto those service that we have, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.460\nNow, yes?\n\n137\n00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.900\n&gt;&gt; Just a quick question.\n\n138\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.830\nSo how can we now tell\nwho the RMS admin is?\n\n139\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.210\n&gt;&gt; Well we've still got a little bit to go\nright because I haven't really connected\n\n140\n00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.850\ninto the rights management yet,\nI've connected to Office 365.\n\n141\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.512\nSo now what I need to do is also\nconnect into the rights to management.\n\n142\n00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:52.229\nSo I need to import\nanother module in here.\n\n143\n00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:56.479\nOkay, so import module, and\n\n144\n00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:01.925\nthen from this point is AADRL, okay?\n\n145\n00:09:01.925 --> 00:09:05.560\nShouldn't have used the AADRM, okay?\n\n146\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.570\nIt doesn't have to be capitalized, but\nthat way it is just because of how I held\n\n147\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.560\nmy hand, but the Azure Active Directory\nRights Management and press Enter,\n\n148\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.450\nand notice that it actually accepted\nit right away and that's what we want.\n\n149\n00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; And now we are going to\n\n150\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.470\nconnect to the service again.\n\n151\n00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:27.538\nConnect and this is AADRMService here.\n\n152\n00:09:27.538 --> 00:09:29.909\nAnd do the same thing with verbose.\n\n153\n00:09:29.909 --> 00:09:32.686\nCall upon the same credentials here.\n\n154\n00:09:38.013 --> 00:09:41.320\nAnd now notice, it actually says,\nhere's exactly where you're connected to.\n\n155\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.860\nSo you can see where it\nactually did connect in,\n\n156\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.312\nand it's neat on the URL that you see.\n\n157\n00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:51.300\nadmin.na, probably for North America, and\nthen of course the Azure Active Directory.\n\n158\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.545\nAzure, why can't I say\nwhat I want to here.\n\n159\n00:09:56.545 --> 00:10:01.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Azure act, why can't I?\n\n160\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.800\nActive directory,\n&gt;&gt; And yeah.\n\n161\n00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nRights management.\n\n162\n00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.209\nI don't know why my mind was not actually\nallowing me to say the words I wanted to.\n\n163\n00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:12.701\nSo, we're actually seeing that and\nthere we are, we're connected in and\n\n164\n00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:17.195\nyou can see right there, the service was\nopen and that is the first place and\n\n165\n00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:21.460\nthat's what the verbose command was\ngave us the ability to do, okay?\n\n166\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.447\nSo now that it is open and\nit is ready for some connection,\n\n167\n00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:29.947\nyou may want to go ahead and\nverify a couple of different things.\n\n168\n00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:33.437\nNow inside of Office 365\nwhen we initially set it up,\n\n169\n00:10:33.437 --> 00:10:38.266\nwe went on and activated the active\ndirectory rights management as well, but\n\n170\n00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:41.220\nyou may wanna go ahead and enable it too.\n\n171\n00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.355\nSo if you do an enable-aadrm,\nnotice there it says the rights\n\n172\n00:10:46.355 --> 00:10:51.220\nmanagement service has\nbeen successfully enabled.\n\n173\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.410\nAlthough additional\nconfiguration may be important,\n\n174\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.230\nit gives you a link to go ahead and\ncheck out if you need more guidance.\n\n175\n00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.770\nSo the initial part that we did inside\nof Office 365 was merely activating,\n\n176\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.050\nin other words, turn it on, okay?\n\n177\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.520\nThis one is now enabling\nthe service in the background,\n\n178\n00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.330\nto make sure that it is ready to go.\n\n179\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:19.130\nOkay, now once this is enabled, and we've\nconnected to the directory services here.\n\n180\n00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.590\nThis is not something you want to\ndo very often but you may have to.\n\n181\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:28.190\nIf you need to ever disconnect\nfrom the active directory service,\n\n182\n00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.090\nyou just simply instead do a disconnect.\n\n183\n00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.450\n-aadrmService, if I can spell correctly,\nokay?\n\n184\n00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.600\nAnd that will also disconnect it.\n\n185\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.970\nWe're not gonna worry about disconnecting\nat this particular point, okay?\n\n186\n00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.630\nSo, everything now is kind of set up\nthat we're turning things on, right?\n\n187\n00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.740\nThe activation allowed us, say,\nall right, we're gonna use this.\n\n188\n00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.600\nAnd now we've got it set up to we're\nusing PowerShell, we're connected\n\n189\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.960\nto Office 365, and we're also in\nAzure Active Directory Rights Manager.\n\n190\n00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.060\nAnd both of those connections\nare important because it allows them to be\n\n191\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.680\nable to send commands back and\nforth as well, and\n\n192\n00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.540\nI can actually use this\nparticular single command line.\n\n193\n00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.660\nNow I'm sending commands into\nboth Office 365 as well as\n\n194\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.630\nthe active directory rights\nmanagement too, okay?\n\n195\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.830\nNow at this point,\nZach asked a great question, right?\n\n196\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.570\nSo how do we know who's actually\nadministrating this thing?\n\n197\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.289\nWell right now it shouldn't be anybody\nbecause we didn't assign anybody.\n\n198\n00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:34.983\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But what if we needed to check, okay,\n\n199\n00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:37.006\nand see what was going on here?\n\n200\n00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:42.037\nWell, if I need to do that, I can type in\n\n201\n00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:48.160\nget-aadrmRoleBasedAdministrator, okay?\n\n202\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.480\nSo once again, I got to that point\nwhere I start typing in roll and\n\n203\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.420\nthen I hit the tab.\n\n204\n00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:58.460\nAnd in a moment here, notice it\ndoesn't list a single person, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.720\nSo right now, nobody is actually\nthe administrator of this thing.\n\n206\n00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.300\nSo, what does that mean?\n\n207\n00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.670\nThat means if we need to change stuff,\nokay?\n\n208\n00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.610\nAnd this needs to be done.\n\n209\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.860\nThere's nobody to do this,\n\n210\n00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.330\ncuz nobody's actually been assigned\nthis particular role here, okay?\n\n211\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n212\n00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.370\nthat's actually something that we\nhave to also be able to do, okay?\n\n213\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:25.392\nSo at this point,\nwe wanna do an add-aadrm,\n\n214\n00:13:29.102 --> 00:13:30.800\nRole based administrator.\n\n215\n00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:38.680\nAnd now I can do this, and I'm just going\nto use an email address instead, and\n\n216\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:46.788\nthis time we're going to actually\nuse daniel@itprotvdemo.com, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:46.788 --> 00:13:54.260\nMake sure I have that, and sometimes it\nmay balk at us for one reason or another.\n\n218\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.520\nSo let's see what happens.\n\n219\n00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.315\nEvery once and\na while if I need to include end quotes,\n\n220\n00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:00.400\nI couldn't remember what they were called,\n\n221\n00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.150\nif I need to include end quotes,\nI'll go ahead and do that.\n\n222\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:08.532\nBut right now, let's see if it actually\ntakes it without the quotes right now,\n\n223\n00:14:08.532 --> 00:14:09.600\nand if I press Enter at this point, okay?\n\n224\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.270\nSo now, notice that Daniel was added\nto the list of administrators for\n\n225\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.890\nrights management services.\n\n226\n00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.060\nLet me hit the up arrow a couple of times,\ngo back through the history for\n\n227\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:20.620\nPowerShell.\n\n228\n00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.170\nAnd now you can see, there it is.\n\n229\n00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.230\nWe added Daniel Lowrie right into that\nparticular group, or not group, but\n\n230\n00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.720\ninto, of course the actual administrator\nfor rights management, right?\n\n231\n00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.460\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n232\n00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.340\n&gt;&gt; Now,\nthe other thing that we can do, and\n\n233\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.705\nwe're not really getting into it this far,\nokay?\n\n234\n00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:42.665\nWhat if you didn't want just\na single individual to do this?\n\n235\n00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:48.770\nWell inside of your user management\nconsole or your portal in Office 365,\n\n236\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:53.530\nyou can create a group of users instead,\nokay?\n\n237\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.180\nThat will also allow you to do this too,\nokay?\n\n238\n00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.740\nSo we could actually come up with\nthe aadrm administrator, say, okay?\n\n239\n00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.790\nAnd then add in whoever we wanted to.\n\n240\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.210\nAnd then we could also add in that group.\n\n241\n00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:17.200\nNow I don't have that group so I if do\nan add-aadrmrolebasedadministrator here,\n\n242\n00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.280\ninstead the option would be,\nSecurity group display net.\n\n243\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.740\nNow this is why I'm not actually\ngonna finish the rest of this cuz\n\n244\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.150\nI haven't created the security group,\nokay?\n\n245\n00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.480\nSo there is no display name here.\n\n246\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.680\nBut at the end here I would\nactually go ahead and\n\n247\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.980\nadd in whatever the display name would be.\n\n248\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.890\nAnd that would also allow me to do that.\n\n249\n00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.610\n&gt;&gt; So what would we do or\n\n250\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.640\nhow would we remove someone\nwhen we want to change it out?\n\n251\n00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n252\n00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.581\nNow, there's a couple of things here, and\n\n253\n00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:46.220\nZach is also asked another question,\nright?\n\n254\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.270\nThat's really good.\n\n255\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.129\nIf I already had the host set up, okay?\n\n256\n00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:50.474\nAnd I did that, and I added or\n\n257\n00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:53.064\norder up the IT people or\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n258\n00:15:53.064 --> 00:15:58.717\nOr aadrm administrators, That's probably\nthe best way to go because it means I can\n\n259\n00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:04.225\nand set all this up in background and then\nI simply add Zach into the group, okay?\n\n260\n00:16:04.225 --> 00:16:07.764\nAnd then when I add Zach in the group, he\nbecomes the administrator because he was\n\n261\n00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:10.280\na part of the group that we just set up.\n\n262\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.030\nThe other easy way to remove Zach then is\nto simply remove him out of that group.\n\n263\n00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.110\nThat would be another way to do that.\n\n264\n00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.824\nOf if we wanted to remove,\nlet's say an individual, so\n\n265\n00:16:20.824 --> 00:16:24.154\nhere let's go ahead and\nsay Daniel at this point.\n\n266\n00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:31.930\nWe would just simply type in remove\naadrm role based administrator.\n\n267\n00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.480\nAnd we can do it by email address again.\n\n268\n00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:42.778\nAnd at this point,\nit would be daniel@itprotv.\n\n269\n00:16:42.778 --> 00:16:44.798\nOops, demo, sorry.\n\n270\n00:16:44.798 --> 00:16:46.096\nI was going to say, that's not right.\n\n271\n00:16:46.096 --> 00:16:50.260\nitprotvdemo.com.\n\n272\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.440\nAnd now you can see where it actually\nwould have removed him, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.173\nBut because of the way that we've\nbeen working in Microsoft and\n\n274\n00:16:57.173 --> 00:16:59.991\nin directories and\ngroups and stuff like that,\n\n275\n00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.808\nusually the best practice is still\nthe same on the cloud as well.\n\n276\n00:17:03.808 --> 00:17:08.092\nCreate the groups that you want, and\nthen once you have the group created,\n\n277\n00:17:08.092 --> 00:17:12.716\nthen you can simply move people in and out\nof those groups without having to do this\n\n278\n00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:15.520\ntype of thing individually one at a time,\nokay?\n\n279\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.060\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if they're not in the group they're\nnot activated, or they're deactivating.\n\n280\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:20.790\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n281\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.610\n&gt;&gt; If they're in the group,\nit's another deal altogether.\n\n282\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.600\n&gt;&gt; Well, it actually activates, and\nwithout you having to go back in and\n\n283\n00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.770\nadd them into the group and do all that.\n\n284\n00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.610\nSo it makes sense to do\nstuff like that as well.\n\n285\n00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.250\nSo those are two ways.\n\n286\n00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:37.600\nAnd this is kind of the basics of\nsetting up the Azure Active Directory\n\n287\n00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.805\nrights management stuff that\nwe need to get configured.\n\n288\n00:17:42.805 --> 00:17:47.227\nNow before we leave this topic and\npretty much leave this particular episode,\n\n289\n00:17:47.227 --> 00:17:50.781\nwe have one more thing that we\nhave to actually talk about here.\n\n290\n00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:54.269\nOkay, and that is the idea of what if, and\n\n291\n00:17:54.269 --> 00:17:58.980\nwe have to talk about this\nidea of different scenarios.\n\n292\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.725\nSo different what if scenarios do come\nalong and the scenarios like that, right,\n\n293\n00:18:03.725 --> 00:18:06.550\nare things that are fairly important.\n\n294\n00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.500\nWhen you start especially taking\na look at the idea of the exam,\n\n295\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.760\nokay, when you start doing this.\n\n296\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.040\nAgain, I can't reveal to you\nanything much about the exam, but\n\n297\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.860\nI can tell you that scenarios\nare important for you to think through and\n\n298\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.540\nto try and figure out and\nunderstand what to do.\n\n299\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.070\n&gt;&gt; It makes sense.\n\n300\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.864\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so one of the things as we\nstart talking about this is that\n\n301\n00:18:26.864 --> 00:18:30.572\nthere is a feature for\nus to essentially help us to\n\n302\n00:18:30.572 --> 00:18:35.470\nprotect ourselves when things\ndon't go exactly right, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.187\nSo everything that we're doing right now,\nright, is configuring things\n\n304\n00:18:39.187 --> 00:18:43.280\nwithin the organization itself, and inside\nof the structure that we have set up.\n\n305\n00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.570\nBut what if an employee leaves\nthe organization, okay, and\n\n306\n00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.090\nthey have this rights\nmanagement stuff set up.\n\n307\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:54.180\nAnd you're not allowed, I'm not allowed\nto actually be able to look at that.\n\n308\n00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:59.161\nBut we still need to be able to read\nthe files that were protected by\n\n309\n00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:01.617\nthe rights management, okay?\n\n310\n00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:03.793\nNow that becomes a little bit trickier,\n\n311\n00:19:03.793 --> 00:19:07.010\ncuz rights management\nis pretty hefty there.\n\n312\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.660\nHow do we remove that type of stuff?\n\n313\n00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.380\nDoes the actual rights\nmanagement administrator,\n\n314\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.590\nare they able to do all that?\n\n315\n00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.830\nSome of it they are, but\nnot everything, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.852\nSecondly, what if an IT administrator\nthough needs to remove let's say a current\n\n317\n00:19:22.852 --> 00:19:27.241\npolicy and then they have another\npolicy configured to apply instead.\n\n318\n00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:31.220\nSo in other words an old policy that\nexisted no longer applies anymore.\n\n319\n00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.180\nAnd now we need to switch it out for\npossibly another policy.\n\n320\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.690\nWell, once again, can the actual current\n\n321\n00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.780\nActive Directory rights\nmanagement administrator do that?\n\n322\n00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.680\nMight be able to do some of it,\nbut not everything once again.\n\n323\n00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.130\nOkay, what about an exchange server?\n\n324\n00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.780\nOkay, that needs to index the mailbox and\nhave search operations.\n\n325\n00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.070\nDefinitely not gonna be able to do that.\n\n326\n00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.850\nAnd the reason why is now we're crossing\nplatforms in this sense, right?\n\n327\n00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.900\nADRM is its own separate service.\n\n328\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.557\nExchange is its own separate service.\n\n329\n00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:10.385\nIt doesn't mean that you as\nan AADRM administrator has any\n\n330\n00:20:10.385 --> 00:20:13.810\nrights over the exchange server.\n\n331\n00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.905\nSo no, you couldn't actually do\nanything like that either, okay?\n\n332\n00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:22.630\nWhat if you already have existing IT\nservices for data loss prevention, okay,\n\n333\n00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.335\nand even though everything is actually\nset up the way that we want to, okay.\n\n334\n00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:31.020\nBut we need to inspect some of those\nfiles and verify their integrity.\n\n335\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.390\nYou still can't do that either, okay.\n\n336\n00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.275\nYou need to bulk decrypt files for\nauditing, legal issues or\n\n337\n00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:39.113\nother compliance reasons.\n\n338\n00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.501\nOnce again,\nyou don't have the ability to do so\n\n339\n00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:45.090\nbecause that violates that\nperson's privacy as well.\n\n340\n00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.925\nSo how do we get this done?\n\n341\n00:20:46.925 --> 00:20:49.490\nOkay, how is all this set up?\n\n342\n00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.920\nThere is a particular user,\nnot a group at this point, but\n\n343\n00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.200\na user that would also need\nto be assigned as well.\n\n344\n00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.352\nSo not only do we need\nan administrator like we did\n\n345\n00:20:59.352 --> 00:21:00.510\nwith Daniel\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n346\n00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.539\n&gt;&gt; But we also need something, and\nthis is the actual true term here\n\n347\n00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:08.019\n&gt;&gt; It's called the Azure Rights Management\n\n348\n00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:09.455\nsuper user.\n\n349\n00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:11.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n350\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n351\n00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.890\n&gt;&gt; Wear a cape then.\n\n352\n00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Azure Rights Management\nsuper user, okay.\n\n353\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:19.160\nThe super user, though, let me make\nsure I'm telling you right, okay,\n\n354\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.510\naccesses protected data even after\nthe user leaves the company.\n\n355\n00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's what can happen.\n\n356\n00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:31.145\nThey can also change protection\npolicy that has already been applied,\n\n357\n00:21:31.145 --> 00:21:35.265\nwhich normally you can even as\nthe AADRM administrator, okay?\n\n358\n00:21:35.265 --> 00:21:37.010\nThe same thing, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.460\nIt allows us to be able to configure for\n\n360\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.530\nthe indexing protection I want,\neverything that we said.\n\n361\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.960\nThat particular super user\nis able to do that stuff.\n\n362\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.220\nSo normally, part of that process is,\n\n363\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.890\nnot only do we assign an AADRM\nadministrator, but we also assign what?\n\n364\n00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.590\n&gt;&gt; The super user.\n&gt;&gt; A super user, yep.\n\n365\n00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.290\n&gt;&gt; So let's show you how to do\nthat before we go here, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:03.660\nSo once we've gotten to this particular\npoint, and that we're still connected to,\n\n367\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.090\nof course, the Azure service here, okay?\n\n368\n00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:13.724\nOnce everything is done now we type\n\n369\n00:22:13.724 --> 00:22:20.144\nin enable-AAdrmSuperUserFeature.\n\n370\n00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.659\nAll right, so I'm gonna press Enter there.\n\n371\n00:22:24.659 --> 00:22:29.247\nAnd now notice it says the super\nuser feature was enabled for\n\n372\n00:22:29.247 --> 00:22:32.130\nrights management service, okay?\n\n373\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.640\nNow at this point,\nwe simply do the same thing.\n\n374\n00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.674\nWe add AADRM super user, and\nnow we actually have the email\n\n375\n00:22:39.674 --> 00:22:44.780\naddress here and\nwe will make this one Zach at this point.\n\n376\n00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.500\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm super.\n\n377\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.692\n&gt;&gt; Sure, that's right.\n\n378\n00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:54.542\nAnd we press Enter, and there it is.\n\n379\n00:22:54.542 --> 00:22:59.140\nZach is now added to the list of\nsuper users for rights management.\n\n380\n00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.500\nAnd at this point,\nthat's what we would do.\n\n381\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.109\nRemember that this particular\none cannot be a group.\n\n382\n00:23:05.109 --> 00:23:08.310\nThis must be an individual,\nthat's pretty much it.\n\n383\n00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.210\nOkay, so\nno group users on the super user idea.\n\n384\n00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.995\nBut this provides us essentially a backup\nas to what it does in case we really do\n\n385\n00:23:17.995 --> 00:23:24.050\nlose control over certain things, we can\ngain it back, or Zach can gain it back.\n\n386\n00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.670\nBut that means that we do\ntrust him to be able to do so.\n\n387\n00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.220\nAnd that he has the rights due\n\n388\n00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.350\nto this particular way that his account\nhas been assigned to that super user.\n\n389\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.288\n&gt;&gt; And forgive me, I think you've\nalready actually touched on this.\n\n390\n00:23:36.288 --> 00:23:36.895\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n391\n00:23:36.895 --> 00:23:39.180\ncan you have more than\none super user though?\n\n392\n00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure you can.\n\n393\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n394\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.337\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ntry one more here.\n\n395\n00:23:42.337 --> 00:23:45.873\nSo I've just hit the up arrow one time,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n396\n00:23:45.873 --> 00:23:50.369\nmake sure that we also add Cherokee in\nsince she's the global administrator.\n\n397\n00:23:50.369 --> 00:23:51.287\nAnd there you go.\n\n398\n00:23:51.287 --> 00:23:53.076\nNotice that we were able\nto do that as well.\n\n399\n00:23:53.076 --> 00:23:55.363\nSo you can have as many\nsuper users you want, but.\n\n400\n00:23:55.363 --> 00:23:57.246\nIt doesn't mean you should, okay?\n\n401\n00:23:57.246 --> 00:23:58.198\nYou can.\n\n402\n00:23:58.198 --> 00:24:01.032\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You want to make sure that you\n\n403\n00:24:01.032 --> 00:24:04.030\nunderstand who is actually\ngoing to be able to do this.\n\n404\n00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.005\nYou might do this maybe for\na department or maybe one for\n\n405\n00:24:08.005 --> 00:24:11.216\na particular group or\nwhatever it might be.\n\n406\n00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:14.494\nBut you probably don't want to create\nsuper many of these but you can.\n\n407\n00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:16.080\nIt's not gonna hurt anything.\n\n408\n00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.150\nBut the key if fairly simple, right?\n\n409\n00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.890\nIt's to remember their purpose,\nokay, as what their purpose is.\n\n410\n00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.310\nSo, Zach, for an example, right?\n\n411\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:29.220\nLet's just say in the future somebody\ncomes up and ask us a question, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.071\nSo, here it is, Zach, okay, here it is.\n\n413\n00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:38.154\nI am the Active Directory rights\nmanagement administrator,\n\n414\n00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:42.786\nbut I find myself not being able to\naccess this particular employee's\n\n415\n00:24:42.786 --> 00:24:45.234\nfiles that we need to access, okay?\n\n416\n00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:52.231\nThat we need to access but I'm actually\nthe administrator and I can't access it.\n\n417\n00:24:52.231 --> 00:24:56.530\nZach, what is the possible reason I\nwould not be able to access that?\n\n418\n00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.260\n&gt;&gt; Because that's something\nthat's designated for\n\n419\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.810\njust the super user to get a hold of.\n\n420\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.811\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\nthat seems logical to me, right?\n\n421\n00:25:03.811 --> 00:25:07.321\nYeah, it's not because the user has\nmessed around with his account,\n\n422\n00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:08.700\neven though he could have.\n\n423\n00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.982\nIt's not because your particular\nrole as being the rights\n\n424\n00:25:13.982 --> 00:25:18.311\nmanagement administrator\nis not high enough.\n\n425\n00:25:18.311 --> 00:25:21.605\nIt's because we have a special\ndesignation for that as well.\n\n426\n00:25:21.605 --> 00:25:23.870\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So it makes sense, right?\n\n427\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:29.240\nWhen you start thinking through answers to\nquestions like that of what can the super\n\n428\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.660\nuser essentially do that the rights\n\n429\n00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.150\nmanagement administrator\nis not gonna be able to do.\n\n430\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.540\nAnd that will help you to kind\nof realize what the role and\n\n431\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.820\nresponsibility of this is going to be.\n\n432\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.715\nSo always in the background, right,\n\n433\n00:25:44.715 --> 00:25:47.679\nnot only do you need the rights\nmanagement administrator,\n\n434\n00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:51.829\nmore than likely you'll probably also need\nthat super user assigned to ensure that\n\n435\n00:25:51.829 --> 00:25:55.586\nyou have true effectiveness throughout\nthe organization in what we need.\n\n436\n00:25:55.586 --> 00:25:57.480\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Zach, pretty much.\n\n437\n00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.710\nThat kind of really helps us to wrap up\nat least the basic administration for\n\n438\n00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.178\nAzure rights management.\n\n439\n00:26:03.178 --> 00:26:05.650\n&gt;&gt; And, as Ronnie has pointed out to you,\n\n440\n00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:08.650\non the exam you're going to\nneed to know it by this name.\n\n441\n00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.110\nSo this has been Administer Azure\nRights Management Part Two.\n\n442\n00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.090\nThere was a part one,\nhopefully you saw that.\n\n443\n00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:19.040\nIf not, please see that one as well, and\nmake sure you watch every episode of\n\n444\n00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.320\nthe Office 365 series, very helpful,\nand then go to our Course Library.\n\n445\n00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.040\nThere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n446\n00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.820\nAnd they're all designed to do one thing,\nthat's to help you go further.\n\n447\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.110\nAnd tell somebody you know,\ntell everybody you know about IT Pro TV,\n\n448\n00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.550\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n449\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.080\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n450\n00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.930\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n451\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:42.268\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n452\n00:26:42.268 --> 00:26:46.316\n[MUSIC]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

Francisco California.\n\n3\n00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:08.185\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.416\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.827\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.827 --> 00:00:16.890\nhelping you learn where ever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.386\n&gt;&gt; I'm your host Zach Memos,\nand this is Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.430\nWe're gonna go look at Administer\nAzure Rights Management Part Three.\n\n9\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.420\nThat's right, there's a part one,\nthere's a part two, this is part three.\n\n10\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.310\nAnd bringing us all the knowledge we need\nto know, is the one and only Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.820\nRonnie great to have you here,\nthanks so very much.\n\n12\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.720\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Zach for having me back\non the show as we continue on talking\n\n13\n00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.970\nabout of course Azure Rights Management.\n\n14\n00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.690\n&gt;&gt; We already mentioned why we want\nto implement Azure Rights Management.\n\n15\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.610\nWe also showed you some of the weird,\nkind of unusual things.\n\n16\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.660\nThe main changes that were\n\n17\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.940\nin Azure Rights Management-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n18\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.400\n&gt;&gt; Where we saw it as being\nthe Azure information protection and\n\n19\n00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.540\nfinally when we jumped\na couple of screens in,\n\n20\n00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.815\nthen it actually showed us look,\nRights Management.\n\n21\n00:00:56.815 --> 00:00:57.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n22\n00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.510\nof course talked about\nthe configuration there and\n\n23\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.074\nwhat it ultimately allows\nus to be able to do.\n\n24\n00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:05.440\nOnce Rights Management is enabled then for\n\n25\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.710\nthose of us that have applications\nthat open such as Office 2016.\n\n26\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.970\nIt gives us some additional options that\n\n27\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.478\nwould allow us to protect those files and\neven emails,okay.\n\n28\n00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:21.680\nThat will then go with that file,\nor that email.\n\n29\n00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.430\nSo it's no longer dependent on\nmy machine as wherever it goes.\n\n30\n00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.260\n&gt;&gt; We still have those\nprotections available to us.\n\n31\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.040\nNow even as we do something like that,\nthere are times and\n\n32\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.540\nthere are cases instead that you may find\nthat you don't need them set up globally\n\n33\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.400\nso much for every single person, but you\nmay want them limited to a specific group.\n\n34\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.350\nOr you may want to set some\nother conditions up depending on\n\n35\n00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.150\nthe organization itself.\n\n36\n00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.400\n&gt;&gt; Whether a person, or a user, excuse me,\nis part of a group or whether they're not.\n\n37\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.370\nWhatever it is,\n\n38\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.590\nright, you can actually do that by\nactually implementing templates, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.120\nSo we can create different templates\ninside of Azure Rights Management\n\n40\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.690\nto allow us to be able to do this and\nto set it up.\n\n41\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.320\nNow just when I say that,\nit sounds easy, it really does.\n\n42\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.030\nAnd it's not exactly the most\ndifficult thing in the world.\n\n43\n00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.410\nBut seeing it is not\na kind of an aha moment.\n\n44\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.290\nIt's not the sound stage where all\nthe lights go completely dark and\n\n45\n00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.660\nthen all of a sudden everybody appears on\nthe stage and the lights kind of pop up.\n\n46\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.800\nIt's not that amazing moment up there.\n\n47\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.620\nOnce we get it all implemented,\nyou have to kinda wait sometimes.\n\n48\n00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.540\nSo it can take up to about an hour\nafter you get the templates created.\n\n49\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.010\nAnd then you have to get them to\nthe point where they're published.\n\n50\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.600\nAnd then from the publication out to\nthose that are running Office 365.\n\n51\n00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.630\nDepending on which service it's actually\ngoing to affect and how it's going to\n\n52\n00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.290\nbe implemented, it may take up to an hour\nbefore we see the effects and the change.\n\n53\n00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.500\nWell, we can't do that on\nthis show in particular, but\n\n54\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.750\nI do want to show you at least some of\nthe differences that you'll see, and\n\n55\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.740\nwhat we're specifically called\non by the exam objective,\n\n56\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.640\nis to really set up templates for\nprotected email instead, okay.\n\n57\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.240\nSo, that's what we're gonna look\nat as far as a template goes.\n\n58\n00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.685\nAnd I already created it because it does\ntake time propagate and do that, but\n\n59\n00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:21.715\nI wanted to show you the difference\nbetween them, and that way,\n\n60\n00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:23.365\nwe'll actually see that as well.\n\n61\n00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:26.305\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, does it have to be an admin\nthat would create these templates, or\n\n62\n00:03:26.305 --> 00:03:27.675\ncan the users create them?\n\n63\n00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:30.915\n&gt;&gt; Nope, you're actually gonna leave this\nfor some administrator to be able to do\n\n64\n00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:34.305\nand to get everything set\nup the way that we want to.\n\n65\n00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:38.230\nSo it does take a bit of time\nwhen we start to do this, but\n\n66\n00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.440\nit's not exactly the most\ndifficult thing in the world, but\n\n67\n00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.990\nit is challenging to find\nwhere we're gonna set this up.\n\n68\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.910\nBut let's take a look at what unprotected\nemail actually looks like as well.\n\n69\n00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.619\nI've actually got another Office\n365 tenancy that we use right\n\n70\n00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:56.810\nhere at ITPro.TV, actually at\nOfficePro.TV is where we use it.\n\n71\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.740\nSo I wanted to show you,\n\n72\n00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.690\nand this is actually logged in as\nyou can see now, Joey Fatone here.\n\n73\n00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.470\nIt's not me, I wasn't actually\nthe one that created this, so\n\n74\n00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.210\nwe're using this anyways.\n\n75\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.120\nBut this is not set up for\nAzure Rights Management.\n\n76\n00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.860\nThere's nothing that has\nfiltered down to this account.\n\n77\n00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.530\nSo if I were to launch a new email, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.590\nWell there are really no\nadditional setting here.\n\n79\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.540\nLet me see if I can zoom in, and\nnotice just send, attach, discard.\n\n80\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.110\nWell there's nothing else over here,\nlet me go down to the bottom.\n\n81\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.850\nWell it looks like there may be\nsome other options down here.\n\n82\n00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.310\nLet me click here.\n\n83\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.160\nNow you can see Message options.\n\n84\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.740\nIf I select that this is what\nI wanted to get to, okay?\n\n85\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.620\nThe sensitivity, Normal,\nPersonal, Private, Confidential.\n\n86\n00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.900\nYou can mark those.\n\n87\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.580\nBut notice these two,\nRequest a delivery receipt.\n\n88\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.010\nRequest a read receipt.\n\n89\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.950\nThose are common, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.370\nThose are exactly the way that they should\nbe when everything is unprotected, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.930\nSo it's not exactly difficult to actually\nbe able to see the differences there, and\n\n92\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.890\nI'm pointing out that in particular\nbecause once we get everything set up\n\n93\n00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.260\nthose are the options\nthat will be different.\n\n94\n00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.550\nThat's what we'll actually end up seeing\nthat's different there by comparison.\n\n95\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.720\nSo hopefully I can leave that up for us to\n\n96\n00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.850\ncompare against once I can get everything\nset up and show you how to do this.\n\n97\n00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.060\nAll right so let me switch back\nover to our current tenant\n\n98\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.100\nthat we've been using during this entire\nshow so far, so that we could see this.\n\n99\n00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.220\nNow I'm logged back in as Cherokee,\nour administrator for our tenant.\n\n100\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.630\nOverall can do everything\nthat we need to do.\n\n101\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.960\nShe's a part of the organization.\n\n102\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.490\nSo now she's ready to setup\nthe Azure Rights Management templates.\n\n103\n00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.060\nWe've already setup the Azure Rights\nManagement, but now we need to go and\n\n104\n00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.600\nconfigure the tenants.\n\n105\n00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.970\nAnd the strange thing is if I\ngo to the admin center here.\n\n106\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.260\nAnd let's just give it a moment and\n\n107\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.570\nwe flip on over here into the admin\ncenter on the left hand side, and\n\n108\n00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.790\nI go all right, I'm looking for\nthe templates for the protection.\n\n109\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.900\nDo I go back to settings, and\n\n110\n00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.230\nwhere we first all of this\nunderneath services and add ins?\n\n111\n00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.170\nNope, you're not gonna actually\nend up finding them here.\n\n112\n00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.620\nSo this is one of those\nfirst places that we saw\n\n113\n00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.220\nwhere the name doesn't exactly match up\nto Azure Rights Management which is what\n\n114\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.900\nwe're gonna see inside of\nthe actual exam as well.\n\n115\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.000\nMake sure you know both because you\nnever know which one they'll ask you\n\n116\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.340\nabout, you see that.\n\n117\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.440\nAnd this is where we originally showed you\nthat you really have a couple of things.\n\n118\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.260\nOne just says close but\nnotice that link there.\n\n119\n00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.090\nAnd let's see if we can\nfind it here first.\n\n120\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.630\nOkay?\n\n121\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.760\nSo, in a moment it should bring this up.\n\n122\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.290\nNotice it is activated at this point.\n\n123\n00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.030\nI have advanced features here that I\ncan go to, okay, if I have the trial.\n\n124\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.410\nBut I don't have the actual The 30 day\ntrial in terms of what they're looking for\n\n125\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.910\nme to be able to get.\n\n126\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.670\nNow, the great thing is when you add\nthat in, right, at least right now,\n\n127\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.420\nwhen I checked on it to make sure,\nit was an additional $2 a month, but\n\n128\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.280\nthat's per account or per subscription.\n\n129\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.970\nSo you might go, what's the big deal now?\n\n130\n00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.080\nWell, let's add that up just for\na moment Zach, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.500\nSo, for ten users an extra $2.00 for\n\n132\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.920\neach user for us per month,\nthat would be $20.00.\n\n133\n00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.770\nNot bad right?\n\n134\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:21.370\nSounds good?\n\n135\n00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.380\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great.\n\n136\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so in that sense, right,\nwith that extra $20.00 no big deal.\n\n137\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.020\nNow Zach if we push\nthat up to 5,000 users.\n\n138\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.885\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't sound great.\n\n139\n00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:34.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now and we add an extra $2 per\n\n140\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.130\nmonth, all of the sudden for\nan organization what does that sound like?\n\n141\n00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.480\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like a lot of expense.\n\n142\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it sounds around $10,000 a month.\n\n143\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.055\nOkay so when you look at it and\ngo I get all this extra protection.\n\n144\n00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:53.345\nYou're right you do but expect to pay for\nit that's what I'm trying to get to, okay.\n\n145\n00:07:53.345 --> 00:07:55.403\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So realize that yes there is gonna be\n\n146\n00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:57.781\na cost as you go for\nthose more granular features.\n\n147\n00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:01.011\n&gt;&gt; So is there a way around that is\nthere a way you can group everybody,\n\n148\n00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.331\nor bundle everyone together and\nhave one cost?\n\n149\n00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:04.115\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n150\n00:08:04.115 --> 00:08:04.867\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n151\n00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:06.419\n&gt;&gt; They figured as Probably.\n\n152\n00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.635\nI bet you, if you actually bring five,\nsix, they'll work out a deal with you.\n\n153\n00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:14.524\nBut overall though, just kind of realize\nat this point, it sounds good and\n\n154\n00:08:14.524 --> 00:08:16.690\nit's not bad for a small group.\n\n155\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.400\nOnce you add in a couple of extra dollars,\nyou're already paying\n\n156\n00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.242\nlet's say $8 a month for the basic plan\nyou can get, or let's say it's even $12.\n\n157\n00:08:24.242 --> 00:08:28.096\n14, you kind of absorb that and\ngo, I don't even think.\n\n158\n00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:31.129\nThe cost of another subscription,\nno big deal per month.\n\n159\n00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:35.180\nWhen you start adding in hundreds,\nthousands of users, that cost begins to\n\n160\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.450\nrise significantly in that term, so\njust realize you already have that.\n\n161\n00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.720\nBut the great thing is even with\nOffice 365, we at least have this,\n\n162\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:48.870\nwhich is the protection that's off,\nthe basic protections that are there.\n\n163\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.230\nBut notice that there's no\nplace that it gives me,\n\n164\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.380\nthat I go to set up any\ntype of template here.\n\n165\n00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.330\nThat's pretty much not\nwhere it's going to be.\n\n166\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.720\nSo let me back on out here,\nI'm going to close out of that tab for\n\n167\n00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.740\njust a moment and close here.\n\n168\n00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.019\nAnd where we're going to scroll down to,\nis gonna be the Admin centers.\n\n169\n00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:13.110\nAnd if I expand that out, now let's take\na look over here on the left-hand side.\n\n170\n00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.510\nAnd let's see, Exchange?\n\n171\n00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.360\nNope.\nSkype?\n\n172\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.300\nNope.\nSharePoint?\n\n173\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.530\nNope, nope, nope.\n\n174\n00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:19.320\nNope, nope.\n\n175\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.410\nSecurity and Compliance?\n\n176\n00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.970\nPossible, but\nwhere we're going is under Azure AD.\n\n177\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.260\nMake sure you know that.\n\n178\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.069\nIt's not gonna be where you\nthink it's gonna be here.\n\n179\n00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.610\nNow, I'm gonna click here and\nit's gonna bring me, of course,\n\n180\n00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.950\ninto the Azure active directory\nportal that they give us.\n\n181\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.952\nAnd this is a specific portal\nof course for Azure AD.\n\n182\n00:09:38.952 --> 00:09:44.398\nNow, If you're going through the office\n365 center, you're gonna land here, but we\n\n183\n00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:49.820\nreally need to get to another place, which\nis right here, under the Azure portal.\n\n184\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.586\nSo you've got two options.\n\n185\n00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:55.260\nYou can go through the Office 365 Admin\ncenters, which I don't know why that\n\n186\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.761\nsounded strange in my head right now,\nto be able to do this.\n\n187\n00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:05.600\nOr you can simply type this into your\nbrowser, http://sportal.azure.com.\n\n188\n00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.740\nI'm just gonna select that link there.\n\n189\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.860\nAnd it's normally gonna\nask you to go ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.340\npresent credentials if\nyou have not already.\n\n191\n00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:17.380\nVerify that you are still logged in as\nthe actual administrator that you want to.\n\n192\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.620\nAnd you'll now notice that you\ndo see a different portal, okay?\n\n193\n00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.270\nSo, the other one was a bit more specific\nfor just Azure Active Directory, but\n\n194\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:31.220\nit still lead you to the portal,\nor you can just\n\n195\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.760\ntype it in your browser, portal.azure.com.\n\n196\n00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.570\nNow, once we do that,\nnow you start to look around and\n\n197\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.380\nyou'll notice that Azure has tons and\ntons of stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.420\nLook at all that stuff that you can\nget into when you start seeing this.\n\n199\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.100\nSo dashboard, resources, SQL databases,\n\n200\n00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.660\nAzure Cosmos database,\nvirtual machines, load balancers,\n\n201\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.850\nmy gosh, it's turning into a nightmare\nas we start to find information.\n\n202\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.660\nAnd Zach, even more surprising, right\ninside of Azure, just when you go all\n\n203\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.440\nright, that's a lot of stuff for us to dig\nthrough, this last little link right here.\n\n204\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.470\nNotice what it says,\nmore services [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.220\nSo when you want to actually go,\nwhat do you mean by more?\n\n206\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.350\nHow much more can there be?\n\n207\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.930\nLet me click on it one time here if I can.\n\n208\n00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:24.900\nLet me see!\n\n209\n00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.930\nNow, look at this.\n\n210\n00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:35.390\nLook at all this stuff as we continue\nto scroll on down through here.\n\n211\n00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:40.230\nSo you actually see there's still\na bit of stuff that we can go through.\n\n212\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.274\nSo they jammed everything and\nthe kitchen sink into\n\n213\n00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:49.610\nMicrosoft Azure,\nis what they actually ended up doing here.\n\n214\n00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.100\nNow, I'm gonna scroll down to where\nit says security and identity, okay?\n\n215\n00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.710\n&gt;&gt; What I was gonna ask, Ronnie,\nis, if I'm preparing for the exam,\n\n216\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:02.080\nin Azure more specifically,\nwhat should I be aware of?\n\n217\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.350\nWhat should I be looking at?\n\n218\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's what we're\nabout to take a look at right now.\n\n219\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.695\nBut first of course,\nis how do you get to this, right?\n\n220\n00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:10.200\nIf you need to setup a template,\nwhere do you set it up?\n\n221\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.890\nYou've got to think about that.\n\n222\n00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.150\nIs it inside of the Office\n365 admin center, not really.\n\n223\n00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.182\nIt is actually inside of\nthe portal.azure.com, ultimately,\n\n224\n00:12:19.182 --> 00:12:19.960\nis where you go.\n\n225\n00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.921\nBut if you're exploring anyways,\n\n226\n00:12:21.921 --> 00:12:26.370\nyou might as well figure out how to\nget there from the Office 365 portal.\n\n227\n00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.560\nAnd we just showed you how\nto do that as well, and\n\n228\n00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.810\nof course you can go directly there.\n\n229\n00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.050\nThe next thing, of course, is you want to\nclick on More Services on the bottom, and\n\n230\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.870\nthen scroll down to the Security and\nIdentity again, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.100\nAnd when you do this, you'll notice\nthat there is an Azure Active Directory,\n\n232\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.690\nwhich Office 365 dumped\nus into right away,\n\n233\n00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.880\nwhich is only one small\ncomponent of everything else.\n\n234\n00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.850\nAnd if I scroll down here in this list,\n\n235\n00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.560\nthat is beginning to look more familiar,\nright?\n\n236\n00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.580\nWhen we saw this inside\nof the Office 365 portal,\n\n237\n00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.190\nAzure Information Protection, hey,\nthat's starting to sound a bell to me.\n\n238\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:09.190\nSo if I select that, and notice there\nit is, Azure Information Protection,\n\n239\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.850\nand then it gives us this over\nhere on the left hand side, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.000\nNow, when you have rights management\nenabled just like what we did,\n\n241\n00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.270\nit automatically creates two\ndefault templates, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.320\nTwo default templates for us that\ngives us kind of a security guidance\n\n243\n00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.910\nthat we actually want, or protection\nguidance that we have available to us.\n\n244\n00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.200\nAnd those two templates,\nif I go down to POLICIES,\n\n245\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.890\nI will call Global polices,\nand then Scoped policies.\n\n246\n00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.450\nGlobal essentially says apply to\neveryone inside of my tenancy.\n\n247\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.480\nOkay, that's pretty much the scope of it.\n\n248\n00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.050\nScoped means I'm going to limit or\n\n249\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.960\nscope to this one group or\nparticular user or whatever it might be.\n\n250\n00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.740\nSo those are pretty much\nthe two kind of basic\n\n251\n00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.780\nideas that you have when you\nstart creating some of that.\n\n252\n00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.680\nSo let me see if I can select\nthe Global here for a moment.\n\n253\n00:14:08.023 --> 00:14:09.790\nAnd let me see if I can scroll out.\n\n254\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.220\nI'm trying to get a little bit\nmore screen real estate here.\n\n255\n00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.560\nThere we go, okay.\n\n256\n00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.650\nI wanted to make sure I\ncould collapse that down.\n\n257\n00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.240\nSo under Global policies, this is\nwhere I created a template originally.\n\n258\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.670\nNow, I wanna show you how\nto create a template here.\n\n259\n00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.260\nBut you'll see this one is\ncalled Email-Protection.\n\n260\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.100\nSo that one I created a while ago because\nit does take up to about an hour for\n\n261\n00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.150\nyou to do this.\n\n262\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:36.130\nIf I click on this drop down,\nhere are the two automatic templates it\n\n263\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:41.800\ncreates, Confidential and\nHighly Confidential.\n\n264\n00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.020\nConfidential, essentially, gives you read,\n\n265\n00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:49.030\nwrite access to those protected documents,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.860\nBut only people within your organization.\n\n267\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:57.170\nSo if you protect that document, if I send\nthat to Zach and he's an IT Pro TV demo,\n\n268\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.500\nas well, he has read/write access, and\nthat means he can actually read it,\n\n269\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500\nhe can respond to it,\nhe can do whatever, he can edit it.\n\n270\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.890\nHe can do that, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.420\nSave it, he can send it back to me\nas long as I'm in the organization.\n\n272\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.530\nNow, highly confidential,\n\n273\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.630\nthough, gives read only access to\npeople within the organization.\n\n274\n00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.840\nSo if I create something and\nI mark it as highly confidential, now,\n\n275\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.590\nZach actually, he can read it,\nhe can't change it, he can't modify.\n\n276\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.370\nWhat about those users\noutside of our organization?\n\n277\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.260\nWell, at this point, in the default\nway that we have it set, it says none.\n\n278\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:37.190\nSo any of these documents, they're now\nprotected with Azure rights management.\n\n279\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.220\nThey will not have access to them at all,\nand\n\n280\n00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.290\nthat's what you also want\nto kind of understand too.\n\n281\n00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.400\nUnderneath the scope policies here,\n\n282\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.810\nyou'll see it doesn't actually have any\npolicy set up underneath the scope.\n\n283\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.440\nIt really only is the global\npolicy right here.\n\n284\n00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.110\nSo these are kind of the two\ndefaults that we're talking about.\n\n285\n00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.381\nAnd this is the one that I created like I\nsaid earlier cuz I knew it would take time\n\n286\n00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:00.990\nto populate.\n\n287\n00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.971\nThe creation of a template\nis relatively easy and\n\n288\n00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:07.689\nthis is where the terminology\nhas changed overtime, okay?\n\n289\n00:16:07.689 --> 00:16:11.840\nSo even over the past year,\nyear and a half or so, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.143\nEven though you see the term template,\nnotice that they don't call it a template,\n\n291\n00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.958\nlook at what they call it,\nadd a new label, go figure okay?\n\n292\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:25.041\nSo yeah, if you wanna know why it's\nconfusing to create a template.\n\n293\n00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:27.070\nWell, it's because, even right?\n\n294\n00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.148\nProtection template, okay?\n\n295\n00:16:30.148 --> 00:16:33.280\nNotice this configure labels, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.442\nGo figure, you have to actually kind\nof figure out one or the other, but\n\n297\n00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:37.826\njust select adding new label.\n\n298\n00:16:39.784 --> 00:16:43.515\nAnd at this point, here, this is\nwhat you would end up doing, right?\n\n299\n00:16:43.515 --> 00:16:48.105\nSpecify how this label is displayed in\nthe information protection client on user\n\n300\n00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:49.150\ndevices.\n\n301\n00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.389\nSo this means it will affect individual\nusers on their devices as well, and\n\n302\n00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:56.416\nyou just have it selected as\nenable at this point, and\n\n303\n00:16:56.416 --> 00:17:02.510\nthen we can create a test template,\nHere, and\n\n304\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.955\nwe'll say, Test Template, right?\n\n305\n00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:12.005\nNow, you can even color that label here,\njust a little, so let's make that one\n\n306\n00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:15.760\nlight green, you of course can\ncustomize that if you choose to.\n\n307\n00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.272\nEven add a numbering system and\n\n308\n00:17:18.272 --> 00:17:23.109\nthen set permissions for\ndocuments and emails doing this.\n\n309\n00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.264\nNotice that it's not configured right now.\n\n310\n00:17:25.264 --> 00:17:28.210\nIf you want to protect it,\nyou simply select Protect.\n\n311\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.046\nAnd now you have two options for\n\n312\n00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:33.670\nprotection which essentially\nis encryption, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.538\nThose are the options that you have set\nand we're not getting that deep into it.\n\n314\n00:17:37.538 --> 00:17:41.919\nFor those you that want to go on towards\nAzure training, or Azure learning,\n\n315\n00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:44.047\nmake sure you check out those shows.\n\n316\n00:17:44.047 --> 00:17:45.714\nProbably if they're not in our library yet\n\n317\n00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:47.830\nthey will be in the library\nin the near future.\n\n318\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.234\nSo we'll actually set all those up, but\nwe're gonna leave it at the default.\n\n319\n00:17:51.234 --> 00:17:56.359\nWe're essentially just gonna use the Azure\ncloud keys for protection right now, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:59.059\nYou can of course, can setup\ndifferent markings if you want to.\n\n321\n00:17:59.059 --> 00:18:03.150\nAnd here's where you can create conditions\nfor automatically applying the label.\n\n322\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.303\nAnd then you can set those different\nconditions as well, all right?\n\n323\n00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:09.318\nSo I'm not gonna set any\nconditions at this point.\n\n324\n00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:13.207\nAnd once you get that done,\nyou select Save.\n\n325\n00:18:13.207 --> 00:18:17.937\nAnd then, oops, let me see and\nlet me click OK here, and\n\n326\n00:18:17.937 --> 00:18:23.186\nthen select Save, and\nif it asks me for anything else, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:28.290\nNow, notice over on the right-hand side,\nit says I need to publish the policy.\n\n328\n00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.576\nSo even if I create one and\n\n329\n00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:32.402\nis not applying I wanna check\nif it's been published.\n\n330\n00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:36.227\nThe great thing is if it hasn't been\npublished, you'll notice up here at\n\n331\n00:18:36.227 --> 00:18:40.066\nthe top there's this little bell for\nnotifications and it'll tell you.\n\n332\n00:18:40.066 --> 00:18:44.949\nIf this still continues saying need to\npublish policy cuz they weren't actually\n\n333\n00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:45.964\npublished yet.\n\n334\n00:18:45.964 --> 00:18:48.542\nWell then from that point that's what\nyou would do is you would need to\n\n335\n00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:49.127\npublish them.\n\n336\n00:18:49.127 --> 00:18:53.627\nThe neat thing is it also gives you this\nkind of whatever color that is, tan?\n\n337\n00:18:53.627 --> 00:18:57.910\n[LAUGH] I don't know, almost yellow?\n\n338\n00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.145\nClick Publish to deploy\nchanges to all users.\n\n339\n00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:03.755\nAnd that's what you do,\nyou'd actually go ahead and\n\n340\n00:19:03.755 --> 00:19:07.705\nclick this template right here and you\nwould deploy that to all the users, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:11.845\nSo once you select that, and it says\nhey are you sure you want to do it?\n\n342\n00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:17.025\nYou click Yes, and now notice it\ntells me that the published policy,\n\n343\n00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:21.685\nthe policy was successfully published,\nwhich I can't say.\n\n344\n00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:23.085\nAnd then I can see that, right?\n\n345\n00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:25.755\nSo we wanna keep those things in mind.\n\n346\n00:19:25.755 --> 00:19:31.245\nNow, that is gonna push out across my\nentire Office 365 tenancy at this point.\n\n347\n00:19:31.245 --> 00:19:35.319\nShould apply to every user cuz I actually\nmade underneath the global policies here.\n\n348\n00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:37.844\nSo, Global Policy, and there's the two.\n\n349\n00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:41.514\nNow, this can take up to an hour\nto push out to do this, but\n\n350\n00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.971\nthis one is actually designed for\nemail protection.\n\n351\n00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:48.604\nNow, if you notice when we said that\nthese templates said for documents and\n\n352\n00:19:48.604 --> 00:19:49.418\nemails, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:49.418 --> 00:19:50.998\nSo what is the end result?\n\n354\n00:19:50.998 --> 00:19:53.290\nWhat should we end up\nseeing at some point?\n\n355\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.458\nAnd this is where you'll\nhave to test it out, too.\n\n356\n00:19:55.458 --> 00:19:59.648\nWhen you actually decide that\nit's time to test everything out,\n\n357\n00:19:59.648 --> 00:20:03.007\nmake sure you log out of your tenancy and\nlog back in.\n\n358\n00:20:03.007 --> 00:20:07.187\nI'm not gonna do that cuz typing that\npassword is a little bit insane right now\n\n359\n00:20:07.187 --> 00:20:07.904\nin my brain.\n\n360\n00:20:07.904 --> 00:20:10.797\nBut let's say that we did that,\nwe logged out and we came back in and\n\n361\n00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:14.103\nwe're just testing out the email policy\ncuz I don't know if the other one has\n\n362\n00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:15.051\napplied yet, okay?\n\n363\n00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:22.280\nSo we would select email and then under\nthe email let's do the same thing.\n\n364\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.325\nRemember over on this one which everything\nwas unprotected here let me show you this\n\n365\n00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.308\nagain, from the beginning of the show.\n\n366\n00:20:28.308 --> 00:20:31.176\nRemember we saw this where we\ncould see sensitivities and\n\n367\n00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:32.558\nthe message options here?\n\n368\n00:20:32.558 --> 00:20:35.116\nRequest a delivery receipt,\nrequest a read receipt.\n\n369\n00:20:35.116 --> 00:20:36.923\nLet me leave this up for us.\n\n370\n00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:41.728\nNow, let me scroll back over here,\nand let's create a new email.\n\n371\n00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:46.108\nAnd on this one, I'm gonna click on\nthese ellipsis button right here,\n\n372\n00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:49.479\nwhich is at the top of the screen\ninstead of the bottom.\n\n373\n00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:53.227\nThen, I'm going to select\nshow message options.\n\n374\n00:20:53.227 --> 00:20:56.637\nAnd now, take a look at\nthe difference here, Zach, okay?\n\n375\n00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:59.778\nNotice on the other one that\nwas unprotected, right?\n\n376\n00:20:59.778 --> 00:21:01.390\nRequest a read receipt.\n\n377\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.886\nRequest a delivery receipt.\n\n378\n00:21:03.886 --> 00:21:06.328\nNow, on the one that's protected.\n\n379\n00:21:06.328 --> 00:21:09.254\nNotice that I have these\ntwo additional options.\n\n380\n00:21:09.254 --> 00:21:12.305\nSo I told you, it's not like\ngoing to a concert and expecting,\n\n381\n00:21:12.305 --> 00:21:15.934\neverybody is roaring, cheering, and\nthen all the lights kinda drop, and\n\n382\n00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:19.793\nthen the lights come up and there,\nthey are, they're on stage, and everybody\n\n383\n00:21:19.793 --> 00:21:23.732\nis cheering and going nuts because they're\non stage and they're ready to play.\n\n384\n00:21:23.732 --> 00:21:27.763\nThis is more like, all right,\nwhat did you really do?\n\n385\n00:21:27.763 --> 00:21:31.494\n[LAUGH] well you did this, and\nyou go is that really important?\n\n386\n00:21:31.494 --> 00:21:33.598\nEncrypt the message.\n\n387\n00:21:33.598 --> 00:21:35.430\nYeah, that's really important, right?\n\n388\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.378\nDigitally sign this message.\n\n389\n00:21:37.378 --> 00:21:39.666\nThat's really important stuff, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:39.666 --> 00:21:43.600\nBecause the only way that you actually get\nto decrypt this message is if you are part\n\n391\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.093\nof this organization, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:45.093 --> 00:21:49.334\nThe only yes you get to check out that\ndigital signature again is part of that\n\n393\n00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:50.288\norganization.\n\n394\n00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:53.385\nSo you don't have that and\nyou're outside the organization right now,\n\n395\n00:21:53.385 --> 00:21:55.884\naccording to those templates,\nyou don't get it, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:55.884 --> 00:21:59.208\nSo that's the way that this ends\nup working out for us here,\n\n397\n00:21:59.208 --> 00:22:02.760\nin the end result,\nin the ultimate test of what we do.\n\n398\n00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.377\nSo that also means that if\nyou're in Office 2016 and\n\n399\n00:22:05.377 --> 00:22:09.172\nyou're pushing out emails through the\nclient there or you're working in Word.\n\n400\n00:22:09.172 --> 00:22:13.548\nYou'll get those options, too,\nbuilt into those applications.\n\n401\n00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:16.070\nAnd you'll be able to actually\ndiscover that and go all right,\n\n402\n00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.557\nI actually have the rights\nmanagement protection turned on.\n\n403\n00:22:18.557 --> 00:22:22.954\nAnd that can actually be done very easily\nand get all that set up here, okay?\n\n404\n00:22:22.954 --> 00:22:26.221\nBut just kinda realize it is a part\nof everything that we can do here.\n\n405\n00:22:26.221 --> 00:22:28.152\nRights management is gonna be important,\n\n406\n00:22:28.152 --> 00:22:31.650\nespecially if you have sensitive\ndocumentation inside your organization.\n\n407\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.918\nAnd you need to make sure\nit remains private or\n\n408\n00:22:33.918 --> 00:22:36.556\nit remains confidential in\nthe way that you need to.\n\n409\n00:22:36.556 --> 00:22:40.501\nRights management is the way to go and\nwe've now also shown you how you\n\n410\n00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:44.500\ncan actually create a template for\nprotecting email as well.\n\n411\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.174\nSo Zach, that really does help us to round\nout some of the knowledge that we need\n\n412\n00:22:48.174 --> 00:22:51.470\nwhen we start talking about\nadministering Azure rights management.\n\n413\n00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.222\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, great and valuable information,\nthanks for adding that on too by the way.\n\n414\n00:22:55.222 --> 00:22:57.133\nSo administer Azure rights\nmanagement part three.\n\n415\n00:22:57.133 --> 00:22:59.706\nThere's a part one,\nthere's a part two, watch them all.\n\n416\n00:22:59.706 --> 00:23:04.740\nIn fact, watch everything in\nthe Office 365 series, it's good stuff.\n\n417\n00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.177\nAnd also go to our course library,\nhundreds of videos there,\n\n418\n00:23:08.177 --> 00:23:11.166\nall designed for one reason,\nto help you go further.\n\n419\n00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:15.506\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be very glad you did.\n\n420\n00:23:15.506 --> 00:23:17.380\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n421\n00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.157\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n422\n00:23:19.157 --> 00:23:26.548\n[MUSIC]\n\n423\n00:23:26.548 --> 00:23:29.188\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.449\n&gt;&gt; Hello again, thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.750\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.810\nI'm your host, Zack Memes.\n\n8\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.690\nThis is Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.200\nAnd we're gonna be managing Office 365\nadministrator roles with Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.610\nHey, Ronnie good to see you again sir.\n\n11\n00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.420\nThanks for being here.\n\n12\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.270\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back here on\nthe show as we continue on taking a look,\n\n13\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.720\nof course, at Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.650\nAnd now we're moving into the realm\nof starting to manage a few of\n\n15\n00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.710\nthe administrative roles that we have.\n\n16\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.810\nAnd we'll also, of course,\n\n17\n00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.730\nprobably in future episodes take a look\nat managing just identities, of course.\n\n18\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.510\nUsers that get added in, and\nthen even groups a little bit later on.\n\n19\n00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.009\nBut this show is specifically talking\nabout those ideas of the different\n\n20\n00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.224\nadministrative roles that\nare available inside of Office 365.\n\n21\n00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.240\nAnd it's very important that we\nactually understand what they are?\n\n22\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.866\nAnd of course, how do we actually\nassign users to them too?\n\n23\n00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.470\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what administrative\nroles do we actually have to assign?\n\n24\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.210\n&gt;&gt; Yep, well that's a good\nquestions because it seems like\n\n25\n00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.200\nyou really don't have kind of to\nthinking about it in two ways, right?\n\n26\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.630\nIn all practicality,\n\n27\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.610\nif you have actually created yourself as\nan attendant administrator, in theory as\n\n28\n00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.830\nlong as you're willing to manage\nthe entirety of Office 365 by yourself.\n\n29\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.750\nYou don't need any other roles, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.270\nNow, but the problem with that though\nis that it's not scalable, right?\n\n31\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.082\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; But an organization that begins\n\n32\n00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:37.394\nwith five or ten people,\n\n33\n00:01:37.394 --> 00:01:40.970\nthat attendant administrator is\nprobably gonna be able to do that.\n\n34\n00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.430\nAnd as long as it says at around five or\nten people,\n\n35\n00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.040\nthere's probably never a need to start\nassigning administrative roles at all.\n\n36\n00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.920\nWhy?\nBecause when they're signed in,\n\n37\n00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.890\nthey're considered\nthe Global administrator and\n\n38\n00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.610\nthat Global administrator gives them\nthe permissions for everything, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.440\nIt doesn't matter what you need done.\n\n40\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.514\nThat one person can actually do anything\nthat we need them to do administratively.\n\n41\n00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:09.912\nBut Zach, the problem that we have is\nsimple, just like what we know and what\n\n42\n00:02:09.912 --> 00:02:14.821\nwe've actually discovered and found out\nover years, and years, of working in IT.\n\n43\n00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.733\nA network rarely remains static and\nwhat that means, of course is that, and\n\n44\n00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.511\na couple of things right,\none in terms of just equipment.\n\n45\n00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:28.470\nThe equipment may remain the same, but the\ntechnology continues to change behind it.\n\n46\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.600\nOperating systems get upgraded.\n\n47\n00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.644\nTechnology that we used two or\nthree years ago, is no longer viable, so\n\n48\n00:02:33.644 --> 00:02:35.392\nwe switch it out with other technology.\n\n49\n00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:36.865\n&gt;&gt; Or two weeks ago for\nthat matter, [LAUGH]\n\n50\n00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Or two weeks ago sometimes.\n\n51\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.330\nYeah, there's no doubt,\nit becomes a little bit quicker,\n\n52\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.280\nbut also the people in your\norganization from a year ago\n\n53\n00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.140\nmight be starkly different\nthan the people you have now.\n\n54\n00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.620\nAnd even the idea of the size of\nthe organization continues to change.\n\n55\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.250\nSo good example of that Zach, is IT ProTV.\n\n56\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.562\nZach, even since you've\ncome on board at ITProTV,\n\n57\n00:02:58.562 --> 00:03:01.170\nthere's been several additions, right?\n\n58\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.990\nKind of struggling, right?\n\n59\n00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.108\n&gt;&gt; Yes, since May 2017, several editions.\n\n60\n00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:07.613\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it starts to startle you,\n\n61\n00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:12.720\nwait a minute since I've been on board,\nwe've hired so many more.\n\n62\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.510\nYeah, Zach can look around the room\nin our morning standard and go, wow,\n\n63\n00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.120\nthere's a lot more people\nhere now than there were.\n\n64\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.130\nWhen Zack was first hired on and\n\n65\n00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.480\nwhen I was first hired on it\nwas really like five of us.\n\n66\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.930\n&gt;&gt; Goodness.\n&gt;&gt; There was five and\n\n67\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170\nthen we were just kinda standing\naround just in a room and just saying,\n\n68\n00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.161\nall right what are we doing today?\n\n69\n00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:33.228\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And that was pretty much it, and\n\n70\n00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:36.303\nit took us all about 35,\n40 seconds to do so.\n\n71\n00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:39.388\nBut now,\norganizations continue to change and\n\n72\n00:03:39.388 --> 00:03:44.631\nwhen something like that happens and\nOffice 365 is a part of that technology,\n\n73\n00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:48.870\nnow you have to be getting\nthe idea of scalability, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.840\nBecause there's just not enough time for\none individual to manage anything anymore.\n\n75\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.050\nSo that means that what we have\nto do is we now have to depend\n\n76\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.330\non the idea of actually adding\nin some more administrators.\n\n77\n00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.630\nNow in theory Zach,\n\n78\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.780\nif I wanted to I could give everybody\nthe idea that tenet administrator rights.\n\n79\n00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.930\nThe Global administrator make them\nresponsible for everything that goes on.\n\n80\n00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.890\nThat's not best practice nor is it good\npractice to do something like that.\n\n81\n00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.508\nBecause there are areas that we really\ndon't want certain people to be able to\n\n82\n00:04:21.508 --> 00:04:22.677\nchange and manipulate,\n\n83\n00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:26.201\nand then there's other things that we\ndon't really want them to control.\n\n84\n00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.935\nSo instead we can separate those out, and\n\n85\n00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:34.120\nin Office 365 they gave us several\ndifferent roles that we wanna consider.\n\n86\n00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.691\nSo let's take a look at how we can\nactually see these different roles, and\n\n87\n00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.889\nlet's talk about each\nof them just briefly.\n\n88\n00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.732\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna go\n\n89\n00:04:40.732 --> 00:04:41.570\ninto a super deep dive.\n\n90\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.100\nWe've already talked about them\na little bit in a previous episode.\n\n91\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.167\nBut this is a good refresher and\n\n92\n00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:46.903\nit's actually something\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n93\n00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:47.620\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n\n94\n00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.250\n&gt;&gt; So here it is,\n\n95\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.370\nI've logged in as our Global\nadministrator right now at Cherokee.\n\n96\n00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.540\nAnd I'm going to select the Admin tile.\n\n97\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.040\nAnd once I do so that should bring me\ninto the Office 365 Admin center for\n\n98\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.380\nmy tenancy.\n\n99\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.310\nAnd now, underneath the first\ngrouping here that we see\n\n100\n00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.120\non the Admin center under Users,\nI'm going to select Users.\n\n101\n00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.020\nThat should help me to focus in and\n\n102\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.190\nthese are the accounts we've been working\nwith since the beginning of the show.\n\n103\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.292\nSo here on the first day of our\nshooting of 70-346 when Zack on air,\n\n104\n00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:27.193\nCherokee and I did the show,\nand I signed on and\n\n105\n00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:31.010\ncreated the Global administrator account.\n\n106\n00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:34.710\nSo you see where it's actually\nthe Global administrator here.\n\n107\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.780\nBut if I am doing this for\nanother organization, right?\n\n108\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.545\nZach, I've kind of mentioned this before.\n\n109\n00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:41.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If I'm the one setting this up,\n\n110\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.010\nI really don't want to\nuse this account again.\n\n111\n00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.410\nNow do I still have all those privileges?\n\n112\n00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.700\nYes, but if I'm not actually really\na part of that organization.\n\n113\n00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.703\nThen the rest of the configuration\nof everything that I do,\n\n114\n00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:57.872\nit shouldn't be under my name.\n\n115\n00:05:57.872 --> 00:06:02.768\nIt shouldn't be tied to me in any way so\nthat's when we also took Cherokee's\n\n116\n00:06:02.768 --> 00:06:07.520\nrole here, and then we also assigned\nher the Global administrator role.\n\n117\n00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.880\nNow how did I do that?\n\n118\n00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.391\nWell, let me double click\non Cherokee's account here.\n\n119\n00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:16.458\nAnd now,\nwhen you hashly do something like this,\n\n120\n00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.670\nyou can now see here it\nis Cherokee's account.\n\n121\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.939\nLet's scroll down, we are looking under\nCherokee's account, and were looking for\n\n122\n00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:24.570\nwhat it says role.\n\n123\n00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.875\nAnd you see where it says\nGlobal administrator.\n\n124\n00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:29.470\nAnd at the beginning of that\nshe didn't have any in role.\n\n125\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.770\nSo if I select Edit, now you could\nsee where we were able to do that.\n\n126\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.680\nNow, I was logged in as me, as Ronnie,\nand then I was able to select this.\n\n127\n00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.290\nBut notice the Global administrator\ncannot edit their own security settings,\n\n128\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.790\nit requires another Global\nadministrator to do so.\n\n129\n00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.760\n&gt;&gt; So like, you got like a super admin,\nis that what the deal is here?\n\n130\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is kinda the same thing, but\n\n131\n00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.260\nat this point you can see that this\nis where we can go to assign that.\n\n132\n00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.850\nNow, once we did that though, Zach, okay?\n\n133\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.185\nWe also ended up creating an account for\nyou, Zach.\n\n134\n00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:04.046\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And this is where I'm logged in as\n\n135\n00:07:04.046 --> 00:07:08.550\nCherokee as you see up here, and I believe\nwe made you some type of administrator.\n\n136\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.140\nPassword administrator is what we also\nassigned to you, and I click Edit.\n\n137\n00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.174\nAnd it's right here, signed in this\nCherokee, notice that I could actually\n\n138\n00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:21.166\ncreate now Zach,\nas a Global administrator wanted too.\n\n139\n00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:25.590\nOr we're really focusing on these\nparticular administrator roles right\n\n140\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.000\nhere, okay?\n\n141\n00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.860\nSo when we start talking about\nthese types of administrative roles\n\n142\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.525\nit is because that you realize your\norganization is going to scale out, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.027\nAnd that's important, understanding\nthe possibilities of scaling up and\n\n144\n00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:41.936\nscaling out is actually something\nthat we want to understand.\n\n145\n00:07:41.936 --> 00:07:42.712\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n146\n00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.370\n&gt;&gt; Administratively, when we start talking\nwere normally talking about scaling\n\n147\n00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.144\nout-\n&gt;&gt; Right\n\n148\n00:07:47.144 --> 00:07:50.175\n&gt;&gt; Office 365 will allow us to scale up as\n\n149\n00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:51.609\nmuch as we want to.\n\n150\n00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:57.618\nZach, we can add from five users today,\nor two users To 10,000 users in a day,\n\n151\n00:07:57.618 --> 00:08:02.472\nOffice 365 says I can scale up to do that,\nit's no big deal.\n\n152\n00:08:02.472 --> 00:08:05.096\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; But administratively though, Zach,\n\n153\n00:08:05.096 --> 00:08:10.151\nthat's an impossibility, with just\nCherokee being the global administrator,\n\n154\n00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:12.890\nand you just being the password reset.\n\n155\n00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.248\nWith 10,000 users, if 9,000 of\nthose people right now, Zach, say,\n\n156\n00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:18.646\nI need my password reset.\n\n157\n00:08:18.646 --> 00:08:23.372\nAnd they have to come to you, that's 9,000\npassword resets that may take a little bit\n\n158\n00:08:23.372 --> 00:08:25.690\nmore time and challenge than you think.\n\n159\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.928\n&gt;&gt; And we might have to question\nwho we've hired [LAUGH].\n\n160\n00:08:27.928 --> 00:08:31.639\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but it kinda lets you know,\nright, that the scaling and\n\n161\n00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:36.096\nthe administrative side is when we start\ntalking about the idea of scaling out.\n\n162\n00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:39.633\nOkay, so when we start doing that,\nthen we start planning for\n\n163\n00:08:39.633 --> 00:08:44.540\nthe future a little bit and saying, all\nright, how do I need to scale out here?\n\n164\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.250\nWell, there's two different things that\ncan happen, if you are only scaling\n\n165\n00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.550\na little bit, I could also make Zach\nnot only the password administrator.\n\n166\n00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.090\nThat one's easy, and that's what\nI wanted to do at the beginning.\n\n167\n00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.834\nAnd right, this means that Zach is\nin charge of helping people to reset\n\n168\n00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:01.887\npasswords, allowing them to\ndo stuff like that as well.\n\n169\n00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:06.314\nBut I could also make Zach,\nif I wanted to, the billing administrator,\n\n170\n00:09:06.314 --> 00:09:08.790\nnotice that I can check mark both.\n\n171\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.242\nAnd that allows me to scale out a little\nbit, but not exactly a lot, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:13.242 --> 00:09:17.949\n&gt;&gt; So like in a smaller enterprise,\nI've noticed that they will assign one\n\n173\n00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:21.860\nperson or maybe two,\nall those roles, is that not right?\n\n174\n00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.310\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, so you can actually see that\nright here, it's fairly simple to do so.\n\n175\n00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.700\nNow by default, when we start talking\nabout this idea of the administrator,\n\n176\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.960\nyou'll notice that there's a lot of\ndifferent administrators right here.\n\n177\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.357\nBut really, kinda the ones\nthat we're centered in around,\n\n178\n00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:40.506\nespecially when we start talking about\nscaling up and scaling out here, okay?\n\n179\n00:09:40.506 --> 00:09:45.463\nWe're really talking about this idea of\nthe billing administrator, the Exchange\n\n180\n00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:50.493\nadministrator, the password administrator,\nthe Skype administrator, service\n\n181\n00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:56.140\nadministrator, SharePoint administrator,\nand user management administrator.\n\n182\n00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.340\nSo in this one, it's seven roles, but\nif you include global administrator,\n\n183\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.040\nit becomes eight.\n\n184\n00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.341\nSo those are kinda the default\nones that are right there.\n\n185\n00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:08.096\nNow, the great thing is,\nwith the global administrator,\n\n186\n00:10:08.096 --> 00:10:11.347\nwhen they're actually the ones\ncreating and setting everything up,\n\n187\n00:10:11.347 --> 00:10:14.490\nthat's pretty much all you\nreally want to use that one for.\n\n188\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.080\nBut at the beginning here, you may\nactually consider adding in one of these,\n\n189\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.218\nif not all of these, depending on\nwhat you actually end up needing.\n\n190\n00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:26.066\nSo the billing administrator makes sense,\nsomebody needs to\n\n191\n00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:30.285\npurchase additional subscriptions for\nyour tenant if you need to.\n\n192\n00:10:30.285 --> 00:10:35.245\nOr can actually say, I'm not gonna pay for\nthose anymore, and reduce that,\n\n193\n00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:38.620\nwell, the billing\nadministrator can handle that.\n\n194\n00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.870\nExchange administrators are, of course,\nfor those that handle the email services.\n\n195\n00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.600\nSkype for Business is those that actually\nhandle the idea of the collaboration as\n\n196\n00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.300\nwell, a little bit of collaboration.\n\n197\n00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.384\nThe communication software\nsuch as Skype for Business,\n\n198\n00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:54.221\nand the SIP phones that you\nmay also be using as well.\n\n199\n00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:57.966\nServices administrator, of course, are all\nthe services that users are normally also\n\n200\n00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:00.303\nthinking about, and then,\nof course, SharePoint.\n\n201\n00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:01.789\nAnd then just user management,\n\n202\n00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:05.770\nsomebody to help somebody's user\naccount to get set up, all that stuff.\n\n203\n00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.790\nOnboarding, you name it,\nall that's actually possible for\n\n204\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.570\nus, depending on what we need set, okay.\n\n205\n00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.290\nSo in that sense,\n\n206\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:20.150\nyou do actually want to make sure that you\nknow these particular roles as well, okay.\n\n207\n00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.915\nSo just being able to do that\nwill really help us out,\n\n208\n00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:27.440\nin at least understanding the roles and\nwhat they actually allow us to do.\n\n209\n00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.710\nSo when it comes down to the time for\nthe exam, make sure you review these.\n\n210\n00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:36.750\nGo and take a look at some of the official\ndocumentation at Microsoft, and understand\n\n211\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:42.110\nsome of the differences between this, as\nyou start to actually set this stuff up.\n\n212\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:47.000\nIt is important that we are able to do it,\nso let's go ahead and do this.\n\n213\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.414\nI'm going to leave Zach's original here,\nand I can do it in a couple of ways.\n\n214\n00:11:51.414 --> 00:11:55.310\nI'm just gonna select Cancel,\nthat way I'm not changing his role.\n\n215\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:01.237\nSo inside of the interface,\nit's simple enough to be able to do.\n\n216\n00:12:01.237 --> 00:12:05.445\nAnd I wish I could tell you that it was\ndifficult, but it's really not difficult\n\n217\n00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:06.160\n&gt;&gt; It doesn't look difficult.\n\n218\n00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.845\n&gt;&gt; So let's add in an additional user, so\nup here on the upper left hand corner,\n\n219\n00:12:10.845 --> 00:12:14.620\nI've got to make sure I'm\nlooking at it correctly here.\n\n220\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.670\nIn the upper left hand corner of\nthe screen, I'm gonna select add user.\n\n221\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.380\nAnd here in the first user here,\n\n222\n00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.330\nlet's add in another person for\nus, and I'll simply add in Daniel.\n\n223\n00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.380\nAll righty, and\nwe'll just add in Daniel here.\n\n224\n00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:45.040\nAnd now on the password,\nI'm just gonna let it auto-generate.\n\n225\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.458\nI'm not gonna worry about changing\nthe password at this point,\n\n226\n00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:49.531\nbecause we're not gonna use it for\nmuch at this point.\n\n227\n00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:53.713\nThen add in a role, and\nnow when we get to this point, right,\n\n228\n00:12:53.713 --> 00:12:59.053\nnotice that it really only gives us three\noptions, then it gives us the rest.\n\n229\n00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:03.684\nAll I have to do is select customize\nadministrator, and then right here,\n\n230\n00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:07.260\nthis is where we can add\nin some other one, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.340\nNow, when we start to take a look at this,\nthough, Zach, and\n\n232\n00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.030\nremember what I said\nat the very beginning.\n\n233\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:18.190\nWe can actually make sure that\nevery single one of these roles\n\n234\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.450\nis assigned to a single individual.\n\n235\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.451\nBut also, if I needed to,\nbecause my organization's not big,\n\n236\n00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:29.266\nI can actually make Daniel, let's say\nboth of these, if I choose to, okay,\n\n237\n00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.580\nto be able to do something like this.\n\n238\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.874\nAnd that way we can, again,\nscale up a little bit, but\n\n239\n00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:38.710\nalso continue to scale out if\nI have enough people, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.425\nThen the idea of actually assigning\neach one an administrative role does\n\n241\n00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:48.215\nhelp us to delegate, and allows us to\nscale that out a bit more and better,\n\n242\n00:13:48.215 --> 00:13:50.090\nto be able to do this as well.\n\n243\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.332\nBut in a small organization you may find\nout, this is probably more realistic than\n\n244\n00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:58.060\njust a single person getting\nassigned a single role, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.285\nSo it's easy enough,\nwe do something like that.\n\n246\n00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:05.568\nAnd then an alternative\ne-mail address here,\n\n247\n00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:11.036\nI'm just gonna have them all\nsent to Cherokee for right now.\n\n248\n00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:17.042\nAnd then the product license at this\npoint, do I want to go ahead and\n\n249\n00:14:17.042 --> 00:14:19.150\nassign him a license or not?\n\n250\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.700\nThat's up to you, and usually you go ahead\nand do that right when you're ready to go.\n\n251\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.965\nAnd then click Add, and\nnow with this in mind,\n\n252\n00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:37.615\nDaniel has now been set as the actual\nadministrator for this organization.\n\n253\n00:14:37.615 --> 00:14:42.288\nSo, I can select, send an email,\nand close, and there we go,\n\n254\n00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:44.782\nokay, it is done and-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n255\n00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:46.935\n&gt;&gt; Simple enough to actually be able to\n\n256\n00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:47.657\ndo, okay.\n\n257\n00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:53.820\nNow, once I do that here, okay, what\nif I actually needed to do this again?\n\n258\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.479\nBut, like everything else,\nZach, that I need to do this,\n\n259\n00:14:58.479 --> 00:15:00.726\nbut in PowerShell instead.\n\n260\n00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:05.564\nYes, well, once we actually have to do\nthis in PowerShell, it may require us,\n\n261\n00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:10.806\nof course, to actually do just a couple\nof other things to help us out as well.\n\n262\n00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:14.790\n&gt;&gt; So why don't you just briefly do, do\nwe need to do it in PowerShell and here,\n\n263\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.870\nor not?\n\n264\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay, it depends on your level of\naccess and what you feel comfortable with.\n\n265\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.213\nNow, we're doing it both in the GUI\nbecause you'll likely see that on\n\n266\n00:15:24.213 --> 00:15:25.190\nthe exam.\n\n267\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.840\nThere's no discounting that\nthe push from Microsoft\n\n268\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.890\nto understand it in PowerShell more\nis also a hefty part of it too.\n\n269\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.554\nSo it doesn't means you always will, but\nthe idea of actually learning how to do it\n\n270\n00:15:38.554 --> 00:15:42.216\nin PowerShell will make you\nquicker on the administrative end.\n\n271\n00:15:42.216 --> 00:15:45.562\nAnd, of course,\ngive you a better technical sense and\n\n272\n00:15:45.562 --> 00:15:48.610\nskill of what has to be\naccomplished as well.\n\n273\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.103\nAnd everything is about least\nadministrative effort, well, for them.\n\n274\n00:15:52.103 --> 00:15:56.670\nBelieve it or not, running in PowerShell's\nactually less administrative effort.\n\n275\n00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.268\nThen you logging in and\ndoing this and doing that, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:03.670\nSo let's take a look at that aspect too,\nright?\n\n277\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.652\nI'm gonna minimize this for\na moment, then we are gonna open up\n\n278\n00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:13.353\nour PowerShell window inside and\nrun as an administrator.\n\n279\n00:16:13.353 --> 00:16:17.270\nMake sure the font looks good, which it\nactually looks pretty good at this point.\n\n280\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.880\nNow once we've actually got\nsomething like this going, okay?\n\n281\n00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:27.180\nI need to connect,\nright now if I run PowerShell here\n\n282\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.580\non my local Windows machine\nthat I'm running, okay?\n\n283\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.150\nIt affects what?\n\n284\n00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.787\nWell really this machine, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:33.787 --> 00:16:38.870\nIs what it affects, but where I decided\nand what I told you Zach, right?\n\n286\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.541\nIs that we want to run the PowerShell and\nhave it affect Office 365.\n\n287\n00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:44.436\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n288\n00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.960\nSo just to show you,\n\n289\n00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.220\nhere are the users that we have\nright now inside of Office 365.\n\n290\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.092\nAnd so here I am inside of PowerShell, so\n\n291\n00:16:54.092 --> 00:16:58.579\nI need to make a connection into\nthe Office 365 world first.\n\n292\n00:16:58.579 --> 00:17:04.311\nSo I'm gonna do my Set-ExecutionPolicy and\nwe're gonna kinda\n\n293\n00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:10.370\njust do the default setting here\nwhich is RemoteSigned and say Yes.\n\n294\n00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.326\nThen I'm gonna create credential to allow\n\n295\n00:17:17.326 --> 00:17:22.769\nme to sign in to Office\n365 a variable here,\n\n296\n00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:26.552\nand is gonna get-credential.\n\n297\n00:17:26.552 --> 00:17:30.150\nAnd now it's gonna give\nme this dialog box.\n\n298\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.531\nAnd I probably haven't said this before,\n\n299\n00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.906\neven though I've been using\nthis throughout the show.\n\n300\n00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:40.286\nThere is many of us in this dialog\nbox that we're seeing right here.\n\n301\n00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:44.850\nLet me see if I can zoom out here for\na second and then zoom back in, okay?\n\n302\n00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:49.051\nThere's many of us that have actually come\nto this point here under the username.\n\n303\n00:17:49.051 --> 00:17:54.232\nWe're used to using that pre\nWindows 2000 convention where it's\n\n304\n00:17:54.232 --> 00:17:59.550\ndomain name/username don't do\nthat here in this credential.\n\n305\n00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.339\nAlways use the one that looks\nlike the email address.\n\n306\n00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:05.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say something wrong,\n\n307\n00:18:05.624 --> 00:18:06.547\nI knew that was gonna happen.\n\n308\n00:18:06.547 --> 00:18:10.656\nSo always use the one that looks\nlike the email address instead,\n\n309\n00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:13.254\nthat is actually prefered here, okay?\n\n310\n00:18:13.254 --> 00:18:14.057\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n311\n00:18:14.057 --> 00:18:18.459\n&gt;&gt; So just as a warning, if you actually\ngo ahead and try to do that and\n\n312\n00:18:18.459 --> 00:18:23.920\nit doesn't actually ever bring you to any\nfruition in terms of that credential.\n\n313\n00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.517\nAnd it always keeps telling you\nthat credentials are wrong.\n\n314\n00:18:26.517 --> 00:18:32.710\nChange it from that domain/username\nto this is what you wanna do.\n\n315\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.090\nAnd then I have type in\nthis super secret password.\n\n316\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.385\n&gt;&gt; The super secret password.\n\n317\n00:18:37.385 --> 00:18:42.824\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and normally,\nit shouldn't be that much of a challenge.\n\n318\n00:18:42.824 --> 00:18:47.096\nExcept that this is actually\na very long password.\n\n319\n00:18:47.096 --> 00:18:48.727\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n320\n00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:53.441\n&gt;&gt; Is an understatement.\n\n321\n00:18:53.441 --> 00:18:54.652\n&gt;&gt; Security is important.\n\n322\n00:18:54.652 --> 00:19:00.230\n&gt;&gt; It is important, and we wanted to make\nsure that we got this done as well, okay?\n\n323\n00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.736\nNow as long as I've typed in\nthose credentials right, okay?\n\n324\n00:19:03.736 --> 00:19:04.551\nI'm okay.\n\n325\n00:19:04.551 --> 00:19:08.802\nRemember that that dialogue box as you\ndo that, it will allow you to type,\n\n326\n00:19:08.802 --> 00:19:11.144\nand mistype those credentials, okay?\n\n327\n00:19:11.144 --> 00:19:13.219\nIt'll take whatever you type in there.\n\n328\n00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:14.616\nIt's just creating a variable, and\n\n329\n00:19:14.616 --> 00:19:16.970\nit doesn't care if\nthe variable is wrong or not.\n\n330\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.847\nIt's assuming that you know what you're\ndoing, which is kind of bad with me.\n\n331\n00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:21.609\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's probably not a good idea that it\n\n332\n00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:24.010\nassumes that I know what I'm doing here.\n\n333\n00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.210\nBut that's what has to happen, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.650\nNow once we get to this point here, okay?\n\n335\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:37.242\nThis is where we can connect to\nthe Microsoft Online Service,\n\n336\n00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:42.939\nand then we can call up\nour credentials again.\n\n337\n00:19:42.939 --> 00:19:46.650\nDo this, and we'll give it a moment, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.083\nSo there it goes.\nSo now we can see something,\n\n339\n00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:51.820\nand I'll say I did it on purpose.\n\n340\n00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.327\nBut you can see what happens,\nthis is saying hey, something is wrong.\n\n341\n00:19:54.327 --> 00:19:56.200\nIt's not wrong with the connection here,\n\n342\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.620\ncuz it's telling me\nan authentication error.\n\n343\n00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.253\nSo all I have to do if I run this, and\nso this is a good moment for us here.\n\n344\n00:20:02.253 --> 00:20:05.740\nCuz it just means Ronnie,\nyou mistyped something.\n\n345\n00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.746\nAnd more than likely it's\nnot the actual username,\n\n346\n00:20:08.746 --> 00:20:10.735\nbecause I can spell the username.\n\n347\n00:20:10.735 --> 00:20:12.875\n&gt;&gt; It's a super secret password.\n\n348\n00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:13.820\n&gt;&gt; It pretty much.\n\n349\n00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.553\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n350\n00:20:14.553 --> 00:20:19.154\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna guarantee that,\nbecause it is very long.\n\n351\n00:20:19.154 --> 00:20:20.100\n&gt;&gt; And super secret.\n\n352\n00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:24.450\n&gt;&gt; And we'll try it one more time.\n\n353\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.020\nSo I've entered that in again, and\n\n354\n00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.363\nnow I can use my up arrows and try to\nrun that again, and there we go, okay?\n\n355\n00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:32.946\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n\n356\n00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:34.379\n&gt;&gt; So it's a good reminder for\n\n357\n00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:37.393\nus every once in a while to\nrun into that error and go.\n\n358\n00:20:37.393 --> 00:20:42.440\nI must have typed that in incorrectly and\nif you go, just use a simple password.\n\n359\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.458\nRemember that you're sending this square.\n\n360\n00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:47.473\nYou're sending it across\nthe network to Office 365, and\n\n361\n00:20:47.473 --> 00:20:51.510\neven though it's protected, you're still\nwanting to use best practice here.\n\n362\n00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.103\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n363\n00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:54.431\nthat's why I went ahead and\ndid this as well.\n\n364\n00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:59.660\nAnd make sure I added in a more complex\npassword as we're setting this up.\n\n365\n00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.332\n&gt;&gt; Can't be too safe.\n\n366\n00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:03.520\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nnow when we do this in PowerShell though,\n\n367\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.110\nthere's a couple of tricky things too,\nokay?\n\n368\n00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.830\nAnd those tricky things involve\nthe names that we can use.\n\n369\n00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.345\nSo some of the ones I told you Zach, like\nthe idea of the global administrator here.\n\n370\n00:21:15.345 --> 00:21:19.864\nLet me do something here,\nand type in get-msrole,\n\n371\n00:21:19.864 --> 00:21:24.293\nlet me go ahead and\nget that to the top of the screen.\n\n372\n00:21:24.293 --> 00:21:26.670\nAnd we'll try this again, so\nlet me clear the screen here.\n\n373\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.331\nAll right, so once I'm here,\nlet me show you something Zach here.\n\n374\n00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:34.150\nLet me do a get-msrole, okay?\n\n375\n00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.890\nNow I just realized something Zach,\ncuz I was typing this in.\n\n376\n00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.890\nI made a mistake here, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.578\nAnd I always do this, because I\nassume that that's all I need is,\n\n378\n00:21:43.578 --> 00:21:48.883\nthis msrole is Microsoft role, but\nit's Microsoft ol, online, okay?\n\n379\n00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:54.012\nmso, oops, let me see if I can do that,\n\n380\n00:21:54.012 --> 00:22:00.110\nmsol which I can't say, online role, okay?\n\n381\n00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.444\nSo if you're ever kind of like me and\nyou're unsure of that,\n\n382\n00:22:05.444 --> 00:22:11.841\nthe great thing is if you can get to\nthat point like msol and then like an R.\n\n383\n00:22:11.841 --> 00:22:13.937\nThen you can use your tab fill, and\n\n384\n00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:18.125\nthat should help you out to get\nto the point that you need to.\n\n385\n00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:20.861\nNow just when I say that,\nis that gonna be available on the exam?\n\n386\n00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:23.066\nI can't tell you,\nit's gonna be available on the exam, okay?\n\n387\n00:22:23.066 --> 00:22:24.215\n&gt;&gt; No, can't tell you.\n\n388\n00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:25.972\n&gt;&gt; And the reason why is I don't know.\n\n389\n00:22:25.972 --> 00:22:29.208\nA lot of times,\nyou will get multiple choice questions.\n\n390\n00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:31.859\nBut if they do happen to\nhave some type of simulator,\n\n391\n00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:34.167\nI can't tell you if it actually works or\nnot.\n\n392\n00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:37.939\nSo just learn both,\nthat's what I would suggest.\n\n393\n00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:40.104\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; Know what the actual command is, but\n\n394\n00:22:40.104 --> 00:22:43.090\nin real life this is how you\nwould end up doing this.\n\n395\n00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.245\nSo if I press Enter at this point, okay?\n\n396\n00:22:46.245 --> 00:22:49.300\nWhat I wanted us to see is that,\nyou take a look.\n\n397\n00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.377\nMicrosoft Online,\nwhen we do it through the PowerShell.\n\n398\n00:22:52.377 --> 00:22:54.756\nRemember I showed you like 8 or\n12 of those?\n\n399\n00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:55.978\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Different administrator roles-\n\n400\n00:22:55.978 --> 00:22:56.869\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.\n\n401\n00:22:56.869 --> 00:22:57.780\n&gt;&gt; That were there, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.103\nLook at this Zach,\n\n403\n00:22:59.103 --> 00:23:01.100\nit looks like that [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n404\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.024\n&gt;&gt; The list has kind of.\n\n405\n00:23:02.024 --> 00:23:03.249\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's gotten bigger.\n\n406\n00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of grown.\n\n407\n00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.831\nSo you see more inside of the PowerShell,\n\n408\n00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:13.636\nwhere you can really get a lot of stuff-\n&gt;&gt; More granular.\n\n409\n00:23:13.636 --> 00:23:14.853\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's amazing how much more you see.\n\n410\n00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:17.884\n&gt;&gt; And what I wanted to ask you also is,\n\n411\n00:23:17.884 --> 00:23:22.948\nthe eight admin roles we looked\nat earlier from the 365.\n\n412\n00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:25.792\nAre those very important to memorize,\nfor our exam?\n\n413\n00:23:25.792 --> 00:23:27.623\n&gt;&gt; Well they're important to know, right?\n\n414\n00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:28.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.\n\n415\n00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.682\n&gt;&gt; As far as memorizing,\nI'm not so sure about-\n\n416\n00:23:30.682 --> 00:23:31.764\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n417\n00:23:31.764 --> 00:23:34.842\n&gt;&gt; But the idea is actually, undesrtsand\nmost of them are fairly intuitive for\n\n418\n00:23:34.842 --> 00:23:36.684\nyou to figure out which one that you need.\n\n419\n00:23:36.684 --> 00:23:37.487\n&gt;&gt; Certainly.\n\n420\n00:23:37.487 --> 00:23:40.161\n&gt;&gt; But\nat least take a look at those roles, okay?\n\n421\n00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:41.412\n&gt;&gt; How about memorizing all of that?\n\n422\n00:23:41.412 --> 00:23:42.183\n&gt;&gt; No-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n423\n00:23:42.183 --> 00:23:43.686\n&gt;&gt; Don't worry about that, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:47.055\nBut I do wanna show you a couple things\nwhere I told you that the langauge gets\n\n425\n00:23:47.055 --> 00:23:48.085\na little bit unusual.\n\n426\n00:23:48.085 --> 00:23:48.747\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n427\n00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:51.079\n&gt;&gt; Remember the global administrator\nrole that I talked about, Zack?\n\n428\n00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:51.737\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n429\n00:23:51.737 --> 00:23:56.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, notice that in this one though,\nthere is no global administrator role.\n\n430\n00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.491\nOkay, so\nin this entire list you can go through,\n\n431\n00:23:59.491 --> 00:24:04.930\nthere is no global administrator role, but\nthere is one called Company Administrator.\n\n432\n00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.370\nGo figure.\n\n433\n00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.912\nAnd if I look at the description, Company\nAdministrator role has full access to\n\n434\n00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:14.480\nperform any operation,\nessentially in the tenth.\n\n435\n00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.090\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a global admin.\n\n436\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.522\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, but notice this one says,\nCompany Administrator.\n\n437\n00:24:19.522 --> 00:24:23.921\nNow, the reason why I want to\npoint something like this out,\n\n438\n00:24:23.921 --> 00:24:26.240\nis because you may see that.\n\n439\n00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.560\nAnd you may actually see, well let's say\nfor an example, which of the following\n\n440\n00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.120\ncommands would allow you to\nassign a global administrator?\n\n441\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.290\nJust take something like that just for\nan example, right?\n\n442\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.720\nAnd they give you a, b, c,\nor d, and you go, alright.\n\n443\n00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.330\nWell, how would I actually\nstart typing that out?\n\n444\n00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.865\nWell lets go ahead and\ntake a look at that for a moment as well.\n\n445\n00:24:47.865 --> 00:24:50.250\nWell let me see if I can\nget out of this thing.\n\n446\n00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.580\nAnd then zoom back in there,\nthere we go, okay.\n\n447\n00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.660\nSo if I wanted to,\nto do something like that, right?\n\n448\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.340\nSo it might be where the command, for\nus let me do a clear screen just for\n\n449\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.213\na moment, okay.\n\n450\n00:25:04.213 --> 00:25:10.947\nIs to Add-MsolRoleMember and\n\n451\n00:25:10.947 --> 00:25:15.352\nthen the role name.\n\n452\n00:25:15.352 --> 00:25:20.539\nNow on the roll name here,\nif I actually get something\n\n453\n00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:25.624\nlike this where I see\nglobal administrator, okay?\n\n454\n00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:29.590\nWell Zach, that probably wouldn't be\nthe actual global administrator role.\n\n455\n00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.090\nIt reads it that way, but\nremember what we saw.\n\n456\n00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:34.750\n&gt;&gt; We saw company.\n\n457\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.930\n&gt;&gt; It said Company, Administrator.\n\n458\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.971\nAll right, then all we have to do is\nactually assign it to a particular person.\n\n459\n00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:51.955\nIf I go, RoleMember and I'm looking for\n\n460\n00:25:51.955 --> 00:25:55.350\nemail address here.\n\n461\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.490\nThen I type in Daniel, who's the only\none that we've added in at this point.\n\n462\n00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:04.877\nLet's see if I can zoom out,\ndaniel@itprovtvdemo,\n\n463\n00:26:04.877 --> 00:26:08.515\nif I have gotten that spelled right.\n\n464\n00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.080\nIt doesn't exist- I know what I did.\n\n465\n00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.705\nIt actually has a space in\nthe middle of this, that's me.\n\n466\n00:26:18.705 --> 00:26:20.145\n&gt;&gt; It's all about the details.\n\n467\n00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:21.515\n&gt;&gt; It is all about the details there.\n\n468\n00:26:21.515 --> 00:26:22.555\nI was like, why didn't they do it?\n\n469\n00:26:22.555 --> 00:26:25.255\nIt's because it's actually\ngot a space in it.\n\n470\n00:26:25.255 --> 00:26:26.875\nSo, when we do something like that,\n\n471\n00:26:26.875 --> 00:26:30.135\nI just used the global\nadministrator here as an example.\n\n472\n00:26:30.135 --> 00:26:35.110\nIf we now go back into the Office 365,\n\n473\n00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.460\nnow notice that Daniel's\nrole that we just added in.\n\n474\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.690\nRemember, we didn't really give him,\nactually we did, didn't we?\n\n475\n00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.260\nWe assigned him an administrative role.\n\n476\n00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.810\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n477\n00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.190\n&gt;&gt; So let's see, there we go.\n\n478\n00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.830\nSo the good thing is you can now see he's\nalso a global administrator as well.\n\n479\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.550\nSo it allows us to do that.\n\n480\n00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.215\n&gt;&gt; But in the PowerShell\nwe had to type in company-\n\n481\n00:26:56.215 --> 00:26:57.530\n&gt;&gt; Yup, instead of the other one.\n\n482\n00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.690\n&gt;&gt; Instead of global.\n\n483\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.504\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n484\n00:26:59.504 --> 00:27:04.540\nnow what if we want to remove that\nparticular role member as well?\n\n485\n00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.700\nSo on this one, we can do the same thing.\n\n486\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.645\nI'm just hitting the up\narrow at this point.\n\n487\n00:27:10.645 --> 00:27:14.936\nAnd now I want to, ops let me not do that,\n\n488\n00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:20.366\nI'm trying to get too fancy here,\nlet me just clear\n\n489\n00:27:20.366 --> 00:27:25.962\nthis thing out instead and\nthat way I don't do that.\n\n490\n00:27:25.962 --> 00:27:28.470\nAll right, so if I wanted to remove,\n\n491\n00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:34.160\nI just do Remove-MsolRoleMember and\nthen the role name here.\n\n492\n00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.324\nOops, role name,\n\n493\n00:27:41.324 --> 00:27:48.510\ncompany, administrator.\n\n494\n00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:49.290\nIf I can spell.\n\n495\n00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:57.160\nThen dash, role member email address.\n\n496\n00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.420\nBecause it's easy for me to remember.\n\n497\n00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.060\nAnd the email address.\n\n498\n00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.630\nAnd then I just do Daniel.\n\n499\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.557\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; @itprotvdemo.com,\n\n500\n00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:14.100\nAnd now if we go back and check this out.\n\n501\n00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.340\nOops, let me make sure I'm\ntelling you right, oop, this one.\n\n502\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.030\nAnd let's see if we can refresh this guy.\n\n503\n00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.630\nGive it a moment, you can now see where\nthe role has also been removed, okay?\n\n504\n00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.490\nSo just as easy and\nsimple when we do something that.\n\n505\n00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.919\nWhether you're actually doing\nit through the GI interface or\n\n506\n00:28:36.919 --> 00:28:38.796\nwhether you're doing\nit through PowerShell.\n\n507\n00:28:38.796 --> 00:28:41.496\nPowerShell requires you to be\na little bit more careful,\n\n508\n00:28:41.496 --> 00:28:45.220\nbecause you do need to pay attention to\nthose names but it's easy enough to do.\n\n509\n00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.840\nYou of course, on this one before you\nremove it just uncheck the check box.\n\n510\n00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.610\nBut in the other one make sure you pay\nattention to those syntax that we showed\n\n511\n00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.160\nyou to be able to add and\nremove these types of administrators.\n\n512\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.190\nAnd when you do so, it'll actually\nmake sure that you go through and\n\n513\n00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.560\ncheck them all out and\nbe able to see that.\n\n514\n00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.400\nBut do spend some time in the PowerShell,\ndo not neglect it just because you say,\n\n515\n00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.510\nI'll never learn that.\n\n516\n00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.000\nYou're going to have to use it for those\nof you heading onto to 70-347 after this.\n\n517\n00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.140\nYou'll see,\nwe'll kind of do the same things in there.\n\n518\n00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.100\nBut at the same time, you're not\ngoing to get away from PowerShell.\n\n519\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.610\nSo don't shy away from it, at least start\nright here and this will get you a healthy\n\n520\n00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.950\nfoundation at some of the things\nyou'll actually do repetitively.\n\n521\n00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.720\nAnd then you'll be able to start\nscripting them out in PowerShell,\n\n522\n00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.410\nwhich will make you much more powerful and\nmuch more efficient.\n\n523\n00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.305\nBut Zach, that's how we begin creating and\n\n524\n00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.610\ntaking a look at managing those\ndifferent administrator roles.\n\n525\n00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.837\n&gt;&gt;

wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.070\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.740\nAnd we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.950\nWe're gonna manage passwords and users.\n\n9\n00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.310\nAnd we have asked Ronnie Wong,\nour IT expert to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.330\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.450\nThanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me on the show, Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.879\nAs we continue to move forward through\nlearning a little bit more about managing\n\n14\n00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.058\nOffice 365, especially the identities and\npart of the name in the exam as well.\n\n15\n00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:43.540\nIt is a good part of what we\nactually have to be able do.\n\n16\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.610\nAnd we're jumping into that right now,\nwhere we're taking a look of course\n\n17\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.490\nat that idea of passwords,\nand of course users as well.\n\n18\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.640\nSo it's always that combination, right?\n\n19\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.855\nAuthentication is a big part of\nsomething that we all have to deal\n\n20\n00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:04.170\nwithin from pretty much at the beginning,\nespecially in cloud services as well.\n\n21\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.040\nAuthentication is huge and the reason why\nit's actually a big part of what we have\n\n22\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.370\nto do is that it's no\nlonger something I control.\n\n23\n00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210\nI am no longer the gatekeeper\n\n24\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.380\nin the sense that I know who gets\ninto my domain and who doesn't.\n\n25\n00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.300\nThe portal to get in is not\neven resided on my own network.\n\n26\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.691\nI'm not the one that actually\nset all of those policies up and\n\n27\n00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:29.165\nactually says who can get in and\nwho can't.\n\n28\n00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:33.500\nIt's Office 365 that does that,\nbut what we can do though right,\n\n29\n00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.908\nis to take advantage of some of the things\nthat they have put in place and\n\n30\n00:01:37.908 --> 00:01:42.320\nto manage that access a little bit\nbetter and to our own tenancy.\n\n31\n00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.020\nAnd that's what we want to\ntalk about a little bit today.\n\n32\n00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610\nSo when it comes down to it in\nterms of the idea of passwords.\n\n33\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.840\nWe've got to realize something at least\nI believe that this is going to happen.\n\n34\n00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.380\nPasswords are going to effectively\ngo away at some point in time.\n\n35\n00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.270\nBut, up until that point in time,\n\n36\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.690\nit doesn't mean that we get to abandon the\nidea of actually managing our passwords.\n\n37\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.280\nWe'd like to think that we can,\nbut we really can't do so.\n\n38\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.410\n&gt;&gt; A two-part question for you, Ronnie.\n\n39\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n40\n00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.451\n&gt;&gt; So first of all, I'm intrigued.\n\n41\n00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.360\nWhat's gonna replace the password?\n\n42\n00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.605\nIs it gonna be biometrics?\n\n43\n00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:18.770\nBut that's part of the question.\n\n44\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.350\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n45\n00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.799\nalso, passwords need to expire-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n46\n00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.090\n&gt;&gt; And they need to change often for\nsecurity?\n\n47\n00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's not doubt that both of\nthose are kinda things we wanna at least\n\n48\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.660\ndive into a little bit.\n\n49\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.550\nWe'll get kind of set up a little bit\nmore in terms of the authentication\n\n50\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.510\na little bit later.\n\n51\n00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.530\nBut what is actually gonna\nend up replacing passwords\n\n52\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.580\nis more than likely some type\nof multifactor authentication.\n\n53\n00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.210\nWhether it's biometrics or something else\nit's gonna be a combination of two things.\n\n54\n00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.154\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So it might be a pin number and\n\n55\n00:02:49.154 --> 00:02:52.151\nbiometrics or it might be an ID card and\nbiometrics or\n\n56\n00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:56.917\nit might be what we're doing now, and what\nI have almost effectively done with just\n\n57\n00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:01.368\nabout every online account except for\nthe test account I'm using right now.\n\n58\n00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:06.031\nAnd we'll probably get that before the end\nof the show, is that when I log in\n\n59\n00:03:06.031 --> 00:03:10.490\nit actually requires me to have another\ndevice on me before I can log in.\n\n60\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.700\nBut, I know that with my email accounts\nand even with my social media accounts.\n\n61\n00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.493\nI have to have my smartphone with me\nbefore or even, [CROSSTALK] let me log in.\n\n62\n00:03:19.493 --> 00:03:23.075\nTo even using my laptop,\nif I don't have that, it says no,\n\n63\n00:03:23.075 --> 00:03:25.260\nI'm not gonna let you log in.\n\n64\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.690\nSo, it really is actually going\nto be that, where you're seeing\n\n65\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.800\nthat multi-factor authentication is\ngoing to take over at some point.\n\n66\n00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.260\nOrganizations are gonna need\nto learn how to adapt to that.\n\n67\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.840\nBut like even though,\nI'd love to go all right,\n\n68\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.320\nwe're gonna just do that but\nthe problem is simple, right?\n\n69\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.150\nNot every organization\nmoves at a lightning pace.\n\n70\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.116\nNot every organization\nis a first adopter and\n\n71\n00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:52.952\nthat means that we still have to be able\nto have some of those things in place\n\n72\n00:03:52.952 --> 00:03:57.031\nthat will help us to effectively\nmanage the authentication.\n\n73\n00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:58.921\nBut really as far as anything else,\n\n74\n00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:03.610\nthe weakest part of our authentication\nis the password process itself, okay?\n\n75\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.860\nSo Zach, in terms of passwords they\ncan be pretty much stolen, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.999\nAnd the reason that they're actually\nstolen very easily a lot of times is they\n\n77\n00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.658\ndon't even have to come into contact with\nyou Zach, to actually steal your password.\n\n78\n00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:22.263\nMost people fall into regular patterns of\npasswords in the sense that they know that\n\n79\n00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:27.350\nthere's a limited set of passwords that\njust about everybody's used over time.\n\n80\n00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.410\nAnd the majority of those\nthat are stolen all the time,\n\n81\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.825\nare the ones that still have the word\npassword in the password itself.\n\n82\n00:04:33.825 --> 00:04:35.665\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I can't imagine\nanyone doing that still.\n\n83\n00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:37.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou don't think it would happen but\n\n84\n00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:40.505\non the Internet it still happens,\nand the very fact that\n\n85\n00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:44.525\na lot of the passwords that have\nactually remained unchanged over time.\n\n86\n00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:47.665\nWhat you were mentioning\nwas another factor.\n\n87\n00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:51.045\nSo even though you might have a company or\nmight have a,\n\n88\n00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:53.660\nlet's just take an individual and\nthen we'll move to a company.\n\n89\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.501\nAnd individual may have opened up\nan email account, let's say 20 years ago.\n\n90\n00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:01.224\nWhat are the chances that have actually\nchange the password if they don't told to\n\n91\n00:05:01.224 --> 00:05:01.890\nchange it?\n\n92\n00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.760\nProbably not good.\n\n93\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.750\nThey probably haven't change and all,\nit's probably still the same password\n\n94\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.210\nthat it opened up the account\nlet 20 years ago, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.560\nAnd when you think about that staggering\nkind of a fact in itself, right?\n\n96\n00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.823\nMore than likely, their email accounts\nare probably hacked fairly well,\n\n97\n00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:22.293\nand they're just waiting for that right\npiece of information to come across and\n\n98\n00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:23.567\npull that information too.\n\n99\n00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:28.040\nSo it's very easy, essentially, for\nsomebody to get access to the password.\n\n100\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.600\nBecause we do fall in those patterns and\nwe do tend to reuse these passwords\n\n101\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.505\nthat everybody on the planet\nhas used over and over again.\n\n102\n00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n103\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.920\n&gt;&gt; So it really limits that pool and\nthat idea.\n\n104\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.750\nSo some of the best practices of course\nover the decades that we've talk about and\n\n105\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.380\nthat we've ended up using.\n\n106\n00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.604\nOf course, is changing the passwords on a\nregular basis like what Zach were saying.\n\n107\n00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:50.490\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n108\n00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.400\n&gt;&gt; It absolutely helped and a some that\ndoes hard that most people don't like, but\n\n109\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.850\nas a best practice I try to do that.\n\n110\n00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.420\nSo even when I was teaching\nregular classrooms Zach, and\n\n111\n00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.880\nI told students that I try to follow my\nown teaching and I took all my accounts.\n\n112\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.070\nAnd I told it to tell me to change my\npasswords like every six weeks or so.\n\n113\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.330\nOr every four weeks, whatever it might be.\n\n114\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.160\nIt was annoying getting those particular\n\n115\n00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.770\nnotifications that said\nchange your password.\n\n116\n00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.106\nBut I'm realizing it was very\nimportant because if I don't do that,\n\n117\n00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:24.424\nI'm just giving an attacker more and\n\n118\n00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:27.882\nmore opportunity to simply\ntry their hack against me.\n\n119\n00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:28.760\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So, instead\n\n120\n00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.450\nchanging them makes them at least\nreset the same way that I have to.\n\n121\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.945\nAnd then, they actually get phased with\na new challenge in the same way I do to.\n\n122\n00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:37.880\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\ndo you use like a password locker?\n\n123\n00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.962\nDo you have an account somewhere\nthat stores your passwords,\n\n124\n00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:42.212\nhelps you out with that?\n\n125\n00:06:42.212 --> 00:06:46.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I use a password manager now as\nwell, and that also helps me too, and\n\n126\n00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:50.520\nthe very fact that I really don't even\nknow what my passwords are anymore.\n\n127\n00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.160\nAnd I know it seems strange but\nit really has helped me out to that point.\n\n128\n00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.503\nWhere if you were to say Ronnie,\ngive me all your money, or\n\n129\n00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:03.059\ngive me your account and\nyour authentication.\n\n130\n00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.969\nUse them, and password to this particular\naccount or I'm going to stab you or\n\n131\n00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:07.580\nshoot you.\n\n132\n00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.590\nI'd have to say you could do that,\nbut you're not gonna get it out of me\n\n133\n00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.560\nregardless because I don't\neven know what it really is.\n\n134\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.319\nSo in that sense I had that.\n\n135\n00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:21.100\nAnd I like my password manager because for\nme right, all I have to do is\n\n136\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.310\nthere's a little button on the side or\na little link that says auto change.\n\n137\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.280\nIn other words, it gives it the ability\nto say change it every so often.\n\n138\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.030\nSo it changes on a regular pattern\nthat I don't even know when and\n\n139\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.497\nhow it actually change?\n\n140\n00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:36.153\n&gt;&gt; Wow, it's great.\n\n141\n00:07:36.153 --> 00:07:37.687\n&gt;&gt; It just goes ahead and does it for me.\n\n142\n00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:39.730\nBut the only thing I do\nis manage that locker.\n\n143\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.530\nThat's all I have to do and\nthat's by me telling that one password.\n\n144\n00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.580\nNow, you again can argue the merits\nof that but at the same time,\n\n145\n00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.020\nevery single account that I have\nonline has a separate password to it.\n\n146\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.410\nAnd I know the way that I have set is at\nleast, I think it's 14 characters or not,\n\n147\n00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.440\n16 characters.\n\n148\n00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.135\nThat's one of those two, I'm gonna assume,\n\n149\n00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:01.669\nI'm gonna go higher end because I\nnormally kind of go to the extreme.\n\n150\n00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:06.013\nSo it's surprise 16 characters that\nare randomly generated as far as on\n\n151\n00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:07.320\nthe keyboard.\n\n152\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.282\nSo even if you're asking me remembering\n16 characters not exactly great,\n\n153\n00:08:12.282 --> 00:08:15.807\nat the same time all of my\nonline accounts are that way.\n\n154\n00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:18.571\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So it makes it much more of a challenge\n\n155\n00:08:18.571 --> 00:08:21.410\nwith Office 365 though, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.190\nMore than likely if you're\nactually the administrator,\n\n157\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.130\nit also means that your users and\nthis is where it comes down to it.\n\n158\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.890\nYou're probably not going to be able to do\nthat for every user unless your company\n\n159\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.490\nsays, here's what you're gonna\ndo you gonna use this way.\n\n160\n00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.554\nAnd you can implement policy that way and\n\n161\n00:08:35.554 --> 00:08:38.891\nthat's the easiest way to get\nadapted quickly is to tell people,\n\n162\n00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:42.182\nhere's what you're gonna use and\nyou've got to use it, okay?\n\n163\n00:08:42.182 --> 00:08:45.845\nBut not everybody will and not everybody\nwas who uses it effectively, so\n\n164\n00:08:45.845 --> 00:08:50.200\nyou gotta still deal with those types\nof remediations end up happening.\n\n165\n00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.690\nBut let's say that you're going,\nwe're not gonna use password managers.\n\n166\n00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.050\nWe're not doing any of that,\nthere's no way, okay?\n\n167\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.099\nAre there still things available to me\nthat I can at least take a look at in\n\n168\n00:09:01.099 --> 00:09:06.754\nterms of password policies that will help\nme to get this set up in Office 365?\n\n169\n00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.520\nAnd the answer is yes, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.909\nWell, is just actually really good for us.\n\n171\n00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:10.729\n&gt;&gt; Good deal.\n\n172\n00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:13.410\n&gt;&gt; So it allows us to be able\nto manage it a little bit more.\n\n173\n00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.290\nSo let's take a look at how we do\nthat right here on our screen.\n\n174\n00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.613\nOkay, so here it is,\n\n175\n00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:23.920\nI am logged into our Office 365 ITProTV\ndemo account that we've been using, okay?\n\n176\n00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.790\nSo here it is,\nwe're actually on Cherokee's log in.\n\n177\n00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.700\nWe're going to select the admin center,\n\n178\n00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.820\nand will of course give us the admin\ncenter for the entire tenancy itself.\n\n179\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.080\nAnd when we start talking about,\nof course,\n\n180\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.290\nthen managing the user's password,\nas well.\n\n181\n00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.900\nWe also want to, let's say,\ngo ahead and set up the idea,\n\n182\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.530\nthe expiration policies and\ndifferent aspects of that too.\n\n183\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.090\nSo over on the left hand\nside in the navigation pane\n\n184\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.070\nwhere I'm expanding this out.\n\n185\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.930\nAnd once I've expanded it out, I'm gonna\nscroll down to where it says Settings.\n\n186\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.720\nI'm gonna click on Settings and\nthen underneath Settings, I'm looking for\n\n187\n00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.470\nSecurity and privacy.\n\n188\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.780\nSo that is what I'm looking for\nwhich is Security and privacy.\n\n189\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.610\nI click once there.\n\n190\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.349\nNotice it brings me right off the bat and\n\n191\n00:10:13.349 --> 00:10:17.429\nlook right here at the very top,\nZach, Password policy.\n\n192\n00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:18.140\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n193\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.040\nSo go figure it actually is\nthe password policy, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.180\nSo in this sense the great thing is it\ngives me what the policy is currently.\n\n195\n00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.110\nSet the password policy for\nall users in your organization.\n\n196\n00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.030\nOkay, so it's a good one to\nactually kind of understand.\n\n197\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.500\nDays before the password expires and\n\n198\n00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.440\nthen days before a user is\nnotified about the expiration.\n\n199\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.910\nSo this at the very beginning helps\nus to set up this password policy.\n\n200\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.780\nNow let's take a look\nat how we modify that.\n\n201\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.080\nAnd the way that we do so is over on the\nright hand side when we can select Edit.\n\n202\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.900\nAnd once I click on Edit, you actually see\nthat you have three settings here, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.930\nNow, the first one that you really\ndon't want to use is right here, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.970\nWhere it says set the users\npassword to never expire.\n\n205\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.890\nNotice if you turn this on,\n\n206\n00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.650\npasswords will never expire for\nany user in your organization.\n\n207\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.680\nWe don't recommend it because\nit is a security risk.\n\n208\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.610\nSo do not use this setting.\n\n209\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.390\nNow you might be wondering like why\nwould you ever do something like this?\n\n210\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.770\nYou probably would not okay.\n\n211\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.890\nNow there are a couple of instances\nwhere you may choose to do that but\n\n212\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.860\nit's not because you said I'm\ngonna do this on purpose.\n\n213\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.550\nAnd there's a reason why\nI'm talking about that.\n\n214\n00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:46.050\nIf you end up setting up\na hybrid environment, right?\n\n215\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.600\nWhere you have\nan On-Premises Active Directory.\n\n216\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.620\nOkay, and you also are going\nto be in work in the cloud.\n\n217\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.900\nIf all of your users essentially\nare bound to that Active Directory,\n\n218\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:02.840\nin other words, everybody's that's\nactually in Office 365 is also in that\n\n219\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.410\nActive Directory network that's\ngoing to be linked in that way.\n\n220\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.510\nBut more than likely you want to\ncontrol the policy not through\n\n221\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.730\nthis portal right here, but\nthrough your group policy or\n\n222\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.920\nyour Active Directory policies instead and\nset it up there too.\n\n223\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.230\nSo in that sense, you probably\ndon't care too much about this but\n\n224\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.430\nmore than likely just leaving this one and\n\n225\n00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.410\nnot messing with it is probably\nthe best thing that you can do.\n\n226\n00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.670\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; So just real quick,\n\n227\n00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.945\ninstead we're using the GUI here but\nwe're also gonna be using Power Shell?\n\n228\n00:12:39.945 --> 00:12:41.908\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe can do it in PowerShell as well, but\n\n229\n00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:45.268\nat this point let's just try to take a\nlook at the options we have available and\n\n230\n00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:48.547\nthen we'll take a look at setting\nsomething else up in PowerShell as well.\n\n231\n00:12:48.547 --> 00:12:49.355\n&gt;&gt; I'm just pretty excited\nabout all this Ronnie.\n\n232\n00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:50.585\n&gt;&gt; Yup, okay.\n\n233\n00:12:50.585 --> 00:12:52.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so here it is.\n\n234\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:58.090\nNotice the days before passwords expire,\n730 days.\n\n235\n00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.000\nWhat is that about?\n\n236\n00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.030\n&gt;&gt; It's just too long.\n\n237\n00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's two years.\n\n238\n00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.240\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 365 times 2,\n\n239\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.710\nthat's about 730 days when we start\nto take a look at that here, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:16.500\nSo it will give you about two\nyears before the password expires.\n\n241\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.010\nNow, in your organization, right?\n\n242\n00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.800\nThat's probably too long but at the same\ntime, it depends on your organization.\n\n243\n00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.910\nYou're the one that's managing this, so\nyou need to set up the password policy.\n\n244\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.790\nThat is going to be comfortable for\nyour organization.\n\n245\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.495\nIf your organization says two\nyears is a okay for you, well,\n\n246\n00:13:34.495 --> 00:13:36.258\nthen notice you have that upper limit.\n\n247\n00:13:36.258 --> 00:13:37.589\n&gt;&gt; You can do it.\n\n248\n00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:39.270\n&gt;&gt; Yup, you can actually do that.\n\n249\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:43.900\nNow, on this one you can actually\nspecify between 14 days and 730 and\n\n250\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:49.790\nhere I just give you 730 at the beginning\nas your upper end, is hat you can do.\n\n251\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.378\nSo anywhere between two weeks and\n\n252\n00:13:52.378 --> 00:13:56.728\nof course 330 days there,\nyou've got the options.\n\n253\n00:13:56.728 --> 00:13:58.384\n&gt;&gt; I think more like 90s good.\n\n254\n00:13:58.384 --> 00:14:01.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do 90 and that's\nwhat this one is set up for as well.\n\n255\n00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.850\nI think by default, it's actually\nsomewhere, a little bit smaller as well.\n\n256\n00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.332\nIt just depends on what your policy is and\n\n257\n00:14:08.332 --> 00:14:13.161\nyou kind of depending on your security\nsettings and who sets up your policies.\n\n258\n00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.411\nThey'll tell you what it's gonna be.\n\n259\n00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:15.182\n&gt;&gt; Right\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n260\n00:14:15.182 --> 00:14:17.830\nyou can simply just change\nit here if you need to.\n\n261\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.510\nNotice the other one,\n\n262\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.450\na notification before the user is\nnotified about the expiration.\n\n263\n00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.320\nThis one can be set up\nanywhere between 1 to 30 days.\n\n264\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.259\nYou do need to let your users\nknow when things expire.\n\n265\n00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:34.782\nI don't wanna say rougher parts here But\n\n266\n00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:40.594\nthis is the part that most end users\ndo not tend to remember, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:44.163\nI don't know how else to say this.\n\n268\n00:14:44.163 --> 00:14:46.893\nA lot of end users will tell you they\n\n269\n00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:52.600\ndidn't get a notification\nabout password expiring, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.840\nIt's just the nature of how many\nemails we get along with the span.\n\n271\n00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.580\nAnd there's another thing that\nwe also have to consider,\n\n272\n00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.100\ndid the actual notification end\nup in the spam folder somewhere?\n\n273\n00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.780\nWherever it might be.\n\n274\n00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.060\nBut this is where you communicate\nclearly through policy and\n\n275\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.330\nnot just say an email, but\nsay expect to be this way.\n\n276\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.730\nExpect to be notified but\n\n277\n00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:20.260\nif it's not, you're gonna need to\nchange your password every 30 days.\n\n278\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.360\nWhat if I don't get the email?\n\n279\n00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.810\nWell, you explain to them that you will\nprobably see that when you try to log in,\n\n280\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.340\nit won't let you login.\n\n281\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.130\nOr it'll say you need to change your\npassword and you might end up with\n\n282\n00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.490\nan option where it says, you have to see\nthe administrator to change your password.\n\n283\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.195\nOr it might lead you to a link to\nanother website that will allow you to\n\n284\n00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:42.952\nchange the password, depending on how the\nadministrator also set this up too, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:45.544\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So don't think that there's not a way\n\n286\n00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:49.804\nbut a lot of users will not pay\nattention to the email unless they're\n\n287\n00:15:49.804 --> 00:15:54.085\nreally good at actually keeping up\nwith their emails a lot of times.\n\n288\n00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:54.817\nAnd all of us do it, right?\n\n289\n00:15:54.817 --> 00:15:57.249\nI know it's happened to\nme a couple of times,\n\n290\n00:15:57.249 --> 00:16:00.137\nwhere I was surprised that\nI actually got an e-mail.\n\n291\n00:16:00.137 --> 00:16:03.932\nBecause to me sometimes it seems like\nI just changed this the other day, and\n\n292\n00:16:03.932 --> 00:16:04.785\nyou might have.\n\n293\n00:16:04.785 --> 00:16:07.268\nSometimes I go,\nI don't even remember having this account,\n\n294\n00:16:07.268 --> 00:16:08.376\nwhich is what's scarier.\n\n295\n00:16:08.376 --> 00:16:13.248\nThat kinda gets you, so just kinda realize\nthat you can change a policy here.\n\n296\n00:16:13.248 --> 00:16:18.099\nAnd that's something that you want to\nat least pay attention to now when you\n\n297\n00:16:18.099 --> 00:16:19.336\nstart to see that.\n\n298\n00:16:19.336 --> 00:16:21.357\nSo chaining these numbers here,\nthis is fairly simple.\n\n299\n00:16:21.357 --> 00:16:27.016\nSo let's say that what I like is the idea\nof 42 days and that's about 6 weeks.\n\n300\n00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:28.895\nSo depending on what you actually have,\n\n301\n00:16:28.895 --> 00:16:32.115\nremember that all this works in\ncombination with a couple of things.\n\n302\n00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:36.298\nAnd I want this to be just\nabout let's say 7 days as well.\n\n303\n00:16:36.298 --> 00:16:41.010\nThis needs to be less than or equal to\ndays before the password expires and\n\n304\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.257\nis that not right?\n\n305\n00:16:42.257 --> 00:16:43.924\nThis needs to be less than or equal to.\n\n306\n00:16:43.924 --> 00:16:47.182\nYeah it is, 7 is less than 42 right?\n\n307\n00:16:47.182 --> 00:16:47.921\n&gt;&gt; It is less than 42.\n\n308\n00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:48.687\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so there you go.\n\n309\n00:16:48.687 --> 00:16:52.552\nSo let's see if I click Save and\n\n310\n00:16:52.552 --> 00:16:57.615\nit balks at me in some way, some reason.\n\n311\n00:16:57.615 --> 00:16:58.911\nWhy is it not letting me save that?\n\n312\n00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:02.059\nIs it 42?\n\n313\n00:17:02.059 --> 00:17:06.359\nNope, let's try it again, 7.\n\n314\n00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.887\n[LAUGH].\n\n315\n00:17:07.887 --> 00:17:10.445\nIs 42 somehow less than 7 now?\n\n316\n00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:15.325\nLet's see, 42 days, 7.\n\n317\n00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:21.298\n&gt;&gt; It is odd.\n&gt;&gt; It is odd,\n\n318\n00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:25.760\nit's not really letting me do that,\nwhich is strange you would think.\n\n319\n00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.223\nSo let's try a higher number here and\nsee what we get.\n\n320\n00:17:29.223 --> 00:17:30.229\nIt likes 14.\n\n321\n00:17:30.229 --> 00:17:32.965\nSo notice apparently it\ndoes not like the 7.\n\n322\n00:17:32.965 --> 00:17:35.670\nLet's see if I can do 8, no.\n\n323\n00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.730\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it has to do with single digits.\n\n324\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:37.891\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it looks like.\n\n325\n00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.296\nLet's see 10, there we go.\n\n326\n00:17:39.296 --> 00:17:39.899\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n327\n00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:47.020\n&gt;&gt; So go figure even though\nthe idea here is less than 42.\n\n328\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.756\nApparently that means double\ndigits are higher, go figure.\n\n329\n00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:51.313\n&gt;&gt; I guess so.\n\n330\n00:17:51.313 --> 00:17:52.331\n&gt;&gt; There you go, click Save.\n\n331\n00:17:52.331 --> 00:17:55.250\nAnd now we're updating the policy.\n\n332\n00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.982\nAnd you can see it's actually been\nupdated at this point, and there we go.\n\n333\n00:17:58.982 --> 00:18:05.280\nWe get a confirmation at the end that\nthe password policy has been set up.\n\n334\n00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.753\nNow once we do this though Zach, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:10.080\nAnd we think we're done, we're not.\n\n336\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.040\nThe reason why is that there's\na couple of other things that we might\n\n337\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.900\nalso need to think about and\ntake care of as well.\n\n338\n00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.120\nWhich is gonna be things like\nthe password complexity as well, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.650\nSo remember that complexity means what?\n\n340\n00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.980\nIt means it's a kind of jumble\nof different characters\n\n341\n00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.820\nin this sense on your keyboard, right?\n\n342\n00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.960\nIt's not just all letters,\nnot all numbers,\n\n343\n00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.810\nit's a combination of several things,\nokay?\n\n344\n00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.729\nSo upper case, lower case letters,\nit makes sense.\n\n345\n00:18:36.729 --> 00:18:41.470\nUsually a number of some sort,\n0 through 9, a number.\n\n346\n00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:42.278\n&gt;&gt; Symbol?\n\n347\n00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:43.187\n&gt;&gt; Yep some symbol.\n\n348\n00:18:43.187 --> 00:18:47.274\nIn other words when you hit the Shift key\nand the number row with the Shift key, so\n\n349\n00:18:47.274 --> 00:18:50.030\none of those symbols as\nyou go through that.\n\n350\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.140\nSo you'll normally actually have\na combination of those things as well.\n\n351\n00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.856\nNow when you do something like that,\nwe actually need to set that up.\n\n352\n00:18:57.856 --> 00:19:02.490\nNow the problem though Zach, when I take\na look at this I can set up the policy.\n\n353\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:07.098\nI didn't see anything for\npassword complexity here.\n\n354\n00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:11.433\nAnd as I scroll down, this last option\nwe're gonna get to in a moment,\n\n355\n00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:13.360\nbut notice what it says.\n\n356\n00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.098\nLet your people reset their own password.\n\n357\n00:19:16.098 --> 00:19:20.723\nIt doesn't seem like it actually\ngives me anything about creating\n\n358\n00:19:20.723 --> 00:19:24.140\na password policy that makes it complex,\nokay?\n\n359\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.896\nSo Zach we've learned something over\na couple of episodes now, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:28.896 --> 00:19:35.050\nThat even though we might see things\nhere inside of the viewing, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.850\nAnd it looks like it gives\nus the majority of it,\n\n362\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.791\nwe know that there's gotta\nbe a feature in there.\n\n363\n00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:45.120\nBut it doesn't seem very prominent\ninside of the gooey interface.\n\n364\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.972\nWhere do you think we're\ngonna have to explore?\n\n365\n00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:49.756\n&gt;&gt; I am guessing, Ronnie,\nthat we're going to the PowerShell.\n\n366\n00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:51.220\n&gt;&gt; You are correct!\n\n367\n00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.444\nOkay so in other words we have to go to\nPowerShell if we want to start exploring\n\n368\n00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.920\nthe idea of password connectivity.\n\n369\n00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.310\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that as well, okay?\n\n370\n00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.750\nSo I've got PowerShell waiting and\nlined up for us.\n\n371\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.716\nAnd then let's connect in to Office 365,\nso\n\n372\n00:20:09.716 --> 00:20:12.458\nconnect-msolservice.\n\n373\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.280\nAnd now it's gonna to ask me to sign in.\n\n374\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.180\nNow before I do that then,\nlet me go ahead and close that out again.\n\n375\n00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.760\nAnd let's create the credentials,\nthe variable instead.\n\n376\n00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.033\nSo I'm going to do\n\n377\n00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:37.050\nthe credential=get-credential.\n\n378\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.669\nIt does not matter which way you do it,\nI just like doing it this way.\n\n379\n00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:46.322\nIt gives me practice, is what it does.\n\n380\n00:20:46.322 --> 00:20:50.670\nAnd now make sure I see my\nsuper secret password here.\n\n381\n00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:02.680\nAll right, so let's try this again.\n\n382\n00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.316\nAnd this one will be Credential and\nthen the $credential, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:07.316 --> 00:21:10.648\nSo remember that what it's asking for\nis when you connect in,\n\n384\n00:21:10.648 --> 00:21:12.453\nI'm gonna ask for credentials.\n\n385\n00:21:12.453 --> 00:21:15.792\nAnd we already supplied it\ninside that little dialogue box,\n\n386\n00:21:15.792 --> 00:21:17.960\nunless I've typed it in incorrectly.\n\n387\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.340\nIt should connect through,\nwhich is what it did.\n\n388\n00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.006\nSo we didn't get any warning about it,\nbut now I'm connected here.\n\n389\n00:21:25.006 --> 00:21:29.518\nOnce I do this, I want to take\na look at all of my passwords that\n\n390\n00:21:29.518 --> 00:21:34.425\ndon't have any particular\ncomplexity requirements right now.\n\n391\n00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:39.308\nOr let's just take a look at it,\nI'm gonna type in get-msoluser.\n\n392\n00:21:39.308 --> 00:21:46.000\nThen we're gonna pipe that into,\nactually let's just do this.\n\n393\n00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.650\nLet's just take a look at\nwho we have right now, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:53.349\nSo currently we can actually see\nthe UserPrincipalName, the DisplayName,\n\n395\n00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:54.520\nisLicensed here.\n\n396\n00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.124\nI removed Daniel's account from an earlier\nepisode if you've been following along in\n\n397\n00:21:58.124 --> 00:21:59.614\nthe order that things are going on.\n\n398\n00:21:59.614 --> 00:22:04.322\nYou're going Daniel's account isn't there,\nit's cuz I actually did remove it before\n\n399\n00:22:04.322 --> 00:22:07.480\nthis show is what ended up happening here,\nokay?\n\n400\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.880\nNow when I see something like this and\nI want to require\n\n401\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.870\nsomething here, I've got to be\nable to set it up in this way.\n\n402\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.914\nAs far as the complexity if I don't\nwant complexity set up, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:21.914 --> 00:22:26.829\nI can do a get-user and\nthen I can pipe that\n\n404\n00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:32.040\ninto set- oops I'm doing it too fast here.\n\n405\n00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.751\nmsoluser and\nthen pipe that into set-msoluser.\n\n406\n00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:46.520\nThen using the option\nStrongPasswordRequired, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.035\nSo when we see something like that\nin the StrongPasswordRequired,\n\n408\n00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:53.183\nI have two options here, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:53.183 --> 00:22:58.670\nI could do a $true or\nI can do a $false, okay?\n\n410\n00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.102\nSo this will actually kick in whether or\n\n411\n00:23:01.102 --> 00:23:05.313\nnot I'm going to require a strong\npassword if I want to, all right?\n\n412\n00:23:05.313 --> 00:23:07.997\nSo let's just do the false one for\nright now, and\n\n413\n00:23:07.997 --> 00:23:11.024\nthen we wanna confirm that\nthis is what was set up here.\n\n414\n00:23:11.024 --> 00:23:15.240\nLet me zoom back out and press Enter.\n\n415\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.940\nSo how do I know that I am not\nrequiring the complexity anymore?\n\n416\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:26.663\nSo if I do a get-msoluser and\n\n417\n00:23:26.663 --> 00:23:31.427\nthen I pipe that into\n\n418\n00:23:31.427 --> 00:23:38.432\nselect UserPrincipalName,\n\n419\n00:23:38.432 --> 00:23:44.604\nPasswordNeverExpires.\n\n420\n00:23:44.604 --> 00:23:50.553\nAnd see notice that everything was set\nup as being False at this point as well.\n\n421\n00:23:50.553 --> 00:23:54.246\nAnd let's see if we can actually\ndo the Yeah, that one should be\n\n422\n00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:03.370\nAnd then one more here,\nStrongPasswordRequired,\n\n423\n00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.890\nI can't spell required.\n\n424\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.230\nI just hit the up arrow and\njust took out the last one.\n\n425\n00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.150\nAnd now you could see everybody's password\n\n426\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.320\nis pretty much set up\nas not requiring that.\n\n427\n00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.780\nNow that's not something you want to do,\nokay.\n\n428\n00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.800\nMore than likely it's probably not, but\nif you happen to have it set up this way,\n\n429\n00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.110\nthis is what you would have to do, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.870\nEasy enough though to change,\nI'm just using the up arrow, and\n\n431\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.882\nthen I simply change this to true, And\n\n432\n00:24:35.882 --> 00:24:40.169\nnow in a moment,\nas we start to take a look here.\n\n433\n00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:43.250\nLet's see if that actually\naffected the password expiration.\n\n434\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.920\nNope, but\ndid it affect the strong password here?\n\n435\n00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.570\nNow notice everybody's\npassword is going to require\n\n436\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.380\nto be stronger at this\nparticular point in time, okay?\n\n437\n00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.662\nSo it can actually do that for us, okay?\n\n438\n00:24:58.662 --> 00:25:04.331\nSo setting up this type of password,\nat least getting the requirements there,\n\n439\n00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:09.260\nthere's a lot more to this, but\nat least getting you started.\n\n440\n00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.313\nIf you're not sure, if your Office 365\nrequires you to actually have a strong\n\n441\n00:25:13.313 --> 00:25:15.651\npassword, it'll probably show you, okay?\n\n442\n00:25:15.651 --> 00:25:21.639\nBut if you really want to at least take\nlook at it from here in the PowerShell,\n\n443\n00:25:21.639 --> 00:25:26.798\nthis is what you can do to change\nthat if you need to as well, okay?\n\n444\n00:25:26.798 --> 00:25:33.370\nSo, Zach this allows us to manipulate and\nchange this up for a few users, right?\n\n445\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:38.510\nBut we still actually need to\ntake some time and consider that\n\n446\n00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:43.980\nmore than likely managing and adding in\npasswords one or two users at a time and\n\n447\n00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.240\ntheir policy, it gets a little\nbit harsh to try and do that.\n\n448\n00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.760\nEspecially when we start talking about\nthe idea of scalability into the future.\n\n449\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.030\nSo in that sense, it means we need to\nlearn how to do this a bit quicker.\n\n450\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:02.370\nAnd we need to actually be able to manage\nadding in users a bit quicker as well.\n\n451\n00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:07.280\nAnd then also showing how we can remove\nusers inside the PowerShell too.\n\n452\n00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.150\nSo there's a lot more for us to go.\n\n453\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.690\nBut Zach,\nlooking at the idea of time here,\n\n454\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.030\nit looks like we'll have to proceed\non with a part two instead.\n\n455\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.620\nSo let's go ahead and\nend it for this episode, and\n\n456\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.210\nthen that's where we'll pick up.\n\n457\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:24.060\n&gt;&gt; Edge Passwords and Users part 1, there\nwill be a part 2, so stay tuned for that.\n\n458\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.020\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 Series.\n\n459\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.380\nIt's good for you, good for you when you\ndo the exam, and it's just plain fun too.\n\n460\n00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.370\nAnd Ronnie's doing a marvelous job,\nby the way.\n\n461\n00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.219\nAnd of course I applaud them all the time.\n\n462\n00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:39.040\nHey, go to our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n463\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.910\nAll designed for one thing,\nto help you go further.\n\n464\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.940\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n465\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.360\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach

--> 00:00:43.160\nIt really does make a lot of sense if\nyou've already been managing networks.\n\n19\n00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.920\nBut same time,\nwe may not know where everything is and\n\n20\n00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.380\nthat's hopefully what\nwe've been showing you.\n\n21\n00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.931\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.490\nAnd what I think we should start off with,\nis maybe the password reset cuz I think we\n\n23\n00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.350\nwere going there at the end\nof the last episode, yeah?\n\n24\n00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did mention that, Zach,\nthat hey, we're gonna take a look at this\n\n25\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.820\nlater, about the password reset and\nit just totally slipped my mind.\n\n26\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.660\nSo this is a good place for us to pick\nback up and we'll kinda jump back and\n\n27\n00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.760\nthen we'll go onto managing\nsome users as well.\n\n28\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.430\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n29\n00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.000\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ntalk about this idea.\n\n30\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.180\nNow, in the previous episodes, Zach,\nwe kinda mentioned that managing passwords\n\n31\n00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.510\ncan be a little bit more hefty, especially\nwhen people can't remember passwords and\n\n32\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.720\nwe set password complexity requirements.\n\n33\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.668\nSo Zach what ends up happening is fairly\nsimple, somebody says I'm gonna make this\n\n34\n00:01:30.668 --> 00:01:34.353\npassword that's gonna be pretty\ncomplex and then they do it.\n\n35\n00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:36.232\nThey're able to type it in twice in a row,\n\n36\n00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:39.300\nbecause you have to to be able\nto get the system entered in.\n\n37\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.420\nThe third time though all of\na sudden becomes a challenge.\n\n38\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.420\nOr, if they don't use it\nas often as they think,\n\n39\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.460\nthey forget whatever\nthat complex password is.\n\n40\n00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.220\nSo, that's why I rely on things\nlike a password manager.\n\n41\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.990\nBut at the same time, what if you actually\ndidn't need to do this and as a password\n\n42\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.360\nmanager there are some things you want to\nmanually have them come to you and reset.\n\n43\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.720\nBut if the majority of them\nare just simple things such as,\n\n44\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.920\nthey're forgetting what their password is,\n\n45\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.110\nyou may want them to be able to have\nan access to reset it on their own.\n\n46\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.900\nSo let's take a look at how we can\ndo something like that as well.\n\n47\n00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.360\nSo on my screen, as we go back in to this,\nwe were in the admin center,\n\n48\n00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.160\nwe went down to Settings,\nSecurity and Privacy.\n\n49\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.860\nAnd when we came to Security and privacy,\n\n50\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.165\nthis is what it normally popped out and\nwhat we end up seeing at the default.\n\n51\n00:02:30.165 --> 00:02:32.830\nWhere we saw the password policy,\n\n52\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.530\nthe customer lockbox, sharing,\nand then at the bottom,\n\n53\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.330\nthis is what I had mentioned, let\npeople reset their own passwords, okay?\n\n54\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.950\nNow, when we start to do that,\n\n55\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.770\nthere's a couple of things that\nyou have to kind of wonder.\n\n56\n00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.930\nOne, is it a good idea to let\nusers reset their passwords.\n\n57\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.230\nAnd two, okay, should I actually let them\nreset their passwords as well, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.560\nSo answering both of those questions\ngives you a help of whether or\n\n59\n00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.210\nnot this is something that's good.\n\n60\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.350\nNow, if you were requiring complex\npasswords, it's probably a good idea\n\n61\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.300\nto allow users to reset their own\npasswords at a point in time, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.044\nBut, if it's just because their kind of\nnot paying attention and not doing it,\n\n63\n00:03:21.044 --> 00:03:25.961\nyou may want them to have to come to you\nSo that you know exactly what is happening\n\n64\n00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.212\nall the time if they're not able to reset\nthis and give them a little bit more user\n\n65\n00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:34.680\neducation, a little bit more training\non picking out what a good password is.\n\n66\n00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.614\nAnd we were talking about this right\nbefore the show, as we went on that, Zach,\n\n67\n00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:42.079\nas simple as it is, it doesn't always\nhave to be the most complex thing\n\n68\n00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.740\nyou've ever seen that\nmakes your head spin.\n\n69\n00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.600\nBut if you can make it longer and\nyou can still understand what it is,\n\n70\n00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.370\nthat's actually a pretty\nstrong password unto itself.\n\n71\n00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.630\nSo think about something like a sentenc,\n\n72\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.970\nif you actually want to and\nmaking it in the form of a sentence.\n\n73\n00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.920\nYour password don't always\nhave to be a password,\n\n74\n00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.030\ninstead you can hear the term pass phrase\nand you may also consider that as well.\n\n75\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.700\nSpaces can also be in passwords as well.\n\n76\n00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.460\nSo actually writing out maybe a portion\nof a sentence, or you know, a phrase,\n\n77\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.830\nis kind of the way to go that would\nprobably help more than anything else.\n\n78\n00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.790\nSo if you do have the password complexity,\nit normally means adding in a few extra\n\n79\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.110\ncharacters, but\nalso using proper case at times.\n\n80\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.950\nBut that should help meet those\ncomplexity requirements too.\n\n81\n00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.600\nBut let's say you want to set this up.\n\n82\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.730\nNotice that it actually says, that for\n\n83\n00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.280\nus to do this, we are actually going\nto take a look and go to someplace we\n\n84\n00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.510\nhaven't been before in the show,\nwhich is the Azure AD admin center.\n\n85\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.970\nAnd this stands for the Azure active\ndirectory administration center,\n\n86\n00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.000\nis what this one stands for.\n\n87\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.940\nSo if I click there, because I'm signed\nin as the global administrator and\n\n88\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.770\nthis is Cherokee at this\npoint In the background,\n\n89\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.460\nwhen we are trading those user accounts,\nit is actually creating accounts\n\n90\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.720\ninside of the Azure Active Directory\nstructure that we have.\n\n91\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.140\nNow, there's a lot more to Azure than\njust what we seen in Office 365, but\n\n92\n00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.350\nat the same time,\nthe basis of it is right here.\n\n93\n00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.000\nAnd you'll notice\nthe portal looks different.\n\n94\n00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.870\nEverything that we get into were\nactually inside of an admin center now.\n\n95\n00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.950\nBut now the terminology also changes.\n\n96\n00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.440\nFor those of you who go on\nto do more Azure training,\n\n97\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.750\nyou'll hear the term blades instead\nof what I say, admin center,\n\n98\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.620\nexchange center, and do all that stuff\nhere, and settings and stuff like that.\n\n99\n00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.840\nSo over on the left hand side they call\nthese things blades is what they end up\n\n100\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.920\ncalling them when you see this.\n\n101\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.307\nBut if I select Azure Active Directory\nover here on the left hand side.\n\n102\n00:05:46.558 --> 00:05:50.470\nNow, let's give it a moment here.\n\n103\n00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.736\nActually I don't even need Azure.\n\n104\n00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:53.387\nI needed Users and groups.\n\n105\n00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.670\nI was trying to think of\nwhere to go with it, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.670\nUsers and groups, that's where I wanted\nto go, not Azure Active Directory.\n\n107\n00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.410\nSo that was just my fault in\nlooking at the wrong one.\n\n108\n00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.090\nSo underneath Azure Active Directory,\nUsers and groups.\n\n109\n00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.560\nNotice that right here, under Users and\ngroups, if I scroll down,\n\n110\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.340\nit says Password reset.\n\n111\n00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:17.280\nIf I click on that, I can now create or\nchange my policy on how this is done.\n\n112\n00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.890\nSelf service password reset enabled.\n\n113\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.687\nSo if I kinda zoom out just a little bit,\ndesignates whether a user in this\n\n114\n00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:30.406\ndirectory who have an office phone,\nmobile phone, alternate e-mail\n\n115\n00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:34.910\naddress specified in their profile\ncan reset their own passwords.\n\n116\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.849\nSelect a group to restrict\nthe user password reset to only\n\n117\n00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.420\na limited group of users if you chose to.\n\n118\n00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.490\nSo right now it says self service\nwho's actually gonna do it?\n\n119\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.070\nCurrently, notice that it looks like\nthe one that is selected is none.\n\n120\n00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.440\nSo we're not allowing this at this point\nsince Zach is our password administrator.\n\n121\n00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.120\nThat means Zach is to handle all\n\n122\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.750\nthose things\n\n123\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.512\n&gt;&gt; Yay\n&gt;&gt; Sounds fun.\n\n124\n00:06:57.512 --> 00:07:00.130\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not really, but it does sound fun.\n\n125\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.100\n&gt;&gt; So we can create selected.\n\n126\n00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.930\nIn other words, we can say, hey it's\nonly gonna be the marketing group,\n\n127\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:06.470\nif we want to.\n\n128\n00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.830\nOr it's only going to be the production\ngroup that gets to reset their passwords.\n\n129\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.690\nWe can do that or, we can,\nof course, select all.\n\n130\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.730\nAnd that will also help us out too, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.950\nNow, just when we think we're done,\nlike if I do that,\n\n132\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.630\nis that all that needs to be done?\n\n133\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.361\nAnd I click save, well,\nno that's not all that needs to be done.\n\n134\n00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And the way that we know that is over\n\n135\n00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.290\nhere on the left hand side, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.890\nSo, notice that there's a lot more\nto manage underneath the password\n\n137\n00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.560\nreset properties here.\n\n138\n00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.320\nSo, I go ahead and\nsave that for right now.\n\n139\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.290\nIt says I'm saving\nthe password reset policy.\n\n140\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.350\nAnd, normally it just takes a little bit\nof time for the policies to be reset, but,\n\n141\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.050\nyou do get these nice warning, I shouldn't\nsay warning, notifications here.\n\n142\n00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.970\nIf I click that again, you'll see.\n\n143\n00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.002\nPassword reset policy saved.\n\n144\n00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:55.639\nChanges to password reset\npolicy were saved as well and\n\n145\n00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.733\nwe'll continue to see those notifications.\n\n146\n00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:03.143\nOnce we get that point, I can also\nchange the Authentication method.\n\n147\n00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:05.393\nAnd here is what we were talking about,\n\n148\n00:08:05.393 --> 00:08:08.814\nwhen we said the idea of\nreplacing passwords at some point.\n\n149\n00:08:08.814 --> 00:08:13.180\nNotice the Number of methods\nrequired to reset, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.332\nSo I can say hey,\nit actually only requires one method.\n\n151\n00:08:16.332 --> 00:08:18.990\nSo it chooses either email or\nmobile phone.\n\n152\n00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.910\nSo I don't have to actually do any other\none, but notice it can be office phone.\n\n153\n00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.721\nSecurity questions, so the default ones\nthat were set up is email or mobile phone.\n\n154\n00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:32.340\nSo as long as you have an email address,\nokay?\n\n155\n00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.905\nAnd that they can go to an alternate\nemail address that you can get to,\n\n156\n00:08:36.905 --> 00:08:38.400\nyou can reset.\n\n157\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.008\nOr they can text you something that will\nhelp you to get that point of reset.\n\n158\n00:08:43.008 --> 00:08:48.060\nYou can tell it to require it instead,\nif you want two factor, you can do that.\n\n159\n00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.691\nWhere it actually says,\nyou need to do both of these.\n\n160\n00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:55.478\nSo it is very possible that you can change\nthis up if you want to as well, and\n\n161\n00:08:55.478 --> 00:08:58.116\nthat's part of the password reset too.\n\n162\n00:08:58.116 --> 00:09:03.300\nIf I select registration,\nRequire users to register when signing in.\n\n163\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.620\nSo this one says Yes.\n\n164\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.313\nNumber of days before user asked\nto re-confirm their authentication\n\n165\n00:09:09.313 --> 00:09:11.308\ninformation, 180 days.\n\n166\n00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:14.594\nAnd if you're not sure about\nwhat any of this stuff is,\n\n167\n00:09:14.594 --> 00:09:18.480\nhover over the little\ninformation bullet or bubble.\n\n168\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.490\nDesignates the period of\ntime before registered users\n\n169\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.090\nare prompted to reconfirm their existing\nauthentication information is valid.\n\n170\n00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.780\nUp to a maximum of 730 days if set to 0,\n\n171\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.240\nregistered users will never\nbe prompted to reconfirm.\n\n172\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.332\nNow that's a bad policy unto itself-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n173\n00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:39.604\n&gt;&gt; Is to never have them reconfirm this.\n\n174\n00:09:39.604 --> 00:09:43.210\nAnd you might say why would\nwe ever need to reconfirm?\n\n175\n00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.760\nThere are a lot of people and\nyou know them and\n\n176\n00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.630\nyou might actually be one of them as well.\n\n177\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.539\nYou just leave your browser\nup all the time, and\n\n178\n00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:51.943\none connection that you have\nconstantly is Office 365.\n\n179\n00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:55.221\nWell you may want to actually\nkind of leave that, but\n\n180\n00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:57.730\nthen you don't wanna leave it open.\n\n181\n00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.544\nBut people do, and that's perfectly\nfine if that's the way you wanna work.\n\n182\n00:10:00.544 --> 00:10:04.538\nOffice will work if you do that, but\nyou may also want them to go ahead and\n\n183\n00:10:04.538 --> 00:10:09.360\nalso make sure that you confirm that\never once and a while as well, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.720\nOther notifications are also here too,\nand this is also a good one, right?\n\n185\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.619\nThe notification of the password resets,\nand this is something that you definitely\n\n186\n00:10:18.619 --> 00:10:20.397\nwant to be notified-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n187\n00:10:20.397 --> 00:10:21.425\n&gt;&gt; About.\n\n188\n00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:27.070\nIf you are not sure that your password has\nbeen reset, that's a bad thing, right?\n\n189\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.684\nThat's something that you want\nto be notified about as well.\n\n190\n00:10:29.684 --> 00:10:35.380\nAlso notice this one, notify all admins\nwhen other admins reset their password.\n\n191\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.886\nThis one is a no by default, but if you\ngo, I don't know who's changing there.\n\n192\n00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:43.390\nYou can do that right here too,\nso all that is still possible.\n\n193\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.314\nOther customizations are also helpful,\nbut for us we're not so worry about.\n\n194\n00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:51.484\nAnd here's where it gets a little bit\nmore complicated, and we'll get into this\n\n195\n00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.873\na little bit once we get into\nthe Azure AD synchronization stuff.\n\n196\n00:10:54.873 --> 00:10:59.312\nBut it says, On-premises\nintegration has not been enabled,\n\n197\n00:10:59.312 --> 00:11:02.260\nenable password writeback, okay?\n\n198\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.950\nSo this is where it gets a little bit\nmore complex, we'll save that for\n\n199\n00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.770\na future episode at this point.\n\n200\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.290\nBut you can see that there's really two\ndifferent options that we have available.\n\n201\n00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.810\nBut because we haven't done any of\nthe integration with an on-premises\n\n202\n00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.011\nActive Directory and\nthe Azure Active Directory.\n\n203\n00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:23.000\nWe're gonna kind of hold on some\nof the settings that we see, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.844\nSo just different settings especially\non this reset is going to give you\n\n205\n00:11:27.844 --> 00:11:30.600\na little more granularity that you see.\n\n206\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.925\nBut notice you don't set\nit up inside of Office 365,\n\n207\n00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:36.970\nwhich is normally what we see right here.\n\n208\n00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.690\nThis one though is done inside of\nthe Azure Active Directory Admin Center\n\n209\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.670\nitself.\n\n210\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.460\nSo pay attention about where\nsome of this stuff is also\n\n211\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.340\ngonna be configured, all right?\n\n212\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.198\nSo that should help us to wrap up the last\nof the password management at least at\n\n213\n00:11:52.198 --> 00:11:54.612\nthe beginning that we'll have to do.\n\n214\n00:11:54.612 --> 00:11:58.093\nAnd we'll learn a little bit more about\nit once we get into the Azure and\n\n215\n00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.876\nthe Active Directory\nsynchronization as well, okay?\n\n216\n00:12:00.876 --> 00:12:07.590\nNow, let's move into managing users and\ngroups just for a moment.\n\n217\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:11.638\nWe're really specifically talking\nabout not so much groups, but\n\n218\n00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:14.030\nabout bulk users a lot of times as well.\n\n219\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.955\nSo we want to start managing\nof course users and\n\n220\n00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:19.730\ndifferent groups that we choose to, okay?\n\n221\n00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.179\nLet's begin with the idea\nof just many users, okay?\n\n222\n00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:28.147\nSo at the beginning of what we started\noff with Office 365, when the key aspects\n\n223\n00:12:28.147 --> 00:12:33.050\nof that at the very beginning set up\nwas setting up of course, a pilot.\n\n224\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.367\nWhich includes choosing pilot users\nto be able to be a part of our group.\n\n225\n00:12:38.367 --> 00:12:42.448\nAnd we said that ideally that\nwould be about 5% of your\n\n226\n00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:47.110\norganizational size spread\nacross many different domains.\n\n227\n00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:51.120\nDifferent levels of experience, making\nsure of that and were full time employees,\n\n228\n00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.668\nand that they have proper\ntraining about doing that.\n\n229\n00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:55.738\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it,\nit's like in house test marketing.\n\n230\n00:12:55.738 --> 00:12:56.405\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n231\n00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:58.359\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's exactly what it comes down to,\n\n232\n00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:01.970\nbut you're trying to get the full\neffect here of what you need.\n\n233\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.236\nNow when you do that,\nat that point and you go ahead and\n\n234\n00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:06.988\nstart to add them in, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:06.988 --> 00:13:10.493\nSo if I go back to\nthe Admin Center at this point.\n\n236\n00:13:10.493 --> 00:13:13.210\nI've got a couple of\noptions that I can do.\n\n237\n00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.484\nI can select Add user or\nmaybe I can select Add user.\n\n238\n00:13:18.484 --> 00:13:20.540\nNo, not select, Add user.\n\n239\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.844\nThere we go, okay, I can select Add user.\n\n240\n00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:28.794\nAnd now notice that it allows me to,\nbut here's where I've had to\n\n241\n00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:34.750\nenter them in one at a time if I were\nto add in an additional user, okay?\n\n242\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.912\nSo let's see if I select Users here and\nsee, okay?\n\n243\n00:13:37.912 --> 00:13:42.982\nNow there's also if I click on More,\nyou can also\n\n244\n00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:49.795\nsee where there's this option\nto Import multiple users, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:54.832\nSo that is actually a little bit\nmore price setup to allow for\n\n246\n00:13:54.832 --> 00:13:59.670\nthe quicker population of your\nusers right here in Office\n\n247\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:05.120\n365 that you can get started\na little bit quicker.\n\n248\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.060\nNow to do that, what is actually required?\n\n249\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.110\nWell let's see by clicking on Import.\n\n250\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.222\nSo here's where it begins here, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:20.840\nSo the great thing is if you're not sure,,\nyou can actually set it up at this point.\n\n252\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.107\nIn this step, download one of\nthe CSV files, save the file,\n\n253\n00:14:25.107 --> 00:14:27.962\nuse Excel or another app to add users in.\n\n254\n00:14:27.962 --> 00:14:32.416\nThen come back here and upload the file\nand verify that it got added correctly,\n\n255\n00:14:32.416 --> 00:14:35.100\nthat it got filled out correctly.\n\n256\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.890\nSo here, notice that you have this, okay?\n\n257\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.250\nDownload a CSV file with headers only.\n\n258\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.470\nDownload a CSV file with headers and\nsample user information.\n\n259\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.240\nNow if I were doing this, right?\n\n260\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.663\nAnd I didn't know exactly what to do,\n\n261\n00:14:51.663 --> 00:14:55.842\nI like this second option a lot\nmore than I like this first option.\n\n262\n00:14:55.842 --> 00:14:59.019\nSo let's go ahead and\nchoose that second option.\n\n263\n00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:01.560\nI'll even show you the first\noption as well, but in a moment.\n\n264\n00:15:03.988 --> 00:15:10.330\nAll right, so there if I select Save,\nit will save it right here.\n\n265\n00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:15.100\nLet me go ahead and\nsave the other one too.\n\n266\n00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:23.520\nOkay, one's a template and\nones a sample card.\n\n267\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.985\nSo I just wanna make sure I could\ndistinguish them before I told you\n\n268\n00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:28.123\nwhich one was which.\n\n269\n00:15:28.123 --> 00:15:34.690\nSo now if I view those down, actually let\nme view it inside of the explorer here.\n\n270\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.770\nThis download, and\nlet's take a look at the template, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.840\nThe template is the one as it's described,\nright?\n\n272\n00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.387\nThat there is nothing there except\nessentially for the headers.\n\n273\n00:15:47.387 --> 00:15:54.315\nIf I right-click on that and I go to Edit,\nactually go to Open with instead.\n\n274\n00:15:54.315 --> 00:16:01.651\nI'm gonna select Notepad, because I\ncan open a CSV file inside of Notepad.\n\n275\n00:16:01.651 --> 00:16:07.107\nAnd now across the top of the page, let me\ndo a word wrap here for just a moment, so\n\n276\n00:16:07.107 --> 00:16:13.200\nthat we can see a little bit and let me\nchange the formatting or the font size.\n\n277\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.380\nLittle bit larger than I\nwould have expected, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.200\nSo this would actually go much\nfurther across the page here.\n\n279\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.990\nIf you could do this inside\nof Excel if you wanted to.\n\n280\n00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:29.370\nBut this is a CSV file,\nwhich is a Comma Separated Value file.\n\n281\n00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:35.738\nNotice how we have commas that are,\nI can't say it, that are our delimiters.\n\n282\n00:16:35.738 --> 00:16:36.440\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n283\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.550\n&gt;&gt; That's harder to say than I\n\n284\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.940\nthought, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.995\nSo this essentially are columns is\nwhat we actually have here, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:45.589\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So each one of thees names followed by\n\n287\n00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:50.080\na comma, that is gonna be the name\nof a particular column for us.\n\n288\n00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.480\nThe strange thing is it really\ndoesn't matter what the column name or\n\n289\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.930\norder that it appears in all reality\nas long as the names are exact.\n\n290\n00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.872\nThat's what really matters, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:01.872 --> 00:17:04.483\nAs long as they're exactly the same.\n\n292\n00:17:04.483 --> 00:17:09.740\nSo notice how this username\nhas a space in between.\n\n293\n00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.910\nNotice how first name,\n\n294\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:16.140\nlast name is capitalized in their case,\nin what they need here.\n\n295\n00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.960\nAs long as they are exactly matching,\nokay, you're fine.\n\n296\n00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.890\nSo, if you enter in first names and\nthen you chose, so\n\n297\n00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.340\njust make sure you have this group of\ninformation is what you want, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.290\nSo that seems to be logical and\nthen put a comma in after each one.\n\n299\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.850\nBut, a little bit more help than this,\nlet me close that one out, and\n\n300\n00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.620\nlet's select the user sample here.\n\n301\n00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:46.350\nAnd let me open that one now,\nyou can actually come and see this one.\n\n302\n00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:53.540\nAnd here's the same information, here,\nthat was just the header information.\n\n303\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.320\nBut now, notice how they've done this.\n\n304\n00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.060\nThey took the username and they have\nnow actually added in a few things.\n\n305\n00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.550\nAnd this is where we can go in and\nessentially change the information and\n\n306\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.480\nadd those things in, okay?\n\n307\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.180\nSo it's here that you\ncan start populating and\n\n308\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.510\nstart doing a few other things to\nget that added in and ready to go.\n\n309\n00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.935\nSo if we were to do this,\n\n310\n00:18:15.935 --> 00:18:20.430\nZach, okay there's a couple of things\nthat we could try and do right here.\n\n311\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.491\nSo let's that change this up for\nwhat we're gonna do.\n\n312\n00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:26.080\nWe'll just kinda use our\nproduction team to help us out.\n\n313\n00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.221\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we'll say Tailor, and then we'll\n\n314\n00:18:30.221 --> 00:18:35.224\ntake Tanisha, and\nwe'll also go over here and\n\n315\n00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:39.686\nadd in Aubrey, And Titus.\n\n316\n00:18:43.595 --> 00:18:44.516\nWho am I missing, Megan?\n\n317\n00:18:47.683 --> 00:18:48.341\nMeagan.\n\n318\n00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:56.900\nRight, now the Contoso here, I'm going\nto use the Edit and do the Replace,\n\n319\n00:18:59.714 --> 00:19:04.891\nThen select contoso.com.\n\n320\n00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:11.681\nI'm gonna replace it with itprotvdemo.com,\ntell it to replace all,\n\n321\n00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:16.870\nmaybe I'm going to tell it\nto find something first.\n\n322\n00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:26.435\nI misspelled Contoso I found the first\none, I want it to replace everything.\n\n323\n00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:31.430\nSo now you can see where it's starting\nto change some of the information here.\n\n324\n00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.580\nNow of course the rest of this\ntakes a little bit more time.\n\n325\n00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.040\nAnd I'm just gonna change the first\nnames and leave the last ones here.\n\n326\n00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.750\nI know that it doesn't really\nmatch our entire staff,\n\n327\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.410\nbut it at least make the point here.\n\n328\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.090\nLet me put this in proper case.\n\n329\n00:19:51.205 --> 00:19:58.940\nAnd this will be Tanisha,\nSame thing here Taylor.\n\n330\n00:20:01.892 --> 00:20:07.420\nI can't spell Taylor, and\nthen I just went to Tanisha.\n\n331\n00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:12.653\nSo you can see how it can help you out.\n\n332\n00:20:12.653 --> 00:20:13.551\nAll right, then, Aubrey.\n\n333\n00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:26.762\nAubrey, and this is Titus And Titus.\n\n334\n00:20:30.622 --> 00:20:31.347\nAnd Meagan.\n\n335\n00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:41.713\nAnd Meagan Right,\nthe rest of it I'm not so\n\n336\n00:20:41.713 --> 00:20:44.750\nworried about it in terms of the rest\nof the details of the information.\n\n337\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.498\nAnd then, I can do File Save as here and\nthen I can type in Pilot.\n\n338\n00:20:54.823 --> 00:20:55.323\nGroup.\n\n339\n00:20:59.122 --> 00:21:04.898\nSave this as a .csv, click Save,\n\n340\n00:21:04.898 --> 00:21:12.220\nand it should be in the same location.\n\n341\n00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.770\nSo now that I've created\nthis I can now browse\n\n342\n00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:24.610\nSelect the Pilot Group\nthat we just modified.\n\n343\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.580\nRemember those on the production staff as\nyou're watching, as you're editing this.\n\n344\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.330\nAnd you're like, that's not my life,\nI know, I did that on purpose.\n\n345\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.459\nSo let me click Open.\n\n346\n00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:36.990\nAnd now that should add it in there,\nI should be able to verify.\n\n347\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.390\nNotice it says,\nyour file looks good, okay?\n\n348\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.460\nSo that's actually a good\nidea to verify that.\n\n349\n00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.900\nThen, I can click Next.\n\n350\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.320\nAnd then it says, chose how you want\nusers to be imported by setting\n\n351\n00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.352\nthe sign in status and\nthe licensed product.\n\n352\n00:21:54.352 --> 00:21:59.454\nSo right at the very beginning,\nI have this option where I can allow\n\n353\n00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:04.490\nthem to sign in immediately, or\nI may choose to block the sign in.\n\n354\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.100\nNow this depends on when you\nwant to launch your pilot,\n\n355\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.520\nif you were to do this for.\n\n356\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.290\nYou want that group to become active and\navailable.\n\n357\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:17.740\nIt may be where you're actually\npreloading up your Office 365 environment\n\n358\n00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.430\ngetting all that done.\n\n359\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.590\nSo that you can deploy this for\nyour organization, but\n\n360\n00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.810\nyou really want them to continue using the\nway that the infrastructure is right now.\n\n361\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.375\nBut you're not ready\nto actually deploy it.\n\n362\n00:22:28.375 --> 00:22:30.340\nAnd you may choose to block\nit through this point.\n\n363\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.530\nBut let's say we'll allow the sign ins.\n\n364\n00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.490\nAnd at this point here\nlocation is perfectly fine,\n\n365\n00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:40.150\nI can then turn on if I want to assign\nthose products, I can do that as well.\n\n366\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.660\nIt says you don't have enough, remember\nsome will actually getting created without\n\n367\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.580\nsome which is perfectly fine.\n\n368\n00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.441\nI'm gonna click Next, And there we go,\n\n369\n00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:56.075\nthe process is working in the background\nto allow us to add this all in.\n\n370\n00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:59.350\nFive users were actually\ncreated which is good.\n\n371\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.070\nAnd that's gonna say email the results\nright here to these people\n\n372\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.540\nwhich is gonna email Cherokee.\n\n373\n00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.170\nI can add in a coma a lot of times or\na semi-colon and\n\n374\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.590\nthen add in another email\naddress if I want to.\n\n375\n00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.360\nBut we'll just send this on\nto Cherokee's report instead.\n\n376\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.614\nSo once everything is done,\nLet me Save and Close.\n\n377\n00:23:22.614 --> 00:23:26.613\nNow that little orange box is actually\nsomething we should've paid attention to\n\n378\n00:23:26.613 --> 00:23:28.282\nbut I clicked on it very quickly.\n\n379\n00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:31.580\nAnd the reason why it says\nhey look you can do this but\n\n380\n00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.170\nremember passwords are in this email.\n\n381\n00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.770\nAnd a lot of times emails\nare actually sent in plain text.\n\n382\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.110\nSo realize they'll be unencrypted.\n\n383\n00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.530\nBut now take a look,\nZach, at what we have.\n\n384\n00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.227\nRemember before\n&gt;&gt; We talked about it.\n\n385\n00:23:44.227 --> 00:23:45.880\n&gt;&gt; It's Cherokee and\nit was you and it was me.\n\n386\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.150\nAnd now there it is,\n\n387\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.100\nwe've now added in our production team\nwith some changed names, but there it is.\n\n388\n00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.110\nWe can actually add in\nmultiple users doing this.\n\n389\n00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.115\nHow many can you do?\n\n390\n00:23:56.115 --> 00:23:58.540\nYou can do a ton, okay?\n\n391\n00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.403\nSo just by simply following that same\nstructure, copying them again and\n\n392\n00:24:02.403 --> 00:24:03.109\ndoing that.\n\n393\n00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:07.913\nNow in the back end, the work does take\na little bit more, but the great thing is,\n\n394\n00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.660\nit can be done.\n\n395\n00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.210\nEven if you work on the side of active\ndirector, you can also export that data.\n\n396\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.190\nMake sure you pull in the right names and\n\n397\n00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.440\nline them up in terms of those column\nnames because that's the important key.\n\n398\n00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.360\nYou can actually pull that information and\ndo this very same thing.\n\n399\n00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.120\nIf you chose to, okay?\n\n400\n00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.220\nNow, that's all up to you especially\nif you're not going to be using\n\n401\n00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.810\nthe Active Directory on premises anymore\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n\n402\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.820\n&gt;&gt; But you still need to add users in.\n\n403\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.480\nSo, bulk importing in users\n\n404\n00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.842\nis really going to be helpful if you\ndo something like that as well, okay?\n\n405\n00:24:39.842 --> 00:24:44.120\nAll right so, once that's actually done,\nnotice it's really\n\n406\n00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.950\nnot exactly the hardest thing in\nthe world, but it does take some time for\n\n407\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.630\nyou to think about that and get it\nready the way that you want to, okay?\n\n408\n00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:53.350\n&gt;&gt; Looks good.\n\n409\n00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.590\n&gt;&gt; Now the other thing that we also want\nto be able to, could you do this all in\n\n410\n00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.520\nPowerShell, definitely, all of this could\nbe done inside of PowerShell as well.\n\n411\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.250\nBut it requires you to start running a for\nloop, and\n\n412\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.950\nto do a couple of other things to do.\n\n413\n00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:10.140\nAnd if you're really\ninterested in doing that,\n\n414\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.310\nmake sure you do check\nout the 70-347 show.\n\n415\n00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.620\nBecause we'll actually\ndo all that once again.\n\n416\n00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.190\nAnd here I'm just using the basic\ntools that we have, but there,\n\n417\n00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.470\nwe'll actually run through it just using\nPowerShell and adding in bulk users and\n\n418\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.820\ndoing that as well.\n\n419\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.130\nWe've only got a few minutes left, so\n\n420\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.520\nI want to show just\na couple more things here.\n\n421\n00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.890\nBy this time, we are going into PowerShell\nto get us working a little bit more too.\n\n422\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.500\nWhat if we delete out an account and\nwe need to recover?\n\n423\n00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.750\nRemember that in a previous episode we\nhad deleted out Daniel's account, right?\n\n424\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.890\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n425\n00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.580\nnow we want to recover\nthat particular account.\n\n426\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.280\nCan we do something like\nthat if we need to?\n\n427\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.190\nWell, of course we can.\n\n428\n00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:57.145\nLet me bring back up our PowerShell here.\n\n429\n00:25:57.145 --> 00:26:01.120\nSo with that account with Daniel's, I\ndon't know if I can actually get that back\n\n430\n00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.150\nor not, but lets' see what we can do here.\n\n431\n00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.780\nI'm going to type in get dash msol user.\n\n432\n00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.000\nAnd that way let's see if we can\nget at least some information.\n\n433\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.860\nRight now, Zach,\nI don't feel confident that I can get\n\n434\n00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.330\nDaniel's account back with\nthe information that I have.\n\n435\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.300\nSo let's delete one of these\nhere using PowerShell.\n\n436\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.080\nAnd then we'll restore that one as well.\n\n437\n00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:22.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n438\n00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:28.150\n&gt;&gt; So once I do this,\nI'm going to type in get dash msol user.\n\n439\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.560\nAnd I've got to pull up a couple names.\n\n440\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.650\nThat way we can verify that's\nthe exact same account and\n\n441\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.230\nwe're not just creating a new one yet.\n\n442\n00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.840\nOkay.\n\n443\n00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.815\nSo if I do this.\n\n444\n00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:44.770\nGet msol user, select user principle name,\nif I can spell principle.\n\n445\n00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.513\nUser principle name, and\n\n446\n00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:53.520\nthen object id.\n\n447\n00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.850\nSo here now notice I get this object id.\n\n448\n00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.541\nThis is a very unique identifier for\nus and what we want and\n\n449\n00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:05.624\nwe'll just select Titus's name\nup here at the top right now,\n\n450\n00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:09.071\nunless we move his, remove-msol user.\n\n451\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:16.804\nAnd we will again use\nthe user principle name.\n\n452\n00:27:20.724 --> 00:27:26.817\nAnd this time titus@itprotvdemo.com,\n\n453\n00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:33.260\nAnd press enter, let's see.\n\n454\n00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.160\nAnd did I not,\nI have to spell it correctly.\n\n455\n00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.180\nHow's that?\n\n456\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.514\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for one reason or\n\n457\n00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:41.777\nanother it doesn't like typos.\n\n458\n00:27:41.777 --> 00:27:45.029\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, let's say, yes.\n\n459\n00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.570\nAnd now it's actually been,\nhopefully, done.\n\n460\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.490\nSo let's check it out.\n\n461\n00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.330\nSee?\n\n462\n00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.640\nVerify that Titus is\nno longer in the list.\n\n463\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.985\nSo if we've made a mistake and\nthen we now need to restore him.\n\n464\n00:27:59.985 --> 00:28:00.550\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n465\n00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.320\n&gt;&gt; We do a restore instead.\n\n466\n00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.860\nNow, I'm going to reuse my work.\n\n467\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:12.240\nAt least, hopefully,\na part of it, restore msol user.\n\n468\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.510\nUser principle name, Titus.\n\n469\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:19.960\nAnd then I'm gonna add in, another option.\n\n470\n00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:26.490\nAuto reconcile proxy conflicts,\nand then, new user principle name.\n\n471\n00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:34.267\nI'm gonna just make it exactly the same,\ntitus@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n472\n00:28:34.267 --> 00:28:37.590\nAnd press enter.\n\n473\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.760\nSo now you can see where\nit added it back in.\n\n474\n00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.160\nAnd now we see.\n\n475\n00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.740\nThere's Titus.\n\n476\n00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.470\nAnd let's see what we can find out here.\n\n477\n00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.180\nOkay.\n\n478\n00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.070\nSo, Titus' original one.\n\n479\n00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.708\nIt ends in, let's say, bdd672.\n\n480\n00:28:51.708 --> 00:28:55.960\nThat's the easiest way to see.\n\n481\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.000\nAnd this is how you know\nit was actually restored.\n\n482\n00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.760\nIt didn't just create a new object name,\nTitus.\n\n483\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.280\nIt restored his particular account, right?\n\n484\n00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.010\nSo we know that it actually did\nrestore exactly that, okay?\n\n485\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.710\nSo this is a good demonstration\nof that idea of being a removal.\n\n486\n00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:18.420\nNow, can you easily remove it\nonce you get into Office 365?\n\n487\n00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.080\nSure, you know exactly how to do that.\n\n488\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.710\nYou simply select this one.\n\n489\n00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.340\nAnd then you can delete\nthat account as well.\n\n490\n00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.760\nAnd they're removed too, okay?\n\n491\n00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.520\nSo that we'll at lest get us\nstarted in just managing users and\n\n492\n00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.920\nthe actual passwords that we have set up.\n\n493\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.970\nBut remember we do have some others to\nactually think about that will probably\n\n494\n00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.760\nhit in a later episode once we get\neverything setup the way that we want to.\n\n495\n00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.780\nWe'll probably even come back and\n\n496\n00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.510\naddress things like the idea of\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n497\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:50.410\nBut, Zach, at least for this point,\nwe are done with users and passwords.\n\n498\n00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.770\nAnd then we'll pick up multi-factor\nauthentication on another day.\n\n499\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.650\n&gt;&gt; Did a wonderful job,\nRonnie, thank you very much.\n\n500\n00:29:55.650 -->

learn,\n\n6\n00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.360\nwherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.700\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.450\nAs we continue on with Office\n365 managed passwords and\n\n9\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.090\nusers is the title of this episode.\n\n10\n00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.630\nAnd of course, Ronnie Wong,\nour IT expert and Office 365 expert,\n\n11\n00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.510\nis here to help us out.\n\n12\n00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.060\nRonnie, great to have you again.\n\n13\n00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.790\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n14\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.390\nhaving me back as we continue on\ntaking a look at passwords and users.\n\n15\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.540\nThis is kind of a third part to kind of a\nminiseries that we've really been talking\n\n16\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.890\nabout in terms of passwords and users.\n\n17\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.710\nShowing you how to manage those and\n\n18\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.853\nnow were at this place where I know it's\nbecome sound strange but we're really\n\n19\n00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:51.146\ntrying to get rid of passwords is what\nwe're really trying to do in this episode.\n\n20\n00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:55.157\nAnd talking about some of the things\nthat are built into Office 365 to help\n\n21\n00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:56.290\nus do that.\n\n22\n00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.650\nAnd you might be wondering\nat some point hopefully,\n\n23\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.370\nyou're in this point in your IT career.\n\n24\n00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130\nWhere you realizing that,\n\n25\n00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.370\nif there is a weakness in the systems that\nwe have in place in terms of security,\n\n26\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.170\nauthentication is probably one\nof the weak points that we have.\n\n27\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.970\nAnd the reason why there's weaknesses\nthere is that it kind of began on a weak\n\n28\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180\npremise at the very foundation of it,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.565\nIt used to be at some point in time,\ntracking passwords was kind of\n\n30\n00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:29.373\na challenge, it was a pit, almost\nlike a chess game between you and me.\n\n31\n00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:33.381\nYou'd guess the password that I would\nuse and then, if you could do that,\n\n32\n00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:38.310\nyou could break through all of my secrets\nand that was pretty much about it, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.005\nBut then there came this idea\nthat we also needed to do,\n\n34\n00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:47.310\nwhat better authentication which\nincluded both a user name and password.\n\n35\n00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030\nSo that was considered a new\nmodel of authentication.\n\n36\n00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.470\nNot just having a simple password anymore\nbut now also username and password.\n\n37\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.310\nTrying to guess the right combinations of\nthose two, seems actually made it stronger\n\n38\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.940\nbecause you might build and\nguess what my passwords Zach.\n\n39\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.395\nBut you might not know what my\nusername is in that machine.\n\n40\n00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:08.726\nSo it's very possible but getting\nthe right combination, all together where\n\n41\n00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:12.676\nyou can actually go, I got the right\npassword with the right username.\n\n42\n00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:15.849\nNow became a bit more challenging for\n\n43\n00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.762\nus getting access and\nthen protecting ourselves.\n\n44\n00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:24.320\nThat didn't take long before\nit was relatively easy and\n\n45\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.800\nthe reason why is that users tend to fall\ninto patterns, like we've said before,\n\n46\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.810\nwhere they reuse the same password or\nthey don't change those passwords.\n\n47\n00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.180\nWhere they actually kind of\nalmost telegraph their passwords\n\n48\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.980\nin ways that they don't realize\nwhat they're doing, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.040\nSo the password part and keeping\nsign like that is also challenging.\n\n50\n00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.836\nThe other thing is the only way that we\nactually started improving on that right\n\n51\n00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.224\nat the beginning is simple.\n\n52\n00:02:51.224 --> 00:02:54.330\nLet's make more complex passwords, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.170\nSo in something like that Zach, when we\ntalk about making more complex passwords,\n\n54\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.090\nI can't make your username\nany more complex than this.\n\n55\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.980\nOkay, but\nI can make your password more complex.\n\n56\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.124\nSo if I pick on Zach for a moment,\nlet's say that his password was for\n\n57\n00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.474\none reason or another, password1.\n\n58\n00:03:12.474 --> 00:03:14.248\n&gt;&gt; Hey, how did you guess that?\n\n59\n00:03:14.248 --> 00:03:16.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz it's the same as your luggage\n\n60\n00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.006\nthat's how I get that.\n\n61\n00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:17.640\n&gt;&gt; It's all right.\n\n62\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.590\n&gt;&gt; So, when we actually see\nsomething like that, right?\n\n63\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.485\nPassword1 and then Zach if he changes it.\n\n64\n00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:28.309\nLet's say that he gets real bold and\ncreative in February,\n\n65\n00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:30.303\nhe changes that to two, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:30.303 --> 00:03:32.307\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You kind of realize,\n\n67\n00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:34.390\nhe's fallen in this pattern,\nand more than likely,\n\n68\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.550\nI'm going to be able to\npredict what's gonna happen.\n\n69\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.560\nAnd after 12 passwords, he's probably\ngoing to go back to password or\n\n70\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.590\npassword1, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.880\nSo that's what it's gonna come down to.\n\n72\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.250\nSo, even though I can make your\npasswords more complex, we gone and\n\n73\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.670\nwent beyond that, and just said,\n\n74\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.880\nlet's make sure that we add some\ndifferent characters and strings, okay?\n\n75\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.453\nWell now, the challenge is not really for\nthe password cracker so\n\n76\n00:03:56.453 --> 00:04:01.293\nmuch, as much as it's for\nZach was that a Shift+6 or was that a six?\n\n77\n00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:05.420\nWas that supposed to be a B or\nan 8 that I was supposed to put here?\n\n78\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.840\nZach is now trying to juggle all\nof these different factors in, and\n\n79\n00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.570\nthe one that's really getting challenged\nby this password challenge is, well,\n\n80\n00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.750\nZach who's supposed to\ncreate this password.\n\n81\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.459\nAnd he can't remember how to actually\n[LAUGH] get all those different elements\n\n82\n00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.460\nin there.\n\n83\n00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.020\nSo that's what happens, right?\n\n84\n00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.590\nSo the password then,\nessentially Zach has to call and go,\n\n85\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.650\nhey, I need you to reset my password.\n\n86\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.460\nWhy?\n\n87\n00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.800\nCuz I can't remember the one [LAUGH]\nthat I was supposed to have set.\n\n88\n00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.000\nSo I need it reset, so\nit gets reset to what?\n\n89\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.780\nTo whatever the admin chooses,\nand he goes, Zach, let me see,\n\n90\n00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.440\nI'm gonna set to password one.\n\n91\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.890\nAnd Zach goes, that's cool, I like that.\n\n92\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.530\nAnd he actually uses\npassword one get reset.\n\n93\n00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.410\nAnd then of course it tells him,\nsend another password but more complex and\n\n94\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.250\nthe challenge begins again, okay?\n\n95\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.630\nSo there's a weakness\ninherently in the system, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.260\nBut with the advent of faster and\n\n97\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.900\nstronger then more complex machines\nthat can calculate billions of\n\n98\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.590\ncalculations per second, Zach's password\nprobably gets broken very quickly, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.910\nAnd then getting access to the machine\nbecomes a challenge at that point.\n\n100\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.920\nSo, how do we recover\nfrom something like that?\n\n101\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.690\nWell, people then started coming up with\nthings like, well we'll change that.\n\n102\n00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.095\nWe'll actually just use\nsmart card instead.\n\n103\n00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:26.530\nZach now has to bring a smart\ncard with him to work, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.712\nHe puts it in the card reader,\nand there he goes, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:30.639\nHe's off and ready to go.\n\n106\n00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.170\nZach doesn't have to remember\nhis password anymore.\n\n107\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.200\nSound good?\n\n108\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.190\n&gt;&gt; I think it sounds okay, but\nwhat if I forget that darn password card.\n\n109\n00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.340\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right,\nso what happens, Zach,\n\n110\n00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.700\nif you don't remember your password card.\n\n111\n00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.330\n&gt;&gt; You're not getting in there, so\nnow Zach has to drive home, and\n\n112\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.910\nthen he goes,\nI don't remember where I left it.\n\n113\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.870\nOkay, and then he drives back to work and\nthen he says, I don't remember where I\n\n114\n00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.000\nleft it, and then we have to issue\nanother particular card out.\n\n115\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.205\nAnd now Zach realizes he left it at his\nfavorite coffee shop trying to get his\n\n116\n00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:01.297\nfavorite weird tea that he drinks,\nurban latte here.\n\n117\n00:06:01.297 --> 00:06:02.748\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And when he does that,\n\n118\n00:06:02.748 --> 00:06:04.692\nnow he realizes somebody with your.\n\n119\n00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:08.440\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Royboss tea and now they actually have\n\n120\n00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.570\nhis articular smart card and\nthey're off and gone, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.560\nWell, now of course, that becomes\na little bit more challenging.\n\n122\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.157\nSo what do we do?\n\n123\n00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:20.476\nWe make it much harder and now we go,\n\n124\n00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:26.353\nall right Zach all you have to\ndo is remember your hands, okay?\n\n125\n00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:27.141\nSo we'll actually put finger\nprint mirror some thing, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:28.270\nSo, that's the way to go, right?\n\n127\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.650\nOr we'll do a retinal skin,\n\n128\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.620\nwe'll do a facial recognition,\nwhatever it might be, okay?\n\n129\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.620\nSo there is three factors of\nauthentication that we either have.\n\n130\n00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.780\nSomething that you know.\n\n131\n00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.580\nPasswords, okay?\n\n132\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.880\nSomething that you have.\n\n133\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.290\nSomething like a smart card or\na that you might have.\n\n134\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.763\nAnd then of course,\neven the idea of biometrics, okay?\n\n135\n00:06:46.763 --> 00:06:47.289\n&gt;&gt; DNA.\n\n136\n00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.154\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you're going that far to\nget into your particular company.\n\n137\n00:06:51.154 --> 00:06:55.485\nYou are working for some organization that\nI really don't want to be responsible for\n\n138\n00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:56.690\nthat security.\n\n139\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.856\nBecause if that means they can't provide\nthat security, I'm probably gonna be dead,\n\n140\n00:06:59.856 --> 00:07:01.630\nokay, as they're requiring\nyour DNA at log on.\n\n141\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.090\nBut to each is on and\nthat's why we will all say at that point.\n\n142\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.540\nBut how do we make it stronger, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.930\nWell, that's the goal, right?\n\n144\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.300\nEach one in themselves technologically\nmore advanced, the ones that we've talked\n\n145\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.880\nabout but is it really any more\nof a challenge for attackers.\n\n146\n00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.169\nIf the attackers can't challenge\nthe idea of DNA, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.360\nWell, what can they challenge?\n\n148\n00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.780\nThey can challenge the system\nthat reads the DNA, okay?\n\n149\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.010\nSo, in other words, they can go,\n\n150\n00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.610\nI wonder if this particular thing has\na chip in it that has some flaw, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.850\nThey can find that.\n\n152\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.470\nSame thing with the card readers.\n\n153\n00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.060\nFor those that have them following on, if\nyou're in the United States, you know that\n\n154\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.670\nwhen the best places to steal those\ncards at a point of sale place, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:51.141\nYou going and fill up your vehicle\nwith your fuel that you do.\n\n156\n00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.460\nYou slide your card in that card reader.\n\n157\n00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.069\nAnd that's the systems that\nare getting challenge up.\n\n158\n00:07:56.069 --> 00:07:58.872\nThey're not trying to challenge\nthe world's security code on it where they\n\n159\n00:07:58.872 --> 00:07:59.800\njust trying to steal it.\n\n160\n00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.109\nThey just forget that, let's just\noutright and steal the information.\n\n161\n00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:06.342\nFrom what, from the device that\nreads it as what they've done.\n\n162\n00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:09.050\nSo they found another point of weakness,\nokay?\n\n163\n00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.280\nSo how do we do this to make it stronger?\n\n164\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.060\nWell, what we do is we do what we\ncall multi-factor authentication.\n\n165\n00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.902\nAnd the way that we do that is we\nactually require more than one, okay?\n\n166\n00:08:18.902 --> 00:08:23.080\nThe multi-factors taking two out of\nthe three or three out of the three\n\n167\n00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.050\nof methods and using them and\nsaying, if you're gonna do this,\n\n168\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.510\nwe're gonna require more of you\nthan just a simple password.\n\n169\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.830\nNow it doesn't mean you have to do it.\n\n170\n00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.030\nRight now on what I'm doing in Office 365,\nI haven't really set that up, okay?\n\n171\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.880\nBut we're about to because it's something\nthat you do need to pay attention to.\n\n172\n00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.430\nAnd be able to understand\nhow to set this up as well.\n\n173\n00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.060\nNow, you of course can do this per user or\nyou can do it per bulk user,\n\n174\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.770\nor a bunch of users at the same time.\n\n175\n00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.830\nWell, let's show you at least one, okay?\n\n176\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.830\nSo, here it is.\n\n177\n00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.430\nI'm logged in as Cherokee,\nthe Tenant Administrator for Office 365.\n\n178\n00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.420\nI'm going to select the admin center and\nthen we're going to go into the users as\n\n179\n00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.956\nwell, okay, so once I select,\nlet me see if I can get there,\n\n180\n00:09:10.956 --> 00:09:17.720\nusers at this point the,\nthere's a recommended practice act, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.380\nIf you're gonna be an administrator for\nOffice 365, whether it's billing\n\n182\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:28.630\nadministrator, whatever, the best practice\nis make sure your administrators for\n\n183\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:34.010\nOffice 365 are using multi-factor\nauthentication, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.780\nNow, what about every other user?\n\n185\n00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.640\nWell, that's probably\nthe best practice as well,\n\n186\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.580\nbut it's hard to get\neverybody to switch on over.\n\n187\n00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.030\nSo at least make the administrators\nwant to control everything.\n\n188\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.260\nAt least that, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.470\nSo let's select at this point,\nlet's select Zack.\n\n190\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.000\nZack Mildew.\n\n191\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.990\nCuz your password being password1\nis really compromising at times.\n\n192\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.260\n&gt;&gt; I feel that I'm being maybe picked on.\n\n193\n00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:58.760\nMaybe.\n\n194\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.880\n&gt;&gt; So, but we're doing it for\na good purpose.\n\n195\n00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's what we're doing it.\n\n196\n00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.915\n&gt;&gt; It's for a good call.\n\n197\n00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:08.770\n&gt;&gt; Yup, so now when we start to take\na look at Zach's particular settings,\n\n198\n00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.080\nwe wanna scroll down to\nthe bottom of Zach's account.\n\n199\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.760\nAnd then down here at the bottom\nwhere it says More settings,\n\n200\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.380\nlet me scroll over, okay.\n\n201\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.130\nMore settings and on the side\nare these two options here, okay.\n\n202\n00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.020\nThe one that I want is Manage\nmulti factor authentication.\n\n203\n00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.060\nSo if I select this for\nZach at this point and give it a moment,\n\n204\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.830\nremember we're actually\nworking with the Cloud so\n\n205\n00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.440\nit takes a little bit of time for\nus to do this.\n\n206\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.980\nThere it is, multi-factor\nauthentication because I'm logged in as\n\n207\n00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.740\nCherokee here, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.780\nIt allows me to get access to\neverything but I selected multi-factor\n\n209\n00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.850\nauthentication, I can see all the users\nthat are available for us, okay?\n\n210\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.860\nSo if I want to set up for\neveryone, it's fairly simple.\n\n211\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.060\nI select all of the display names here,\n\n212\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.140\nthen I can enable it fairly quickly and\nby selecting enable, we can do that.\n\n213\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.660\nOkay?\n\n214\n00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.350\nBut let's not do that right now cuz I\nmight let myself out without realizing\n\n215\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.400\nthat I'm doing this.\n\n216\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.440\nSo let me find Zachary Memos here.\n\n217\n00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.520\nSo I'm now selected Zachary and\nyou can see, multi-factor off status,\n\n218\n00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.630\nit is currently for Zach, Disabled, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.030\nSo Zach, you can use your password one and\n\n220\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.414\ncompromise our entire\nOffice 365 Tennessee.\n\n221\n00:11:24.414 --> 00:11:26.915\nThank you Zack appreciate that.\n\n222\n00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:29.810\nOkay, so\nhere it is over on the right hand side,\n\n223\n00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.310\nZach Memos quick steps kind of helps.\n\n224\n00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:33.930\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n225\n00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.150\n&gt;&gt; A little bit intuitive there,\nas it does that.\n\n226\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.520\nI select enabled and\nnow here it goes, okay.\n\n227\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.290\nOf course if you are doing this for your\norganization, read that deployment guide.\n\n228\n00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.580\nIt does take a little bit of time for\nyou to read, but\n\n229\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.200\nit is worth you thinking about it as well.\n\n230\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.930\nIf your users do not regularly\nsign in through the browser,\n\n231\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:58.110\nyou can send them this link to register\nfor multi-factor authentication.\n\n232\n00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.371\nSo notice that you can get\nyour own users instead.\n\n233\n00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:05.159\nSay look, we've got your password\nset up but more secure is for\n\n234\n00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:08.661\nyou to do this on your own,\ninstead of me making you do it and\n\n235\n00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:12.330\nyou can send them to this link\nright here and that will set up.\n\n236\n00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.520\nIt says MFA for\nmulti-factor authentication setup, right.\n\n237\n00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.195\nSo I'm gonna select enable\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n238\n00:12:21.195 --> 00:12:24.680\nMulti-factor authentication\nhas now been enabled for\n\n239\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.200\nthe account and in a moment here,\nyou can see where it's been enabled.\n\n240\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.920\nNow, let's take a look at a couple\nof other things too, right?\n\n241\n00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.910\nSo now that that's actually set up here,\nlet me select Manage user settings.\n\n242\n00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.670\nThis is what we also have to get into,\nright.\n\n243\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.160\nSo this is where you select how\ndo you want this multi-factor\n\n244\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.290\nauthentication to tap?\n\n245\n00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.220\nRequire the selected user to\nprovide contact methods again.\n\n246\n00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.995\nSo let's say that we set this up a long\ntime ago, Zach, and now, I'm saying look.\n\n247\n00:12:57.995 --> 00:13:01.939\nI want us to reset this up because, let's\nsay that Zach actually has a new phone or\n\n248\n00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:02.931\nsomething, okay.\n\n249\n00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:06.837\nWell I can actually require him to just\nset it up again if I want to, okay, but\n\n250\n00:13:06.837 --> 00:13:07.518\nwe can do it.\n\n251\n00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:11.730\nDelete all existing app passwords\ngenerated by the selected users.\n\n252\n00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:17.790\nSo Zach your password's 1234567,\ngone if I want to delete all that.\n\n253\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.070\nRestore multi-factor authentication\non all remembered devices.\n\n254\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.760\nYou name it, we can actually\ndo that right there too, okay?\n\n255\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.610\nNow there's actually a screen that I was\ngonna click on before I clicked on this\n\n256\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.730\nbut I didn't.\n\n257\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.450\nLet's go back to that screen as well.\n\n258\n00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.468\nActually, it's right here I was\ngoing to say, where's the link?.\n\n259\n00:13:36.468 --> 00:13:40.710\nSo, under multi-factor authentication\nthis is where again it's kind of\n\n260\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.730\nsubtle at the changes that it does.\n\n261\n00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.790\nSo, if I select users here that's\nwhat gives us this list but\n\n262\n00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.540\nnotice right next to it, service settings.\n\n263\n00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.060\nIt doesn't look like that is a button,\nor a selection that you need to make.\n\n264\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.100\nBut I hover over it, I get that\nlittle kind of symbol that says, hey,\n\n265\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.060\nyou can click here.\n\n266\n00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.970\nAt least, I think you can, there we go.\n\n267\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.975\nNow that I've done that, now notice that I\nhave these options that I can select for\n\n268\n00:14:06.975 --> 00:14:09.300\nmulti-factor identification as well.\n\n269\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.470\nApp passwords, Allow users to create app\npasswords to sign into non-browser apps.\n\n270\n00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:21.380\nSo, if Zack is running whatever office\napp that he wants on his phone.\n\n271\n00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.710\nWe can actually make sure that he can\ncreate passwords on those types of apps if\n\n272\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.210\nhe want to or I can limit it.\n\n273\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:33.820\nThis one, would actually be more secure at\nthis point, okay, it has to limit that.\n\n274\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.210\nHere are the multi-factor verification\nmethods that you also have, as well.\n\n275\n00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:44.180\nSo notice that Call to a phone,\nText message to a phone, Notification\n\n276\n00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.060\nthrough the mobile app, Verification\ncode from a mobile app, as well.\n\n277\n00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.060\nSo you normally can go to\neither the Apple Store,\n\n278\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.250\nI think that's what it's called, or\nthe Play Store that's out there, and\n\n279\n00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.200\nprobably download the authenticator\napp that you have available to you.\n\n280\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.570\nAnd on Microsoft,\n\n281\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.030\nI actually just downloaded\nthe authenticator app on my phone instead.\n\n282\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.140\nSo it doesn't actually just come\nthrough text messaging anymore.\n\n283\n00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:14.300\nIt actually is the authenticator app that\nif I log in from a different machine.\n\n284\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.240\nIf I go to Zack's computer and\ntry to log into this, even as Cherokee.\n\n285\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.050\nIt's gonna say, hey,\nI need you to authenticate with this too.\n\n286\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.750\nAnd it would just send up a message that\nsays, here's the authenticator code, and\n\n287\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.890\nI just type that into\nthe screen that it shows me.\n\n288\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.660\nAnd I'm ready to go as well, right.\n\n289\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.880\nThen, let me see, hold on,\nlet me scroll down here, so\n\n290\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.480\nwe can see this last one here,\nremember multi-factor authentication.\n\n291\n00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.890\nNow this is a bit of a challenge but\nyou have kind of weigh and\n\n292\n00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.778\nbalance the situation out here, okay?\n\n293\n00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:51.501\nSo it might annoying for Zachy, okay, if\nhe log off and log in 10 times a day and\n\n294\n00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:55.615\nstill ask him like make sure\nyou do this authentication.\n\n295\n00:15:55.615 --> 00:15:58.578\nInstead, you can put a check mark here,\nit says,\n\n296\n00:15:58.578 --> 00:16:03.603\nAllow users to remember multi-factor\nauthentication on devices that they trust.\n\n297\n00:16:03.603 --> 00:16:06.414\nDays before they actually\nhave to authenticate.\n\n298\n00:16:06.414 --> 00:16:10.085\nNow for me, on certain,\ni'm trying to think which one does but\n\n299\n00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:13.150\nI can't remember,\nI think it's on my phone.\n\n300\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.950\nEvery 30 days I think is what I\nhave to do to re-authenticate.\n\n301\n00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.610\nAnd that means that hey,\n\n302\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.370\nI don't have to authenticate all the time\nwith multi-factor authentication.\n\n303\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.010\nBut every 30 days, that app is gonna\nrequire me to actually do the multi-factor\n\n304\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.010\nauthentication again to get that set up.\n\n305\n00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.683\nAnd everyone is actually set\nup a little bit differently.\n\n306\n00:16:32.683 --> 00:16:36.115\nSo, for example,\non my password manager, right,\n\n307\n00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:41.585\nit doesn't require a password of me, even\nthough it can actually take a password.\n\n308\n00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:44.635\nIt just says use your\nfingerprint to authenticate.\n\n309\n00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:49.012\nAnd same thing when I actually use\nthe Office app on my phone here,\n\n310\n00:16:49.012 --> 00:16:52.674\nit actually says, hey,\neither use the fingerprint or\n\n311\n00:16:52.674 --> 00:16:58.500\nget the authentication code from the\nauthenticator app that I have available.\n\n312\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.710\nSo it is actually right there and\navailable for us to be able to do so.\n\n313\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.050\nSo we can limit to what we want\nto be able to do if we wanted to.\n\n314\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:07.700\nOkay?\n\n315\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.860\nSo where we might choose certain\nmethods or you can leave them all.\n\n316\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.080\nIt just depends on what you wanna do.\n\n317\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.220\nThe end user will then, of course,\n\n318\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.280\nget an email message that will\nsay how they'll have to do this.\n\n319\n00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.373\nNow, I have gotten confused by\nthe way that this is done before,\n\n320\n00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:25.590\nZack, where it says enter this in and\nthen it kept sending me stuff.\n\n321\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.120\nThen I kept entering in the wrong\nphone and kept doing something else.\n\n322\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.600\nSo, it can be a bit of a challenge\nat times, but just slowly.\n\n323\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.280\nDon't do like I do,\nhalf paying attention, half not.\n\n324\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.620\nDedicate the ten minutes that it takes for\nyou to get in and\n\n325\n00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.370\nunderstand what you actually have right\nhere, as you go through whatever it is.\n\n326\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.720\nWe're gonna send you an email right at\nthe beginning to help you out, okay.\n\n327\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.610\nSo from that point,\n\n328\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.495\nyou save the operations to make\nsure that this happens, okay?\n\n329\n00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:56.165\nAnd there you go, it has now been\nsuccessfully completed at that point,\n\n330\n00:17:56.165 --> 00:17:59.595\nand now we have multi-factor\nauthentication turned on for Zach.\n\n331\n00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:01.520\n&gt;&gt; So I notice that we're\ndoing all this in the GUI,\n\n332\n00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.395\nwe're not doing this in PowerShell?\n\n333\n00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:06.765\n&gt;&gt; Nope, we're not gonna actually\nchallenge this one in PowerShell, and\n\n334\n00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:08.055\nthere's a reason behind that.\n\n335\n00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:12.365\nAnd that's because it actually does\ngo into the Azure Cloud to do so.\n\n336\n00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:14.245\nSo that's a different environment totally.\n\n337\n00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:16.960\nFor us, all we're doing is\nsetting it up right here.\n\n338\n00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.700\nYou possibly can set this stuff\nup inside of PowerShell, but for\n\n339\n00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.550\nour sakes, we are going to\nleave that as is right now.\n\n340\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.670\nAnd that will be enabled in\nthe service if we want to,\n\n341\n00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.910\nprobably even through\nthe 347 show instead.\n\n342\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.170\nSo at this point,\nthat's just the basics and the setup, and\n\n343\n00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.110\nthat's all that we really have to do.\n\n344\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.380\nAnd from that point,\n\n345\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.340\nwe are now ready to use mutlifactor\nauthentication for those users.\n\n346\n00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.810\nIf everything begins to be successful at\nthat point, it seems to be seamless for\n\n347\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.400\nZach, I can try it out again now\nwith 10 or 15 others, right?\n\n348\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.270\nAnd then, as it becomes seamless for them,\n\n349\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.610\nI continue to roll that out\nby selecting more users.\n\n350\n00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.180\nOr I just say, everybody,\nwe're switching over to this, and we go.\n\n351\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.800\nBut, you might not be able to do it all\nat one time, supporting 50 users, right?\n\n352\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.220\nAnd they have problems with trying to\nfigure out what to put in this situation.\n\n353\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.890\nIt might be better to handle\nit 10 to 15 at a time.\n\n354\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.460\nThat way you can control the amount of\nstuff that you have to be able to do and\n\n355\n00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.530\nkeep in mind as well.\n\n356\n00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.980\nBut Zach, that pretty much helps us\nat the end here of understanding.\n\n357\n00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.840\nAnd you're probably, like I said at\nthe beginning, passwords and users, it's\n\n358\n00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.050\nbecause we're talking about really how we\nget rid of the idea of the passwords, and\n\n359\n00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.780\nit does fall right in line with that.\n\n360\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.940\nSo here's a basic start for\nyou to test out.\n\n361\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.440\nAnd so, in the very end, when Zach\nlogs on to his Office 365 demo here,\n\n362\n00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.730\nit might actually say, hey, you need to\nset up multi-factor authentication first.\n\n363\n00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.650\nAnd that's when he'll actually get to\ncheck that, and you have to kinda log out\n\n364\n00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.720\nand log back in again a couple of times,\nand it'll all be good fun for Zach.\n\n365\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.720\nSo, Zach,\nthat's pretty much what we have here.\n\n366\n00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.400\n&gt;&gt; Well, thanks Ronnie,\nyou did a marvelous job as usual.\n\n367\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.530\nAnd I'll remember all of that,\nI really will.\n\n368\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.510\nSo manage, passwords,\nand users part three.\n\n369\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.265\nThere's a part one.\n\n370\n00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:03.240\nThere's a part two, and\nnow there's a part three.\n\n371\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.640\nMake sure you watch them all,\nyou'll be glad you did.\n\n372\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.570\nAnd also, go to the course library.\n\n373\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.900\nHundreds of videos there that\nare all designed for one thing.\n\n374\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.240\nTo help you go further.\n\n375\n00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.391\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro Tv.\n\n376\n00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:17.100\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n377\n00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.780\nThanks for watching.\n\n378\n00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.550\nI'm

--> 00:00:15.298\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:20.080\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.220\nCloud identity is with PowerShell,\nthe title of this episode,\n\n9\n00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.330\nwhat is it all mean?\n\n10\n00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.864\nWell, our IT expert,\nRonnie Wong is here to show us the way,\n\n11\n00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:28.570\nRonnie thanks very much for being here.\n\n12\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.542\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\non the show, as we continue on and\n\n13\n00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:37.580\nof course now managing the idea of Cloud\nidentities and especially with PowerShell.\n\n14\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.662\nThere is no other way to\nput PowerShell is gonna\n\n15\n00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.834\nbe a central part of what\nwe have to learn and do.\n\n16\n00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:48.880\nAnd there's no way you cannot get around,\nso you might as well jump in to it now.\n\n17\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.094\nAnd with this specific focus\non just managing Office365,\n\n18\n00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.677\nis gonna help you because it actually\ndoes transfers some of the other\n\n19\n00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:59.660\nstuff that you're gonna do inside of\neither an On-Premises environment.\n\n20\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.670\nOr what more a cloud technology as well.\n\n21\n00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.890\nSo that's what we wanna jump in to\nas well when we get started here.\n\n22\n00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.060\n&gt;&gt; And PowerShell,\nthat's not just for the admin too.\n\n23\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.040\nI mean, that's for\nusers as well, right, Ronnie?\n\n24\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.160\n&gt;&gt; It is, okay.\n\n25\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.840\nSo when we start to take a look, there\nare some things that users can do but\n\n26\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.370\nthe majority of what we'll\nbe talking about, of course\n\n27\n00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.498\nis what administrators will actually end\nup doing for us in the very beginning.\n\n28\n00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:27.054\nSo one of the things that we've\nbeen doing all along is that we've\n\n29\n00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:29.965\nbeen just showing you some\nof the basic techniques and\n\n30\n00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:33.473\nsome of the things that you have to\nget set up for the pile of work.\n\n31\n00:01:33.473 --> 00:01:35.427\nBut as well as of course preparing for\n\n32\n00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:39.400\nthe on boarding situation that\nis gonna happen into the future.\n\n33\n00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630\nSo we want to at least show you some\nmore of these PowerShell commands that\n\n34\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.140\nwill help you to begin this process and\n\n35\n00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.600\nunderstand the automation of it\na little bit more as well, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.488\nSo let's go ahead and\ndive into this and start talking about\n\n37\n00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:58.660\ntypes of PowerShell command or\nanother example of PowerShell command.\n\n38\n00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.010\nThat you definitely want to make\nsure that you can do, okay?\n\n39\n00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.258\nSo one of those things that we do just\nmanaging a network administratively\n\n40\n00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:06.875\nat times,\n\n41\n00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:11.272\nis that every time that we do something\nthat we have something else going on.\n\n42\n00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:14.410\nWe may need to have a user account, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.330\nThat will actually normally need to be\nlogged in for us to accomplish something.\n\n44\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.730\nBut in the same time, what if you\nneeded to create a service account?\n\n45\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.630\nNow let's remember this\nidea of a service account.\n\n46\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.210\nIt allows for us to essentially\nrun an application or a program or\n\n47\n00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.620\nwhatever it is in the background,\nthat requires authorization of some sort.\n\n48\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.340\nBut the neat thing about it is that\n\n49\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.820\nparticular user doesn't necessarily\nneed to be logged in to do so.\n\n50\n00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.980\nSo if we're asked for\ncertain credentials and\n\n51\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.310\nwe want this to continue to run in\nthe background as a service for\n\n52\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.700\nus, we may want to establish what\nwe call a service account, okay?\n\n53\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.457\nNow a simple service account instead of\nthe manage service accounts that we tend\n\n54\n00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:58.517\nto see inside of Server 2016.\n\n55\n00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:02.924\nIt is really about this idea of\ncreating a user account in which\n\n56\n00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.560\na password doesn't expire.\n\n57\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.030\nSo if I am asked for\n\n58\n00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.910\ncredentials, I normally can do this\nespecially at the administrative level to\n\n59\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.430\nallow to run without me being logged\nin to make sure that it run as well.\n\n60\n00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.180\nSo that's one of the first things that\nwe want to do is wanna go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.050\nconfigure a service account.\n\n62\n00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.960\nAnd then show you how to do this\nin PowerShell as well, and then,\n\n63\n00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.780\nof course, to make sure that\nthe password doesn't expire\n\n64\n00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.990\nis what we want to be able to do as well,\nokay?\n\n65\n00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.430\nLet's go ahead and make our connection and\nnow before we do so, we're\n\n66\n00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.500\ngonna follow the same pattern that way it\nkind of gets stuck in out head to do this.\n\n67\n00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.620\nWe're gonna create a variable\nwith our credentials so\n\n68\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.840\nthat we can log in to well,\nthe Office online as well.\n\n69\n00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.763\nSo if I do $credential=get-credential.\n\n70\n00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:49.976\nNow we're gonna use\n\n71\n00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:58.566\nour name here that we've set up.\n\n72\n00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:01.010\nAnd this is gonna be Cherokee.\n\n73\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.920\nAnd then of course, I have to make sure\nI get access to that secret password.\n\n74\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.438\nRemember that even though we set this up,\nI could have actually had a typo in there.\n\n75\n00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:23.687\nIt will accept it perfectly fine,\nso If you can,\n\n76\n00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:26.320\ndouble check that as you're doing it.\n\n77\n00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.240\nI'm just trying to make sure we\nget it done here in the beginning.\n\n78\n00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.720\nI think I've typed it in\ncorrectly at this point.\n\n79\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.370\nBut I may not have, right?\n\n80\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.756\nSo once we've got to this point here,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:44.254\nWe want to connect to\nthe Microsoft Online.\n\n82\n00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:49.187\nSo msolservice, And\n\n83\n00:04:49.187 --> 00:04:53.090\nthen when I do,\nI'm gonna type in verbose this time.\n\n84\n00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.690\nI'm also going to issue or tell it\nwhat credentials I am going to use.\n\n85\n00:05:01.543 --> 00:05:02.870\nSo we'll give it a moment.\n\n86\n00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.970\nIt'll either spew out red for me or\nit'll actually allow me to connect in.\n\n87\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.640\nSo without any other verbosity\nthat comes across here.\n\n88\n00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.960\nIt shows me I am now connected to\nmy Microsoft Online Service and\n\n89\n00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.010\nready to go as well, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.970\nSo once I'm here,\nI want to create a new user account\n\n91\n00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.410\nthat is actually going to become\na service account for us.\n\n92\n00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.300\nSo this one, when we do this.\n\n93\n00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.390\nLet me see if I can zoom in, so\n\n94\n00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.840\nthat we can see it just\na little bit better, right?\n\n95\n00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.360\nSo before I do this, let me go and clear\noff the screen and that way, we'll kind of\n\n96\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.840\nget that settled and ready to go for\nwhatever else we need here, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.500\nSo I've just full screen it, make sure\nthat we can see what we need to and\n\n98\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610\nat the top of the screen away from my\nhead is what I was trying to avoid.\n\n99\n00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.520\nSo here I just do a New MSOL user.\n\n100\n00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.600\nNow remember, whenever you can,\n\n101\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.200\nI would recommend you use auto complete to\ndo this, and that will also help you out.\n\n102\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.000\nThen I going to do to do the option for\nuser principal name at this point.\n\n103\n00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.090\nThis is where you actually decide\nwhat the user principal name is.\n\n104\n00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.040\nIt normally looks like the form of\nan email address for the cloud service.\n\n105\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.940\nSo let's do this.\n\n106\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.780\nLet's say that I wanna actually create\na synchronization administrator,\n\n107\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.032\nis what I want to create.\n\n108\n00:06:17.032 --> 00:06:21.818\nI'm gonna ask you to type in\nsynchadmin is what I'm going to do.\n\n109\n00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:28.702\nSo it's sync, S-Y-N-C-H or\njust C, let's do that, C.\n\n110\n00:06:28.702 --> 00:06:34.860\nSyncadmin@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n111\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.280\nThen, what do I want displayed to do this.\n\n112\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.090\nSo I'm gonna look for a display name.\n\n113\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.190\nSo once again I typed out D-I and then\nI used a tab for the auto fill for us.\n\n114\n00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.780\nAnd in parenthesis, I'm gonna tell it\nthat I want to actually spell out sync\n\n115\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.080\nadmin, let's just do administrator,\nI like that.\n\n116\n00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.763\nI don't know why,\nthat seems better for me.\n\n117\n00:06:57.763 --> 00:07:04.180\nI'm gonna do a no option for first name,\nand first name we'll just make the sync\n\n118\n00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.480\nAnd then even for last name here, oops.\n\n119\n00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.340\nThere we go, first name.\n\n120\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.450\nI knew that was gonna happen.\n\n121\n00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.368\nI was like I didn't spell that right.\n\n122\n00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:23.780\nAnd then -lastname and\nthere's gonna be administrator.\n\n123\n00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:29.300\nSo if we check out the syntax in this,\nright?\n\n124\n00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.640\nNew Microsoft online user,\nhere's what the user principal name is,\n\n125\n00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.020\nin other words the user name\nthat we'll end up using, and\n\n126\n00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.780\nwhat it will display of inside\nof our Office 365 account, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.510\nSo let's verify that we\nactually can add that in, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.180\nSo at this point, let me see.\n\n129\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.370\nLet me go back to the admin center.\n\n130\n00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.990\nLet's verify I haven't put\nit in there yet, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.570\nOkay, it's pretty much\nthe key to doing this.\n\n132\n00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.295\nSo if I select here Users under\nthe admin center, well maybe.\n\n133\n00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:01.802\nLet's try it one more time.\n\n134\n00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:06.150\nI do not have sync admin\nlisted in here right now.\n\n135\n00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.870\nI have you and me listed, Zach.\n\n136\n00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.850\nBut I've got a few more accounts that\nwe've also created over time as well.\n\n137\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.000\nAnd now, let's see if we're successful at\nactually creating this particular account.\n\n138\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.950\nThough, unless I've actually\ntyped in something wrong,\n\n139\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.280\nwhich is a very likely possibility here,\nI can press Enter.\n\n140\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.280\nAnd now we get this, which is the output.\n\n141\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.190\nAnd it tells me what the password is right\nhere as well as the sync administrator.\n\n142\n00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.790\nAnd we have that set up.\n\n143\n00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.190\nSo at this point if I\nrefresh this content,\n\n144\n00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.092\nat least I hope that's what I'll do.\n\n145\n00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:47.419\nI'm gonna click back on home for a moment,\nand then we'll come back and to users.\n\n146\n00:08:50.522 --> 00:08:54.690\nNotice now,\nSync administrator has appeared.\n\n147\n00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:57.280\nOops, maybe, it's disappeared.\n\n148\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.215\nThere we go.\n\n149\n00:08:58.215 --> 00:09:00.990\nSync administrator has now appeared for\nus and\n\n150\n00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.150\nthere's exactly what I\nset up to sync admin.\n\n151\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.990\nUsername.\n\n152\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.238\nNo products have been\nassigned at this point.\n\n153\n00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:10.210\nSign in status, sign in is allowed.\n\n154\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:16.220\nWe actually have everything set up the way\nthat we want to for getting this to work.\n\n155\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.830\nNow could I have done this in the GUI?\n\n156\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.986\nYes, okay there's no doubt you\ncould have done this in the GUI.\n\n157\n00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:27.037\nLet me set a reminder here and\nsame thing that I also will say in 70-347.\n\n158\n00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:31.177\nEven though you can do it in the GUI, one\nof the things that you want to of course\n\n159\n00:09:31.177 --> 00:09:34.764\nbe able to do a lot of times is that\nit's easy enough to do in the GUI.\n\n160\n00:09:34.764 --> 00:09:39.410\nYou probably also gonna need to learn how\nto do this in the PowerShell as well.\n\n161\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.100\nSo to make this a service account,\nthe current policy for\n\n162\n00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.690\nus in terms of the expiration which\nwe did set in a previous episode.\n\n163\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.500\nWe talked about it for 42 days.\n\n164\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.960\nSix weeks time is what we talked\nabout it to be able to do.\n\n165\n00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.480\nBut I don't want this password essentially\nto expire cuz I want it to run.\n\n166\n00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.728\nAnd when we do that, I want it to\nactually run in the background for\n\n167\n00:10:01.728 --> 00:10:02.982\nwhatever else I need to.\n\n168\n00:10:02.982 --> 00:10:07.794\nSo at this point we're gonna change,\nor modify this user account.\n\n169\n00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:13.674\nInstead we're gonna do a set msol,\n\n170\n00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:19.946\nuser, the user principle name here,\n\n171\n00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:24.454\nand this is gonna be our sync\n\n172\n00:10:24.454 --> 00:10:29.370\nadmin at itprotvdemo.com.\n\n173\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.300\nAnd then I want the password.\n\n174\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.668\nAnd notice as I started typing it in,\n\n175\n00:10:33.668 --> 00:10:35.801\nthere's probably a couple\nof different options there.\n\n176\n00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.013\nBut actually for this one,\nit doesn't look like it.\n\n177\n00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.160\nLooks like password never\nexpires is our only option.\n\n178\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.300\nAt this point,\nI have only two options I can do.\n\n179\n00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.660\nWhich is one risk faults,\n\n180\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.020\nwhich means allow it to expire or\nI can set this to true.\n\n181\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.140\nNow I'm leaving this up on\nthe screen because Zach,\n\n182\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.350\nI can start seeing where I might be\nquestioned about something like this.\n\n183\n00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.690\nWhich of the following will\nactually allow me to create a user,\n\n184\n00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.910\na service account of some sort?\n\n185\n00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.700\nSo remember that the condition for the\nservice account, Zach, is fairly simple.\n\n186\n00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.900\nWe need a user account,\njust a regular user account.\n\n187\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.520\nBut one of the conditions is actually just\nto never allow the password to expire.\n\n188\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.609\nNow inside of the GUI interface\nis a simple check mark.\n\n189\n00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:25.673\nBut here we have to make sure that\nwe set this option here instead.\n\n190\n00:11:25.673 --> 00:11:28.923\nYou may see other options that\nare out there that sound close,\n\n191\n00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:31.500\nlike set the password,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n192\n00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.574\nBut that's the only option that appears\nwhen I tried to use the Auto Tab here or\n\n193\n00:11:35.574 --> 00:11:38.220\nthe Auto Complete to make this happen.\n\n194\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.466\nSo now if I press,\nlet me make sure I click on the end here.\n\n195\n00:11:43.466 --> 00:11:50.286\nAnd then if I do so,\nand it accepts it here,\n\n196\n00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:54.838\nI can do the getms msoluser.\n\n197\n00:11:54.838 --> 00:12:02.514\nAnd let's just his user principle name,\n\n198\n00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:08.885\nsync admin at itprotvdemo.com.\n\n199\n00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:11.300\nNow we can see that he's\nactually unlicensed here.\n\n200\n00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.700\nLet's see if I can,\ncan I get his password?\n\n201\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.290\nNope, not right here okay.\n\n202\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:22.600\nSo at this point, we can at least see\nthat at least for his particular account,\n\n203\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.430\nhis display name, he currently doesn't\nhave a license, which is perfectly fine.\n\n204\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:35.341\nNow if I go back and check his own account\nthough, Let's see if we can refresh him.\n\n205\n00:12:39.214 --> 00:12:41.370\nAnd get everything else that we need to.\n\n206\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.620\nSo we're not gonna actually change or\nreset his password for right now, but it's\n\n207\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.600\nright here that you actually do have all\nof the other things that you would set up.\n\n208\n00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.880\nSo that's fairly simple, so now I can take\nthat particular Sync administrator and\n\n209\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.760\nassign him to certain types of tasks\nthat need an authorization, but\n\n210\n00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.650\ndoesn't need an account that may expire.\n\n211\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.910\nSometimes you do this\nwithout thinking about it,\n\n212\n00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.390\nyou just enter your own credentials in.\n\n213\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.280\nAnd then when you change your password,\nand\n\n214\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.130\nwhatever was authorized at that point,\nthat password didn't change.\n\n215\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.280\nThat's when you have to go back and\nchange it again.\n\n216\n00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.900\nThat's when you know that you\nneed a service account instead.\n\n217\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.280\nThat will help you out.\n\n218\n00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.710\nSo this is one of the first things that we\nwant to make sure that we understand how\n\n219\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.890\nto do is to create this idea\nof a simple service account.\n\n220\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.810\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, when am I adding users?\n\n221\n00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.770\nI mean, we can do them one at a time but\nif you have 10,000 users,\n\n222\n00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.630\nthat's kinda crazy.\n\n223\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.860\nWe can do a bulk, can't we?\n\n224\n00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nthat's what we also wanna do now.\n\n225\n00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.987\nIn a previous episode,\neven when we were talking about this,\n\n226\n00:13:37.987 --> 00:13:40.093\nthe idea of creating\nthis is fairly simple.\n\n227\n00:13:40.093 --> 00:13:42.342\nWe can create a CSV file.\n\n228\n00:13:42.342 --> 00:13:47.607\nAnd we are able to download a CSV file\neven from inside of here by adding a user,\n\n229\n00:13:47.607 --> 00:13:52.510\nactually not by adding a user,\nit was adding more there it is.\n\n230\n00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.250\nBy importing multiple users,\n\n231\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.940\nit shows you I don't really\nremember where everything is.\n\n232\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.820\nSo with the import of\nthe multiple users here though,\n\n233\n00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.720\nit actually did allow us to create.\n\n234\n00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.940\nIt gave us a template,\nessentially a template to follow.\n\n235\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.060\nAnd we simply changed that template and\nwe were able to add them in that way.\n\n236\n00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.990\nSo we know that it can be\ndone using a CSV file.\n\n237\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.551\nAnd when we take a look at this just for\na moment.\n\n238\n00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:24.306\nWhen I did this for the other show,\nI think this is the one.\n\n239\n00:14:24.306 --> 00:14:25.510\nNope, that's not the one.\n\n240\n00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.030\nLet me see if I can find\nthe one that I ended up doing.\n\n241\n00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.910\nSo here's the template\nthat we followed and\n\n242\n00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.735\nhere's the sample that it gave us before.\n\n243\n00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:41.845\nI took this sample and remember that what\nI ended up doing is I changed it up here.\n\n244\n00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:44.885\nI added in names right here as well.\n\n245\n00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:48.585\nWe know it can be done through\nthe actual GUI interface.\n\n246\n00:14:48.585 --> 00:14:50.885\nBut at the same time,\nyou have to actually think,\n\n247\n00:14:50.885 --> 00:14:54.200\ncan this be done inside of PowerShell?\n\n248\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.510\nAnd that is also something else\nthat we want to be able to do.\n\n249\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.368\n&gt;&gt; Would you want to do some cut and paste\nhere, Ronnie, or do it all from scratch?\n\n250\n00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:06.340\n&gt;&gt; If you can,\nmore then likely in a realistic situation,\n\n251\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.000\nthere's a couple ways that\nthis ends up happening.\n\n252\n00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.230\nEither you go to HR, your Human Resources\nand say, we're about to onboard\n\n253\n00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.550\nthis particular many users or\nthis department.\n\n254\n00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.880\nI need from HR an Excel spreadsheet\n\n255\n00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.340\nthat will actually list for\nme this information.\n\n256\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.550\nMore than likely inside of the human\nresources department, they can do that.\n\n257\n00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.700\nNow I'm not saying you go in and\ndemand it.\n\n258\n00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.670\nIf they can't, they can't.\n\n259\n00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.290\nThen you'll get the information\nin a nice Excel spreadsheet.\n\n260\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:47.380\nSave it as a .csv file and\nthat will help you out even more.\n\n261\n00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.344\nVerify that the information\nis exactly what you want, and\n\n262\n00:15:50.344 --> 00:15:53.139\nthat's what you'll actually\nhave available to you.\n\n263\n00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:54.414\nOnce we get that,\n\n264\n00:15:54.414 --> 00:15:59.604\nthen we don't really ever have to\nactually go into the interface at all.\n\n265\n00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:04.003\nIn Office 365, and\nwhat I've done is I've done that as well.\n\n266\n00:16:04.003 --> 00:16:06.350\nI've actually created one,\nI call it Bulk here.\n\n267\n00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.830\nIt's not a ton, it's just a few\nmore addresses that I've added in.\n\n268\n00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.150\nAnd this time I've changed it\nup a little bit here, Zach.\n\n269\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.318\nI added in UserPrincipalName,\nFirstName, LastName, DisplayName, and\n\n270\n00:16:17.318 --> 00:16:18.751\nUsageLocation instead so\n\n271\n00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:22.800\nthat's the information that I want to\nimport in as far as number of users.\n\n272\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.990\nI could have that, don't think about five.\n\n273\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.780\nThink about 50, think about 100,\nthink about 1,000 if you wanted to.\n\n274\n00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.450\nYou can do this as well.\n\n275\n00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.250\nIf you do 1,000 though, wait for it.\n\n276\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.520\nIt's gonna take a little bit more time\nbecause remember, you're setting this up\n\n277\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.550\nfrom your computer up into the cloud, so\ndon't expect it to be instantaneous, okay?\n\n278\n00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.325\nSo give it a moment or\ntwo to actually work as well okay.\n\n279\n00:16:45.325 --> 00:16:49.730\nAnd sometimes you may find out that\nyou'll expect and see failures as well.\n\n280\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.320\nSo it does happen.\n\n281\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.640\nThe key though, is once you get that\nCSV file, remember where you store it.\n\n282\n00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.850\nYou’ll need that full path.\n\n283\n00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:58.540\nOkay.\n\n284\n00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.370\nYou’ll need that location.\n\n285\n00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.970\nI made it easy on me and\nI stored it right at the C drive here, but\n\n286\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.850\nyou may make a folder here\nthat say CSV files or\n\n287\n00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:09.960\nwhatever it might be to\nmake it easier on you.\n\n288\n00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.395\nI just make it easier for\nthe screen so you didn’t see me typing\n\n289\n00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:19.120\nC:\\users\\ Administrator\\Documents\nforget that,\n\n290\n00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:24.250\nlet me just move it to this C: here\nto make it a little bit easier, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.840\nSo from this point on, I know where my\nusers are, which is right here in this\n\n292\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.860\nbulk .CSV file okay,\nthen I can go to PowerShell here okay,\n\n293\n00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.030\nand once I'm actually in PowerShell we\ncan go ahead and begin to create this.\n\n294\n00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.540\nNow you've got a couple\nways we can do this,\n\n295\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.510\nremember how we set up the user\ncredential inside of a variable first?\n\n296\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.675\nOkay well if I wanna type out that full\npath every time I need to refer to it,\n\n297\n00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:54.745\nthen I could do that, but\nan easier way for me instead,\n\n298\n00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:56.895\nis to actually create another variable.\n\n299\n00:17:56.895 --> 00:17:58.345\nAnd let's say, I will create this one,\n\n300\n00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:01.875\nand we'll call this one\naddusers at this point.\n\n301\n00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:05.023\nOkay, so users and then the variable here.\n\n302\n00:18:05.023 --> 00:18:08.685\nWe're gonna import.csv.\n\n303\n00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:10.560\nIs what we are gonna tell it.\n\n304\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.490\nThen inside of this variable,\nwe're gonna locate it in terms of a path,\n\n305\n00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:18.468\nand that's gonna be C:\\ and then bolt.csv.\n\n306\n00:18:18.468 --> 00:18:26.420\nI was able to use even the tab autofill\nto help me to find that file as well.\n\n307\n00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:30.550\nOkay, so that one helps us right there.\n\n308\n00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.560\nLet me go ahead and press Enter.\n\n309\n00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:44.040\nAnd so now I've created that particular\nvariable for us to be able to use.\n\n310\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.010\nNow that the variable's created, I'm\ngong to call up on that variable again.\n\n311\n00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.620\nSo this is going to be users.\n\n312\n00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.146\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe\nthat into a ForEach\n\n313\n00:18:55.146 --> 00:19:01.030\nobject statement -Object.\n\n314\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.910\nThis is where I have to\nuse the fancy brackets or\n\n315\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.570\ncurly braces, however you wanna call them.\n\n316\n00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.650\nI heard so many different names for them.\n\n317\n00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.290\nI don't even know which one's\nactually correct anymore.\n\n318\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.190\nSo curly brackets.\n\n319\n00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.410\n&gt;&gt; Curly brackets.\n\n320\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:14.530\n&gt;&gt; Burly brackets.\n\n321\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.510\n&gt;&gt; Are you making a hard claim on that?\n\n322\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.930\n&gt;&gt; I think it's curly brackets.\n\n323\n00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.350\n&gt;&gt; Curly brackets here, okay.\n\n324\n00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.260\nSo we're gonna actually\nalso add in a display name.\n\n325\n00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.720\nNow this is where it gets a little\nbit tricky along with this, right.\n\n326\n00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:36.840\nCuz we need a dollar sign underscore which\napparently I can't type in, display name.\n\n327\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.130\nSo this actually refers back to what\nwe're actually telling it to get.\n\n328\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.010\nSo we're actually saying hey go into\nthat import file for what you actually\n\n329\n00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.010\ncreated here, that dollar sign underscore\nessentially points back to get this one.\n\n330\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:54.130\nFor every one,\nget this one to come back to.\n\n331\n00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.100\nSo it's kind of a neat way to do this.\n\n332\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.990\nA little bit intimidating when you\nfirst start here, but it will work.\n\n333\n00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:07.230\nFirst name, same thing,\n$_ and then first name.\n\n334\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.670\nOops, make sure I'm telling you right.\n\n335\n00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:24.370\nDid I do that, first name,\nand then last name,\n\n336\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.810\nthen $_lastname.\n\n337\n00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.845\nWe're also gonna do\nthe User Principal Name here.\n\n338\n00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:43.813\nAnd $_.UserPrincipalName, and\n\n339\n00:20:43.813 --> 00:20:49.200\nthen one more which is Usage Location.\n\n340\n00:20:50.248 --> 00:21:00.007\nUsagelocation $_.usagelocation.\n\n341\n00:21:00.007 --> 00:21:03.800\nAnd close all that off, okay.\n\n342\n00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.370\nSo, now this where like I said,\n\n343\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.090\na little bit more advanced than some\nof the stuff that you're doing.\n\n344\n00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.940\nBut that's essentially what it's doing,\nit's saying, grab from what,\n\n345\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.080\nthe bulk CSV, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.860\nFor every object that you find, create a\nnew user, be sure you grab that particular\n\n347\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.990\ndisplay name that's listed there, and\nfirst name, last name, usage and location.\n\n348\n00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.770\nLet me verify something\nbefore I say yes here.\n\n349\n00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.120\nI wanna make sure I have all\nthose fields in there, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.180\nCuz if not it will return errors.\n\n351\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.850\nAnd that's what we're looking for\nright up here at the top.\n\n352\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:42.630\nIt doesn't really matter what order\nthat they're in the CSV file.\n\n353\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.770\nIt just matters that they're there and\nthat consistently all the data and\n\n354\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.420\nthe way that you have them here.\n\n355\n00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.500\nBut that's what you'll also\nend up seeing as well, okay?\n\n356\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.190\nSo that's all that really\nmatters at that point.\n\n357\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.320\n&gt;&gt; So PowerShell, because of what\nyou were doing in the command there,\n\n358\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.020\nthat will pull this information\nfrom the CSV file, right?\n\n359\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.590\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n360\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:01.230\n&gt;&gt; Right on, very cool.\n\n361\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.470\n&gt;&gt; So in theory if I've typed\nin everything correctly.\n\n362\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.030\nIf not it's just gonna spew\nred all over the screen and-\n\n363\n00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.560\n&gt;&gt; And then you'll do it again.\n\n364\n00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.316\n&gt;&gt; Then I'll cry.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:09.948\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, then I'll cry.\n\n366\n00:22:09.948 --> 00:22:10.936\nAnd that will end up happening.\n\n367\n00:22:10.936 --> 00:22:12.560\nBut let's see what happens here.\n\n368\n00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.850\nPress Enter and we'll give it a moment.\n\n369\n00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.620\nAnd so now, it actually says\na couple of things, right.\n\n370\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.130\nUnable to add this user because a user\nwith this principle name exists.\n\n371\n00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.890\nAnd that's because I\ntried to reuse the file.\n\n372\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.650\nSo it actually does make\nsense of what happened here.\n\n373\n00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.500\nSo on this particular list,\nit did add in a set,\n\n374\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.340\nactually none of them did it,\nno it actually did one, Megan.\n\n375\n00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.600\nIt did not Marisha, Sarah, Viki and\nRenee it says it added in.\n\n376\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.403\nAnd so let's see what happens, okay and\nthis is actually just not licensed.\n\n377\n00:22:47.403 --> 00:22:52.178\nSo it ave us Angie, it gave us Marisha,\nit gave us Sarah, it gave us Viki,\n\n378\n00:22:52.178 --> 00:22:53.270\nit gave us Rene.\n\n379\n00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.748\nMeagan's was the only one,\nand I just remembered that,\n\n380\n00:22:56.748 --> 00:23:00.588\nthat I did add in Meagan a little\nbit earlier in our episode, and\n\n381\n00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:04.060\nthere is Meagan,\nhas actually been added in.\n\n382\n00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.270\nSo those additional names have been added\nin, now, without me having to go and\n\n383\n00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.100\ndo anything, except for Meagan's here,\nand let's see if we can refresh this.\n\n384\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.420\nSee how many active users that we\nhave now to go about doing this.\n\n385\n00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.680\nNow look it looks like we are adding and\nthere they are.\n\n386\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.700\nSo there's some additional names\nthat we're starting to see here\n\n387\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.720\nthat we've added in.\n\n388\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.590\nSo we're adding in bulk users to\nbe able to do that as well, okay.\n\n389\n00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:40.894\nNow, along with this right,\nwhen you start to do something like this,\n\n390\n00:23:40.894 --> 00:23:44.430\nit really does help, okay,\nto make sure that you have it.\n\n391\n00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.776\nNow what about these things\nthat are unlicensed here, okay,\n\n392\n00:23:48.776 --> 00:23:53.803\nhow do I update something like that\nwhen I have these unlicensed users?\n\n393\n00:23:53.803 --> 00:23:55.578\nWell for us its simple.\n\n394\n00:23:55.578 --> 00:23:56.884\nWe go in here.\n\n395\n00:23:56.884 --> 00:23:59.500\nWe simply select a user.\n\n396\n00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.779\nWe you go down to the Product License,\nselect Edit, and\n\n397\n00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:07.750\nonce we do that we just simply turn it on,\nokay?\n\n398\n00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.300\nSo it makes sense we can do that\nindividually one at a time, but\n\n399\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.510\nwhat if I had 50 or 100 again?\n\n400\n00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.560\nIt begins to get expensive, okay.\n\n401\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.480\nOne, it should start making your heart\nflutter a little bit when you add in 50,\n\n402\n00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.350\nand let's say it's the E5, like $30 a pop,\n\n403\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.470\nall of a sudden when you start doing that,\nper month, okay?\n\n404\n00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:29.130\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n405\n00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, now all of a sudden you're like,\nyou start breathing a little bit harder\n\n406\n00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.810\nand realizing that, which is fine,\ncuz that's part of your job to do so.\n\n407\n00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.080\nBut at the same time, if you wanna\ndo that using PowerShell, okay,\n\n408\n00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.030\nit can also be done.\n\n409\n00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:47.760\nBut first let's go ahead and\nget a list of those who have,\n\n410\n00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.690\nfind out what licenses that we have\nright now before we get started.\n\n411\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.310\nSo I'm gonna actually\ndo the Get-MsolAccount,\n\n412\n00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:04.010\nwhich I can't spell, AccountSku, okay.\n\n413\n00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.264\nSo Sku here, press Enter.\n\n414\n00:25:07.945 --> 00:25:10.540\nAnd here we can actually take a look here.\n\n415\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:15.360\nSo right now I have this Enterprise Pack,\nITProTV demo code Enterprise Pack.\n\n416\n00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.740\n25 units, 7 consumed.\n\n417\n00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.583\nYou have to keep track of this stuff,\nright?\n\n418\n00:25:20.583 --> 00:25:24.016\nOr you're gonna actually run out of these\nlicenses relatively quickly here to do\n\n419\n00:25:24.016 --> 00:25:25.500\nthis, okay?\n\n420\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.059\nNow once I do that, I wanna get-MsolUser,\n\n421\n00:25:31.059 --> 00:25:37.710\nand let's do an all, and\nthen unlicensed only.\n\n422\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.770\nOkay, so let's find the unlicensed\nuser at this point, and there it is.\n\n423\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.510\nThere are my list of unlicensed\nusers that I have open and\n\n424\n00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.590\navailable to us as we want to get\nsomething like this, all right?\n\n425\n00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.154\nNow, even though we're kind of\njust showing you how to do this,\n\n426\n00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:59.850\nright, I really don't care about\nassigning a license to Ronnie or\n\n427\n00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.250\nto Sync Administrator.\n\n428\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.049\nBut let's go head and do this for just the\nsake of making sure cuz we only have a few\n\n429\n00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:07.830\nminutes left, so\nlet's do this as well, okay?\n\n430\n00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:13.570\nSo once I get that, I'm gonna reuse a part\nof this, which is gonna be at this part,\n\n431\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.130\nthe finding all of those unlicensed users.\n\n432\n00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:22.099\nFrom this point, I'm gonna type\n\n433\n00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:27.424\nthat into Set-MsolUserLicense,\n\n434\n00:26:27.424 --> 00:26:32.830\nthen do an Add_License here.\n\n435\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.920\nNow, the hard part is,\nwhat do you actually add in?\n\n436\n00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.220\nYou have to add in this AccountSkuId.\n\n437\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.380\nSo the way that it's\nactually done right here.\n\n438\n00:26:45.911 --> 00:26:51.010\nI'm gonna see if I can copy that,\nand then paste it in here.\n\n439\n00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.550\nOops, apparently I can't do it that way.\n\n440\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.036\nLet me try it one more time.\n\n441\n00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.940\nThere we go.\n\n442\n00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.020\nOkay, so that time I just highlighted it,\nI pressed Enter, and then I\n\n443\n00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.679\ncame down here where said AddLicenses,\nand I did right-click on my mouse.\n\n444\n00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.416\nAnd let's see if there's anything else\nI need to add in before I do that.\n\n445\n00:27:17.416 --> 00:27:26.638\nPress Enter, Usage parameter?\n\n446\n00:27:29.949 --> 00:27:32.157\nAll right, well,\nlet's set the usage parameter here.\n\n447\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.312\nOr location.\n\n448\n00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:42.340\nIt's not gonna let me do it.\n\n449\n00:27:44.574 --> 00:27:46.770\nAll right,\nI see what I've actually done here.\n\n450\n00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.120\nThe issue, right, is right here\nwhere it says parameter name.\n\n451\n00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.010\nI kept trying to add it in here, and\nit wouldn't allow me to do anything.\n\n452\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:00.020\nBut, taking a look at it here,\nI realize I need to do it up here in\n\n453\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.100\nthe beginning, where I add in\nUsageLocation, and there you go.\n\n454\n00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.090\nSo I can add it in right here, and we'll\nset this one up for US at this point.\n\n455\n00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.800\nSo, now when I get all of the users,\nI'm actually finding all\n\n456\n00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.500\nof the users in the US that don't have\nany licenses associated with them.\n\n457\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.280\nThen, I tell it I want to set those\nlicenses for those individuals,\n\n458\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.650\nat least that's what the idea is.\n\n459\n00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.160\nSo, there you go, okay?\n\n460\n00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.170\nSo, it's simple but\n\n461\n00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.820\nat the same time a bit confusing cuz\nI was trying to do it at the end.\n\n462\n00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.120\nSo, go back and\ncheck your syntax if you're doing that.\n\n463\n00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.858\nNow, what happens if you actually went\nahead and did it, kind of said, now,\n\n464\n00:28:38.858 --> 00:28:43.430\nwhat if you just get the users and\njust add in the licenses?\n\n465\n00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.430\nWell, it will see that licenses are\nalready assigned, just like what we saw\n\n466\n00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.680\nthere when Megan's account was\nalready used, and then skip it, okay?\n\n467\n00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.356\nBut at the same time it's\na little bit frightening,\n\n468\n00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:55.827\njust like when you see it goes red and\nyou're kind of like, I have to do this for\n\n469\n00:28:55.827 --> 00:28:56.550\n500 of them?\n\n470\n00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.880\nIt begins to get a little\nbit more worrisome.\n\n471\n00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.050\nBut in this instance here right?\n\n472\n00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.950\nAdding in that usage because the error\neven provided the proper one.\n\n473\n00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.110\nThis is where you go out on the Internet\nand you do a little bit of searching for\n\n474\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.930\nthat parameter, and it shows you\nexactly where it's supposed to go.\n\n475\n00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.800\nSo it helps you out, and\nthen you don't have to do it over again.\n\n476\n00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.749\nIt should add it in.\n\n477\n00:29:17.749 --> 00:29:22.580\nSo let's take a look and\nverify how this actually came about.\n\n478\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:27.325\nSo remember we have these particular\nlicenses that are not added in?\n\n479\n00:29:27.325 --> 00:29:30.909\nLet me go ahead and,\nI'm going to refresh, once again.\n\n480\n00:29:34.602 --> 00:29:38.530\nGet that back in there, and\nnow you can see, there we are.\n\n481\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:42.210\nWe actually, oops,\nsee the actual names here, and\n\n482\n00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.400\nnow they all have their\nenterprise licenses.\n\n483\n00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.190\nAnd instead of 7, if I hit the up arrow\na couple of different times here,\n\n484\n00:29:53.717 --> 00:29:55.565\nThe only one that doesn't have one is,\n\n485\n00:29:55.565 --> 00:29:59.570\nnotice this one, okay, which is that\nSync Administrator at this point.\n\n486\n00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.220\nAnd let's see how many licenses\nI've actually gone through as well.\n\n487\n00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.474\nSo now, notice that, there it is,\n25 active units are now active,\n\n488\n00:30:10.474 --> 00:30:14.012\nand then, how many I have access to,\nexcuse me.\n\n489\n00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:17.800\nAnd then, of course, 13 of them have\nnow currently been consumed, okay.\n\n490\n00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.840\nWhich means I'm using them right now.\n\n491\n00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.840\nBut that should help us to get started.\n\n492\n00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.630\nAnd what we actually need to\nbe able to do as well, okay?\n\n493\n00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:27.950\nAnd get that done.\n\n494\n00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.180\nNow there's only one other thing.\n\n495\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.780\nAnd since we have a couple of\nminutes left that I want to show for\n\n496\n00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.650\nmanaging these users is that,\nin a previous episode,\n\n497\n00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.730\nwe showed you how you could even\nrecover a user that had been deleted.\n\n498\n00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.130\nNow, there's two types of deletions here,\nand there's one you can recover from,\n\n499\n00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.795\nthere's one you can't, okay?\n\n500\n00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:50.870\nThere's what we call a soft deletion,\nokay?\n\n501\n00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:55.120\nA soft deletion will essentially\nhold that account for about 30 days.\n\n502\n00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:01.400\nAnd then if you wanted to, you could\nactually run a command, get-Msoluser,\n\n503\n00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:07.640\nand from that point, you can\nactually do remove, remove-Msoluser.\n\n504\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.110\nAnd then you can actually do\na restore-Msoluser and get that back.\n\n505\n00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:15.220\nWe showed you how to do that\nin a previous episode, okay?\n\n506\n00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.590\nBut what if you go, I don't care,\nI don't want that to happen, okay?\n\n507\n00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.870\nI want to make sure it's permanently\nremoved, I don't want it to go past Go.\n\n508\n00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.930\nI don't wanna do any, go straight to jail.\n\n509\n00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.100\nI don't want that to be recovered.\n\n510\n00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:34.030\nWell, you run the same command again, so\nlet's go ahead and do that as well, okay?\n\n511\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.200\nSo, I gotta pick a name.\n\n512\n00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.310\nThat's what becomes hard,\ncuz I messed up everybody's name here.\n\n513\n00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.220\nSo we'll pick Marisha at this point here,\nokay?\n\n514\n00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.790\nBustav is what we'll actually do,\nMarisha Bustav.\n\n515\n00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:52.376\nSo at this point here,\nif I wanted to remove, I do get-Msoluser.\n\n516\n00:31:52.376 --> 00:31:59.440\nAnd then from this point here,\nnot get, it's remove-Msoluser.\n\n517\n00:32:03.308 --> 00:32:07.518\nUserPrincipalName, and\n\n518\n00:32:07.518 --> 00:32:14.793\nthis would be Marisha@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n519\n00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:19.331\nAnd then -remove.\n\n520\n00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.414\nRecycle bin, okay?\n\n521\n00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:26.429\nThat's the difference, okay?\n\n522\n00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:32.040\nBefore when we talked about that soft\ndeletion where we could recover that,\n\n523\n00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.722\nnotice this one,\nif you say remove recycle bin and\n\n524\n00:32:35.722 --> 00:32:41.810\nthen you add in force here, okay,\nthat says don't store it for 30 days.\n\n525\n00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.533\nTake it away.\n\n526\n00:32:42.533 --> 00:32:47.274\nThis is what's called a hard\ndelete that you will not be\n\n527\n00:32:47.274 --> 00:32:49.862\nable to recover from, okay?\n\n528\n00:32:49.862 --> 00:32:52.343\nSo in that sense, right?\n\n529\n00:32:52.343 --> 00:32:54.136\nMake sure you know the difference here.\n\n530\n00:32:54.136 --> 00:32:57.861\nSoft delete, stored in recycle\nbin essentially for 30 days.\n\n531\n00:32:57.861 --> 00:32:58.731\nAnd this can happen.\n\n532\n00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:01.728\nLet's say that you do stuff like I do,\nright?\n\n533\n00:33:01.728 --> 00:33:05.401\nYou're removing that user account cuz\nyou want to test if it works here and\n\n534\n00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.009\nall of a sudden, you go crud!\n\n535\n00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:08.660\nI deleted it, I can't recover it.\n\n536\n00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.736\nWell what if you do need\nto recover that one?\n\n537\n00:33:10.736 --> 00:33:15.204\nWell make sure you only do the soft\ndelete, don't add in the remove from\n\n538\n00:33:15.204 --> 00:33:19.454\nrecycle bin or the /force,\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n539\n00:33:19.454 --> 00:33:22.700\nNow you really need it gone,\nthis is the way to do it.\n\n540\n00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.630\nSo, running those commands\nwill allow you to not recover.\n\n541\n00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.370\nI'm gonna leave it for right now\nbecause I want to keep some of these\n\n542\n00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:34.040\naccounts actually ready and going, as we\ncontinue to move forward in our show here.\n\n543\n00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.770\nBut overall though, those are kinda some\nof the different things that we want to\n\n544\n00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:41.590\nmake sure that we are keeping track of,\nand that we can manage.\n\n545\n00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.780\nNow there are still some PowerShell\n\n546\n00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.660\ncommands left to go throughout\nthe remainder of this series.\n\n547\n00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.070\nBut as far as us individually being\nable to manage, and doing a few things\n\n548\n00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:57.090\nthrough the PowerShell, especially\nwith the cloud identity side of it.\n\n549\n00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.730\nThis is the way to actually go, okay?\n\n550\n00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.360\nWhen you go in to enabling\nthe services in PowerShell,\n\n551\n00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.870\nyou'll see we have a complete show for\nthat.\n\n552\n00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.470\nAnd you'll see that we hit just\nabout every PowerShell command\n\n553\n00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:14.030\nthat we can think of, to make sure that\nwe cover it well for you too, okay?\n\n554\n00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:18.990\nBut, Zach, from this point here, this\nshould get us up to speed on this idea of\n\n555\n00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:21.660\ndoing some management of\nthese cloud identities, and\n\n556\n00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.800\nwe've done it pretty much\nall from the PowerShell.\n\n557\n00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.020\n&gt;&gt; Great job as usual, Ronnie.\n\n558\n00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.262\nThanks very much.\n\n559\n00:34:26.262 --> 00:34:29.028\nCloud identities with PowerShell,\ngood episode.\n\n560\n00:34:29.028 --> 00:34:32.548\nIn fact, all the episodes in\nthe Office 365 series are awesome, so\n\n561\n00:34:32.548 --> 00:34:33.932\nmake sure you see them all.\n\n562\n00:34:33.932 --> 00:34:37.015\nAnd go to our course library,\nthere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n563\n00:34:37.015 --> 00:34:40.582\nThey're all designed for\none thing, to help you go further.\n\n564\n00:34:40.582 --> 00:34:42.707\nAnd tell everyone you know ITProTV.\n\n565\n00:34:42.707 --> 00:34:44.343\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n566\n00:34:44.343 --> 00:34:45.868\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n567\n00:34:45.868

00:00:08.219\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.799\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.982\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:15.714\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:19.870\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.330\nThis is gonna be Azure Active Directory\nCmdlets, what's that all about?\n\n9\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.090\nWell, Ronnie Wong is here, he's our\nIT expert and our Office 365 expert.\n\n10\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.810\nRonnie, show us the way, would you?\n\n11\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.490\nWhat is an Azure Active Directory Cmdlet?\n\n12\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.120\n&gt;&gt; Well when it comes down to it we,\nof course, have been using PowerShell.\n\n13\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.790\nAnd because, well,\n\n14\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.630\na lot of times PowerShell is gonna\nbe whatever you see on the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.384\nBut also it's gonna be the way that\nadministrators are gonna want to be able\n\n16\n00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:51.508\nto manage what happens, right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.508 --> 00:00:55.092\nSo the GUI interface,\ndon't get me wrong it has its place, but\n\n18\n00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:59.553\nmore than likely as you start doing a lot\nof things that are gonna be automated,\n\n19\n00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:03.560\nthings that you want to make sure\nthat you can run very quickly.\n\n20\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.530\nPowerShell, essentially, is the way to go.\n\n21\n00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.580\nSo to help us out in the Microsoft world,\nthey created, of course, PowerShell.\n\n22\n00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.560\nNow PowerShell itself is a very\npowerful language that you can use and\n\n23\n00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.630\nyou can do scripting, you can do\na lot of different things with it.\n\n24\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.961\nCmdlets, C-M-D-L-E-T, and\n\n25\n00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:26.720\nthat's the way that they're actually kind\nof pronounced here and spelled, right?.\n\n26\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.395\nSo you don't actually type out command and\nthen L-E-T-S, but\n\n27\n00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:34.830\na C-M-D-L-E-T-S is cmdlets there.\n\n28\n00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.600\nThese are small chunks of the coding\nthat's inside of PowerShell,\n\n29\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.210\nand it is designed to be where\nit's relatively intuitive.\n\n30\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.290\nThere's always gonna be a verb and\nthen there's gonna be a noun.\n\n31\n00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.790\nSo you're always gonna see,\nin those cmdlets,\n\n32\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.570\nthat it actually has a verb\nattached to it, such as get or\n\n33\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.980\nset or new or something.\n\n34\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.910\nIt's gonna actually be\nsomething like that, and\n\n35\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.000\nthen whatever you want to accomplish.\n\n36\n00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.420\nAnd it's supposed to, like I said,\nbe relatively intuitive.\n\n37\n00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.476\nSomething that you're not gonna\nhave to re-learn everything.\n\n38\n00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:16.973\nBut the longer that PowerShell has\nbeen in existence, the wider and\n\n39\n00:02:16.973 --> 00:02:22.510\nthe more powerful this library\nhas grown and grown and grown.\n\n40\n00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.257\nThat you're gonna see that there's a lot\nmore commands that are available to us,\n\n41\n00:02:26.257 --> 00:02:28.770\nand a lot more cmdlets that\nare available to us as well.\n\n42\n00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.776\nAnd we need to actually think\nabout using those, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:36.522\nSo a cmdlet essentially is that,\nthe essentially pre-formed or\n\n44\n00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:40.492\npre-built commands or\ncmdlets that we have in there,\n\n45\n00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:44.380\nthat allow us to do something\ninside of PowerShell.\n\n46\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.110\n&gt;&gt; Right, I was just,\nin fact, I was gonna ask you,\n\n47\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.100\nhow is the Azure Active Directory cmdlet\ndifferent than a command in PowerShell?\n\n48\n00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.130\nBut you're already explaining it, and\nyou're doing a great job [LAUGH].\n\n49\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.595\n&gt;&gt; Well no, the idea,\nit is a different concept.\n\n50\n00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:59.855\nSo I don't think that you'll\nbe asked this on the exam so\n\n51\n00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:02.570\ndon't worry about like, let me make\nsure I know the difference here.\n\n52\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.360\nBut for you to know the difference,\nwhen people talk about Active Directory\n\n53\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.910\ncommands versus cmdlets, cmdlets\nare what you get from PowerShell, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.480\nSo you're not adding anything in.\n\n55\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.790\nA cmdlet essentially is, here's what\nthis cmdlet does for you, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.610\nAnd so if you need it done,\nyou're gonna use this cmdlet.\n\n57\n00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.915\nBut when you start actually\ntalking about commands,\n\n58\n00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:26.160\nnow you're starting to talk about\nadding in options and the variables.\n\n59\n00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.844\nAnd you're adding all that together.\n\n60\n00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:33.500\nAnd then the whole thing that you add in,\nthat customizes it for what you need.\n\n61\n00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.040\nThat becomes an, I almost said Active\nDirectory, a PowerShell command, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.110\nSo there is different terminology,\nand people might go that's not right,\n\n63\n00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.190\nit doesn't matter.\n\n64\n00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.820\nBut that's the way that it\nreally boils down to, right?\n\n65\n00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.300\nSo cmdlet is what you get based from\nPowerShell itself, commands such as how\n\n66\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.040\nyou customize it for your environment\nto run exactly what you need to do.\n\n67\n00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.360\nAnd that whole thing, essentially,\nare the commands that you have.\n\n68\n00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.110\nNow we're not really talking about\njust overall PowerShell unto itself,\n\n69\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.850\nwhich could do just about anything that\nyou can think about inside of a Windows\n\n70\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.630\n10 machine, inside of a Server 2016,\n2012, heck, all the way back to 2008.\n\n71\n00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.030\nAnything that you can do in the GUI,\nyou can do in the PowerShell as well.\n\n72\n00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.326\nIt used to be,\nwhen they started doing this, and\n\n73\n00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.910\nthat probably still is part\nof the design philosophy.\n\n74\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.800\nIf it can't be done in\nthe PowerShell then, in theory,\n\n75\n00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.690\nit can't be done in the GUI.\n\n76\n00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.380\nBecause in the background of all of\nthe GUI interface that you're seeing,\n\n77\n00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.090\nit more than likely is PowerShell\nrunning that's actually doing that.\n\n78\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.100\nAnd you're just kinda saying, here's\nwhat I want done, and it's going out,\n\n79\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.380\nfinding the right cmdlet,\nand issuing that.\n\n80\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.720\nAnd that's what it's essentially doing,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.570\nSo that's kinda the power behind\nthe PowerShell that we have.\n\n82\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.240\nToday though, we're focusing in on\nkind of a subset of all of PowerShell,\n\n83\n00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.290\nand that is focusing in on\nAzure Active Directory cmdlets.\n\n84\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.786\nNow in this episode, there's gonna\nbe where you are gonna see that,\n\n85\n00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:07.800\nthere are already cmdlets that you and\n\n86\n00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.810\nI have run together to be\nable to create user accounts,\n\n87\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.160\nto be able to remove them,\nto create security groups.\n\n88\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.945\nTo actually add users, you name it,\n\n89\n00:05:16.945 --> 00:05:22.490\nwe've done quite a bit in PowerShell so\nfar, and we're still gonna be doing more.\n\n90\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.527\nBut we're also gonna end up seeing that\nthere's gonna be a list of some of them\n\n91\n00:05:25.527 --> 00:05:28.114\nthat we haven't come to yet\nthat we'll be covering in the shows.\n\n92\n00:05:28.114 --> 00:05:30.845\nAnd we're also gonna see that\nin Azure Active Directory and\n\n93\n00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:32.936\ntheir cmdlets that we\ncan run in PowerShell.\n\n94\n00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.130\nThere's gonna be some we're\nnot gonna cover at all,\n\n95\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.840\nand that's because it actually\ndoesn't fit well in our context.\n\n96\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.790\nAnd only in a real, practical,\n\n97\n00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.180\nenvironmental situation are you\nprobably ever gonna run it.\n\n98\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.770\nAnd only in a specific situation\nare you really ever going to need it.\n\n99\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.935\nWe'll talk about all of them\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n100\n00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:55.649\nBut we will run some of them so\nthat we can get familiar with them again.\n\n101\n00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:58.505\nSo it's a bit of review and\nyou'll kind of hopefully go, yeah,\n\n102\n00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:01.130\nI remember that command,\nand that will help you out.\n\n103\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.140\nSome of them you won't actually\nsee probably again until you're\n\n104\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.940\nactually asked to look it up and\nresearch it a little bit more.\n\n105\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.334\nSome of them we're gonna see later\non as we continue to produce through\n\n106\n00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:11.680\nthis show, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.430\nSo that's what we're actually\ngonna be taking a look at as well.\n\n108\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.880\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, so Ronnie, is there anything\nspecial we need before we get started with\n\n109\n00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.522\nAzure Active Directory cmdlets?\n\n110\n00:06:19.522 --> 00:06:22.898\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there's gonna be a couple of\nthings that we're gonna need to make sure\n\n111\n00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:25.349\nthat we do, and\nthen we'll come back and understand.\n\n112\n00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.202\nSo the first thing that we want to do is,\nlet me switch to the correct machine,\n\n113\n00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:31.970\nhow's that, okay?\n\n114\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.950\nThat would actually help, so\nwhen we start to do this.\n\n115\n00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.374\nLet me bring up, and I've already\ncovered this in the show previously, but\n\n116\n00:06:40.374 --> 00:06:41.976\njust as a reminder, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:41.976 --> 00:06:45.180\nRemember that when you\nare now choosing to run for\n\n118\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.660\nAzure Active Directory commands, right?\n\n119\n00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.579\nThis means something that is different\nthan running it on your own machine inside\n\n120\n00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:57.630\nof your workplace environment,\ninside of your lab environment,\n\n121\n00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.752\nbecause that only effects where?\n\n122\n00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:03.699\nThat environment, when you start\nto do this for Office 365 or\n\n123\n00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.598\nyou've got an Azure portal, Azure.com\naccount and you actually have an Azure\n\n124\n00:07:08.598 --> 00:07:13.010\nsubscription and you're doing all that,\nwell, that's different.\n\n125\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.430\nThat means you're able to sit at your\nmachine, using the PowerShell window that\n\n126\n00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.226\nyou have, and you need to send\ncommands that are gonna affect where?\n\n127\n00:07:21.226 --> 00:07:26.270\nUp there, not here, but up there to do so.\n\n128\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.000\nSo you can go and\nfind this link right here.\n\n129\n00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.923\nSo all I did is,\nI opened up a search window and\n\n130\n00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:39.270\nI typed in connect to Office\n365 using PowerShell.\n\n131\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.520\nAnd I wanna make sure that I remind\nyou of kind of the prerequisite\n\n132\n00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.760\nthings that you need to get\ninstalled onto your computer first.\n\n133\n00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.212\nSo as I scroll down, take a look,\ngo through this entire article, but\n\n134\n00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:54.029\nin a short run here, right?\n\n135\n00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:59.572\nStep number one, you wanna pay attention\nto both of these right here, okay?\n\n136\n00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:03.621\nInstall the Microsoft Online\nService Sign-in Assistance for\n\n137\n00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:06.300\nIT Professionals, get that installed.\n\n138\n00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.889\nIt's going to run, it's not going to\ngive you a gigantic output at the end.\n\n139\n00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:14.190\nIt is setting up that commands and\nsetting up everything that we need to so\n\n140\n00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:19.430\nthat we can sign in the way that we\nneed to in these cloud services as well.\n\n141\n00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.180\nThe other one is install\nthe 64 bit version of\n\n142\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.120\nthe Microsoft Azure Active\nDirectory Module for PowerShell.\n\n143\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.250\nOkay, so this will actually allow you to\ngo ahead and get that command done and\n\n144\n00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.000\nyou can download it and\nget that installed as well.\n\n145\n00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.440\nNow there are others that are out there,\nokay?\n\n146\n00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.370\nThere's one for Exchange.\n\n147\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.740\nThere's one for Skype for Business,\nthere's one for SharePoint and\n\n148\n00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.150\nyou name it, there's a lot these\nthat are actually out there and\n\n149\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.450\navailable to you, and that actually allows\nyou to set that up and get it ready to go.\n\n150\n00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.442\nOn top of that, right,\ndepending on what you need.\n\n151\n00:08:56.442 --> 00:08:59.330\nIf you're saying,\nI need to do all that stuff,\n\n152\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.014\nmake sure you watch the 70-347 show,\nwhere we go in and\n\n153\n00:09:03.014 --> 00:09:06.864\nwe show you how to install all\nthese different modules as well.\n\n154\n00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:09.770\nIt's not difficult, you just install it,\nand it actually works.\n\n155\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.900\nBut we show you how to get connected.\n\n156\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.440\nWe even show you something where you\ncan conglomerate all of them into\n\n157\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.510\none PowerShell interface, so that you're\nnot having to go, was it this one or\n\n158\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.770\nwas it this one that I\nopened it up to do this?\n\n159\n00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.890\nSo we actually run all those commands in\none particular window to allow you to go\n\n160\n00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.230\nbetween all those different\ncomponents inside of Office 365.\n\n161\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.830\nNow, I wanted to also show you\none that we've run a little bit\n\n162\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.790\npreviously here too.\n\n163\n00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.360\nEarlier in our series we also\ndid a show on rights management.\n\n164\n00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.740\nAnd in rights management,\n\n165\n00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.440\nyou all actually end up finding out\nsomething just like you will for some of\n\n166\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.805\nthese other Azure Active Directory command\nlist that are here unavailable for us.\n\n167\n00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:55.200\nBut you might find out that you don't\nhave all of the actual commands\n\n168\n00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.910\navailable to you.\n\n169\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.550\nAnd if you dont, what you'll need to do\nis you'll need to download the proper\n\n170\n00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:06.190\nadministration tool that will\nalso add in those additional\n\n171\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.140\ncapabilities inside of your PowerShell.\n\n172\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.540\nSo this one, for example,\nis the one that we downloaded for\n\n173\n00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.300\nAzure Rights Management\nAdministration Tool.\n\n174\n00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.630\nWithout it, I didn't have\nthe command that I needed to, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.800\nSo with it,\nI was able to do everything that I needed.\n\n176\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.070\nSo don't overlook those\nbasic bare function and\n\n177\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.100\nfacts when we actually get started here,\nokay?\n\n178\n00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.180\nSo just wanna make sure that you had that.\n\n179\n00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.430\nNow once you get that done, right?\n\n180\n00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.980\nThen of course that means\na connection needs to be made\n\n181\n00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.760\ninto Azure Active Directory.\n\n182\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.320\nNow I'm gonna do this in a different way,\nokay?\n\n183\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.120\nI know that a lot of people just go,\n\n184\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.150\nall you have to do is actually\nimport in what you normally need to.\n\n185\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:55.439\nSo for us that would be\nlike import-msol Microsoft.\n\n186\n00:10:59.102 --> 00:11:01.730\n-ms, why can't I remember, Microsoft.\n\n187\n00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.370\nModule.\nImport module.\n\n188\n00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.480\nImport module, that's it.\n\n189\n00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.720\nSee, I always forget, see.\n\n190\n00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.450\nImport-Module msonline.\n\n191\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.480\nI always forget the n for the online.\n\n192\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.910\nSo you import the module, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.710\nSo that's the very beginning.\n\n194\n00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.689\nFrom that point, you're gonna need to\nmake a connection into the office online\n\n195\n00:11:18.689 --> 00:11:22.181\nwhich again is also a part of\nAzure Active Directory, so\n\n196\n00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.256\nI always like to create\na variable at this point.\n\n197\n00:11:32.157 --> 00:11:36.120\nExcuse me, I typed in the wrong command,\nI don't know what I was thinking.\n\n198\n00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.330\nJust not thinking pretty much.\n\n199\n00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.230\nAll right, so let's do that.\n\n200\n00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.302\nAnd we'll use Cherokee's credentials here.\n\n201\n00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:52.768\n[LAUGH] So once I get that,\nlet me make sure I get the right password.\n\n202\n00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:05.062\nAnd remember that on that one when\nyou actually are doing this to create\n\n203\n00:12:05.062 --> 00:12:05.846\nthat variable,\n\n204\n00:12:05.846 --> 00:12:09.900\nit will take a password regardless of\nwhether it's spelled right or not.\n\n205\n00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.580\nSo it could be if I didn't spell it right,\nI'm going to get an error that says,\n\n206\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.070\nhey your credentials are bunk.\n\n207\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.670\nThey don't, just rerun this command\nagain and that will help you.\n\n208\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.899\nAnd at that point we are gonna\ndo a connect-msolservice,\n\n209\n00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:28.914\nI'm gonna tell it to run verbose here,\nthen also ask for\n\n210\n00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:34.270\nthe credentials and\ncall upon the variable, press Enter.\n\n211\n00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.340\nSo if it accepts it, now you're\nconnected to Microsoft Online or\n\n212\n00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.870\nAzure Active Directly Online and\n\n213\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.640\nyou're also connecting into Office\n365 is pretty much what you're doing.\n\n214\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.210\nBecause we used Cherokee's credential for\nITProTV demo, it connects us into\n\n215\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:57.630\nour own ITProTV demo account,\nthe tenancy that we created.\n\n216\n00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.680\nSo we're not messing around\nwith anybody else's.\n\n217\n00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.260\nSo that's where it actually\nkeys into everything.\n\n218\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.030\nAlright, now,\n\n219\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.230\nwhen we start talking about Azure Active\nDirectory commandlet style, okay?\n\n220\n00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.830\nThis is what I wanted to bring up\nbefore we get really started here.\n\n221\n00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:19.190\nSo there's eight different groupings\nof commands that are actually\n\n222\n00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.370\nin Azure Active Directory commandlets.\n\n223\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.680\nNow, there's actually a range between 4\n\n224\n00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.150\nin the groups all the way up to 9 to 13,\nI mean there is a lot of different\n\n225\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.520\ncommands that we are gonna be taking a\nlook at, at least briefly on some of them.\n\n226\n00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.520\nNow some of them we've already\ngone through in our series.\n\n227\n00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.480\nSo I do challenge you to go\nback over those as well, and\n\n228\n00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.660\nsome of them we'll actually kind of\ndo right here during our show too.\n\n229\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.840\nBut it seems relatively intuitive\n\n230\n00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.070\non what we are actually talking about here\nas we continue to take a look, right?\n\n231\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.260\nUser management, that's probably more of\nwhat we've been, actually these first two.\n\n232\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.390\nUser management and group and\nrole management, these we probably covered\n\n233\n00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.620\nfairly well, okay, throughout our show and\nwe'll review some of those.\n\n234\n00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.180\nAnd we probably won't type in\na lot of them at this point, but\n\n235\n00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.660\nwe'll review some of\nthose in just a moment.\n\n236\n00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.447\nService Principal Management,\nwe haven't gone into at all.\n\n237\n00:14:15.447 --> 00:14:18.640\nI'm going to hold off on that one just for\na moment.\n\n238\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.184\nDomain Management allows us to\nbe able to check and verify.\n\n239\n00:14:23.184 --> 00:14:30.001\nThis is more about DNS than anything,\nright?\n\n240\n00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:33.280\nIt boils down to DNS,\nis what I'm really meaning to say here.\n\n241\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.190\nIf you've been watching the series,\nif you kind of scroll back in time\n\n242\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.760\nto prior when the first few\nepisodes that we did when\n\n243\n00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.698\nwe showed you how to make sure that we\ncould use our own DNS settings okay?\n\n244\n00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:49.840\nAnd we had to verify this by\n\n245\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:55.000\ntelling Office 365 that we owned\nat that particular domain name.\n\n246\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.460\nDomain Management helps us\nto do that as well, okay.\n\n247\n00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.230\nSo we will kind of take\na look at that too.\n\n248\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.160\nSSO or Single Sign-on management.\n\n249\n00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.854\nThis is not something that\nwe've gone to yet, okay?\n\n250\n00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:12.260\nBut we are coming up on those particular\nobjectives in the near future.\n\n251\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.690\nIf you not already have watched it, right?\n\n252\n00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.400\nSorry, it depends on how you\nactually watch the episodes here.\n\n253\n00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:23.060\nWe do, we will and we do have other\nepisodes that are going to be available\n\n254\n00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.470\nfor you where you can take a look at\nactually doing Single Sign-on, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:34.700\nSo that means a single authentication\nbetween your on premises as well as your\n\n256\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.860\ncloud subscription in the Office 365\nas well, and you'll see that there's\n\n257\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:45.390\nactually gonna be some management\ncommandlets that are available to us too.\n\n258\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.120\nSubscription and Licensing Management,,\nthis is more about tenancy management than\n\n259\n00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.560\nanything and we've looked that a couple of\nthem so far, so we'll review that one too.\n\n260\n00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.372\nNow company information\nservice management,\n\n261\n00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:59.769\nadministrative unit management here.\n\n262\n00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:02.174\nThese are things that we have not covered.\n\n263\n00:16:02.174 --> 00:16:07.637\nSo Service Principal Management, Company\nInformation and Service Management here,\n\n264\n00:16:07.637 --> 00:16:11.560\nAdministrative Unit Management,\nwe have not touched those.\n\n265\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.440\nAnd we will talk about the complexities\nof those things as we go through this in\n\n266\n00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:20.060\nterms of a basic review of some\nof these concepts here, okay.\n\n267\n00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.410\nSo let's go ahead and get started and\n\n268\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:28.150\nwe will talk about some of the ones that\nwe want to make sure that we do see, okay.\n\n269\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.470\n&gt;&gt; So my question to you is,\nwe kind of talked about users and\n\n270\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.420\nuser management already.\n\n271\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.760\nSo this is basically an overview as\nit involves the commandlet, right?\n\n272\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.270\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n273\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so, we're just kind of making\nsure that we understand what they're for\n\n274\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.550\nat this point but if something actually\nlooks interesting at this point.\n\n275\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.640\nCuz we've done a lot of this.\n\n276\n00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.580\nLike Set-MsolUser.\n\n277\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.580\nWe've removed the user.\n\n278\n00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.640\nWe've created a new one.\n\n279\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.770\nWe've gotten their information.\n\n280\n00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.430\nSo we've done a lot that we\nhave seen on the screen so far.\n\n281\n00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:02.110\nBut there are a couple that I\nwant to point out right away.\n\n282\n00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.030\nNow, even right here\nat the very beginning.\n\n283\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:12.615\nThis one is one that we haven't covered,\nwhich is Convert-MsolFederatedUser, okay.\n\n284\n00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:16.405\nSo the way that I've defined this is\nupdates to domain user accounts for\n\n285\n00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:20.255\nSSO converted to standard authentication,\nokay.\n\n286\n00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:25.405\nAnd you have do provide a new password, so\nin this instance here on this particular\n\n287\n00:17:25.405 --> 00:17:30.285\ntype of command, this is if you\nare actually taking your formerly single\n\n288\n00:17:30.285 --> 00:17:35.630\nsign on, Federated service,\nwith Office 365.\n\n289\n00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.350\nAnd now you're deciding you're ready to\nuse the regular old conventional username\n\n290\n00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.070\nand password instead.\n\n291\n00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.180\nWell, that's probably something that\nwe're not really gonna end up doing.\n\n292\n00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.380\nBut they do give you the option because\nthey don't want you to feel like you're\n\n293\n00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.290\nlocked in to whatever\nthat setting is gonna be.\n\n294\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.863\nIf you choose not to federate or\nnot to actually do the single sign on,\n\n295\n00:17:55.863 --> 00:17:59.005\nthey're giving you this opportunity\nto be able to do this for\n\n296\n00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:01.117\na particular user if you want to, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:01.117 --> 00:18:04.682\nSo that's a little bit more challenging\nbut notice this one actually requires\n\n298\n00:18:04.682 --> 00:18:07.810\nthem to provide a new password\nif you're going to do that.\n\n299\n00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:12.100\nSo you're not going to be able to\nreuse that same password to do so.\n\n300\n00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.000\nGetting, of course,\nMsolUser retrieves user information.\n\n301\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.940\nCreating a new user allows us to do this.\n\n302\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.950\nAnd like I said, we've already done\nthe majority of these right here, okay?\n\n303\n00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:29.820\nSetting the MsolUser, okay, gives us\nthe ability to edit, is what we see.\n\n304\n00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.570\nNow along with that,\nthere are just a few more and\n\n305\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.600\nwe've actually done these two as well\nwhere we have taken a look at the,\n\n306\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.520\nactually we didn't do this,\nset user principal name.\n\n307\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.450\nBut we have actually covered\nthe the user password.\n\n308\n00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.061\nSo I am not so\nworried about changing that one, okay.\n\n309\n00:18:46.061 --> 00:18:49.484\nSo it actually allows us to set\nthe password and do this, but\n\n310\n00:18:49.484 --> 00:18:53.350\nthis is not designed for\nsingle sign on accounts.\n\n311\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:58.370\nSo a little bit tricky in terms of what\nit's actually used for or when it's used.\n\n312\n00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.480\nYou don't have to know every\nsingle one of these for the exams.\n\n313\n00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.280\nThe ones that we're probably going over\nin the show are pretty much the ones that\n\n314\n00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.770\nyou definitely need to know for sure.\n\n315\n00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.590\nNow what about these other ones\nthat we really haven't hit?\n\n316\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.000\nThose are for occasions that you're\nnot gonna necessarily need but\n\n317\n00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.180\nat the same time we're throwing this\nin here for the sake of completeness.\n\n318\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.530\nNow the only other one right\nhere is Redo-MsolProvisionUser.\n\n319\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:30.350\nThis is only if you get a valid error,\nokay.\n\n320\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.363\nIf you try to actually create a user and\nit gave you an error, in other words,\n\n321\n00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:36.183\na validation error at some point,\n\n322\n00:19:36.183 --> 00:19:40.450\nit probably means something was\nskipped that it didn't recognize.\n\n323\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.252\nAnd instead of you actually just rerunning\nthe same command it says to redo\n\n324\n00:19:45.252 --> 00:19:48.340\nthe provisioning of that user again.\n\n325\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.390\nSo, only if you actually do get a\nparticular validation error, because this\n\n326\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.524\ncommand can be used to re-attempt\nthe provisioning of that user, all right?\n\n327\n00:19:56.524 --> 00:19:59.824\nSo the great thing is,\non the user management side,\n\n328\n00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:03.220\nit's nothing that we really\nhaven't seen or done.\n\n329\n00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.318\nSo let's just make sure that, we'll\njust run kind of the simple ones here.\n\n330\n00:20:06.318 --> 00:20:08.630\nLet's do get-Msol user okay.\n\n331\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.570\nThat's probably the most\npopular one that we'll end\n\n332\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:18.290\nup seeing here and now we'll see\nthere's a list of our names that we\n\n333\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.980\nhave available to us that we\ncan also be able to do as well.\n\n334\n00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.175\nSo remember that for\n\n335\n00:20:25.175 --> 00:20:29.672\nus it's really not about the most\ndifficult ones that are available.\n\n336\n00:20:29.672 --> 00:20:32.020\nIt's probably the ones we\nare going to use every day,\n\n337\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.015\nor we are going to need to use every day\nto find out information that we need.\n\n338\n00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:39.297\nIt's probably going to be more of\nthe concentration of what we want to\n\n339\n00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:39.927\nfocus in on.\n\n340\n00:20:39.927 --> 00:20:43.723\nBut because we've been using\nthese throughout the episode,\n\n341\n00:20:43.723 --> 00:20:46.490\nlets go back and try a few more times.\n\n342\n00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.210\nGet it into your head on what\nyou're actually expecting to see\n\n343\n00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.850\nwhen you do this.\n\n344\n00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.479\nThe only way to do that is by\nyou running these commands okay,\n\n345\n00:20:53.479 --> 00:20:55.768\nis pretty much the key here all right.\n\n346\n00:20:55.768 --> 00:21:01.000\nSo the user one I'm not so concerned about\nfor what we're actually doing, okay.\n\n347\n00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.080\nThe group ones we've already done this,\nlike I said actually for\n\n348\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.140\nus in the way that we've\nbeen shooting this up.\n\n349\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.460\nWe actually did this right before\nwe did this particular episode\n\n350\n00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:15.420\nwhere we created a particular group as\nwell as added a group member in there.\n\n351\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.580\nWe showed how you can actually\ncreate a security group as well.\n\n352\n00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.450\nSo take a look at those things\nthat you actually do see.\n\n353\n00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.950\nLet's do the same thing, get- MsolGroup.\n\n354\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.710\nAnd I don't have any, yeah that's right,\nI've deleted them out.\n\n355\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.960\nI forgot I actually deleted them out here.\n\n356\n00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.860\nThen I wanted to add a group.\n\n357\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.526\nLet's do that one.\n\n358\n00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:41.920\nHere, wait.\n\n359\n00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:47.762\nSet-MsolGroup, remove, this one\ndoesn't actually have add a group, and\n\n360\n00:21:47.762 --> 00:21:51.200\nthat's because we normally have\nto do something else here.\n\n361\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.100\nAll right, so, let's check out the list\nagain cuz I may have just missed it as\n\n362\n00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.000\nI was going through this.\n\n363\n00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.500\nSo as I look through here on the list,\non the, groups and role management right.\n\n364\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.200\nI see, wait, that might be, that's,\nlet me check out the other one.\n\n365\n00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.030\nBut I just realized what I need to do\nhere is actually something that's,\n\n366\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.020\nto me it's actually a little bit of\na violation against the way that they do\n\n367\n00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.198\nPowerShell commands.\n\n368\n00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:16.140\nRemember it's normally a verb like get,\n\n369\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.090\nlike you're seeing right here on\nthe screen and then what we're doing.\n\n370\n00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.417\nThis one's a little bit unusual in the\nfact that it actually requires the word\n\n371\n00:22:23.417 --> 00:22:27.850\nnew-MsolGroup, okay.\n\n372\n00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.960\nSo for me to create a group, and\nthis one's not in the list but\n\n373\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.032\nwe did cover it in a previous episode,\ntube.\n\n374\n00:22:35.032 --> 00:22:39.820\nThen I can do display name from here.\n\n375\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.508\nWe will call this one production.\n\n376\n00:22:42.508 --> 00:22:47.390\nAnd we'll add in a description here and\n\n377\n00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:56.180\nit's going to say awesome production team.\n\n378\n00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:59.300\nDo that.\n\n379\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.650\nAnd that's pretty much as simple as\ncreating a group for us, and there we go.\n\n380\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.480\nAnd you'll see a security group.\n\n381\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.100\nSo just as easy.\n\n382\n00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.480\nRemember we've already done that as\nwell as other commands inside of that\n\n383\n00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.530\ngroup setting.\n\n384\n00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.820\nSo being able to see some of these.\n\n385\n00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.320\nYou don't have to try\nout every single one.\n\n386\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.720\nDon't think you have to memorize every\nsingle one, but there is a lot more for\n\n387\n00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.530\nus to go, Zach.\n\n388\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:26.170\nSo at this point we've really just hit\nlike user management and groups and\n\n389\n00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.560\nrole management here, but we will\nhit a few more of this down here and\n\n390\n00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.780\nthen we'll talk about some of these\nthat we're really not gonna cover as\n\n391\n00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.210\nmuch in that because we're not gonna hit\nthem during this show In particular.\n\n392\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.100\nBut we will at least cover them and we'll\ntalk about a few of them and what they do.\n\n393\n00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.160\nBut Zack, I realize that we're out of\ntime at this point, so for us to cover\n\n394\n00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.040\nthe rest of this we need a part two\nthat we'll actually have to go to.\n\n395\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.372\n&gt;&gt; And we will give you a part two,\n\n396\n00:23:49.372 --> 00:23:52.610\nbecause we want to find out more about\nAzure active directory commandlets and\n\n397\n00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.990\nwe will find out more about Azure\nactive directory comandlets.\n\n398\n00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:59.457\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of Office 365 with Ronnie.\n\n399\n00:23:59.457 --> 00:24:03.320\nHe is doing a wonderful job and it will\nhelp you when it comes time for that exam.\n\n400\n00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.820\nMake sure you go to the course library.\n\n401\n00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.280\nHundreds of venues there,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n402\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.120\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n403\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.820\nThey'll be really glad you did.\n\n404\n00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.840\nThanks for watching.\n\n405\n00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.680\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n406\n00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.410\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n407\n00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.364\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n408\n00:24:16.364 --> 00:24:22.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n409\n00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.091\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.047\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:11.879\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.040\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for choosing ITPro\nTV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.570\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365,\n\n7\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.380\nand this is Azure Active Directory\ncommandlets, part two.\n\n8\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.870\nThere's a part one see that, too.\n\n9\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.580\nAnd bringing us part two, as well as part\none, is the one and only Ronnie Wong,\n\n10\n00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.860\nRonnie, great to have you here again.\n\n11\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.150\nThanks so very much.\n\n12\n00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.630\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n13\n00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.593\nAs we continue on to take a look at\nsome of these different commandlets that\n\n14\n00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:41.605\nyou're gonna be exposed to.\n\n15\n00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:45.811\nAs you continue to work more and\nmore with Office 365.\n\n16\n00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.977\nPowerShell is definitely the way\nthat the future is heading for\n\n17\n00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:50.690\njust about everything.\n\n18\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.880\nBut also you're gonna see that it's gonna\nbe heavily tested as well for the exam.\n\n19\n00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.020\nSo there is no use in you saying,\nI'm gonna avoid it as long as I can.\n\n20\n00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.380\nIt is here and\nit is the wave of the future for\n\n21\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.540\nevery other Microsoft certification\nthat you're going to be doing.\n\n22\n00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.330\nSo you might as well take\nthis time to at least get\n\n23\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.185\nfamiliar with some of the commands that\nyou're gonna see that are used very often.\n\n24\n00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.212\nAnd then some of the ones that we're\nactually gonna talk about as well are not\n\n25\n00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:16.596\ngonna be used as often too, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:19.555\n&gt;&gt; And not to mention, you save time\nif you're working in PowerShell,\n\n27\n00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:21.920\nbecause it relates right back to the GUI,\nright?\n\n28\n00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does in the background,\n\n29\n00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.480\nremember just about everything that you're\ndoing in most of the interface today\n\n30\n00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.750\nreally does translate into PowerShell\ncommand somewhere down the line and\n\n31\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.960\nessentially runs that for us and\nmakes it much more efficient.\n\n32\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.210\nSo in previous episode, right,\nwe kind of took a look at our categories.\n\n33\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.110\nLet's go back, and we've talked about\nuser management and group management.\n\n34\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620\nNow we're moving into\nservice principle management.\n\n35\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.970\nNow, on this one, we're probably not gonna\ncover as far as just typing in commands.\n\n36\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.530\nAnd the reason why, we don't have\nany of this set up, okay, so,\n\n37\n00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.330\nI was trying to look this up.\n\n38\n00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.120\nAnd I didn't like this definition,\n\n39\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.230\nbut, Service Principal Management\nconfigures service principals.\n\n40\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.860\nGreat, what the heck does that mean?\n\n41\n00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.829\nMost of us, when we think about it,\nright, service and principles,\n\n42\n00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.622\nwhat are we really talking about\nat this particular point in time?\n\n43\n00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:16.808\nWell, it doesn't make sense if we've only\nbeen dealing with users in groups, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:16.808 --> 00:02:19.659\nSo, service principles, in our sense,\n\n45\n00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.629\nin what we're actually going to be\nworking with is gonna be applications\n\n46\n00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.376\nthat are running in\nthe background of Office 365 and\n\n47\n00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:33.434\nAzure that have access to more than\none service that is available, okay.\n\n48\n00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:37.530\nSo you're probably thinking about, yeah,\nno, I don't have a clue when I'd use that.\n\n49\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.770\nThat's exactly right, okay,\n\n50\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.060\nthat's what it comes down to, when in\nthe world are you really gonna use this?\n\n51\n00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.960\nIf you are starting that process of\nautomation, if you are integrating\n\n52\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.960\ncustom applications that were really\ndesigned in PowerShell, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.831\nThat really do control the access to,\nwell, other things, right,\n\n54\n00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.999\nother services that are available,\nand depend on those other services.\n\n55\n00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.352\nThis is the arena that\nyou're talking about, okay.\n\n56\n00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:08.710\nSo for us, even though I've got a list\nof them, and you can see what they are,\n\n57\n00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.180\nit doesn't really help us in our\nsituation that we're facing.\n\n58\n00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:17.900\nTo kinda go, all right,\nwe can use this on our show, or\n\n59\n00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.230\nactually in any real practical\nway in our show, at this point.\n\n60\n00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.000\nBut for those of you that, as you\ncontinue to deep dive into Office 365,\n\n61\n00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.050\nbeyond the certification realm and\nthey start to talk about integration and\n\n62\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.910\nstart to do this with other\ncomponents that are out there,\n\n63\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.960\nyou may actually be running\ncommands like this, okay.\n\n64\n00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.260\nSo the great thing is, notice it's\nstill the same principal, verb and\n\n65\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.970\nthen of course, you have your\nnoun that you have here, okay.\n\n66\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.580\nSo at the very beginning it's\nfairly logical, right, so\n\n67\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.360\nwe can actually set a new one.\n\n68\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.350\nSo this is the only one, and\n\n69\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.140\nI've said this in a previous episode,\nit's not a verb.\n\n70\n00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.770\nNew is not a verb, I don't know how you\ndo this, so somewhere along the line,\n\n71\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.880\nit got dropped in here as\nbeing considered a verb.\n\n72\n00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.290\nI guess the PowerShell guys\nare smarter than I am, and\n\n73\n00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.830\nthey've created a new particular noun\ncalled new, or a new verb called new.\n\n74\n00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.680\nBut you wanna create a new\nservice principle, okay,\n\n75\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.765\nyou just do a new service principal,\nit makes sense.\n\n76\n00:04:14.765 --> 00:04:18.200\nNew-MsolServicePrincipal, creates\na new service principal from that\n\n77\n00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.660\nparticular point, right.\n\n78\n00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.373\nYou would set it up, in other words,\n\n79\n00:04:21.373 --> 00:04:24.593\nyou would actually add in all\nthe details that you normally would do.\n\n80\n00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:30.153\nAnd also enable or disable this service\nhere by using the set command, okay.\n\n81\n00:04:30.153 --> 00:04:33.091\nThe other thing you may also\nset of course is the location.\n\n82\n00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:37.905\nBecause the locative value of something\nmay be important because you may not want\n\n83\n00:04:37.905 --> 00:04:42.246\nthat particular application to reach\nbeyond a location as well, okay.\n\n84\n00:04:42.246 --> 00:04:45.694\nAnd of course, you wanna see what\nthe particular service principals are,\n\n85\n00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:47.841\nyou can run the Get-MsolServicePrincipal.\n\n86\n00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:51.177\nSo if there's any of them,\nZach, it's this one, so\n\n87\n00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:56.009\nlet's do this Get-MsolServicePrincipal,\nif I'm still connected here.\n\n88\n00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.531\nSee if I can type in this password,\n\n89\n00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:04.160\nlet's do the Get-MsolServicePrincipal.\n\n90\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.918\nMake sure I'm doing it right, okay, so\n\n91\n00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:08.421\nlet's see what service\nprincipals are available to me.\n\n92\n00:05:08.421 --> 00:05:11.227\nAnd yes,\nyou see that there's a lot of them, okay.\n\n93\n00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:15.820\nNow, Zach, as I take a look\nat this information, okay,\n\n94\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.798\njust to point out the complexity\nof this stuff, Zach, okay,\n\n95\n00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:24.943\nthis object ID right here\nmeans nothing me, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:30.096\nZach, even the display name here,\nokay, really doesn't mean much to me,\n\n97\n00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:33.510\n[LAUGH] okay,\nwhen I start to take a look at it.\n\n98\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.670\nDo I know that it's actually\nenabled by an account?\n\n99\n00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.735\nYes, okay, so I get that.\n\n100\n00:05:38.735 --> 00:05:42.300\nWhat about Internal_AccessScope?\n\n101\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.110\nThat again still means really not a lot\nto what I am doing at this point.\n\n102\n00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.950\nBut if you do need to control certain\nthings, Microsoft Approval Manager,\n\n103\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.060\nany of this starting to\nmean something to you Zach?\n\n104\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.050\nAnything look like sort of,\nhere's one that's close, Azure Portal.\n\n105\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.940\nThat Azure Portal I can understand,\nthat one I might,\n\n106\n00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.238\ncuz I've actually gone into\nthe Azure Portal for this show.\n\n107\n00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:09.740\nOffice Personal Assistant at Work Service,\nI haven't used it.\n\n108\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.690\n&gt;&gt; I know what that means.\n\n109\n00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.434\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, haven't done it.\n\n110\n00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:14.558\n&gt;&gt; That means the guy in the restroom who\nhands you a towel when you're washing\n\n111\n00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:15.110\nyour hands.\n\n112\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.130\n&gt;&gt; It is very possible\nthat you are seeing this.\n\n113\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.286\nBut, you can actually,\nnow see, there we've actually,\n\n114\n00:06:20.286 --> 00:06:22.630\nno we haven't added\nthe identity protection.\n\n115\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.050\nWe did do the information protection\nhere under Azure information protection.\n\n116\n00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.980\nBut you're starting to see we've\nalso talked about FastTrack a bit.\n\n117\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.650\nWe haven't done any of\nthe Azure Media Services, but\n\n118\n00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.520\nas I scroll up here,\nthese are different applications.\n\n119\n00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.793\nThese are the default ones that\nare available for what we have.\n\n120\n00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:44.725\nLook, I can actually run Cortana,\nokay, with Office 365 and\n\n121\n00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:46.882\nService Encryption, you name it.\n\n122\n00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:51.367\nIf you're not gonna be manipulating these\nthings to set a new one that you've\n\n123\n00:06:51.367 --> 00:06:52.678\nalready got in place,\n\n124\n00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:56.760\nthen more than likely we're probably\nnot gonna be using it too often.\n\n125\n00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.841\nBut if you are, and\nthose are for those of you,\n\n126\n00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.700\nexcuse me, that doesn't even sound right.\n\n127\n00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.730\nThis is for those of you that are gonna\nmove into that application development for\n\n128\n00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.030\nAzure, is what you're\nactually getting into.\n\n129\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.470\nSo, if you're doing that then\nthat's where you actually go.\n\n130\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.840\nOkay, so\nhere is the list in Service Principals.\n\n131\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.970\nMore than likely on the system\nadministration side,\n\n132\n00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.160\nor the tenant administration side,\nOffice 365 Administration side.\n\n133\n00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.500\nIt's probably not gonna do a lot for\nme as far as the meat and\n\n134\n00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.680\npotatoes of getting it up and running.\n\n135\n00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.700\nAll right, so, enough about\nthe different service principles here.\n\n136\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.000\nThere of course you can remove one, and\nyou can even add in new credentials in\n\n137\n00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.100\ncase the service doesn't do what we need,\nokay.\n\n138\n00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.660\nNow here's one I forgot to\nactually put some spacing in, so\n\n139\n00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.580\nit's gonna look a little bit strange.\n\n140\n00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.147\nI tried to space them all out so\n\n141\n00:07:50.147 --> 00:07:53.051\nthat we could see them a little\nbit easier here, okay.\n\n142\n00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:57.202\nAll right, now this is what I\nhad talked about previously,\n\n143\n00:07:57.202 --> 00:07:59.284\nwhere it helps us to confirm.\n\n144\n00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:03.202\nCertain things,\nlike the confirming the domain ownership.\n\n145\n00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:07.280\nWe did this when we actually\ncreated a text file.\n\n146\n00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.600\nWe actually created a text file record,\n\n147\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.310\nI should say,\ninside of our own DNS registrar.\n\n148\n00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.620\nOffice 365 was able to see\nthat particular file and\n\n149\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.420\nrealize that we had actually\ncreated exactly what it asked for.\n\n150\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.380\nAnd the only person that could do that, is\nif you owned that particular domain name.\n\n151\n00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.120\nSo we of course can do some of this here.\n\n152\n00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.887\nLet's go ahead and check out our\nown domain here, get-msoldomain.\n\n153\n00:08:33.887 --> 00:08:36.090\nAnd in a moment you'll notice,\nthere they are.\n\n154\n00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.380\nNotice that there are two different\ndomains for us that we can verify and see.\n\n155\n00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.630\nAnd if I want to confirm, msoldomain,\n\n156\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.328\nand I'd say the domain\n\n157\n00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:57.510\nname itprotvdemo.com.\n\n158\n00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.960\nIt might just be running\njust the domain name.\n\n159\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:07.820\nLet's just do the ITPROTVdemo, doesn't\nexist, so what did I type in wrong?\n\n160\n00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.930\nIt's already used elsewhere,\nthat's why, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.259\nSo there is, I'm like why is\nit saying that it's not there?\n\n162\n00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.690\nIt has removed the verify domain\nname before adding it here.\n\n163\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.250\nSo that's what happened I was like it's\nthere, I know it's actually right there,\n\n164\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.140\nbut apparently it doesn't like it\nwhen I choose to run two of these.\n\n165\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.570\nThere's the verification inside\nof DNS that we can also run.\n\n166\n00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.000\nWe can add in a new one if I\nhad a new one, and remove one.\n\n167\n00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.470\nSo, not exactly the most\ngigantic thing in the world, but\n\n168\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.210\nit does help especially during\nthe setup of Office 365.\n\n169\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:48.380\nIf you chose to try and manage it more\nfrom PowerShell at this point to do so.\n\n170\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.930\nWe can also of course get\nthe password policies and\n\n171\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.945\nwe've seen that setup as well, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:56.017\nAll right, so\nup in that point really there's a few\n\n173\n00:09:56.017 --> 00:09:58.946\nof them that we can talk about and\nbe able to use and\n\n174\n00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:04.050\nsee but at least the service principles\nwill probably not hit that too much.\n\n175\n00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.780\nWhether we're actually in\n70-346 which is this show or\n\n176\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.810\neven in the 70-347 show,\n\n177\n00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.800\nwe don't really tend to get into the\nservice principle side of the management.\n\n178\n00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.900\nThat's probably more for\ncustomizations too.\n\n179\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.400\nNow we will be heading\nin to single sign on,\n\n180\n00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.580\nbut we haven't gone there yet for our\nparticular episode in what we're doing.\n\n181\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.660\nNow I try to separate this out and\n\n182\n00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.420\nthat's what happens which\nI didn't delete out this.\n\n183\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.190\nI wanna put that on to the second page and\nmake it a little bit more spaced.\n\n184\n00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.120\nSo that we can read it\na little bit easier here.\n\n185\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.380\nMove that up to the top,\nmake it where we don't have to squint.\n\n186\n00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.880\nSingle sign on management, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.410\nAs we start to move toward federated\nservices and remember this means\n\n188\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.140\nreally integrating our on-premises Active\nDirectory with Azure Active Directory, but\n\n189\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.990\nI only want a single sign on, right?\n\n190\n00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.966\nOnly one username and\npassword to do this, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:08.472\nWell, I can actually implement this idea,\n\n192\n00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:14.175\ndoing single sign on by converting\nmy domain into an SSO domain, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:14.175 --> 00:11:15.300\nI can do it in a couple of ways.\n\n194\n00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.060\nI can create a brand new one,\nif I wanted to.\n\n195\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.060\nOr I can convert and\nthat's M solDomainToStandard.\n\n196\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.600\nAnd now I can actually go\nback if I had an SSO domain,\n\n197\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.690\nI can convert it back to a standard.\n\n198\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.520\nIf I want to convert a standard\nto a federated one or\n\n199\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.570\nto SSO, I can also do that too.\n\n200\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.550\nNow we will be running some of these\ncommands in a near future episode as we\n\n201\n00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.290\ncontinue through this or if you're\nwatching this as a review instead.\n\n202\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:49.300\nAnd you watch that episode first, you've\nalready seen what we have done there too.\n\n203\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.200\nBeing able, of course, to get the settings\ncorrect from Azure AD all the way to your\n\n204\n00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.980\nfederated services server, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.150\nIt can be challenging the first time\nyou set it up, so I understand,\n\n206\n00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.750\nI've been there before.\n\n207\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.230\nIt takes a little bit of patience,\n\n208\n00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:09.010\nbut this helps you to make sure that you\nget the proper settings that you need to.\n\n209\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.800\nSo that you can also set this up as well,\nokay?\n\n210\n00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.480\nSo we'll be seeing pretty much a lot\nof these commands in those episodes.\n\n211\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.532\n&gt;&gt; So, in your P and SSO management,\nthat is something we would be using, and\n\n212\n00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:19.509\nit's very important.\n\n213\n00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:21.390\n&gt;&gt; Right, as we start to set this up.\n\n214\n00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.850\nIt really Is gonna be up to\nyour organization, right?\n\n215\n00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.720\nHow it's going to be set up.\n\n216\n00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.740\nYour organization may say no,\nlet's just kind of leave it as is and\n\n217\n00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.970\nwe can keep two separate accounts.\n\n218\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.530\nZach, you can actually have when\nyou sign on the office 365,\n\n219\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.480\nyou are using a different\naccount than if you're signed on\n\n220\n00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.020\nto one of my machines inside\nof my on-premises network.\n\n221\n00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.070\nSo we can do that if we chose to.\n\n222\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.240\nWe can even have completely\ndifferent passwords if we wanted to.\n\n223\n00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.240\nTo make sure that we kept those separate.\n\n224\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.280\nOr you can even try and line them up and\nmake sure that they're exactly the same,\n\n225\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.470\nbut they're not connecting.\n\n226\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:59.980\nBut with single sign on here,\n\n227\n00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.440\nwhat we're saying is,\nregardless of where you are in this world.\n\n228\n00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.690\nIf you are sitting at Starbucks, and\nyou've made a connection up to Office 365,\n\n229\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.670\nyou would use the same credentials there,\non your laptop as you would\n\n230\n00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.430\nif you were inside of my own protected\nnetwork, and I would sign in as well.\n\n231\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.240\nThat gives me that single sign on,\n\n232\n00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.610\nfrom regardless of where we are to\nthat same point and location.\n\n233\n00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.120\nIt doesn't seem to matter,\nwhen we start to do this.\n\n234\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.910\nAnd then across all their different\nventures that they have, as well, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.620\nSo we'll actually see some of\nthis as we go on through here.\n\n236\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.380\nWe'll get to this in a future episode,\nespecially the ADFS context here.\n\n237\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.690\nAnd, of course, even the settings\nupdate that we need to as well, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:47.130\nSo we will see the SSO\nassignment in a future episode,\n\n239\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.340\nat least from this point as\nthe shooting of the show, all right?\n\n240\n00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.060\nSubscription and license management.\n\n241\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.340\nNow this is kind of the ones that we need\nto verify at the very beginning again.\n\n242\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.670\nSo if we just kind of take a look at that,\nlet me get to this so\n\n243\n00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.480\nI can type it out without having\nto flip back and forth too much.\n\n244\n00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.583\nClear the screen up here.\n\n245\n00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:10.146\nIf I do a get-msolsubscription,\n\n246\n00:14:10.146 --> 00:14:14.552\nhow could I spell subscription,\n\n247\n00:14:14.552 --> 00:14:19.490\nmsolsubscription press Enter.\n\n248\n00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.770\nYou can see right now that\nthe current user that is signed in\n\n249\n00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.480\nhas the actual enterprising\npack which is the E3 licensing.\n\n250\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.890\nAn this is something else I probably\nshould of emphasized in the show,\n\n251\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:35.180\nbut I probably didn't cuz I think you know\nyou need to be familiar with the products.\n\n252\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.910\nBut remember that there are different\nsubscription levels, right?\n\n253\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.730\nAnd I probably mentioned them,\nbut probably in passing.\n\n254\n00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.490\nMake sure you can distinguish\nthe difference between an E1, E3, and\n\n255\n00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.510\nE5, and business accounts.\n\n256\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.371\nAnd I know that we went\nthrough some of that, but\n\n257\n00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.824\nI didn't really spend a lot of time.\n\n258\n00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:53.200\nBut those are fairly testable,\nas I start thinking about it.\n\n259\n00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.510\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask, so that's\nsomething they might need for the exam.\n\n260\n00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like I said,\n\n261\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.220\nI hate to say this, I kind of\nassumed that you would do that and\n\n262\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.370\nthat's probably a bad thing on my side.\n\n263\n00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.810\nBut as I look at it it's like, I don't\nthink I really talk about that too much.\n\n264\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.699\nSo I just go back and make sure you look\nat those difference subscriptions and\n\n265\n00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:13.212\nyou can differentiate those things too,\nokay?\n\n266\n00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:19.469\nAll right,\nlet's also the idea of the different\n\n267\n00:15:19.469 --> 00:15:25.125\nskews that we have get- msolaccountskew.\n\n268\n00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.645\nAnd now you can see that sent a list for\n\n269\n00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:32.604\nme all the details of my particular\nsubscriptions here, active units,\n\n270\n00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:37.350\nhow many that are actually\nconsumed at this point here, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.250\nThe warning units are usually\nif we are actually expiring or\n\n272\n00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.280\nwe haven't paid something.\n\n273\n00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.760\nThat's what we'll also end up seeing too.\n\n274\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.657\nSo that is another possibility as well.\n\n275\n00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:52.107\nNow they do have one other one\nhere that is kind of unusual\n\n276\n00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:56.848\ncuz I'm not exactly sure what\nthis option does for us here.\n\n277\n00:15:56.848 --> 00:16:00.607\nThe new MsolLicenseOption.\n\n278\n00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:06.480\nAnd the way that I have it described here\nis creates a new license option object.\n\n279\n00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.720\nAs far as I know you only have\nthe license that are available for you.\n\n280\n00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.410\nI don't think you can\ncustomize the license.\n\n281\n00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.410\nSo even though you can run that,\n\n282\n00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.310\nI'm not exactly sure what all the\navailable new options are available there.\n\n283\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.330\nSo this is probably not something\nthat I would use on a regular basis.\n\n284\n00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.463\nI'll probably just pick\nthe ones that I need, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:24.463 --> 00:16:27.810\nOf course you can change\na user's license here.\n\n286\n00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.920\nBut I don't have any other\nlicenses that are available.\n\n287\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.071\nSo here is Set-MsolUserLicense,\nit modifies licenses,\n\n288\n00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:39.720\nwhere we can assign them to a user, remove\nthem, or even upgrade or change them.\n\n289\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.398\nSo you might have a user\nthat has an E1 license and\n\n290\n00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:46.281\nyou want them to be upgraded to an E5.\n\n291\n00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:48.351\nOr you might have somebody that\nhas a small business license and\n\n292\n00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:49.790\nyou're upgrading them.\n\n293\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:53.520\nYou can also use this to help\nyou to do that as well, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.540\nSo on the licensing features,\nthey're all there.\n\n295\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.400\nThey are available for you.\n\n296\n00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.130\nIt can all be done inside\nof PowerShell as well.\n\n297\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.929\nNow, you may wonder,\n\n298\n00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:04.950\nwhy the heck would I do this in\nPowerShell when I can easily uncheck it?\n\n299\n00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.700\nRemember that when you're doing this,\nright?\n\n300\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.520\nYou can do this for\ngroups of people at a time.\n\n301\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.930\nYou can script it out, tell it to\ngo through and actually upgrade or\n\n302\n00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.420\nremove this.\n\n303\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.360\nAnd you can set it up that way.\n\n304\n00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.937\nYou can take those PowerShell commands\nwe learned a little bit earlier in\n\n305\n00:17:19.937 --> 00:17:21.390\nthe users and groups, right?\n\n306\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.320\nAnd say get me all of the user accounts\nthat don't have any licenses and\n\n307\n00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.730\nsubscription to them, and\nyou can delete all those, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.210\nInstead of you having to go them to\nfigure out which one is actually their.\n\n309\n00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.320\nYou can actually run that, and\n\n310\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.990\nrun a couple of commands\ntogether to make that work.\n\n311\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.580\nAnd that's why this is so powerful and\nwhat we have available to us, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.798\nAll right, the great thing is we're\npretty much at the end here in terms of\n\n313\n00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:49.510\na couple of different topics that\nwe have available to us, okay?\n\n314\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.100\nThe next one here on company information\nand service management, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.829\nNow with the company information and\nservice management this\n\n316\n00:17:57.829 --> 00:18:03.250\nis also something else that probably\nwe're not going to be tackling too much.\n\n317\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.123\nIf your organization is set up to\nwhere you have a partner along with\n\n318\n00:18:08.123 --> 00:18:09.259\nyour tenancy.\n\n319\n00:18:09.259 --> 00:18:14.060\nIn other words, if you need for a partner\norganization to access your Office\n\n320\n00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.049\n365 tenancy, this is the information\nthat you would need.\n\n321\n00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:20.902\nMost of us are probably not\ngoing to be setting that up,\n\n322\n00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:23.030\nat least at our level, okay?\n\n323\n00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.410\nBut if you are involved in that,\n\n324\n00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.590\nyou're probably involved in\ncontract negotiations, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.270\nAnd you're setting all that\ninformation up or everything work.\n\n326\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.630\nAnd notice there it is,\nget partner contract, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:43.200\nGet partner information setting it up\nhere, and redo partner provisions here.\n\n328\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.422\nYou're trying to make sure that everything\nis actually gonna work with a third party\n\n329\n00:18:47.422 --> 00:18:49.096\ncoming in to your Office 365.\n\n330\n00:18:49.096 --> 00:18:52.996\nSo this is not something that you\nsee on a regular basis in terms of\n\n331\n00:18:52.996 --> 00:18:55.031\njust immediately setting it up.\n\n332\n00:18:55.031 --> 00:19:00.062\nUnless you are setting this up with\nthe event in mind that a future\n\n333\n00:19:00.062 --> 00:19:06.136\npartner is going to be integrating into\nyour company to get access in, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:06.136 --> 00:19:08.520\nSo if a partner needs\naccess to your tenancy,\n\n335\n00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.680\nthat's where the company information and\nservices management will come in.\n\n336\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.980\nSo there are a few of them,\n\n337\n00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.890\nas you continue to see there's\neven more right there, okay?\n\n338\n00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.813\nSo that one actually has a few that,\nagain,\n\n339\n00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:26.373\nI'm not gonna actually be\ntaking too much with that.\n\n340\n00:19:26.373 --> 00:19:28.946\nNow the last one is a little\nbit more unusual here,\n\n341\n00:19:28.946 --> 00:19:32.330\nwhich is the idea of\nan administrative unit, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.720\nAnd administrative unit management.\n\n343\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.110\nZach, this is a term which kind of\nboggled me when I first encountered it.\n\n344\n00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.832\nI was like, what the heck is\nadministrative unit management?\n\n345\n00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:47.480\nAnd as I thought about that, it was\nactually more puzzling than I thought.\n\n346\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.028\n&gt;&gt; Could it be a manager of a unit?\n\n347\n00:19:49.028 --> 00:19:51.662\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A division manager perhaps.\n\n348\n00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:55.700\n&gt;&gt; Actually you're getting pretty\nclose here when you do that, okay?\n\n349\n00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.798\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of the manager,\n\n350\n00:19:57.798 --> 00:20:01.360\nright, of a unit,\nwhat are we really taking a look at here?\n\n351\n00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.384\nWell, what we can do is,\nin a very large and\n\n352\n00:20:04.384 --> 00:20:08.758\na very complex Active Directory\nnetwork administrative unit\n\n353\n00:20:08.758 --> 00:20:13.903\nmanagement allows us to essentially\ndelegate the control here, okay?\n\n354\n00:20:13.903 --> 00:20:16.310\nIt also allows us to subdivide up for\n\n355\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:20.660\nmanagement purposes our entire\nActive Directory if we need to.\n\n356\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.310\nSo this is really what it's about.\n\n357\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.641\nIt's about subdividing the directory,\ndelegating for\n\n358\n00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:28.939\nadministrative control if we need to.\n\n359\n00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:33.276\nAnd normally we don't set this up\nunless we have an incredibly complex\n\n360\n00:20:33.276 --> 00:20:36.380\nActive Directory configuration.\n\n361\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.410\nFor me,\nI'm running single Active Directory,\n\n362\n00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.170\na single forest with a single domain,\nokay?\n\n363\n00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.450\nSo I'm really not gonna need the idea\nof administrative unit management.\n\n364\n00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.590\nBut those of you that have your forest and\nthen domains and\n\n365\n00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:56.240\nchild domains and stuff like that,\nand you have forest trust?\n\n366\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.953\nThis is the area that you also\nend up seeing as well, okay?\n\n367\n00:21:00.953 --> 00:21:05.734\nAll right, so taking a look at the\ninformation that you see right here, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:05.734 --> 00:21:09.059\nAnd being able to look at them, okay?\n\n369\n00:21:09.059 --> 00:21:11.683\nThe ones that I've kind\nof really emphasized and\n\n370\n00:21:11.683 --> 00:21:15.760\nthat we're doing during our show,\nthose are the ones to be emphasized.\n\n371\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.520\nThe rest is really for\nthe sake of completeness.\n\n372\n00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.172\nI wish I could tell you you don't need to,\ndon't worry about memorizing it.\n\n373\n00:21:22.172 --> 00:21:24.330\nI'm really serious,\nI wouldn't memorize them.\n\n374\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.980\nBut at the same time for me to say\nthat they can't appear on the exam\n\n375\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.140\nwould be overstating what I can overstate,\nokay?\n\n376\n00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.940\nSo I can't sit there and go,\nyou'll never see this, okay?\n\n377\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.720\nI'd be lying to you to say\nthat you're not doing.\n\n378\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.860\nEven if it's not for\n\n379\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.700\na right answer, they could put it in there\nas a possible wrong answer to something.\n\n380\n00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.570\nSo don't think that I'll just ignore this.\n\n381\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.538\nIt's not something that you want to do.\n\n382\n00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:54.701\nIt doesn't mean that you have to spend\na ton of time on it, but at least for\n\n383\n00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:58.688\nthe preparation for the exam,\nunderstanding those units, right?\n\n384\n00:21:58.688 --> 00:22:02.890\nAnd what they're for, and kind of\nbeing able to set that into context.\n\n385\n00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:08.100\nSo Zach, let me kind of, again,\nlet's go into exam mode for a moment.\n\n386\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.670\nSo if I told you, okay?\n\n387\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.470\nThe idea here and\nkind of thinking about this.\n\n388\n00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.380\nAnd the great thing is the name\nreally helps us out here, right?\n\n389\n00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.852\nIf I said, Zach,\nwe've got a complex Active Directory and\n\n390\n00:22:19.852 --> 00:22:24.781\nwe need to be able to hand over\ndelegation to so and so and so and so.\n\n391\n00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:28.435\nAnd you look at different\noptions that are given to you?\n\n392\n00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:31.801\nWell, hopefully it makes sense that\nwhat you would actually look for\n\n393\n00:22:31.801 --> 00:22:34.850\nis what, administrative unit somewhere,\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, absolutely.\n\n394\n00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense, okay?\n\n395\n00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.160\nAnd you take a look at these commands,\nand look up, administrative unit,\n\n396\n00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.420\nadministrative unit,\nadministrative unit, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.270\nNow not all of them.\n\n398\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.173\nSo notice like this one,\nRemove-MsolScopedRoleMember, okay?\n\n399\n00:22:46.173 --> 00:22:47.282\nWell that's a little bit different.\n\n400\n00:22:47.282 --> 00:22:52.497\nBut overall though, there's a lot of\nthem that say AdministrativeUnit.\n\n401\n00:22:52.497 --> 00:22:56.958\nThe same thing inside of this, the company\ninformation and service management.\n\n402\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:23:00.130\nPartner, partner, partner, okay?\n\n403\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.020\nMakes sense when you start\nto look at it that way.\n\n404\n00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.210\nSo taking a look at stuff like this,\nright?\n\n405\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:11.060\nIs really helpful in the long run on\nthe exam because it can help you at\n\n406\n00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.090\nleast weed out information that's\nprobably not going to be relevant and\n\n407\n00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.100\nlead you to the right answer, if nothing\nelse, by the process of elimination.\n\n408\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.660\nBut if you don't know what they are,\nit's not gonna help you at all.\n\n409\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.320\nSo take the time and go through\nwhat you're actually seeing here.\n\n410\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.220\nAnd that will actually help\nyou out as well, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.430\nSo don't think that you have to\nmemorize every single one of these.\n\n412\n00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.880\nBut you do need to at least be\nable to kind of imagine and\n\n413\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.310\nfigure out what do these groups do?\n\n414\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.970\nAnd what are some of the types of\ncommands that are associated here?\n\n415\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.060\nAnd then I can eliminate from\nthat point with questions\n\n416\n00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.850\nthat may come up on the exam.\n\n417\n00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.720\nOr somebody may ask me about that,\nyes it can be done or it can't be done.\n\n418\n00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.010\nSo there we have it.\n\n419\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.080\nAll right Zach, so there's a lot of\ndifferent commands on the right there for\n\n420\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.150\nAzure Active Directory command list.\n\n421\n00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.949\nBut we won't see a ton of them in show as\nfar as the ones that we talked at the very\n\n422\n00:24:04.949 --> 00:24:06.070\nend there.\n\n423\n00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.960\nBut we will actually see the majority\nof these throughout this show,\n\n424\n00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.260\nas well as in Office 365 for 70-347.\n\n425\n00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.275\nWe'll see a lot of more them as well,\nand in much more detail.\n\n426\n00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:20.000\nSo dont' overlook that fact.\n\n427\n00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.040\nJust realize there are a ton of commands,\nand\n\n428\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.808\nyou just have to be familiar with them.\n\n429\n00:24:24.808 --> 00:24:26.590\n&gt;&gt; Comprehensive and\nwell done as always, Ronnie.\n\n430\n00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:27.960\nThank you so very much.\n\n431\n00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.810\nSo, Azure Active Directory Cmdlets Parts\n1 and 2, watch them both.\n\n432\n00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.250\nAnd watch everything in the Office\n365 series, you'll be glad you did.\n\n433\n00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.030\nAnd take a look at the course library,\n\n434\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.870\nhundreds of videos there,\nall designed to help you

00:00:08.255\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.255 --> 00:00:11.728\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:15.611\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV, helping you grow and\n\n6\n00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:17.240\nlearn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.585\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nand this is Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.700\nWe're gonna create security\ngroups with Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.500\nRonnie, great to see you again,\nsir, thanks for joining us.\n\n10\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Zach for\nhaving me on the show,\n\n11\n00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.410\nas we continue on in our\njourney through Office 365.\n\n12\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.710\nAnd we're taking a little bit\nof time here and talking about,\n\n13\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.480\nof course, managing users, and now we're\nactually talking about groups as well.\n\n14\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.590\nThe idea of managing users is\na fairly simple concept, and\n\n15\n00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.130\nwe've done this throughout\nour entire series.\n\n16\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.620\nWe've created user accounts,\n\n17\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.470\nand showed you how you can add\nroles to them as an administrator.\n\n18\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.190\nWe've showed you how you can assign\ndifferent licenses of subscriptions to\n\n19\n00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.720\nthem as well.\n\n20\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.880\nAnd we showed you how to remove them from\nthe Office 365 users that are out there.\n\n21\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.940\nBut at the same time, we actually\nrealized that as we continue to grow,\n\n22\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.810\nand we talk about the idea of scalability,\nright, and the ability to manage that.\n\n23\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.562\nIt becomes a little more difficult\nto manage individual users, so\n\n24\n00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:18.185\nthat is another reason for us to actually\nthink about the idea of a security group.\n\n25\n00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:20.855\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, obvious question,\nwhat is a security group,\n\n26\n00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.115\ncan you define that for us?\n\n27\n00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:25.691\n&gt;&gt; Yes, well, as easy as it is,\nwhen it breaks down to\n\n28\n00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:30.533\neverything that we want to do we can\ndefine it in many different ways.\n\n29\n00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.357\nBut the easiest way to think about it,\nright,\n\n30\n00:01:33.357 --> 00:01:37.940\nis a security group is something that\nwe can say how we control access.\n\n31\n00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.060\nOkay, and\nit allows us to build a control access for\n\n32\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.270\na group of users,\nis what it allows us to do.\n\n33\n00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.652\nSo instead of me having me to\nactually take Zach's user account and\n\n34\n00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:52.018\nCherokee's user account and\nmy user account, and\n\n35\n00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:56.813\nindividually assign them access, or\ndeny them access to what I want to.\n\n36\n00:01:56.813 --> 00:02:00.310\nI can create just a group,\nwhich is a representation,\n\n37\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.990\nokay, of what I might want for them,\nand I just assigned a name to it.\n\n38\n00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.830\nAnd instead, I assign those\naccess permissions to the group.\n\n39\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.870\nIf Zach gets added to that group, well,\n\n40\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.630\nhe automatically gets those\npermissions as well, or the denial.\n\n41\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.080\nAnd the same thing with everybody that's\nadded into the group as well, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.060\nSo, for anything else, right,\nit's about ease of management or\n\n43\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.040\nless administrative effort.\n\n44\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.020\nAnd, Zach, that's a term that, if we\nare not familiar with Microsoft exams,\n\n45\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.440\nthen we need to become more\nfamiliar with Microsoft exams.\n\n46\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.540\nAny time that you see that idea, and\nespecially when you start to read\n\n47\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.350\nmore about the way that Microsoft does\nthings, it's always about scalability.\n\n48\n00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.170\nAnd the idea of scalability here for what\nyou're gonna be doing as an administrator\n\n49\n00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.100\nis that you want to be able\nto do this effectively.\n\n50\n00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.611\nBut you wanna to do it with the least\nadministrative effort possible.\n\n51\n00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.530\nAnd when you start talking about access\ncontrol at points here, whether we're\n\n52\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.330\ntalking about it on-premises, or whether\nwe're talking about it in the cloud.\n\n53\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.589\nSecurity groups or\nactually creating groups is the way that\n\n54\n00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:10.495\nwe actually can control access\nwith less administrative effort.\n\n55\n00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:15.900\nBecause I instead am really dealing with\nthe group, instead of individual users.\n\n56\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.500\nSo if there were ten users that I\nneeded the same access control to,\n\n57\n00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.840\nwell, I can, like I said, individually,\none at a time, go to each account and\n\n58\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.230\ndo that, and provide the rights and access\nI need to, to every individual user.\n\n59\n00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.220\nOr I can create a group,\nput them all into a group, and\n\n60\n00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.230\nassign the access control that I want the\nsame access control that one group, and\n\n61\n00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.560\nthat helps us to be able to see this.\n\n62\n00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.480\nSo it's a big part of what we actually\nwant to understand at the beginning here.\n\n63\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.832\nAnd if you've already been\nworking on Active Directory,\n\n64\n00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:50.050\nyou've been working with\nsecurity groups all along.\n\n65\n00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.216\nBut if you haven't that's kind of\nthe idea that we have in place.\n\n66\n00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.564\n&gt;&gt; So, then, next question, logical,\n\n67\n00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:59.630\nlet's say I'm an admin,\nwho do I assign to these security groups?\n\n68\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.880\nShould there be upfront some groups\nof people I should be thinking about?\n\n69\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.374\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot of times\nwhere you definitely wanna be able\n\n70\n00:04:08.374 --> 00:04:10.382\nto assign people to groups.\n\n71\n00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:14.519\nAnd at the beginning, you wanna start\nthinking about the most logical and\n\n72\n00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.130\nnatural way to assign them.\n\n73\n00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.636\nOf course, our what we call\nrole-based access groups, and\n\n74\n00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:23.295\nthis is where you might say,\neverybody in the dev department.\n\n75\n00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:27.499\nOr, everybody part of the marketing team,\nor everybody part of a sales team,\n\n76\n00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.260\nyou go ahead and because, why?\n\n77\n00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.380\nThose users are gonna probably need the\nsame level of access as everybody else.\n\n78\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.842\nBut that's the most logical assignment\nthat you have, ready and available for\n\n79\n00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:38.781\nus to go, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.390\nSo let's show you how to\nactually create a group, as well.\n\n81\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.420\nAnd so, I'm gonna log in here, so\n\n82\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.660\nI'm actually at the log\nin screen at this point.\n\n83\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.292\nI need to type in this password,\nwhich again, is a little bit long And I\n\n84\n00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:57.630\nalways remember this as I'm typing it in,\nthat it takes a little bit of time here.\n\n85\n00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:04.448\nSee if it gets me in here, okay, now,\n\n86\n00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:08.789\nwhen we start to talk about\ncreating security groups, okay,\n\n87\n00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.310\nwe do also have to kind of remember\none very important fact here.\n\n88\n00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.982\nAbout who can actually\ncreate security groups, and\n\n89\n00:05:16.982 --> 00:05:21.040\neven modify them or\nget rid of them if we need to, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.560\nAnd that comes back to two particular\ntypes of administrator accounts,\n\n91\n00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.020\nand you want to make sure\nthat you know those, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.555\nThose particular accounts are going to be,\none, the global administrator.\n\n93\n00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:36.020\nIn other words, one that's responsible for\nthe entire tenancy there,\n\n94\n00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.620\nthey are the ones that are actually\ngonna be able to do this.\n\n95\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.251\nAnd the second one is gonna be\nthe user management group, so\n\n96\n00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:46.766\nlet's kind of give ourselves a scenario\nhere, Zach for a moment, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:48.984\nSo let's say that here it is Zach,\n\n98\n00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:54.620\nyou are actually the tenant administrator,\nokay, for our organization.\n\n99\n00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.321\nBut, you realize that security groups\nare going to need to be created, but\n\n100\n00:05:58.321 --> 00:06:00.214\nyou are not part of the organization.\n\n101\n00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:02.655\nOkay, you're the one that set it up,\nokay, so\n\n102\n00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:05.980\nthis is what I actually have at\nthe very beginning of our series.\n\n103\n00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.100\nI'm not really a part of the organization,\nbut I did set it up, and\n\n104\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.240\nI realized that security groups\nare gonna be a part of it.\n\n105\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.000\nNow, Zach, would that be good advice for\nyou, who's\n\n106\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.640\nnot actually a part of my organization,\nto create those security groups?\n\n107\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.217\n&gt;&gt; I think I'd probably want to get\nwith the global administrator who\n\n108\n00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:23.914\nI've assigned.\n\n109\n00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:26.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'd want to get with some\nadministrator that you'd assigned.\n\n110\n00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.070\nSo yeah, if you've actually\nassigned a global administrator,\n\n111\n00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.890\nand they're part of the actual group,\nthen yes.\n\n112\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.020\nThey can actually create groups,\nand that's actually the best way.\n\n113\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.470\nSo if you think about it, right, if you're\nactually kind of the one that set it up,\n\n114\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.951\nyou're not a part of the organization.\n\n115\n00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:45.450\nDon't ask the organization, say, what\ngroups do you want me to create, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.220\nBecause remember,\n\n117\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.800\nafter you get it set up, you turn it over\nto them, you're not gonna log back in.\n\n118\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.980\nYou're not gonna get back into\ntheir particular tenancy and\n\n119\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.310\nessentially help them out on that,\nunless they really request your help.\n\n120\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.200\nBut what you want to do is,\nyou want to their global tenant,\n\n121\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.340\ntheir global administrator,\nand have them assign it.\n\n122\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.500\nOr, you actually want another one, let\nme show you what I'm talking about here.\n\n123\n00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.522\nI've just clicked on the admin tile,\nand the other type of user account,\n\n124\n00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:18.548\nor the other type of administrator,\nif I can actually find the user here.\n\n125\n00:07:19.892 --> 00:07:26.051\nSo we'll select this point, let's\njust select Megan at this point here,\n\n126\n00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:30.680\nand then once everything populates,\nI scroll down.\n\n127\n00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.900\nNotice that right now in Megan's account\nhere, no admin access, and I click Edit.\n\n128\n00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.170\nThen I am going to select\ncustomize administrator, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.699\nWe don't want to make everybody\na global administrator.\n\n130\n00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:50.015\nBut if I know that groups are gonna need\nto be created, so Zach, here's a great\n\n131\n00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:54.865\nkind of scenario in terms of something\nthat might be exam like, right?\n\n132\n00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:59.287\nWell which of these following, as you\nactually take a look at these here, right?\n\n133\n00:07:59.287 --> 00:08:02.615\nSo it might not be every single one,\nbut it might be four or five.\n\n134\n00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:07.714\nWhich of these, following administrator\nroles would actually allow users,\n\n135\n00:08:07.714 --> 00:08:13.121\nexcuse me, would allow Meagan, at this\npoint, who we've actually picked here,\n\n136\n00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:17.450\nto be able to create, edit,\nor even delete groups, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.920\nSo this is where you have to know\nwhere each of these administrators\n\n138\n00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.560\nactually are capable of doing, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.950\nNow the reason why I'm pointing this\nout right, is cause we did mention this\n\n140\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:33.050\nprobably toward the early beginnings\nof our entire series together, okay?\n\n141\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.410\nBut when it comes down to it there's two\nthat I mentioned here, okay, the global\n\n142\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.330\nadministrator themselves can create\nthose groups, that's perfectly fine.\n\n143\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.470\nBut what if we didn't want the global\nadministrator to do it either?\n\n144\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.700\nWe'd have to come down here and\n\n145\n00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.140\nwhat we'd select then is the User\nmanagement administrator instead.\n\n146\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.400\nSo the User management\nadministrator is the other role\n\n147\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.950\nthat can also create, edit, or\ndelete security groups, okay?\n\n148\n00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.270\nSo those are the two roles.\n\n149\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.140\nMake sure you kind of understand that.\n\n150\n00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.370\nActually, not kind of understand it,\nmake sure you absolutely understand\n\n151\n00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.430\nthat those are the ones that's gonna\nbe able to create security groups.\n\n152\n00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.760\nFrom that point inside\nof the GUI interface.\n\n153\n00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.420\nNow I'm not gonna worry\nabout saving that change,\n\n154\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.789\nI just wanted to show you where that is.\n\n155\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.110\nSo once you have that and if we\nactually assigned that from that point.\n\n156\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.693\nWe would log off,\nlog back in as Meagan and\n\n157\n00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:30.300\nthen Meagan could actually start\ncreating those security groups.\n\n158\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.650\nSo when we start to do that well,\n\n159\n00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.340\nhow in the world do we start\ncreating all security group stuff?\n\n160\n00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.150\nAt this point that's what we want to do,\nall right,\n\n161\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.830\nlet me get back out to Home here.\n\n162\n00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.580\nAnd then over on the left-hand side,\n\n163\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.960\nI like to always come back\nto this kind of home screen.\n\n164\n00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.890\nOver on the left-hand side,\n\n165\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.780\nin the navigation pane,\nnotice that there's Groups.\n\n166\n00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.630\nAnd when I click on Groups,\nnotice there's, look, Groups again.\n\n167\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:02.568\nAgain, the nomenclature here, not\nexactly the most intuitive of thinking,\n\n168\n00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:04.320\nright, groups groups.\n\n169\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.230\nSo, lets select Groups here.\n\n170\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.378\nAnd I do not have any particular group.\n\n171\n00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:12.410\nNow, its okay that I am doing this even\nthough I am not signed in as Meagan,\n\n172\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.790\nbecause our account that we are using,\nright, is Cherokee.\n\n173\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.410\nAnd she is actually the company or\n\n174\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.250\nthe domain tenet administrator\nof this port, right?\n\n175\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.820\nSo she is the one that we\nactually did create to do this.\n\n176\n00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.510\nSo I can click Add a Group.\n\n177\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.300\nAnd once I select Add a Group, I need\nto select a type of group here, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.730\nSo when we start to take\na look at the type of group,\n\n179\n00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.590\nnow this is where you can\nstart seeing some information.\n\n180\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.820\nAnd notice that there is four different\ngroups that are listed right here, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.320\nThe Office group, Distribution list,\nMail-enabled, Security group, so\n\n182\n00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.280\nwhat is the difference?\n\n183\n00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.840\nThe great thing is you have of\ncourse the information over here on\n\n184\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.540\nthe right-hand side.\n\n185\n00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.000\nSo the Office 365 group, great way for\n\n186\n00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.980\nteams to collaborate by\ngiving them group email and\n\n187\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.010\na shared workspace for conversations,\nfile, and calendar events, right?\n\n188\n00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.360\nSo that works, and\n\n189\n00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.720\nthat's probably the default group\nthat most people will end up doing.\n\n190\n00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.960\nBut make sure you understand what\nit is that you're doing here too.\n\n191\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.500\nNotice that can create\na distribution list,\n\n192\n00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.310\nsends email to all the members in this\ngroup, okay, members on the list.\n\n193\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.790\nYou can even allow outside\npeople in your organization\n\n194\n00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.330\nto be in the distribution list as well.\n\n195\n00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.790\nAnd then of course, mail-enabled security\ngroups can be used to control access to\n\n196\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.330\none drive, SharePoint, as well of send\nmail to all members in that list too.\n\n197\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.640\nAnd the finally, the last one that\nwe talked about which is right here.\n\n198\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.140\nSecurity group, controls access\nto OneDrive and SharePoint and\n\n199\n00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.943\nis used for mobile device management for\nOffice 365.\n\n200\n00:11:52.943 --> 00:11:56.450\nSo if I select security group.\n\n201\n00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.410\nThis is what is actually telling\nme that I'm trying to do.\n\n202\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.750\nRemember, that I described that\na security group is all about what?\n\n203\n00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.040\nAccess control.\n\n204\n00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.610\nSo if I select that,\nthat's what we're seeing.\n\n205\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.270\nIt's not gonna let me highlight that.\n\n206\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.323\nI was hoping it would.\n\n207\n00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:12.660\nSo that's what we're seeing\nwhere it says Access Control.\n\n208\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.700\nSo we can select Security group and\nthen in the name here,\n\n209\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.330\nI'm gonna actually create\nthis as just Marketing.\n\n210\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.771\nAnd then from this point here,\n\n211\n00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:34.692\nlet's just say Controls Access\nto MarketingDocs,\n\n212\n00:12:34.692 --> 00:12:39.770\ninternal and confidential.\n\n213\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.870\nLet's just do that, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.190\nJust has a description.\n\n215\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.510\nDescription, it doesn't seem to be so\nimportant, but the nice thing about\n\n216\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:51.020\nactually including a description\nespecially with the group names.\n\n217\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.250\nIs that instead of you having to try and\nfigure out why this group was created,\n\n218\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.560\nit at least gives you a description\nof why it was created here.\n\n219\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.710\nSo I click Add, and\n\n220\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.960\nnow that the group is ready, it gives\nme the next step that I want to do.\n\n221\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.330\nAdd members and additional owners,\nselect the group,\n\n222\n00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:12.840\nthen click edit next here to\nthe settings that you want to change.\n\n223\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.890\nSo group is now ready.\n\n224\n00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.860\nSo that didn't seem too\ndifficult to be able to do.\n\n225\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.880\nNow, that I have the marketing group,\nthis is where I can go in and\n\n226\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.290\nI can now add an additional members or\nowners.\n\n227\n00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.040\nThe difference between an owner and\na member is fairly simple, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.210\nA member can actually be\na part of the group, but\n\n229\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.150\nthey don't get to change any\npermissions on the group, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.410\nThey don't own the group, so they don't\nactually get to change any permissions.\n\n231\n00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.296\nSo it might be where you can include\nother people, but you can't actually,\n\n232\n00:13:42.296 --> 00:13:46.310\nlike, if Zach and I were both a part\nof the group, as just a member.\n\n233\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.356\nZach can just go,\nI don't want Ronnie in this group, and\n\n234\n00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:51.143\nkick me out of that group, okay?\n\n235\n00:13:51.143 --> 00:13:53.750\nNow you might go,\nis there a way that I can't?\n\n236\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.410\nIn theory,\nif Zach's particular user account,\n\n237\n00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.430\nlet's say that he's also\nthe global administrator.\n\n238\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.254\nYeah, he could do it, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:01.254 --> 00:14:05.700\nBut if he's not, and\nwe're just both a part of this group here,\n\n240\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.890\nand we both have essentially the same\nlevel of access here as being a member,\n\n241\n00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.830\nthen at that point no,\nI can't kick Zach out of the group.\n\n242\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:20.190\nNow, if Zach's an owner, though,\nif Zach is owner of this group and\n\n243\n00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.940\nRonnie is just a member of the group, then\nyes, Zach can say I don't want Ronnie,\n\n244\n00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.200\nyep, and\npretty much kick me out of here to do so.\n\n245\n00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.670\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\ncan you have more than one owner?\n\n246\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay?\n\n247\n00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.000\nSo the way that you can do that, so\nnotice that I actually have owners, right?\n\n248\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.540\nSo it might be at the very beginning\nthat you assign a particular owner.\n\n249\n00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.310\nSo all I have to do is click on Add,\nand then when I do so,\n\n250\n00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.890\nit expands out the list.\n\n251\n00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:49.145\nLet's say that I add in Angie and\nlet's say we add in Meagan.\n\n252\n00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.326\nSince we kind of talked about\nthem being the owner here.\n\n253\n00:14:53.326 --> 00:14:57.290\nSo notice it says you need at least one,\nbut I can check them all if I want to.\n\n254\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.120\n&gt;&gt; They all could owners.\n\n255\n00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.650\n&gt;&gt; So they all could actually be owners.\n\n256\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.900\nSo if I selected Save, then click Close.\n\n257\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.750\nNotice now there's two particular\nowners in the group here, all right?\n\n258\n00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.690\nAnd then I click Close again.\n\n259\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:11.730\nNow you can see the owners.\n\n260\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.910\nIf I add in members at this point,\nI can also add members and\n\n261\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.890\nthen it should load everybody\nelse that we want in here.\n\n262\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:26.872\nLet's now add an Aubrey and\nMorisha and Renee.\n\n263\n00:15:26.872 --> 00:15:29.419\nClick Save.\n\n264\n00:15:31.609 --> 00:15:36.200\nAnd notice it says that the membership was\nupdated and will take effect immediately.\n\n265\n00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.133\nI click Close and there we go, okay?\n\n266\n00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:44.140\nSo now we have the members and\nthen together, underneath this one place,\n\n267\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.280\nI can see all of the owners as\nwell as the members of this group.\n\n268\n00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.879\nAnd now that group then can actually\nbe assigned to different things\n\n269\n00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.661\ninside of Office 365.\n\n270\n00:15:54.661 --> 00:15:58.533\nYou might be thinking like, when would I\never use this particular security group?\n\n271\n00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:02.209\nWell, you can use it for email,\nYou can use it for your OneDrive.\n\n272\n00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:03.952\nYou can use it for SharePoint.\n\n273\n00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:07.880\nYou can actually control access depending\non the way that you have this done.\n\n274\n00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.980\nWe're not really getting\ninto that side of things.\n\n275\n00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.900\nWe're just really setting up\nthe basics of Office 365 and\n\n276\n00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.840\nthe requirements to make\nsure it's getting done.\n\n277\n00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.254\nTo enable the services and do all that,\nmake sure you check the 70-347 show.\n\n278\n00:16:20.254 --> 00:16:25.030\nI wanna show you how you actually kind of\nget all that set up to do this as well.\n\n279\n00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.780\nDon't forget that as the owner,\ntoo, you can delete the group, or\n\n280\n00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.660\nas a global administrator, or\n\n281\n00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.410\nas a user management administrator you\ncan also delete the group as well.\n\n282\n00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.350\nAssign an icon if you want to,\nyou can change all that as well.\n\n283\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:47.079\nSo not exactly the most difficult thing\nto do inside of the GUI interface here.\n\n284\n00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:52.680\nSo Zach, that's pretty much the easiest\npart of us creating a group here.\n\n285\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.780\nAnd managing it right here is just as\nsimple as what we showed you over here on\n\n286\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.190\nthe left-hand side.\n\n287\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.860\nYou take the navigation pane,\nyou go down to groups, groups,\n\n288\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.490\nand then you saw how\neasy it was to set up.\n\n289\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.740\n&gt;&gt; So\nis it also easy to just delete a group.\n\n290\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.560\nLet's say you wanted to\njust delete higher groups.\n\n291\n00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.300\nIs that easy as well?\n\n292\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes it sure is.\n\n293\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.410\nIt's just as easy as selecting this.\n\n294\n00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.519\nSo I just put a check mark and\nthen selecting where it says delete group,\n\n295\n00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:20.340\nand if I delete the group out there, says\nhey are you sure you want to delete it?\n\n296\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.649\nAnd if there's any requirements,\nin other words,\n\n297\n00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:26.178\nif there's something that is preventing\nus from deleting, it should tell us.\n\n298\n00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:30.643\nIt should say hey you can't delete\nthis particular group, it's in use or\n\n299\n00:17:30.643 --> 00:17:34.387\nmay even give us that warning like,\nif you delete this group,\n\n300\n00:17:34.387 --> 00:17:37.915\nmake sure that you realize that\nother places that the group\n\n301\n00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:41.550\nis actually still assigned is\nnot gonna be good for them.\n\n302\n00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.483\nSo you have to worry about what we\ncall dependencies at that point.\n\n303\n00:17:44.483 --> 00:17:48.000\nSo for\nexample if I had this on a OneDrive, so\n\n304\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.120\nlet's say that Zach again is in charge\nof the marketing folder in OneDrive.\n\n305\n00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.410\nAnd we have assigned this as\nthe security group to him.\n\n306\n00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.810\nBut Zach says I don't want anybody to\nhave access to it, but he goes ahead and\n\n307\n00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:02.704\nhe deletes the group.\n\n308\n00:18:02.704 --> 00:18:06.751\nWell in theory that should actually\nwork out fine, except now even on Zach's\n\n309\n00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:10.237\nfolder, even though nobody is\nactually gonna be able to get access\n\n310\n00:18:10.237 --> 00:18:14.468\nto it because that group is deleted,\nthat group still exists on Zach's folder,\n\n311\n00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:17.361\nwhich could cause some problems\na little bit later on.\n\n312\n00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:21.566\nSo you just never know exactly what ends\nup happening at times with all that stuff\n\n313\n00:18:21.566 --> 00:18:23.580\nthat's actually in between.\n\n314\n00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.760\nThough it should tell you like\nif there's a dependency here.\n\n315\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.010\nLike if you do this, so and so\nis going to lose access to this.\n\n316\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.310\nAnd all of the sudden they have a so\nand so\n\n317\n00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.190\nwho's your boss that's\ngonna lose access to it,\n\n318\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.770\nit may not be the best thing for\nZach to do.\n\n319\n00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.195\n&gt;&gt; So\nup till now we've been working in the GUI.\n\n320\n00:18:37.195 --> 00:18:40.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; What about doing this in PowerShell?\n\n321\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.790\nI know that could be important.\n\n322\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.260\n&gt;&gt; It can be important, and\n\n323\n00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.650\nit's something that you definitely want to\nmake sure that you can also do as well.\n\n324\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.880\nSo let's shut down on\nthe GUI interface right now.\n\n325\n00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.540\nI just minimized it and\nparked it on the bar here.\n\n326\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.730\nAnd because I knew we were going\ninto power shell I went ahead and\n\n327\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:03.730\nconnected into Office 365\nhere through PowerShell.\n\n328\n00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.763\nI made my variable again by\ndoing the credential variable,\n\n329\n00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:14.009\nadded in my credentials when it\ngave me the dialog box to do so.\n\n330\n00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:19.026\nConnected into the MSLL service, such as\nAzure Active Directory in the background\n\n331\n00:19:19.026 --> 00:19:24.340\nand of course Office 365's overall\ninfrastructure's that there.\n\n332\n00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.570\nGave it the credentials, and\nnow I am connected in Office 365 and\n\n333\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.170\nready to add in a security\ngroup even through PowerShell.\n\n334\n00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:39.038\nSo for us to be able to do this,\n\n335\n00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:45.172\nwe would need to do a new-MSOL group.\n\n336\n00:19:45.172 --> 00:19:48.860\nMake sure I am telling you right,\nI gotta be able to type in stuff.\n\n337\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.860\nSo new MSOL Group.\n\n338\n00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.740\nMicrosoft Online Group is what we have.\n\n339\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.670\nThe option that we also want is\ngoing to be the display name.\n\n340\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.030\nSo, how do I want it displayed?\n\n341\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.770\nRemember, I called this marketing\nthrough the GUI interface, but\n\n342\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.570\nhere on the display name, this time\nI'm going to choose DevTeam instead.\n\n343\n00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.660\nI'm going to put that in parenthesis, and\n\n344\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.930\nnow I'm going to add in\na description like I did before.\n\n345\n00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:20.085\nAnd this is gonna\n\n346\n00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:25.977\nbe the ITProTV demo\n\n347\n00:20:25.977 --> 00:20:32.250\ndevelopment team.\n\n348\n00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.310\nLet's just add that in there.\n\n349\n00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.620\nSo I didn't have to do the description,\nbut adding this in, like I said,\n\n350\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.130\njust makes me feel better as well.\n\n351\n00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.700\nPress enter, and in a moment notice\nI have now created the DevTeam here.\n\n352\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.770\nNow I always like to verify using\nthe GUI because I just like to do that.\n\n353\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:54.810\nSo at this point if I refresh this,\nsee if I can refresh that.\n\n354\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:01.170\nIn a moment notice it changed and\nthere it is.\n\n355\n00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.060\nDev Team and it is a security group.\n\n356\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.980\nI didn't even have to put\nin security group, right?\n\n357\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.790\nSo unlike inside the GUI\nwhere I had to select,\n\n358\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.460\nit assumed at this point that I was\ncreating a security group, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.860\nAnd you could see that right\nhere on the security type.\n\n360\n00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.450\nIf I scroll over to the right hand side\n\n361\n00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.210\nthere's also the description\nthat I created right here.\n\n362\n00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.060\nSo creating the group is\nnot exactly difficult, but\n\n363\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.050\nthat's not all that I need to do.\n\n364\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:32.730\nCreating a security group, one of\nthe things that we can verify once again,\n\n365\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.800\nthat I selected, is notice I don't\nhave any members in that group.\n\n366\n00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.720\nOr owners, or whatever it might be.\n\n367\n00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.380\nSo I now need to add in\nsomething into that group,\n\n368\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.330\nor a user account into that group,\nas well.\n\n369\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.250\nSo before I do that, let's go ahead and\n\n370\n00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.686\nget a list of people that we also\nwant to be able to do as well.\n\n371\n00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:56.426\nAll right, so let me clear the screen\nright now and reset that up to the top\n\n372\n00:21:56.426 --> 00:22:01.270\nhere so that you can actually see\nit without me having to go too far.\n\n373\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:08.580\nFirst thing I want to do is I want to go\nahead and try and get some information.\n\n374\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:14.142\nSo I'm going to set up a variable first,\nand we're going to call this one DevTeam=\n\n375\n00:22:14.142 --> 00:22:21.270\nand then we are going to tell\nit to get the MSOL group and\n\n376\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.460\nthe group type is gonna be secured.\n\n377\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.810\nI'm also gonna type that\ninto a ware dash object.\n\n378\n00:22:37.354 --> 00:22:38.767\nI think I am.\n\n379\n00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:40.210\nWe'll see right here in a moment.\n\n380\n00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.110\nI always get a little bit worried when\nit doesn't actually fill out the rest\n\n381\n00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.070\nof it for me.\n\n382\n00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.500\nSo I may actually have done\nthat a little bit wrong there.\n\n383\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.330\nBut we'll see here in a moment.\n\n384\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.771\nDisplay name, if I can spell display.\n\n385\n00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.190\nMake sure I'm actually typing\nin the right command here, yep.\n\n386\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.661\nAnd then eq for equal DevTeam.\n\n387\n00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.568\nWhoops.\n\n388\n00:23:14.592 --> 00:23:16.725\nSo, either's it's gonna\nspew red out at me or\n\n389\n00:23:16.725 --> 00:23:19.430\nit's actually gonna let me do this here.\n\n390\n00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.050\nThat's not gonna work because I\ndidn't close the parenthesis there.\n\n391\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.210\nSo let me do a control here and\ndo it out of that for a moment.\n\n392\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.350\nAll right.\n\n393\n00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:32.540\nSo I forgot that at some point here, oops.\n\n394\n00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.930\nLet me see if I can find the,\nwhat was I typing in?\n\n395\n00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.290\nThat, okay.\n\n396\n00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:39.460\nWell let's try this one more time.\n\n397\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.900\nWas not gonna let me do that, was it?\n\n398\n00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.470\nAll right.\n\n399\n00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.870\nWell let's do this one more time.\n\n400\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.570\nI forgot to actually close out\nof the curly brackets over here.\n\n401\n00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.985\nSo I need to retype this one.\n\n402\n00:23:52.985 --> 00:24:00.163\nDev-Team equals get-msolgroup,\nand then -grouptype.\n\n403\n00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:03.523\nSecurity.\n\n404\n00:24:03.523 --> 00:24:07.898\nAnd I forgot the other half of\nthat of that quote anyways.\n\n405\n00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:14.980\nWhere object,\nthat's what I was looking for.\n\n406\n00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.024\nI'm like, it's not actually\nturning the color I expected to.\n\n407\n00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:20.992\nThere is the $_.\n\n408\n00:24:23.561 --> 00:24:24.615\nDisplay name.\n\n409\n00:24:29.222 --> 00:24:34.093\nEQ DevTeam.\n\n410\n00:24:34.093 --> 00:24:38.209\nAnd then close out with the little\ncurly braces or fancy brackets.\n\n411\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.702\nAll right, so if I've actually typed\nit in correct this time [LAUGH],\n\n412\n00:24:43.702 --> 00:24:46.480\npress Enter, it should say, all right.\n\n413\n00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.370\nSo now I've created a second variable\nhere that we also want to have.\n\n414\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:25:00.270\nNow, I'm gonna do a get-msolgroup Member.\n\n415\n00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:05.152\nSo I'm seeing that, I'm actually trying to\nsee inside of this particular group here,\n\n416\n00:25:05.152 --> 00:25:05.777\nokay?\n\n417\n00:25:05.777 --> 00:25:07.710\nWho's actually in the group?\n\n418\n00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.629\nAnd I'll probably actually\nfind out something,\n\n419\n00:25:09.629 --> 00:25:12.470\nthat nothing is inside this group,\nor at least that's what I'm hoping.\n\n420\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.026\nWhat I'm looking for is object ID.\n\n421\n00:25:18.612 --> 00:25:20.964\nAll right, so\nwithout it actually returning anything,\n\n422\n00:25:20.964 --> 00:25:24.830\nit's telling me that this particular one\nis actually empty at this point, okay?\n\n423\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.850\nSo now let's go ahead and add in a member.\n\n424\n00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.540\nNow to do this, I'm just gonna create\nanother variable cuz it actually makes it\n\n425\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.870\neasier in the long run for me.\n\n426\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:38.740\nAnd I say get -msol user.\n\n427\n00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:42.990\nThen I'm gonna do a dash\nuser principal name.\n\n428\n00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:47.017\nNow on this one, let's do,\nlet's add in Zach,\n\n429\n00:25:47.017 --> 00:25:51.252\ncuz I can remember his\ne-mail address on this one.\n\n430\n00:25:56.195 --> 00:25:59.810\nSo I've created a variable with\nZach's name in it at this point.\n\n431\n00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:05.687\nThen we're gonna do\nan add msolgroupmember.\n\n432\n00:26:08.178 --> 00:26:13.017\nGroupobjectid here, is going to be\n\n433\n00:26:13.017 --> 00:26:18.190\nhere is gonna be devTeam.objectid.\n\n434\n00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:28.035\nGroup member type is\ngoing to be a user here.\n\n435\n00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:33.245\nAnd then group Member object ID.\n\n436\n00:26:33.245 --> 00:26:39.120\nThen I'm going to tell it to\nactually retrieve number.object ID.\n\n437\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.470\nMake sure I don't have any fancy\nbrackets or anything there.\n\n438\n00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.300\nSo now that should have\nactually added Zach in, okay?\n\n439\n00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.223\nSo, I can verify it by\ngoing to the actual GUI,\n\n440\n00:26:53.223 --> 00:26:57.407\nbut I can also get-msolgroupmember.\n\n441\n00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:06.402\nAnd then, do the groupObjectID.\n\n442\n00:27:06.402 --> 00:27:13.219\nAnd let's look in the same thing,\nDev-team.objectId.\n\n443\n00:27:13.219 --> 00:27:18.030\nAnd now, you can see we've essentially\nadded Zach right back in there, okay?\n\n444\n00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.740\nSo now we've added Zach in as a member,\nokay?\n\n445\n00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.870\nSo, it does take a little bit of time.\n\n446\n00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.580\nNow, did I have to do all of\nthese different variables?\n\n447\n00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.810\nNot necessarily, but\n\n448\n00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.830\nlook at all of the stuff I would have\nhad to type in its place if I didn't.\n\n449\n00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.800\nAny place that you see all of\nthe green dollar signs over here that\n\n450\n00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.410\nI would have had to actually add in.\n\n451\n00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:43.360\nI would have actually to have actually\ntyped in all of this information to do so.\n\n452\n00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.710\nSo instead,\n\n453\n00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.930\nusing those variables is really\nhelpful when you get it patterned out.\n\n454\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.830\n&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.\n\n455\n00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:56.500\nSo Ronnie, wouldn't you save time\ndoing this initially in PowerShell,\n\n456\n00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.020\nbecause then it would\ntranslate back to the GUI?\n\n457\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:00.590\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n458\n00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:04.958\nOkay, so that the whole goal here, right,\neven though we're only showing you one,\n\n459\n00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:06.413\nis that if you do it one time,\n\n460\n00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:09.706\nright, it will actually go ahead and\ncreate all of this for you.\n\n461\n00:28:09.706 --> 00:28:13.308\nAnd then all you having to do is really,\nwhen you add in the new member,\n\n462\n00:28:13.308 --> 00:28:16.908\nis just add that one line in there,\nevery time you add a new member, and\n\n463\n00:28:16.908 --> 00:28:18.910\nyou don't have to do that again.\n\n464\n00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:22.370\nYou can even script it out to make\nit much easier where it tells you,\n\n465\n00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:26.370\nlike when it comes down to this, where you\nsay get the group member when you create\n\n466\n00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:30.060\na variable to do so,\nyou type it in just like I showed you when\n\n467\n00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.500\nwe actually did the credentials anyways,\nokay?\n\n468\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.560\nSo it can actually work very well for you.\n\n469\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.230\nNow, the other thing that we did\ninside of the GUI interface, right,\n\n470\n00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:44.390\nis not only did we create the group,\nnot only that we add members to it, okay?\n\n471\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:49.540\nWe also removed a particular\ngroup as well, okay?\n\n472\n00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.490\nSo for us, let's remove this one.\n\n473\n00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.480\nRemove msolgroup.\n\n474\n00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.160\nAnd this time it's object.\n\n475\n00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.785\nLet's do object id.\n\n476\n00:29:03.813 --> 00:29:06.424\nDefteam.objectid.\n\n477\n00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:11.120\nAnd now, notice that it says,\nhey are you sure you want to do this?\n\n478\n00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.350\nY is the default which means I\ndidn't have to type in a Y at all.\n\n479\n00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.910\nSo at that point here,\n\n480\n00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.510\nif everything is actually done,\nI should also be able to verify.\n\n481\n00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.302\nGet-msolgroup.\n\n482\n00:29:23.302 --> 00:29:27.590\nGroup member\n\n483\n00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:33.439\ngroup object ID.\n\n484\n00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:36.482\nOnce again calling upon the variable.\n\n485\n00:29:36.482 --> 00:29:40.660\nDev team object id.\n\n486\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.680\nOkay, notice even though it's actually\nan error, but look at what it says.\n\n487\n00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.500\nBecause I deleted it out,\nthis is what I'm looking for.\n\n488\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.270\nThis group does not exist, okay?\n\n489\n00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:55.650\nSo, that actually shows me that I was\nable to successfully delete this out.\n\n490\n00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.362\nSo even though we normally don't\nlike seeing red on the screen,\n\n491\n00:29:59.362 --> 00:30:02.866\nif I wanted to verify that it\ndidn't exist, I could do this or\n\n492\n00:30:02.866 --> 00:30:07.082\nI could simply go back to my GUI\ninterface here and refresh one more time.\n\n493\n00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:15.719\nAnd in a moment, notice no group\nname actually appears anymore, and\n\n494\n00:30:15.719 --> 00:30:17.230\nthere we have it.\n\n495\n00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.360\nSo being able to create\nthe simple security groups\n\n496\n00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.300\nare really going to be helpful, and it's\ngoing to actually lead us to especially in\n\n497\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.270\nsome of those different commands,\n\n498\n00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.440\nyou're going to see that they're going to\nbecome more effective as you actually use\n\n499\n00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.630\nthem more often when multiple\ngroups do end up having to appear.\n\n500\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:34.570\nBecause that's what's going to happen.\n\n501\n00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.330\nYour organization is essentially\ngonna break down into\n\n502\n00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.930\ndifferent groups that you're gonna\nneed to manage access control to.\n\n503\n00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.510\nAnd here we've shown you in\nOffice 365 how to do that,\n\n504\n00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.960\nnot only in the GUI but\nalso in the PowerShell as well.\n\n505\n00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.170\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, great job as usual.\n\n506\n00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.260\nCreating security groups.\n\n507\n00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.410\nCouldn't be easier when\nRonnie is teaching, right?\n\n508\n00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.680\nAnd there's a whole bunch of videos\ninside of the Office 365 series.\n\n509\n00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.766\nMake sure you watch them all.\n\n510\n00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:00.050\nAlso go to our course library.\n\n511\n00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.935\nHundreds of videos, all designed to\ndo one thing, help you go further.\n\n512\n00:31:03.935 --> 00:31:05.780\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n513\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.140\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n514\n00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.860\nThanks for watching.\n\n515\n00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.730\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n516\n00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.460\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n517\n00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.126\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n518\n00:31:11.126 --> 00:31:17.275\n[MUSIC]\n\n519\n00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:19.130\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching IT Pro Tv.\n\n",

00:00:08.031\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:11.695\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:13.861\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.577\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:19.046\nI'm your host Zach Memos as\nwe continue with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:24.373\nWe're gonna prepare AD synchronization\nto Office 365 today, and the person\n\n9\n00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:29.490\nhelping us do that, of course, is\nthe one and only IT wizard, Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.600\nRonnie, glad to have you here.\n\n11\n00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.555\nThank you so very much.\n\n12\n00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:35.848\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on our journey\n\n13\n00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:39.350\ntogether in learning more\nabout setting up Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220\nAnd this is where it starts to jump a\nlittle bit more into some technical issues\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.818\nthat we may not have considered.\n\n16\n00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:48.776\nSo up into this point in the series,\nif you've been watching from the very\n\n17\n00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:50.793\nbeginning in the way that\nwe've been doing this.\n\n18\n00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:55.511\nWe really haven't talked about\nthe idea that you may already have\n\n19\n00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:59.381\nan on-premises Active Directory network,\nright?\n\n20\n00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:03.191\nSo you've got your infrastructure already\nset up, you've got your group policies.\n\n21\n00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:07.285\nYou've got everything set up there and\nit works the way that you want to, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:11.894\nAnd now you're introducing a cloud\nenvironment into that situation,\n\n23\n00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:16.906\nwell what is going to happen when we\nactually start to do something like that?\n\n24\n00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:20.580\nWell, there's a couple of things\nthat can end up happening here.\n\n25\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.290\nAnd usually the kind of\nbeginning aspect of this, right?\n\n26\n00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.779\nIs that we go, they'll just have to\nuse an Office 365 login as well as,\n\n27\n00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:33.012\nof course, an Active Directory login\nwhen they're here on our network.\n\n28\n00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:37.950\nWhen they need Office 365, they'll also\nneed to do something like that as well.\n\n29\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.890\nBut when you start to now move into\nthe direction and realm of saying,\n\n30\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.850\nwe want to kinda merge all\nof that together as one.\n\n31\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.730\nThere may be this idea that\nwhat we want to do instead\n\n32\n00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.620\nis to talk about the idea of synchronizing\nboth of our on-premises along\n\n33\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.710\nwith Azure's Active Directory as well and\nOffice 365 all together.\n\n34\n00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.631\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, why go through all\nthat effort of synchronization?\n\n35\n00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:08.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, hopefully it makes sense here,\nbut sometimes it doesn't, right?\n\n36\n00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.976\nSo it's not about really some magic\nvoodoo that happens in the background.\n\n37\n00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:17.808\nIt is about trying to really provide as\nseamless of an experience as possible,\n\n38\n00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:18.690\nright?\n\n39\n00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.518\nFor things like email, in the beginning\nhere, and then even managing, of course,\n\n40\n00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.243\nOffice products that you\nhave along with that.\n\n41\n00:02:26.243 --> 00:02:29.720\nSo your Active Directory organization,\nas well as your Exchange,\n\n42\n00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.679\nwe want that to be a seamless process.\n\n43\n00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.201\nWhere people don't really know whether\ntheir e-mail is going to be running\n\n44\n00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:41.220\nthrough an Exchange on-premises, or\neven in the cloud out there somewhere.\n\n45\n00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.990\nThe synchronization allows us\nthe first steps in setting that up\n\n46\n00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.930\nto ensure that something like\nthis also happens as well.\n\n47\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.594\nIt also allows us to reuse, essentially,\n\n48\n00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:53.629\nthe infrastructure that\nwe've already setup.\n\n49\n00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.501\nSuch as our groups and our contacts\nthat have been created on-premises\n\n50\n00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.760\nto actually also get\nadded into Office 365.\n\n51\n00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.453\nSo I don't have to go and do and go,\nall right, I've got 400 users inside of\n\n52\n00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:10.669\nmy Active Directory network, or\n4,000 for all you care, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.790\nBut we've already talked\nabout adding in bulk users.\n\n54\n00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.060\nYes, we can do that and we know how\nto do that, but I don't have to.\n\n55\n00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.420\nIf I can use the synchronization\ntools that are available to me,\n\n56\n00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.960\nI can go ahead and\nget those accounts setup in Office 365.\n\n57\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.993\nBut it's not a complete turnkey solution.\n\n58\n00:03:28.993 --> 00:03:31.872\nEven if you do something like that,\nyou still have to go in and\n\n59\n00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:33.740\nassign licenses a little bit later on.\n\n60\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.630\nBut just kind of realize that\nthat will also do that, too.\n\n61\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.090\nNow the other thing that's also\nan advantage of this is, because it is\n\n62\n00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.700\na synchronization tool, whatever we modify\non-premises, in terms of objects and\n\n63\n00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.350\ngroups, can also, again, accept and have\nthose modifications in Office 365 as well.\n\n64\n00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.131\nSo let me go ahead and show you kinda the\nexamples of what I've just been talking\n\n65\n00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:02.067\nabout, and then we'll move into what we\nalso have to think about as well, okay?\n\n66\n00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:09.110\nSo here on my screen, this is kind of\nthe idea right at the beginning right?\n\n67\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.490\nSo currently, let's say that we\nare over here on the left-hand side.\n\n68\n00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.700\nHere is our ITPro.TV demo network.\n\n69\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.909\nAnd that means that when\na user signs on here, right?\n\n70\n00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:20.861\nWhen they sign on,\n\n71\n00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.027\nthey're actually signing on and they're\nhitting some domain control over here.\n\n72\n00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:28.310\nWhich is gonna be the source\nof authority at this point.\n\n73\n00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.803\nAnd so when they actually sign on,\n\n74\n00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:32.225\nthey check against that\nparticular directory server.\n\n75\n00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:36.051\nThe directory server says, yes,\nI've got credentials for you and yes,\n\n76\n00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:38.037\nyou've presented valid a username.\n\n77\n00:04:38.037 --> 00:04:40.516\nThen you can get access in,\nand password, of course.\n\n78\n00:04:40.516 --> 00:04:43.790\nYou can get access into this and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n79\n00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.750\nBut it doesn't give us any control or\n\n80\n00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.490\naccess over here on the right-hand side,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.390\nNow, over here on the right-hand\nside though, this is gonna be\n\n82\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.220\nour Office 365 that we've actually\ncreate in terms of our tenancy instead.\n\n83\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.280\nSo currently, without synchronization,\nwe would actually present another sign on.\n\n84\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.930\nSo even for an individual user right here,\nit essentially ends up with two\n\n85\n00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.670\ndifferent accounts, and identities and\neverything else that you have.\n\n86\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.860\nSo over here,\nhe would also have his own account,\n\n87\n00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.991\nhe would have his own email and\nOffice 365 unit.\n\n88\n00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.440\nBut he also presents his own credentials\nagainst another authority inside of\n\n89\n00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.362\nAzure Active Directory, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:30.520\nSo at that point that's\nessentially what goes on.\n\n91\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.792\nNow, can you run it like that?\n\n92\n00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:35.120\nSure, you can actually do that.\n\n93\n00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.253\nNow, is that the easiest way?\n\n94\n00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:42.412\nIt's easier, don't get me wrong,\nit's easier for you and me,\n\n95\n00:05:42.412 --> 00:05:45.370\nadministratively, to just tell the engine.\n\n96\n00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.700\nSo Zach, you're just gonna keep\ntrack of two accounts, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.980\nThat's all Zach has to do,\nis keep track of two accounts.\n\n98\n00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.930\nI go, anybody can do that, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.690\nNow I go to Zach, and Zach might say,\n\n100\n00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.530\nwhat do you mean I have to\nkeep track of two accounts?\n\n101\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.431\nNow we're a little bit more\nin that fuzzy area, right?\n\n102\n00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:06.268\nSo in that sense, it may be a little\nbit harder on the end user to do\n\n103\n00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:10.920\nsomething like this, but it can be done,\nif you just want to do that.\n\n104\n00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.680\nBut the problem is,\nwhen Zach has an issue.\n\n105\n00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.954\nLet's say Zach says, Ronnie,\nI forgot the password.\n\n106\n00:06:18.954 --> 00:06:21.766\nWell, what did he forget the password to?\n\n107\n00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.583\nYou know, my password.\n\n108\n00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.856\nWell, which account are you talking about?\n\n109\n00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.630\nThe one where I check email.\n\n110\n00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.123\nWell, which one is that,\nwhich account are you using?\n\n111\n00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:33.480\nI don't know, it was one of them.\n\n112\n00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.970\nWell now we're starting to have issues,\nokay?\n\n113\n00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.347\nSo that's where it seems like\nit's logical that we can do this.\n\n114\n00:06:40.347 --> 00:06:43.440\nAnd you can pretty much name\nthem identically if you want to.\n\n115\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.650\nBut at the same time,\nthis is where it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n116\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.534\nWhat if I did that, what if I was\nsmart enough to say, all right,\n\n117\n00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:53.504\nZach's account is the same\nexact over here as up here?\n\n118\n00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:57.240\nSo now the Office 365 username and\n\n119\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.650\npassword exactly the same as the one that\nhe has over here on his on-premises,\n\n120\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.140\nwhen he signs in to work on his\nworkstation and he happily works away.\n\n121\n00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.380\nWell, so let's say I change it over here,\nand I forgot to change it over here.\n\n122\n00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.460\nNow Zach comes into work, he sits\ndown at his workstation, and he still\n\n123\n00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.230\ncan't sign in, even though I changed\nit over here on the right-hand side.\n\n124\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.440\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm a dinny [LAUGH].\n\n125\n00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay,\nwell that's one way to look at it.\n\n126\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.730\nNo, what I'm saying is, you can see where\nthe administrative effort gets a little\n\n127\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.900\nbit more challenging when you start\nto think about it in that way, right?\n\n128\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.220\nSo can it be done?\n\n129\n00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.560\nYeah, you kind of squint at it, and you\nkind of go, I'm bracing myself for this.\n\n130\n00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.260\nNow, just with Zach's account,\nthat's enough to be a challenge for me,\n\n131\n00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.506\none because it's Zach.\n\n132\n00:07:48.506 --> 00:07:51.011\nI'm joking,\nI don't mean to pick on Zach in any way.\n\n133\n00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:55.037\nBut yeah, one because it might be Zach,\nbut no, that's not really true.\n\n134\n00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.431\nIt's when you start to scale.\n\n135\n00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:59.039\nRemember when we've talked about this\nin our series a little bit more, right?\n\n136\n00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.254\nThe idea of scaling up and\nscaling out, okay.\n\n137\n00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:07.762\nWell, now when we move up to 400 users or\nthousands users, and let's just\n\n138\n00:08:07.762 --> 00:08:14.110\nsay it's 15% of them that's doing this\nit now becomes much more of a challenge.\n\n139\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.104\nSo every time Zach or somebody else, or\n\n140\n00:08:17.104 --> 00:08:21.838\nthe 15% of the 400 that come in,\nso what is that, 60?\n\n141\n00:08:21.838 --> 00:08:26.285\nOkay, 60 that end up coming in our,\nyeah 60, Joe was right.\n\n142\n00:08:26.285 --> 00:08:28.827\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So 60 that come in, okay,\n\n143\n00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:29.970\nwhat if I do that?\n\n144\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.423\nWell, that means that I have to\nactually change the account over\n\n145\n00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:37.313\nhere inside of my Office 365 tenancy.\n\n146\n00:08:37.313 --> 00:08:41.459\nAnd then I have to go into Active\nDirectory over here and change it too.\n\n147\n00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:45.899\nSo for everyone single one user I\nhave to change it at least twice for\n\n148\n00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:48.532\na password, if that's what happens.\n\n149\n00:08:48.532 --> 00:08:49.346\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:52.459\n&gt;&gt; So now my administrative effort,\neven though in my mind it says,\n\n151\n00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:54.680\nthis how it's gonna be,\nit's gonna be easy.\n\n152\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.940\nI'm not gonna worry about Zach,\n\n153\n00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.960\nZach's the only one who has to\nworry about the two accounts here.\n\n154\n00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.527\nI don't, I just tell Zach that\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n155\n00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:06.170\nWell now my administrative effort had\njust increased, pretty much, okay.\n\n156\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.734\nSo when we start to talk about\nsynchronization, what we're really\n\n157\n00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:15.710\ntalking about is how can this coexist\na little bit easier instead, okay.\n\n158\n00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.990\nSo the goal here is down here at\nthe bottom that you see, okay.\n\n159\n00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.601\nUsers have a single identity\nto access both, okay.\n\n160\n00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:28.115\nUsers have a single identity\nwhich single resources inside of\n\n161\n00:09:28.115 --> 00:09:31.869\nyour active directory\nare also synchronized too.\n\n162\n00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:36.655\nNow what that can actually mean,\nagain this is kinda based on everything\n\n163\n00:09:36.655 --> 00:09:40.978\nelse that goes on, but\nthere comes in this point in time, right?\n\n164\n00:09:40.978 --> 00:09:46.740\nWhere what we really want is what we\ncall a single source of authority, okay.\n\n165\n00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:51.565\nSo when we start this idea of Active\nDirectory Synchronization, we're pretty\n\n166\n00:09:51.565 --> 00:09:56.542\nmuch saying, hey, let's synchronize\nthese two Active Directories together.\n\n167\n00:09:56.542 --> 00:10:00.266\nAnd then e'll have a single\nsource of authority at the very\n\n168\n00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:04.680\nbeginning when we start to do this,\nespecially with Office 365.\n\n169\n00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.557\nWell, the first time, okay,\nthat everything is finally synchronized up\n\n170\n00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:12.756\nthe source of authority is over here,\ninside of the Office 365 Cloud, okay.\n\n171\n00:10:12.756 --> 00:10:15.842\nBut then, once it's done and complete,\n\n172\n00:10:15.842 --> 00:10:21.397\nthat source of authority will migrate\nback over to our on premises if I can,\n\n173\n00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:28.160\nI didn't exactly space this very well,\nover here on my on premises instead, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.708\nAnd this now actually means that\nthe synchronization will not be two ways.\n\n175\n00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:35.264\nAnd this is actually a wrong arrow,\nI probably should have actually have a one\n\n176\n00:10:35.264 --> 00:10:38.540\nway synchronization is what\nends up happening here, okay.\n\n177\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:44.508\nSo the synchronization will always happen\nin this one direction instead, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:44.508 --> 00:10:47.051\nSo everything that I\nmake a modification and\n\n179\n00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:51.270\nchange over here it will also\nsync up over here too, okay.\n\n180\n00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.442\nSo it's not gonna be two way where\nif I make a change over here,\n\n181\n00:10:54.442 --> 00:10:57.432\nit syncs down over here,\nit's just not gonna be that way.\n\n182\n00:10:57.432 --> 00:11:01.679\nBut ultimately in the end, right, once\neverything we start that synchronization\n\n183\n00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:05.457\nI'm gonna show you that it's not\nexactly the most difficult thing to do.\n\n184\n00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:08.903\nBut you do have them take some\nconsiderations in mind when you do\n\n185\n00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:09.563\nso, okay.\n\n186\n00:11:09.563 --> 00:11:12.634\nBut that's essentially what\nis gonna happen, okay.\n\n187\n00:11:12.634 --> 00:11:16.270\nSo the very initial state,\nright, remember it is over\n\n188\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.510\nhere at the beginning with the very\nfirst initial synchronization.\n\n189\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.344\nOnce it's done, now when you actually\nget synchronized here, okay.\n\n190\n00:11:26.344 --> 00:11:29.064\nAnd the user logs on\nwith their Office 365,\n\n191\n00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:33.390\nthe Azure Active Directory synchronization\nthough it will check against\n\n192\n00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.810\nthe sources authority which will\nbe over here on your own domain.\n\n193\n00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:43.044\nIf you're keeping both the on-premises\nwhich is your network over here,\n\n194\n00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:45.131\nand of course Office 365.\n\n195\n00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:49.129\nNow if you're saying, I'm migrating\ncompletely over then at some point in\n\n196\n00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:52.814\nthe future after you make sure\neverything is working that you want to,\n\n197\n00:11:52.814 --> 00:11:56.160\nyou kind of don't have to\nworry about this one so much.\n\n198\n00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.884\nBut if you really need that hybrid\nenvironment where you still have\n\n199\n00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:04.222\nExchange working and Skype working,\nand everything else working, right?\n\n200\n00:12:04.222 --> 00:12:08.935\nAnd then you're actually saying I wanna\nmove this to online or Exchange online and\n\n201\n00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:10.660\neverything over here.\n\n202\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.042\nWell, we need the synchronization\nprocess to be up and\n\n203\n00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:18.094\nworking so that the end user has\nthe seam as close as we can, okay.\n\n204\n00:12:18.094 --> 00:12:21.670\nThe seamless environment\nthat we really want, okay?\n\n205\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.564\nSo that's a big part of what we're\nactually trying to do and what we actually\n\n206\n00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:31.845\nneed to think about in terms of planning\nand synchronization as it goes on, okay.\n\n207\n00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:37.039\nSo once we have that in our mind and\nunderstand what we're doing there,\n\n208\n00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:42.930\nthere are some considerations we need\nto begin to plan for as well, okay.\n\n209\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.873\nAnd one of those particular plans that\nwe have to think about is that what if\n\n210\n00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:52.417\non your own Active Directory on\npremises solution that you have over\n\n211\n00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:54.265\nhere on the left hand side?\n\n212\n00:12:54.265 --> 00:12:58.933\nWhat if you actually have\nnon-routable domains inside of\n\n213\n00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:03.660\nthis particular Active Directory solution,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.155\nWell, if you have that, well,\nwe can't actually use that,\n\n215\n00:13:07.155 --> 00:13:11.134\nin other words it's not routable,\nit's not allowed to be out there.\n\n216\n00:13:11.134 --> 00:13:16.860\nSo normally these types of domains\nend in something like .local, okay?\n\n217\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.870\nNow you may have it for many reasons,\ntesting of some type on other environment\n\n218\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.810\nthat you have but\nlet's kinda pretend that we have that.\n\n219\n00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.380\nNow I have something close,\nI don't have everything.\n\n220\n00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.622\nBut I have something fairly close and\nsimilar that we're going to use.\n\n221\n00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:33.674\nSo I had to setup another domain\ncontroller to help us out, but\n\n222\n00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:37.489\nthe good thing is I already had one that\nI could actually kinda pull in to help us\n\n223\n00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:38.820\nout here, okay.\n\n224\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.290\nSo when we start to try and\n\n225\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.155\nplan for this, especially\nnon-routable domain names, okay?\n\n226\n00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:48.600\nWe have two options essentially that\nyou have to be able to deal with.\n\n227\n00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.749\nIf you have some domain, so\nlet me change this right now.\n\n228\n00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.911\nLet's say that internally, okay,\n\n229\n00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.680\nyour particular domain here\nwas itprotvdemo.local instead,\n\n230\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.740\nwhich means you're not gonna actually\nuse this out on the Internet.\n\n231\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.321\nYou're not planning on routing it,\n\n232\n00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.585\nyou're just wanting this as an Active\nDirectory Management environment,\n\n233\n00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:09.555\nan administrative environment and\nthat's perfectly fine, okay.\n\n234\n00:14:09.555 --> 00:14:13.600\nBut now you wanna connect\nto active out here, okay.\n\n235\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.463\nWell if you want to do that,\nthe recommendation of course then,\n\n236\n00:14:19.463 --> 00:14:24.133\nis to go through and\nchange the itprotvdemo local,\n\n237\n00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:26.967\nokay, or itprotvdemo.com.\n\n238\n00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:30.878\nNow that's a pretty involved\nsituation to actually be able to do.\n\n239\n00:14:30.878 --> 00:14:34.496\nYou're really renaming\nthe whole domain again,\n\n240\n00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:40.278\nwhich I believe is actually gonna include\nin demoting your domain controller.\n\n241\n00:14:40.278 --> 00:14:45.169\nAnd then doing all that other stuff that\nyou need to do and then bringing them back\n\n242\n00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:49.485\nup, and then there it is,\nItprotvdemo.com would actually come up.\n\n243\n00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:52.219\nNow, if you have multiple\ndomain controllers,\n\n244\n00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:54.906\nyou're gonna have to give it some time,\nokay.\n\n245\n00:14:54.906 --> 00:14:58.881\nSo I would recommend wait at least\n48 hours before you choose to change\n\n246\n00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.540\neverything else to allow for\nthe complete replication product.\n\n247\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.900\nBut in reality most people go no,\ndon't do that, okay.\n\n248\n00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.920\nDo not rename your domain name after\nyou actually get it set up cuz there\n\n249\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.296\nare just too many objects inside to know\nif it got every single thing or not.\n\n250\n00:15:16.296 --> 00:15:20.380\nNow with Server 2016,\nthey may have made that easier.\n\n251\n00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.977\nBut if you're coming from the old school,\nlike I did,\n\n252\n00:15:22.977 --> 00:15:26.152\nyou kinda still hesitate on going,\nshould I really do this or not?\n\n253\n00:15:26.152 --> 00:15:28.701\nSo you do want to be\ncareful if you do that.\n\n254\n00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:33.520\nSo it can be done but at the same time\nthe recommendation that I would say is,\n\n255\n00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.600\nwe'd probably wanna\nbring up the new domain.\n\n256\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.769\nBut it does take a little\nbit of time to do that.\n\n257\n00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:40.639\nSo instead you may have to do that,\n\n258\n00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:44.890\nwhich is to change over that domain\nto another domain name instead.\n\n259\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.384\nPreferably, the one that matches what\nyou probably set up over here if you\n\n260\n00:15:49.384 --> 00:15:51.426\nalready own that domain, okay?\n\n261\n00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:58.858\nNow, what if you go, I don't know if\nI'm willing to do that right now, okay.\n\n262\n00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:01.505\nI don't wanna change from my local domain.\n\n263\n00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:05.306\nI want to actually make sure\nthat I can still get over there.\n\n264\n00:16:05.306 --> 00:16:10.424\nI still want to make sure that I can\nuse the routable domain name space but\n\n265\n00:16:10.424 --> 00:16:13.200\nthis I've gotta leave as is.\n\n266\n00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.210\nWell you have to do that, that means\nagain your other options then okay,\n\n267\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.270\nis instead is to change the UPN\nsuffixes by registering\n\n268\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:28.200\nanother UPN suffix inside of\nyour Active Directory, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.340\nSo that is the other option that you have\nand that is something that you can do.\n\n270\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.160\nAnd we are gonna show you of\ncourse how to get that done,\n\n271\n00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.630\nwhich is not real difficult but remember,\n\n272\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.290\nyou may not be in charged of everything\nthat I say that you can do, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.130\nSo you just have to at least\nunderstand what the steps are and\n\n274\n00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.290\nthe other thing is adding in that new\nUPN suffix that you're gonna register in\n\n275\n00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.110\nthe Active Directory to make sure then,\nthat this happens, and\n\n276\n00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.002\nthen you'll have to change a couple\nof other things to do so, okay?\n\n277\n00:16:58.002 --> 00:17:02.760\nSo let me flip on over here,\nto this domain controller.\n\n278\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.610\nNow, this is one that\nI've used in other shows.\n\n279\n00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.190\nSo, it's got another domain, or\nat least I think I can use it.\n\n280\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.321\nThere we go, okay?\n\n281\n00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:11.960\nThis is, I know, there it is, Joey Fatone.\n\n282\n00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.472\nWho would have guessed?\n\n283\n00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.730\n&gt;&gt; Would Joey mind, Ronnie?\n\n284\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.015\n&gt;&gt; I hope Joey doesn't mind.\n\n285\n00:17:20.015 --> 00:17:22.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n286\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.325\nI am logging in and let me show you\nthe name of the domain right now, okay?\n\n287\n00:17:27.325 --> 00:17:30.765\nSo this one is not exactly\nthe non-routable one,\n\n288\n00:17:30.765 --> 00:17:34.915\nbut it will actually work\nwith us in doing this, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:38.405\nSo when you start to take\na look here on Office Pro,\n\n290\n00:17:38.405 --> 00:17:43.915\nthis is officeprodemocoonmicrosoft.com,\njust take the onmicrosoft.com and\n\n291\n00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:46.960\nthink of it as being .local instead,\nat the end here.\n\n292\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.220\nSo it was the only way I could do this\nvery quickly to make sure that this could\n\n293\n00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.150\nbe done, right?\n\n294\n00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.780\nThe other way was to set up a whole new\ndomain controller once again and do this.\n\n295\n00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.062\nAll right, now once you have that,\n\n296\n00:17:57.062 --> 00:18:01.750\nlet me select Active Directory,\nDirectory Services.\n\n297\n00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.838\nI'm going to right click on\nthe Active Directory, Directory Services\n\n298\n00:18:06.838 --> 00:18:11.521\nover here and we are going to domains and\ntrusts at the beginning.\n\n299\n00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:20.563\nAll right, now once l'm inside\nof Active Directory domains and\n\n300\n00:18:20.563 --> 00:18:23.260\ntrust at this point, okay.\n\n301\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.940\nNotice that if you do this here, you're\nwanting this top level node right here\n\n302\n00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.080\nokay, under Active Directory domains and\ntrust.\n\n303\n00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.810\nIf I right click on that, not the actual\ndomain down here at the bottom.\n\n304\n00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.370\nIf I scroll down and select properties.\n\n305\n00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.623\nThis is where you want to change,\nor add in a new UPN suffix.\n\n306\n00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:51.030\nOkay?\nThe names of the current domain and\n\n307\n00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.322\nthe route domains are the default\nusers principal names suffixes.\n\n308\n00:18:55.322 --> 00:18:59.110\nAdding an alternative name provides\nadditional logon security and\n\n309\n00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.470\nsimplifies logon names.\n\n310\n00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.137\nIf you want an alternative UPN suffix\nto appear during user creation,\n\n311\n00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:08.281\nadd them to the following list.\n\n312\n00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:13.417\nSo it's right here that we can\n\n313\n00:19:13.417 --> 00:19:19.176\nactually do itprotvdemo.com.\n\n314\n00:19:22.015 --> 00:19:28.254\nI'm going to click add, apply and then OK.\n\n315\n00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:37.393\nAll right, now once I've actually got that\nselected, it's not difficult, but most,\n\n316\n00:19:37.393 --> 00:19:40.450\nI know like me,\n95% of the time where am I going?\n\n317\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.520\nActive Directory users and computers.\n\n318\n00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.070\nGoing into domains and trusts, really\nnot exactly something I'd do every day.\n\n319\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.270\nBut just realize if you are doing this\nbecause you do have a non-routable domain,\n\n320\n00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.750\nyou'll need to actually go into\nActive Directory domains and trusts and\n\n321\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.720\nadd in that UPN suffix.\n\n322\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.311\nFrom that point, if everything has\nactually kind of done what we needed to,\n\n323\n00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:05.203\nnow I need to go into Active Directory\nusers and computers here.\n\n324\n00:20:08.668 --> 00:20:11.829\nActive Directory users and computers and\n\n325\n00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:15.899\nyou'll see I selected that\nright there under tools.\n\n326\n00:20:18.106 --> 00:20:20.830\nAnd that will bring up this\nmanagement console in just a moment.\n\n327\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.547\nThere it is.\n\n328\n00:20:24.243 --> 00:20:31.110\nNow for the users that I'm going to\nbe kinda of pulling in together here.\n\n329\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.266\nLet's see where I can actually find\na couple of use, there you go, Office 265.\n\n330\n00:20:35.266 --> 00:20:37.320\nSo this one is a little bit more unusual.\n\n331\n00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.270\nLet's use this here,\nas this will help us out, okay.\n\n332\n00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:47.050\nNow in each one of these, right,\nthere are individuals that are in here.\n\n333\n00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.370\nIf I right click on Titus for example, and\n\n334\n00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:58.420\nI go to properties select account, okay?\n\n335\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.770\nIt's right here if they're going\nto be using the office 365.\n\n336\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.890\nI don't want this to be their UPN suffix.\n\n337\n00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:11.790\nI click on the drop down this is what\nI want to be their UPN suffix instead.\n\n338\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:14.985\nSo these are the accounts that I'm\nprobably going to start synchronizing over\n\n339\n00:21:14.985 --> 00:21:19.360\nas changing those that are actually going\nto be part of that synchronization.\n\n340\n00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.555\nSo it's as simple as that, where you add\nin what you want to at that point, then\n\n341\n00:21:23.555 --> 00:21:27.963\nyou click Apply then you click OK and then\nyou continue to actually do that as well.\n\n342\n00:21:27.963 --> 00:21:33.170\nSo we select Tyler who is sitting right\noutside of our office here, or our studio.\n\n343\n00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.750\nWe do the same thing.\n\n344\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.630\nAgain, click OK.\n\n345\n00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.610\nAnd there you go.\n\n346\n00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.336\nSo now if I take a look and\nI go back into his account.\n\n347\n00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:49.917\nNotice that that's what his particular\nlogin is going to be instead or his UPN,\n\n348\n00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:51.640\nexcuse me, is going to be.\n\n349\n00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.980\nAnd that's gonna help us too.\n\n350\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.460\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie,\nwe had a question from the chat room and\n\n351\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.910\nthank you for that by the way.\n\n352\n00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.490\nCan exchange play nice\nwith AED controllers?\n\n353\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.130\n&gt;&gt; Not if you're changing very easily.\n\n354\n00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.880\nSo this is where you have to use\nthe connect tools and everything else.\n\n355\n00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.960\nBut that's why planning this out is\na little bit more essential, okay?\n\n356\n00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.710\nSo you do want to make sure that\neverything is set up correctly before you\n\n357\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.730\ndo this.\n\n358\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.870\nSo a lot of times that's where\nyou have to sync up what's\n\n359\n00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.690\nactually inside your EAC,\nexchange admin center.\n\n360\n00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.970\nVerify that those settings are also\ncorrect along with what you have inside of\n\n361\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.530\nyour Active Drectory, and also your\non-premise exchange controllers as well.\n\n362\n00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.560\nNow we do a little bit of\nthat in the 70-347 show.\n\n363\n00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.480\nBut don't expect everything is gonna\ngo exactly perfectly at this point\n\n364\n00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.310\nwhen you start messing around\nwith exchange like this.\n\n365\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.470\nCan it actually work relatively easily?\n\n366\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.070\nTo a point, right, if everything is\nsimple it's probably gonna do that,\n\n367\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.640\nbut once you start getting a little bit\nmore complex you'll probably need to at\n\n368\n00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.740\nleast think about if\nit's not working right?\n\n369\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.710\nThink about calling on somebody with\na little bit more experience to help that\n\n370\n00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.100\nmigration process through.\n\n371\n00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.110\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n372\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.940\nSo that would be my recommendation.\n\n373\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.980\nBut we do hit kind of the fundamentals on\nverifying everything is actually okay, and\n\n374\n00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.350\nexchange admin center\nreally helps you out.\n\n375\n00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.460\nIf that's what you're doing and\nyou're choosing to do that.\n\n376\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.330\nSo, just kind of be aware.\n\n377\n00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.690\nIt doesn't always work\nout exactly perfectly.\n\n378\n00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.450\nBut here are some of the planning steps\nthat we've been talking about, and\n\n379\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.716\nthat's what we are getting into, okay?\n\n380\n00:23:22.716 --> 00:23:23.448\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n381\n00:23:23.448 --> 00:23:27.449\nAll right, now there are some other\nthings that we also have to do so\n\n382\n00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:32.379\nonce we get that down right, that's kind\nof the primary step as far as planning for\n\n383\n00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:36.598\nsynchronization is what do we do\nwith those particular non-routable\n\n384\n00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:37.685\ndomains, okay?\n\n385\n00:23:37.685 --> 00:23:42.698\nThe other thing that we also have to\nbe able to do, before we start to\n\n386\n00:23:42.698 --> 00:23:49.240\nsynchronize is we may want to start\ncleaning up our active directory itself.\n\n387\n00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.940\nNow the great thing is, there is actually\na tool that is available for us.\n\n388\n00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.560\nTo do so, okay?\n\n389\n00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.960\nAnd that's what we really want to\nat least take a look at again and\n\n390\n00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.210\nsee how that works out for us as well.\n\n391\n00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.910\nSo, let's go ahead and do that as well.\n\n392\n00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.540\nI'm gonna switch to another machine and\nthen we'll go ahead and do so.\n\n393\n00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.010\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, we really want to do that,\nbut I guess what we're gonna be running\n\n394\n00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.940\nout of time here in about two minutes\n&gt;&gt; So we'll have to go to a part two.\n\n395\n00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.130\nWould that be all right?\n\n396\n00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.680\n&gt;&gt; That sounds great, Zach cuz there is a\nlittle bit more for us to show in terms of\n\n397\n00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.310\nthe idea plan, actually a lot more for us\nto show in the idea of planning here, but\n\n398\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.360\nwith just a few minutes,\nthere's no real hope of us jumping in and\n\n399\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.750\nshowing you anything else on this\nepisode so part two sounds great.\n\n400\n00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.860\n&gt;&gt; And we will do that.\n\n401\n00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.070\nPrepare AD synchronization\nto Office 365 part two.\n\n402\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.560\nYou've seen part one, and\nyou'll wanna watch both of them.\n\n403\n00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.380\nAnd in fact.\n\n404\n00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.170\nYou wanna watch everything\nin the Office 365 series,\n\n405\n00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.200\nvisit our course library there's hundreds\nof videos there, all designed for\n\n406\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.070\none purpose, to help you go further.\n\n407\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.460\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV\nthey'll be glad you did, thanks for\n\n408\n00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.570\nwatching, I'm Zach

00:00:08.253\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.253 --> 00:00:11.950\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.282\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:17.450\nHelping you learn wherever you go,\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.170\nAs we continue with Office 365,\n\n8\n00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.830\nthis is prepare AD synchronization\nto Office 365 part two.\n\n9\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.260\nThere was a part one,\nmake sure you see that and\n\n10\n00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.620\nof course Ronnie Wong has\ncome back to help us out.\n\n11\n00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.990\nRonnie good to see you again,\nthanks for joining us.\n\n12\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back as we\ncontinue to taking a look at this idea of,\n\n13\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.010\nbeginning this process of\nsynchronization to Office 365\n\n14\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.170\nNow we've already talked\nabout it a little bit and\n\n15\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.950\nshown you a couple of different things\nthat you have to be able to get ready.\n\n16\n00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.710\nSinking the concept into your\nhead of why we want to do it is\n\n17\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.310\npretty much critical, right?\n\n18\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.100\nAs well as thinking about how\nour organization is set up and\n\n19\n00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.700\nsome of the things we have to take\ncare of is another part of it too.\n\n20\n00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.120\nAnd that's where we, in our previous\nepisode when we talked about this idea of\n\n21\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.940\nactually doing something with\nthe none routable domains and\n\n22\n00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.955\nwhat can we do with them.\n\n23\n00:01:05.955 --> 00:01:07.920\nThen we mentioned what\nyou can do with them.\n\n24\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.940\nGranted, there are hiccups along\nthe way that if you do this.\n\n25\n00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.450\nSo normally the recommendation,especially\nwhen you already have an existing domain\n\n26\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.300\nthat's non-routable, is that you\ndon't try and rename everything.\n\n27\n00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.961\nBecause even if you do,\nyou may experience some issues.\n\n28\n00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:25.880\nAnd someone in our chat actually did\ntalk about that, that a lot of times\n\n29\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.040\nwhen you start renaming stuff inside\nof Active Directory, even if you do\n\n30\n00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.835\nit every single possible thing that\nsomebody could think of to account for.\n\n31\n00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:38.340\nThere is always something glitches and\nthat's because there is so\n\n32\n00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.710\nmany objects it has to change.\n\n33\n00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.110\nAnd I'm talking, I just,\nI can't even imagine how many, there is\n\n34\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.920\nmillions of objects that essentially\nhave to change their attributes and\n\n35\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.240\neverything else in them, that it's going\nto run into a glitch at some point.\n\n36\n00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.730\nYou have a hiccup,\nsome type of CPU voltage spike,\n\n37\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.570\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n38\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.080\nAll it takes is a little bit of static.\n\n39\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.120\nWhatever it is, that changes\na value that you don't want to and\n\n40\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.270\nit just kinda ruins your day, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.468\nSo the other way of course,\nthat we showed you was to add in\n\n42\n00:02:08.468 --> 00:02:12.594\nan additional UPN suffix in\nto your domains and trusts.\n\n43\n00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:17.582\nAnd then all the users that are gonna be\nfor what we're gonna synchronize in to\n\n44\n00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:23.202\nOffice 365 and getting everything done\nthe way that we want to, well that, right?\n\n45\n00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.836\nWe also need to go in and\n\n46\n00:02:24.836 --> 00:02:29.407\nchange their particular UPN suffix\nto the one that we added in.\n\n47\n00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:33.900\nAnd that will help us when it comes down\ntime for us to do the synchronization.\n\n48\n00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.780\nSo that was a part of the plan when\nwe started talking about the idea\n\n49\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.880\nof planning.\n\n50\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.990\nNow believe it or not, and\n\n51\n00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.770\nthis in there trying until I end\nup teaching project management.\n\n52\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.160\nThe majority of the work that we end up\ndoing, it's not in all of the clicks that\n\n53\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.610\nwe do or finding the right things, or\njust finding the right actions to do.\n\n54\n00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.280\nBecause in the background, most of that\nis us just kind of following a wizard\n\n55\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.210\nthrough, making sure that we understand\nwhat the elements are in the wizard.\n\n56\n00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.320\nBut the wizard takes care of it,\nit does the job for us.\n\n57\n00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.830\nBut the planning is what we have to\nconsider, to make sure that we cover all\n\n58\n00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.295\nof our bases to make a a seamless and\na smooth of a transition as possible\n\n59\n00:03:12.295 --> 00:03:16.975\ninto the synchronized type of environment\nthat we're talking about, okay.\n\n60\n00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:20.665\nSo one of the things that we are about\nto do before we ended the episode and\n\n61\n00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:25.270\nrealized I ran out of time,\nis that we were going to talk about other\n\n62\n00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.210\nobjects that we may need to clean up\ninside of Active Directory, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.760\nAnd that's what we want to\nbeing talking about as well.\n\n64\n00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhy do we need to clean up these objects?\n\n65\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.130\nWhy do we need to clean all that up?\n\n66\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.210\n&gt;&gt; It really is kind of weird and\nyou know at the same time\n\n67\n00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.180\nyou would think that somewhere along the\nline, Microsoft would have figured out.\n\n68\n00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.570\nThat hey,\nyou know this whatever Ronnie thinks it is\n\n69\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.630\nshould match exactly up to\nwhat Microsoft believes it is.\n\n70\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.830\nBut in all reality,\nMicrosoft is not a mind reader and\n\n71\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.680\nthey're definitely not\na Ronnie Wong mind reader.\n\n72\n00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.545\n&gt;&gt; They're not a mind reader?\n\n73\n00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:03.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're not mind readers and,\nyou know, that's the weird thing, right?\n\n74\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.720\nThings that I call differently\nthan what most people out there,\n\n75\n00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.850\nthey've attended some official\nMicrosoft think about,\n\n76\n00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.680\nwhy isn't Ronnie using\nthe term that I learned?\n\n77\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.530\nAnd it's because, I probably learned it\non my own, and it just called it on me.\n\n78\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.902\nAnd so, there are some things that we've\nactually kind of learned how to do because\n\n79\n00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:22.907\nof who we were taught by or\nhow we actually decide to do it.\n\n80\n00:04:22.907 --> 00:04:26.866\nThat technically might not fit into\nthe schema of everything the way\n\n81\n00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.310\nthat Microsoft wants it done.\n\n82\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.320\nSo these are sometimes where you have\nto kind of go back and clean things up.\n\n83\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.020\nBecause the tool itself and\nthe synchronization part itself, right?\n\n84\n00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.330\nIt really is, it's kind of programmed\nin to recognize certain things,\n\n85\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.940\nand not programmed to actually\nrecognize everything.\n\n86\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.460\nWe don't account for\nevery single possible variable here.\n\n87\n00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.334\nSo, for example, if Zach and I,\nwe were kind of doing the same thing,\n\n88\n00:04:51.334 --> 00:04:56.132\nZach may actually approach it completely\n100 percent different than the way I would\n\n89\n00:04:56.132 --> 00:04:56.938\napproach it.\n\n90\n00:04:56.938 --> 00:04:59.323\nAnd it doesn't mean that we\ncan't get the same result,\n\n91\n00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:02.560\nwhat it means that was that we\njust kinda look at it differently.\n\n92\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.190\nBut the whole goal behind it is planning,\nright?\n\n93\n00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.820\nAs long as we plan and that we're\nrelatively comprehensive in what we\n\n94\n00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.120\nplan on doing and understand what\nelements have to be in place.\n\n95\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.660\nAnd it really doesn't matter if Zach\ndoes it his way, or I do it my way,\n\n96\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.330\nas long as it matches up to what\nMicrosoft really needs to make it work.\n\n97\n00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.040\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n98\n00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.805\n&gt;&gt; So the cleanup is actually a big\npart of what Microsoft is telling us.\n\n99\n00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:31.300\nLike you can try and\ndo this without cleaning this up, okay.\n\n100\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.780\nBut we don't recommend it because\nwhat you're gonna see is it's gonna\n\n101\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.900\nthrow an error.\n\n102\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.480\nAnd now at that point Ronnie,\nyou're going to have to go back and\n\n103\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.920\ntrace that error out and\nfigure out what it is.\n\n104\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.440\nAnd it could be just something\n\n105\n00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.010\nas simple as a space where there\ndidn't need to be a space.\n\n106\n00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.520\nOr it could be something as simple as\na character that it does not recognize\n\n107\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.180\nthat its there.\n\n108\n00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.525\nSo in other words,\n\n109\n00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:55.930\nthere may be invalid characters,\nand actually that is a good example\n\n110\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.520\nof some of the planning considerations\nwe may actually have to be able to do.\n\n111\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.900\nSo when we start to do this, and when we\nstart to think about the idea of cleaning,\n\n112\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.050\nwithout this step it can possibly work.\n\n113\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.380\nBut absolutely though, if you don't\ntry at all, you're definitely gonna\n\n114\n00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.998\nend up with errors, and you're gonna end\nup with more errors than what you thought.\n\n115\n00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:20.670\nSo cleaning them up before you\ntry the synchronization part\n\n116\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.800\nis really going to help make it smoother.\n\n117\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.280\nI'm not gonna guarantee you 100% error\nfree, but it will at least kind of smooth\n\n118\n00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.990\nthe path down so you're not hitting\nevery single obstacle along the way.\n\n119\n00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.825\n&gt;&gt; So here, an ounce of prevention\nis worth a pound of cure.\n\n120\n00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:37.830\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, it really is.\n\n121\n00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.900\nSo some of those things that\nwe might even consider, so\n\n122\n00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.810\nan example that I was using, right?\n\n123\n00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.580\nIs the idea of invalid characters\ninside of our UPN suffix name, okay?\n\n124\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.619\nSo if you realize that you might have some\nthat's in there that might be considered\n\n125\n00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.681\ninvalid character.\n\n126\n00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:55.738\nUsually inside a program such\nas ampersands sometimes or\n\n127\n00:06:55.738 --> 00:06:59.961\nsquiggly marks or the tick mark or\nwhatever you wanna call,\n\n128\n00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.961\naccent mark, a brav, accent, a goo,\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n129\n00:07:04.961 --> 00:07:12.030\nThat the synchronization tool\ndoesn't recognize, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.480\nThen it's gonna cause errors, and then\nyou're gonna have to trace that down and\n\n131\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.077\ngo, are you joking me that that's\nwhat it was that cause it?\n\n132\n00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:20.170\nNo, we're not joking you.\n\n133\n00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.010\nSo finding those types of things before\nyou even start the synchronization\n\n134\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.940\nis going to help you out, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.148\nSo we want to make sure that we will\ncall and we will understand that.\n\n136\n00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:33.145\nNow there is other issues that I also\nwant to point out to you as well, okay.\n\n137\n00:07:33.145 --> 00:07:34.953\nAs we get started here and\n\n138\n00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:39.960\nmake sure that we understand what\nelse is also happening too, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.120\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at our\nActive Directory, since that's where we're\n\n140\n00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.550\npretty much going to try and get\neverything to clean up what we need to.\n\n141\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.470\nOnce I'm here I'm gonna select of course\nActive Directly, then I'm gonna right\n\n142\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.620\nclick and let's go to Active Directory\nDomains and Trusts at this point.\n\n143\n00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.950\nWhat I'm looking for\nis the actual forest functional level or\n\n144\n00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:05.170\nthe domain functional level is\nwhat I want to be able to do.\n\n145\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.135\nSo let me select where it says, let's see\nif Manage actually shows me that instead.\n\n146\n00:08:09.135 --> 00:08:10.510\nNo, that's not what I wanted.\n\n147\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.770\nI want the right click and select.\n\n148\n00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.350\nI keep doing the wrong one.\n\n149\n00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.770\nIt's right there, it says Raise Functional\nLevel, and I keep hitting the wrong one.\n\n150\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.850\nSo this is what I'm essentially\nwanting to see here.\n\n151\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.280\nNow if I select this, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.260\nNow you'll actually see where it\nsays the current functional level\n\n153\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.090\nThat's all I really wanted to show.\n\n154\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.710\nYou want to verify that if you\nare actually doing this for Office 365,\n\n155\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:39.160\nthat the functional level is at\nleast gonna be 2008 or later, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.314\nNow a lot of times when you do this\nyou're like, okay, you're in 2016, so\n\n157\n00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:44.191\ndoes it matter?\n\n158\n00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:49.240\nIt really doesn't, but if you are actually\nin an Active Directory domain and\n\n159\n00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.892\nyou're still seeing where\nit says Server 2008, or\n\n160\n00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:56.020\nServer 2008 R2, that is perfectly fine.\n\n161\n00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.910\nNow you may be wondering like,\nis anybody still running Server 2008?\n\n162\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.975\nProbably, okay so\ndon't underestimate that.\n\n163\n00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:03.771\n&gt;&gt; Here, guilty.\n\n164\n00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:05.261\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm kind of, yeah,\n\n165\n00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:06.410\nevery once in a while.\n\n166\n00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.022\n&gt;&gt; At home, not here.\n\n167\n00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:11.965\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, every once in a while, I'm\nkind of still surprised that Server 2003\n\n168\n00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:15.430\nis still out there as a domain controller,\nbut it is, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.867\nIt's still out there as\na domain controller, so\n\n170\n00:09:17.867 --> 00:09:19.893\ndon't think it can't happen, right?\n\n171\n00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:24.260\nSo as long as it's 2008 or\nlater, now what if it's 2003?\n\n172\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.590\nWell, can it work?\n\n173\n00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.830\nYes, it will still allow you to\ndo this synchronization up to\n\n174\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:37.910\nOffice 365, but you will not get\nall of the latest features and\n\n175\n00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.960\nbenefits that you'll actually be\nable to have with 2008 or later.\n\n176\n00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.459\nSo an example of that is what we call\nthe idea of password write back.\n\n177\n00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.860\nPassword write back is a cool,\nessential part of what you want to do,\n\n178\n00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.920\nwhich is what we were talking\nabout in a previous episode.\n\n179\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.840\nSo that if I synchronize Zach's account\nfrom my Active Directory account\n\n180\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.910\nto Zach's Office 365 account,\neverything is actually that way.\n\n181\n00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:09.498\nWhat I want though, is this ability\nthat if I change it in Zach's Office\n\n182\n00:10:09.498 --> 00:10:14.010\n365 account, that it actually has\nthis ability to also change on,\n\n183\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.390\nyou know .I'm saying it backward.\n\n184\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.503\nLet's do it the other way cuz\nthat's probably the proper way.\n\n185\n00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:24.670\nIf I change it inside of my local domain,\nthat it also transfers up to Office 365.\n\n186\n00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.020\nSo that way,\n\n187\n00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.680\nthat's what we want, we want that ability\nto have that right back feature enabled.\n\n188\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.080\nIf you have functional level of\n2003 like what you're seeing here,\n\n189\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.426\nyou definitely are not going to have that.\n\n190\n00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:40.450\nSo just kind of be aware, if you are\nactually going to clean up something and\n\n191\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.210\ndo that, it doesn't normally change\nanything else that we're doing, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.180\nSo most people don't probably realize\nwhat the functional level does anyways.\n\n193\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.680\nBut if this is going to be a part of it,\nmake sure you talk to whoever it is and\n\n194\n00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.380\nsay, is your particular domain or\nyour forest functional level or\n\n195\n00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.610\nyour domain functional level,\nis it at least 2008 or later?\n\n196\n00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.500\nIf it's not, go back and look that up and\nrealize, they probably won't have somewhat\n\n197\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.660\nthe right back feature, or\nthe password right back features\n\n198\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.410\nthat keeps track of those password\nchanges the way that we want, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.210\nSo that's one thing, so\nmake sure you understand.\n\n200\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.140\nNow, what if you go to an organization and\nyou're helping them say,\n\n201\n00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:27.520\nhere's what we really wanna do, we wanna\ndo this Active Directory synchronization.\n\n202\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.840\nAnd we go, all right let's take\na look at your Active Directory and\n\n203\n00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.510\nsee if everything comes up.\n\n204\n00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.258\nWell if everything comes up but the only\nthing that you're actually seeing at that\n\n205\n00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:41.260\npoint instead,\nWhen it comes up is this, okay?\n\n206\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.360\nThat indicates something, and you go,\n\n207\n00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.540\nhey why is it coming up just with\nthe command prompt and nothing else.\n\n208\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.940\nThere's no GUI interface.\n\n209\n00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.401\nMore than likely you're\nrunning server core.\n\n210\n00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:55.751\nWhichever edition it is,\nit usually started 2008 or later,\n\n211\n00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:58.367\nR2 probably at this point, or later.\n\n212\n00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:01.407\nWhichever one it is,\nyou're not going to be able to do this.\n\n213\n00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:06.580\nCuz it only works if you have it\nwith the actual GUI installed.\n\n214\n00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.280\n&gt;&gt; So you can't work around Server Core?\n\n215\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.830\n&gt;&gt; You cannot do this synchronization\n&gt;&gt; Ooh\n\n216\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.210\n&gt;&gt; With Server Core.\n\n217\n00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.890\nIt's kind of one of the weird gotchas\nthat you have available here.\n\n218\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.280\nSo it can't be done with Server Core.\n\n219\n00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.160\nSo that is another kind of thing that\ncan get you a little bit as well.\n\n220\n00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.900\nSo just kinda realize that yes,\n\n221\n00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.605\nyou're gonna need at least one\nof those machines running.\n\n222\n00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:35.140\nWith the full GUI or today, in Server\n2016 they call it the desktop experience.\n\n223\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:36.520\nYou'll need that one.\n\n224\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.540\nThat's true, though.\n\n225\n00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.010\nIn the install it shows you.\n\n226\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.600\nIn Server 2016, Zach, by default when you\ninstall it, it installs a Server Core.\n\n227\n00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.180\nIt doesn't even say, do you want to\ninstall it this way or this way?\n\n228\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.830\nIt just says, if you don't pick\none I'm picking Server Core.\n\n229\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.870\nSo it's not a bad idea,\nit's actually a great idea.\n\n230\n00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:57.230\nUntil you wanna do synchronization,\nthen it's a bad idea at that point.\n\n231\n00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.840\nSo just be aware that this is\none of those unusual things\n\n232\n00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.700\nthat you may find yourself in.\n\n233\n00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.730\nNow the next one here is a little\nbit tricky, not for everyone, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.740\nNormally of course if you're\nalready doing this and\n\n235\n00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:13.320\nyou're also managing your network and\nyou're also doing Exchange, right?\n\n236\n00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:19.640\nYou're gonna see that your Exchange users\nhave a lot more attributes to them, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.270\nSo let me bring that up,\ninstead, if I right click, and\n\n238\n00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.850\ngo to Active Directory users and\ncomputers, okay.\n\n239\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.600\nThis is pretty much the one that I want,\nright here.\n\n240\n00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.950\nAnd, let's,\nwe'll pick the production team again.\n\n241\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.300\nTo help us out okay?\n\n242\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.710\nSo if I select Taylor's account here and\nI take a look at these properties,\n\n243\n00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.700\nnotice all these tabs that\nare actually up here aren't available.\n\n244\n00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.980\nif you're running Microsoft Exchange,\n\n245\n00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.990\nright, along with this, you're gonna see\nthat there is a lot more tabs up here.\n\n246\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.840\nThat are available right now.\n\n247\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:04.000\nAnd what that means is that your\nactive directory schema has changed.\n\n248\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.870\nIt is not exactly the same anymore,\nbecause it had to expand\n\n249\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.220\nto make room for all the other stuff\nthat exchange actually puts in here.\n\n250\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.970\nAnd lets you do.\n\n251\n00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.240\nYou also wanna make sure that you\ncheck on some of those particular\n\n252\n00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.900\nattributes as well.\n\n253\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.380\nNow you'll notice something, Zach.\n\n254\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.060\nI don't have all the other things\nthat I'm talking about, okay?\n\n255\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.200\nSo what do I do then?\n\n256\n00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.280\nWell, normally you're probably not running\nthen an Active Directory exchange.\n\n257\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.280\nYou probably don't have to worry about it.\n\n258\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.150\nBut lets say that you are.\n\n259\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.320\nSo here, if you're not seeing it for\none reason or another and\n\n260\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.990\nyou still have Exchange turned on.\n\n261\n00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.120\nIt should show up, just should be there.\n\n262\n00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.850\nBut if it's not.\n\n263\n00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.760\nUnder active directory users and\ncomputers, and view.\n\n264\n00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.300\nYou select view.\n\n265\n00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.980\nYou can come down here to where\nit says Advanced Features.\n\n266\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.410\nIf I select Advanced Features,\n\n267\n00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.780\nnotice that that populated a lot\nmore different objects here, now.\n\n268\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.400\nAnd now if go back into Production,\nlike what we saw, and\n\n269\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.330\nI select Taylor's object again.\n\n270\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.480\nOops, let me see here.\n\n271\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.850\nOop, did I not do that?\n\n272\n00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.460\nI didn't select advanced options.\n\n273\n00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.960\nThere we go.\n\n274\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.630\nLet's see, it should be.\n\n275\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.420\nAnd now if I select Taylor's\noptions I should have.\n\n276\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.353\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie what additional features and\nfunctions are we looking for here?\n\n277\n00:15:26.353 --> 00:15:29.880\n&gt;&gt; When it comes down to it, Exchange\nactually adds in some different things.\n\n278\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.750\nSo it's going to expand the schema and\n\n279\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.390\nwhat we're really looking at is\nthe idea of additional attributes.\n\n280\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.900\nSo let me show you where we can go and\nsee that.\n\n281\n00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.360\nSo if I select active directory users and\ncomputers.\n\n282\n00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.950\nRemember that if you already\nhave an Exchange account,\n\n283\n00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.050\nthey're going to be built-in, okay?\n\n284\n00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.060\nSo if I select Taylor's account in here,\nokay?\n\n285\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.040\nThese are pretty much\nthe default properties.\n\n286\n00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.950\nAll these tabs that you see up\nhere at the top, these are normal.\n\n287\n00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.230\nIf you have Exchange built in or\n\n288\n00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.890\nyou've added it in,\nyou'll see that this is expanded.\n\n289\n00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.630\nIn other words, they've changed it so they\ncan add in additional features right here,\n\n290\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.760\nand you'll see a bunch of different\ntabs also added in here as well.\n\n291\n00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.710\nNow, you'll see that,\nwith this actually not being there,\n\n292\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.560\nI'm probably not running Exchange,\nwhich I'm not running Exchange.\n\n293\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.843\nBut if you have to be running Exchange and\nyou're still not seeing them, okay?\n\n294\n00:16:19.843 --> 00:16:22.441\nOr if you're actually like me,\nyou're not running Exchange and\n\n295\n00:16:22.441 --> 00:16:25.550\nyou're not seeing them,\nthat's because they're hidden.\n\n296\n00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.300\nThe way to get around that hiddenness\nhere, let me close out of that.\n\n297\n00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.540\nIs up here in the upper left-hand corner,\nif I select view, and\n\n298\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.600\nthen I go down to where it\nsays Advanced Features, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.560\nNow, once I get Advanced Features,\nyou now see over the left hand side\n\n300\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.710\nthat's populated with more objects,\nor containers down here.\n\n301\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.420\nWhat we're gonna look at,\nagain, is Production.\n\n302\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.690\nThen I'm going to select Taylor's account,\nagain.\n\n303\n00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.630\nAnd now notice there's actually\nadded in a different row.\n\n304\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.930\nJust about, right,\nthere were three rows before.\n\n305\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.250\nNow you see four rows of tabs here,\nand the one that I'm looking for\n\n306\n00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.420\nis attribute editor.\n\n307\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.690\nIf I select attribute editor which will\nbring it to the forefront, there are a few\n\n308\n00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.470\nof these things that we want to actually\nverify and take a look at as well.\n\n309\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.450\nSo, let me kind of move that over so\n\n310\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:22.080\nwe don't have to kind of full\nscreen all the way out again.\n\n311\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.570\nSo, if I do this, one of the things that\nI want to look for is a proxy address.\n\n312\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.761\nSo I can scroll down toward the Ps here.\n\n313\n00:17:33.203 --> 00:17:37.050\nAnd if I select proxyAddresses right here,\nokay?\n\n314\n00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:42.950\nI wanna make sure, first and foremost,\nthat I do not have any duplicates, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.990\nThat are actually in the proxy\naddress that's here.\n\n316\n00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.850\nSo if I have a proxy address,\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n317\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.210\nI don't have one set here.\n\n318\n00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:55.472\nBut if I do, it should be absolutely,\n100% unique.\n\n319\n00:17:55.472 --> 00:17:59.650\nThere should not be any duplicate\nvalues in the proxy addresses at all.\n\n320\n00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:03.940\nSo that's what you want to\nverify in terms of doing that.\n\n321\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.020\nAnd if you actually do need to edit that,\nall you select is Edit and then whatever\n\n322\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.250\nthe value is, if it's right here, you\nclick on that value that's a duplicate and\n\n323\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.250\nyou select remove and then that's\nwhat you would also do there, okay.\n\n324\n00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.160\nSo that helps to ensure that\nyou're not going to get some\n\n325\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.810\nduplicate value up in Office 365 as well.\n\n326\n00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:27.990\nThe other thing that you also want is to\nensure that every user that's going to end\n\n327\n00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.990\nup getting assigned an Office 365 service,\nokay.\n\n328\n00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:37.030\nAlso has a unique user principal name.\n\n329\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:42.040\nSo if I scroll down to the bottom here,\nI also wanna verify that,\n\n330\n00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.350\nthat is proper and that Taylor is the only\none that's gonna be using this name, okay?\n\n331\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.524\nNow, this is where it comes down\nto your naming convention, right,\n\n332\n00:18:51.524 --> 00:18:55.371\nin our organization, relatively small,\nI just listed everybody's first name.\n\n333\n00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:58.810\nBut if we end up hiring another Taylor,\nwell now I'd be in trouble.\n\n334\n00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.910\nPut Taylor1 I guess or\nstart actually adding in what I need to.\n\n335\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.660\nBut overall though, just kind of realize\nthat you may actually want to come up with\n\n336\n00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.390\na better naming scheme than I did.\n\n337\n00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.198\nEspecially if your organization\nis continuing to grow, okay.\n\n338\n00:19:11.198 --> 00:19:15.960\nSo that's gonna be a very important\nbecause this is pretty much how we will\n\n339\n00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:21.700\nlogin through Office 365 is using\nthe userPrincipalName as well, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:27.046\nThe other unique value that we\nalso want is to verify that\n\n341\n00:19:27.046 --> 00:19:32.288\nwe have what we call the same\naccount name as well okay.\n\n342\n00:19:32.288 --> 00:19:35.956\nThis should also be a unique value too,\nokay, so\n\n343\n00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:41.242\nthat should not be repeated anywhere\nelse inside of my organization.\n\n344\n00:19:41.242 --> 00:19:43.706\nNow as I I'm doing this one\nat a time you're saying,\n\n345\n00:19:43.706 --> 00:19:46.805\nRonnie there's got to be\nan easier way to do this okay?\n\n346\n00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:50.670\nThere does, I'm not gonna do it right now,\nbut it's called PowerShell, okay?\n\n347\n00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's really\n\n348\n00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:52.935\nthe easier way to do this, right?\n\n349\n00:19:52.935 --> 00:19:55.678\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna ask you, up till now\nwe've been doing everything in the GUI,\n\n350\n00:19:55.678 --> 00:19:58.385\nare we gonna be doing any\nof this in PowerShell?\n\n351\n00:19:58.385 --> 00:20:00.465\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, in your organization, yes.\n\n352\n00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.295\nOkay there's no doubt, okay?\n\n353\n00:20:02.295 --> 00:20:06.385\nThat if you have a list of 50 or\n60 people, 100 people,\n\n354\n00:20:06.385 --> 00:20:11.407\n400 people, or 1000 people I should say,\n4,000 people, doing\n\n355\n00:20:11.407 --> 00:20:16.285\nit in PowerShell is what will give you\nthat ability to contrast and compare them.\n\n356\n00:20:16.285 --> 00:20:19.345\nIn the organization that I'm\ndoing especially right now right?\n\n357\n00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:20.805\nEven in our own.\n\n358\n00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:25.045\nIt's still relatively small enough\nthat I remember everybody's name.\n\n359\n00:20:25.045 --> 00:20:27.115\nBecause I'm the one that\nactually put it in there.\n\n360\n00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:28.495\nSo I'm not so worried about it.\n\n361\n00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.925\nAnd for us,\nespecially getting ready for the exam,\n\n362\n00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:34.535\nit's more important that you understand\nthe attributes that have to be unique,\n\n363\n00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:38.115\nrather than me showing you that you\nhave skill in PowerShell to do this.\n\n364\n00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:42.475\nBut yes, you could actually do a find,\nand you could do a GIT attribute, and\n\n365\n00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:44.715\nbe able to actually pull\nup this information and\n\n366\n00:20:44.715 --> 00:20:48.197\nfind what you actually need to as well,\nto do that.\n\n367\n00:20:48.197 --> 00:20:51.275\nBut just realize yes, it can be done and\n\n368\n00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:54.085\nthat's what you'd probably do if\nyou're really having to compare.\n\n369\n00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:58.065\nWhen you know that you have multiple\npeople that are named exactly the same,\n\n370\n00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.955\nthat's probably the easier\nway to go about doing it.\n\n371\n00:20:59.955 --> 00:21:02.625\nAnd that way you'll get a list of them and\nthen you go, ooh look at that,\n\n372\n00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.055\nthat same account name.\n\n373\n00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:04.625\nMore than likely,\n\n374\n00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:07.835\nif you created the accounts it's not\ngonna let you duplicate them anyways.\n\n375\n00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:08.495\nSomebody will tell you,\n\n376\n00:21:08.495 --> 00:21:11.655\nyou've already used this name before,\nnow pick another one.\n\n377\n00:21:11.655 --> 00:21:15.135\nSo normally, it tries to be very good,\nand keep them and not duplicate.\n\n378\n00:21:15.135 --> 00:21:17.915\nBut just in case it shows up for\none reason or another.\n\n379\n00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:19.635\nOnce again, the same thing.\n\n380\n00:21:19.635 --> 00:21:22.545\nIf you do end up with duplicates here,\njust click on Edit,\n\n381\n00:21:22.545 --> 00:21:26.955\nremove the duplicate value if\nsomething else is up, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:26.955 --> 00:21:27.875\nAll right.\n\n383\n00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:32.135\nSo in that instance, in that set of all\nthe things that we're talking about and\n\n384\n00:21:32.135 --> 00:21:33.545\ndoing, right?\n\n385\n00:21:33.545 --> 00:21:35.975\nWow, that's a lot when you\nhave to do it one at a time.\n\n386\n00:21:35.975 --> 00:21:36.785\nIt really is.\n\n387\n00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:38.225\nWhen you have to go back and\n\n388\n00:21:38.225 --> 00:21:42.875\ndo this one at a time,\nit does take a bit of time to do so.\n\n389\n00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:45.557\nIs there a tool that can help\nus out besides PowerShell?\n\n390\n00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:46.195\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n391\n00:21:46.195 --> 00:21:47.345\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there is, okay?\n\n392\n00:21:47.345 --> 00:21:50.604\nThe great thing is we already\ndid an entire episode on that.\n\n393\n00:21:50.604 --> 00:21:51.307\nBut just to show.\n&gt;&gt; Yes we did.\n\n394\n00:21:51.307 --> 00:21:53.948\n&gt;&gt; You the actual tool here, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:53.948 --> 00:21:58.945\nIt's actually one that is called the,\nId Fix tool, okay?\n\n396\n00:21:58.945 --> 00:22:03.085\nSo, I like this description here, that\nit gives in this first paragraph, okay?\n\n397\n00:22:03.085 --> 00:22:07.005\nWhich really helps you because it's\nabout duplicate values, right?\n\n398\n00:22:07.005 --> 00:22:11.315\nIdFix identifies errors such as duplicates\nand formatting problems in your directory.\n\n399\n00:22:11.315 --> 00:22:15.135\nBefore your synchronize and\nnotice the key term here, right?\n\n400\n00:22:15.135 --> 00:22:17.565\nBefore, you synchronize.\n\n401\n00:22:17.565 --> 00:22:18.855\nDon't do this after you synchronize.\n\n402\n00:22:18.855 --> 00:22:20.805\nBefore you synchronize it, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:20.805 --> 00:22:23.575\nTo finish this task successfully,\nyou should be comfortable in working with\n\n404\n00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:26.882\nusers, groups, and\ncontact objects in Active Directory, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:30.065\nSo, this is kind of neat here.\n\n406\n00:22:30.065 --> 00:22:33.845\nThe other one let me see here,\nthere was actually something,\n\n407\n00:22:33.845 --> 00:22:36.465\nalright right here if I remember.\n\n408\n00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:41.535\nWhat do you need to run IdFix?\n\n409\n00:22:41.535 --> 00:22:43.025\nThe easiest way to get IdFix up and\n\n410\n00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:45.655\nrunning is to install on a computer\nyou joined to the domain.\n\n411\n00:22:45.655 --> 00:22:48.105\nYou can run on domain controller two,\nbut it's not necessary, so\n\n412\n00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:50.165\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n413\n00:22:50.165 --> 00:22:53.425\nBut there was a, I don't know,\nthere was some that made me, there it is.\n\n414\n00:22:53.425 --> 00:22:55.965\nI was gonna say, that's not\nthe line that I was looking for.\n\n415\n00:22:55.965 --> 00:22:56.535\nIt's right here.\n\n416\n00:22:56.535 --> 00:22:57.825\nThis is the line.\n\n417\n00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:01.775\nCan you run the directory\nsynchronization without IdFix, okay?\n\n418\n00:23:01.775 --> 00:23:05.085\nSo even if you go through manually and\nyou think I've got it all, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:09.925\nThey still recommend that you go back and\nuse IdFix to run this, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:13.443\nYou can synchronize your active\ndirectory without running IdFix.\n\n421\n00:23:13.443 --> 00:23:14.685\nWe don't recommend it, okay?\n\n422\n00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:17.675\nSo they're pretty much saying, you can,\nbut, remember, this is gonna try and\n\n423\n00:23:17.675 --> 00:23:19.475\npick up on everything here.\n\n424\n00:23:19.475 --> 00:23:21.827\nFinding errors before you\nsynchronize takes less time,\n\n425\n00:23:21.827 --> 00:23:24.135\nprovides a smoother\ntransition to the Cloud.\n\n426\n00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:25.585\nAnd that's what you want.\n\n427\n00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:26.935\nAlso, go back in the episode.\n\n428\n00:23:26.935 --> 00:23:30.045\nWe'll talk about the requirements as well,\nto make sure you know this.\n\n429\n00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:32.915\nThis particular number has also changed,\ntoo.\n\n430\n00:23:32.915 --> 00:23:36.965\nIf I remember right, this actually\nchanged, I think to ten gigs of free\n\n431\n00:23:36.965 --> 00:23:40.554\nspace, because active directories\nare just getting larger.\n\n432\n00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:43.461\nAnd the attributes for\nthem are getting larger as well.\n\n433\n00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:45.954\nDon't forget also .NET frameworks.\n\n434\n00:23:45.954 --> 00:23:48.449\nYou name it, so you can go do that.\n\n435\n00:23:48.449 --> 00:23:50.550\nAnd then it has a link for your download.\n\n436\n00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.885\nWhen you download it,\nyou actually downloaded it here.\n\n437\n00:23:52.885 --> 00:23:56.655\nIdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool.\n\n438\n00:23:56.655 --> 00:23:59.527\nInstall that onto your\nparticular computer.\n\n439\n00:23:59.527 --> 00:24:03.055\nSo, I am running it\nright here on this one.\n\n440\n00:24:05.045 --> 00:24:07.195\nLet's see,\nwhere did I end up putting that?\n\n441\n00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:09.735\nUnder Downloads?\n\n442\n00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:11.035\nYep, there it is.\n\n443\n00:24:11.035 --> 00:24:13.435\nSo I unzipped it, and there it is.\n\n444\n00:24:13.435 --> 00:24:15.132\nAnd all I had to do is double click on it.\n\n445\n00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:19.535\nNow, there it is.\n\n446\n00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:21.395\nIt's really neat isn't it?\n\n447\n00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:24.235\nIt looks great if i select query.\n\n448\n00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:25.855\nNow I run it, and it says.\n\n449\n00:24:25.855 --> 00:24:28.535\nIt actually has a.\n\n450\n00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:31.925\nException occurred in the application,\nclick continue.\n\n451\n00:24:31.925 --> 00:24:32.975\nLet's go ahead and continue.\n\n452\n00:24:32.975 --> 00:24:35.475\nLet's see what else it does for us, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:35.475 --> 00:24:39.226\nSo there you can see where it\nactually did query 78 objects.\n\n454\n00:24:39.226 --> 00:24:40.530\nIt found no errors, which is good.\n\n455\n00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.965\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if it did find an error,\n\n456\n00:24:42.965 --> 00:24:46.975\nyou'll see that they will be\nlisted across here in a row.\n\n457\n00:24:46.975 --> 00:24:50.215\nAnd it will even give you an action\nthat you can do a little dropdown.\n\n458\n00:24:50.215 --> 00:24:53.195\nOf how to fix it or\nwhat the next steps are gonna be for\n\n459\n00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:54.935\nyou to fix it again, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:54.935 --> 00:25:00.115\nSo, don't think that there's not tools\nout there to help you to do this and\n\n461\n00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:05.545\nto get it right, but the planning of\nit is really a most important step.\n\n462\n00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:10.015\nIt's easy to say,\nI just can charge at this and get it done.\n\n463\n00:25:10.015 --> 00:25:13.961\nBut when you charge at it and\nyou don't plan for it, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.795\nYou don't know what errors you're\nexpecting to see at that point.\n\n465\n00:25:17.795 --> 00:25:20.965\nAnd that may slow you down\nmore than you realize.\n\n466\n00:25:20.965 --> 00:25:23.475\nBy taking a few moments, right?\n\n467\n00:25:23.475 --> 00:25:26.965\nAnd understanding what you should\nactually see in terms of errors and\n\n468\n00:25:26.965 --> 00:25:29.695\nwhat you shouldn't,\nis going to help you, right?\n\n469\n00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:33.475\nEliminating as much of those as you can\nbefore the synchronization, makes for\n\n470\n00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:36.715\nthat synchronization happen\nmuch more smoothly, and\n\n471\n00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:40.675\nit takes less time which makes you more\nefficient and makes your company up and\n\n472\n00:25:40.675 --> 00:25:42.965\nrunning with more productivity as well.\n\n473\n00:25:42.965 --> 00:25:46.575\nSo think about those aspects as\nyou continue to move forward\n\n474\n00:25:46.575 --> 00:25:49.095\nin terms of actually thinking about,\nof course,\n\n475\n00:25:49.095 --> 00:25:53.915\nthe idea of synchronizing to your\nActive Directory to Office 365.\n\n476\n00:25:53.915 --> 00:25:55.725\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job as usual, Ronnie.\n\n477\n00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:56.645\nThanks so very much.\n\n478\n00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:58.905\nDo you want to add anything\nelse before we move on?\n\n479\n00:25:58.905 --> 00:25:59.425\nNot really.\n\n480\n00:25:59.425 --> 00:25:59.935\nRight now.\n\n481\n00:25:59.935 --> 00:26:01.625\nRemember, we've just\ntalked about the planning.\n\n482\n00:26:01.625 --> 00:26:03.845\nWe are in the next\ncouple of episodes here.\n\n483\n00:26:03.845 --> 00:26:04.915\nGoing to see, of course,\n\n484\n00:26:04.915 --> 00:26:09.945\nabout the idea of synchronizing\neverything up into our active direct and\n\n485\n00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:15.125\ninto our Azure active directory as well\nand start to get that process down.\n\n486\n00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:18.265\nAnd we'll talk about some of the process\nthat we've also done here as well just as\n\n487\n00:26:18.265 --> 00:26:19.785\na reminder and review.\n\n488\n00:26:19.785 --> 00:26:21.955\nTo help the south and\n\n489\n00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:25.425\nunderstand the concepts of what's exactly\nhappening during the synchronization.\n\n490\n00:26:25.425 --> 00:26:29.301\nBut this is the foundation, planning\nit out because in your Active Directory\n\n491\n00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:33.491\nenvironment, unlike mine that's only been\naround for a couple of weeks, right?\n\n492\n00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:37.084\nYour's may have been around for years and\nthere may be so many more objects,\n\n493\n00:26:37.084 --> 00:26:39.005\nthat you haven't even considered yet.\n\n494\n00:26:39.005 --> 00:26:43.915\nMake sure you take time to review those\nand look at the principles of cleaning\n\n495\n00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:46.625\nout your Active Directory\nbefore the synchronization.\n\n496\n00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:47.355\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n497\n00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:49.545\nThank you so much, Ronnie,\nalways a great job.\n\n498\n00:26:49.545 --> 00:26:54.435\nRepair, AD synchronization Office 365\nparts one and two, see both of those.\n\n499\n00:26:54.435 --> 00:26:57.535\nSee, everything in\nRonnie's Office 365 series.\n\n500\n00:26:57.535 --> 00:27:00.465\nIt will help you and it's awesome and\nthen also look the course library.\n\n501\n00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:04.705\nThere's hundreds of videos there, they're\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n502\n00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:08.105\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nIT Pro TV because they'll be glad you did.\n\n503\n00:27:08.105 --> 00:27:08.865\nThanks for

00:00:07.918\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:11.718\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.800\nHelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.372\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:23.580\nThis episode today is plan for\nfiltering Active Directory.\n\n9\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.860\nAnd our IT pro wizard, and\nof course, wizard of Office 365,\n\n10\n00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.740\nRonnie Wong is here to help us out.\n\n11\n00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.080\nRonnie, good to have you, thanks.\n\n12\n00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, for\n\n13\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.810\nhaving me back on the show as\nwe continue on with Office 365.\n\n14\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.117\nAnd we are continuing on in our\ntopic as we're preparing now for\n\n15\n00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:44.993\nthe idea of making sure that our current\nActive Directory that we have on\n\n16\n00:00:44.993 --> 00:00:49.868\npremises is going to integrate, and\nbe able to function along with what\n\n17\n00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:53.471\nwe have in Azure AD on\nthe Office 365 side, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:57.956\nSo in previous episodes, ones that we\nhave, if you're watching in order,\n\n19\n00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:00.549\nthe ones that appear\nright before this one,\n\n20\n00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.952\nyou did see where we started to tell you.\n\n21\n00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:06.316\nHere are some of the things\nthat you want to consider as,\n\n22\n00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:10.184\nwhen you're preparing to do this\ntype of synchronization, and\n\n23\n00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:13.880\nwe went through a lot of\ninformation in those episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.785\nJust trying to make sure we covered\nthe basis and thinking about some of those\n\n25\n00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:21.937\ndifferent things including and of course\ncleaning up Active Directory as well as\n\n26\n00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:25.678\nusing the Active Directory or\nthe Azure Active Directory Connect tool.\n\n27\n00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:29.859\nSome of those things are actually right\nthere are really helpful in everything\n\n28\n00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.440\nthat we are doing, but Zach,\n\n29\n00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.771\nis right we are turning into this other\ntopic which is still along that same vein.\n\n30\n00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.593\nWhere we are now talking about of course,\n\n31\n00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:42.230\nplanning for\nfiltering of Active Directory.\n\n32\n00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.190\nNow that sounds a little bit complex, but\n\n33\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.110\nit's something we definitely\nneed to dive into.\n\n34\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.795\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, why do we need to\nfilter our on-premise directory or\n\n35\n00:01:49.795 --> 00:01:51.373\nActive Directory rather?\n\n36\n00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:55.265\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, because as we start talking\nabout this idea of synchronization and\n\n37\n00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.845\nwe're going to realize something, okay?\n\n38\n00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:01.695\nNot everything is going to work the way\nthat we want to just saying, all right,\n\n39\n00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:05.075\nlet's just run tools and\nsee what happens, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:08.620\nThe better way of course\nis careful planning, okay?\n\n41\n00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.700\nCareful preparation, right?\n\n42\n00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.700\nSo there's an added cheer in the United\nStates that you hear all the time.\n\n43\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.520\nPoor planning and\n\n44\n00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.330\npoor execution on your part doesn't\nconstitute an emergency on my part.\n\n45\n00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.930\nSo in other words, when you are doing\nsomething like this as relatively complex,\n\n46\n00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.840\nthe poor planning that you do\ntends to lead to poor execution.\n\n47\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.380\nAnd then the results of that\ntend to actually lead you to\n\n48\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.520\nerrors that you don't\nunderstand why they happened?\n\n49\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.750\nAnd then,\na lot more errors that end up occurring.\n\n50\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.637\nAnd then, when you call a consultant in or\nyou call somebody to help you,\n\n51\n00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:51.973\nyou kind of realize something that they're\nnot as concerned about it as you are at\n\n52\n00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:52.706\nthat point.\n\n53\n00:02:52.706 --> 00:02:56.404\nAnd that means they're not gonna treat it\nas an emergency like you might treat it as\n\n54\n00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:57.660\nan emergency.\n\n55\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.346\nAnd so what we want to do\nis we wanna take this time\n\n56\n00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:05.503\nas you are learning more\nabout how to do this, right?\n\n57\n00:03:05.503 --> 00:03:10.379\nHow to actually get everything connected\nup the way you want to begin to actually\n\n58\n00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.488\nrealize, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:16.800\nThat the better preparation and the better\nplanning that we do is gonna help us out.\n\n60\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.920\nAnd when those planning phases\nout at the very end, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.990\nInclude have you prepared everything and\nyou go like, I think I'm ready to go.\n\n62\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.260\nYou also now need to look\nat your Active Directory.\n\n63\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.040\nAnd then, you have to begin to\nrealize that there are gonna be some\n\n64\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.660\nobjects inside of Active Directory that\nyou may not want to bring in, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.100\nIdeally though if you can\nthe most seamless experience for\n\n66\n00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.634\nthe end user that you can have is if\nyou can bring everything over, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:52.643\n100% everything over into\nActive Directory that you want to and\n\n68\n00:03:52.643 --> 00:03:58.020\nAzure Active Directory that makes a little\nbit of a longer synchronization time.\n\n69\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.310\nBut it essentially helps\nas much as we can, right?\n\n70\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.260\nTo have the duplicate environment\ninside of Azure Active Directory\n\n71\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.360\nas we have inside of our\non-premises Active Directory.\n\n72\n00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.030\nNow that doesn't meant hat's gonna\nwork 100% in the same way, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.070\nThere's some other things that's gonna go\ninto the background that's really gonna\n\n74\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.040\nchange, but in the end the end\nuser experience is gonna be 100%\n\n75\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.550\nbetter if we can actually do\nsomething like this instead.\n\n76\n00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.735\nBut in reality, right?\n\n77\n00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:30.421\nWe may find out something like some of\nthe things that we find out over time with\n\n78\n00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:31.959\nActive Directory here, Zach.\n\n79\n00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:38.100\nOkay, is there's a couple of different\nadministrative styles that we have, right?\n\n80\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.380\nSo let me kinda give you an example and\nthis will I hope help you as well, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.480\nSo in a regular Active Directory network,\n\n82\n00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.340\nZach, if we continue to have people\non board and come into our network.\n\n83\n00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.110\nWe add a user account, I mean, they\nkind of appear on the list, make sense?\n\n84\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.700\n&gt;&gt; It does make sense, yeah, absolutely.\n\n85\n00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so when another instance happens,\na user leaves, okay, so\n\n86\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.590\nwhen a user leaves you might think that if\nyou don't have a lot of experience with\n\n87\n00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.200\nActive Directory That you\nsimply just right-click and\n\n88\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.400\ndelete that user out of\nthe Active Directory, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.580\nBecause they no longer in the account,\nright?\n\n90\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.272\n&gt;&gt; Unless it's a bunch of\ndependencies that might be stuck-\n\n91\n00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:14.821\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n92\n00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.680\nthere might be stuff like that.\n\n93\n00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.650\nThere are things that could break if\nyou actually believe them right up.\n\n94\n00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.860\nSo good catch there, Zach.\n\n95\n00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.800\nBut in the end right,\nwhat we normally do when you start\n\n96\n00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.540\ngetting a little bit more experience\nis you don't delete their account out,\n\n97\n00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.210\nbut you simply just mark it and\ndisable their account.\n\n98\n00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.910\nSo if there are emails\nthat are still coming in,\n\n99\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.210\nif there are certain I don't\nknow why you would do this.\n\n100\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.920\nBut let's just say for\ninstance here, there are certain\n\n101\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.970\ndependencies on that account having\nto run in the background for\n\n102\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.998\nsome reason you actually ended up using it\nas a service account or something, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:48.505\nIf it's still actually doing that, well,\n\n104\n00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:52.370\nthe easiest way to find out is\nby just letting it go, right?\n\n105\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.920\nSo in other words if\nyou're doing that right,\n\n106\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.410\nyou don't want to delete it out\ncuz it could break something.\n\n107\n00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.703\nSo we tend to kind of disable it, and\nsome people then disable it for 30 days,\n\n108\n00:06:01.703 --> 00:06:03.217\ndisable it from 90 days.\n\n109\n00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:06.380\nAnd then end up just kind of\ngoing not after 90 days, no,\n\n110\n00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.920\ndon't look like that there's\nanything going wrong here.\n\n111\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.940\nLet's go ahead and delete them out.\n\n112\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.446\nThen, there are of course, after you start\nrealizing something about your company,\n\n113\n00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:19.655\nand some of the legalities that are there,\nyou might go look,\n\n114\n00:06:19.655 --> 00:06:23.684\nlet's just disable them and move them\ninto another OU or another container.\n\n115\n00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:26.196\nThat's just the disabled accounts instead,\nand\n\n116\n00:06:26.196 --> 00:06:30.334\nthat way they're out of what you see in\nyour regular Active Directory structure.\n\n117\n00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:34.540\nBut they're inside of that one container,\nout of sight, out of mind, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.810\nWell, if I bring 100% everything\nover into Active Directory Azure\n\n119\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.690\nwhich is in the cloud, 100%, Zack.\n\n120\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.488\nIt also means I'm also carrying over what,\nthose disabled accounts.\n\n121\n00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:48.290\n&gt;&gt; Those disabled accounts, right.\n\n122\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.900\n&gt;&gt; And why would I carry over disabled\naccounts into the Azure Active Directory?\n\n123\n00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.154\nIt doesn't seem to actually make sense.\n\n124\n00:06:56.154 --> 00:07:00.180\nAzure Active Directory, what we really\nwant over there are essentially the active\n\n125\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.110\naccounts instead, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.950\nSo we don't tend to want to see so\n\n127\n00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.280\nmuch of the idea of service\naccounts too much, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.490\nSo in that instance we may choose to\nfilter our Active Directory to say,\n\n129\n00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.030\nlook, let's not bring\nover service accounts.\n\n130\n00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.640\nI'm still gonna have my\nActive Directory on-premises here.\n\n131\n00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.560\nLet's leave those alone and not worry\nabout carrying those over as well.\n\n132\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.790\nOther OUs that right now attributes\nbased types of objects, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.700\nThese are some of the ones that we may\ngo all right, we don't have to bring\n\n134\n00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.030\nthose over cuz they're not really active\naccounts they're not gonna hurt anything.\n\n135\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.570\nBut why would we carry those over?\n\n136\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.820\nIt doesn't seem logical to do\nsomething like that, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.020\nSo you may actually use something\nlike the filtering to help you out.\n\n138\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.969\nWe also talked in earlier episodes\nabout us setting up a pilot.\n\n139\n00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:53.852\nNow, if I said all right,\nhere Zack, I want us to try and\n\n140\n00:07:53.852 --> 00:07:57.502\ndo this Active Directory synchronization,\nokay?\n\n141\n00:07:57.502 --> 00:08:00.777\nBut what if my Active Directory\nhas 4,000 users in it?\n\n142\n00:08:00.777 --> 00:08:06.965\nWell, if I say bring over everything,\nmy pilot now, instead of being 25 or\n\n143\n00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:11.362\n60 people,\nbecomes 4,000 people right away.\n\n144\n00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:13.520\nAnd that may not be something I want.\n\n145\n00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.730\nSo the idea of planning and\n\n146\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.550\nfiltering, now, only the users that we\nwant may actually be helpful to us,\n\n147\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:25.210\nto not bring everybody and everything over\nat one particular point in time, okay.\n\n148\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.840\nThe other thing that I also mentioned,\nright, some compliance issues.\n\n149\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.253\nSome legal issues that may exist\nwhere you're not actually supposed to\n\n150\n00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:36.635\ntake those things from where\nthey reside inside of your\n\n151\n00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:40.916\nprotected network to being stored\non a cloud service as well, okay.\n\n152\n00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.370\nAnd this normally,\nif you're doing something like this,\n\n153\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.974\nprobably happens a lot of times\nespecially with those legal and\n\n154\n00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:48.297\ncompliance issues if your\ncompany is publicly traded.\n\n155\n00:08:48.297 --> 00:08:49.581\nYou gotta be careful there.\n\n156\n00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:54.091\nHealth care issues, especially here in the\nUnited States, you gotta be careful there\n\n157\n00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:58.260\nin terms of information, how that also\nspreads out across networks, as well.\n\n158\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.600\nAnd even payment card industries types\nof companies may find out that they\n\n159\n00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.540\ncan't keep certain information\nthe way that they want to.\n\n160\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.320\nNow, all of that's about data.\n\n161\n00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.260\nBut what if users are responsible for\nthis?\n\n162\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.878\nCan their particular accounts also\nbe in the cloud as well as here\n\n163\n00:09:13.878 --> 00:09:15.260\non-premises, as well?\n\n164\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.863\nSo you gotta actually figure all that out.\n\n165\n00:09:16.863 --> 00:09:22.123\nSo take a look at your local compliance\nthat you also have to be able to do, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:22.123 --> 00:09:24.307\nThe other thing that\nyou may also run into.\n\n167\n00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:27.982\nSo I'm just giving you a whole litany\nof different things that you may also\n\n168\n00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:29.120\nconsider.\n\n169\n00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.790\nLet's say that in your network,\nthough, you have multiple domains.\n\n170\n00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.082\nBut you're really not wanting both of\nthose domains, or all four of those\n\n171\n00:09:37.082 --> 00:09:40.977\ndomains, or whatever they are, to actually\nbe synchronized up to Active Directory.\n\n172\n00:09:40.977 --> 00:09:42.770\nBut what if you only want one?\n\n173\n00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.650\nWell, filtering it out is\nthe way that we do that so\n\n174\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:53.250\nthat we don't send information into\nAzure Active Directory that we don't want.\n\n175\n00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.090\nSo when it comes down to kind of\nthe baseline of everything, right,\n\n176\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.830\nultimately what it actually\nturns out to be is simple.\n\n177\n00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.470\nWe really only want to send over,\nin terms of synchronization,\n\n178\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.995\nthat which we want inside of\nAzure Active Directory, okay.\n\n179\n00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.250\nSo remember that this is\nwhere the extreme is.\n\n180\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.535\nAnd how you figure this out and\nhow you want to do it,\n\n181\n00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:17.880\nit's not controlled in any way.\n\n182\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.140\nIn other words, there's not exactly\none way that's better than the other,\n\n183\n00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.000\nbut it depends on what you want to do,\nokay.\n\n184\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.080\nIn theory and best practice,\nMicrosoft or Office365 says,\n\n185\n00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.850\nlook, only really synchronize those\nactive accounts that you want.\n\n186\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.740\nThat's what they recommend.\n\n187\n00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.490\nBut in reality, right, if you're doing\nthis and this is your first time doing it,\n\n188\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.185\nsynchronizing everything over is\nthe easiest thing in the world to do.\n\n189\n00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:44.083\nYou've got everything prepared,\n\n190\n00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:47.697\nit takes you a little bit longer\ntime in synchronizing everything.\n\n191\n00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.657\nBut in the end though, okay,\nit is gonna give at least those\n\n192\n00:10:50.657 --> 00:10:54.746\nusers that are migrating over, right,\nthat's actually getting changed over,\n\n193\n00:10:54.746 --> 00:10:57.533\nprobably the best possible\nexperience that they have,\n\n194\n00:10:57.533 --> 00:11:01.890\nor at least an equivalent experience than\nthe on-premises that they've had, okay.\n\n195\n00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.420\nBut when you start filtering stuff out and\nif you forget something, okay,\n\n196\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.290\nit can be a little bit tricky\nto find exactly what you forgot.\n\n197\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.416\nOkay, but at the same time,\nit also make for\n\n198\n00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:14.160\nmore of a burden in the very fact that\nyou're not synchronizing everything.\n\n199\n00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.110\nSo any problems that already\nexist in the Active Directory\n\n200\n00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.130\nare also gonna exist in\nAzure Active Directory, as well.\n\n201\n00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.050\nSo it is time and\nyou do have to plan for this.\n\n202\n00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.530\nI wish I could say there's just\na magic wand that we can wave.\n\n203\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.450\nBut we've shown you a couple of\nutilities that help you to clean up\n\n204\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.740\nActive Directory.\n\n205\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.910\nBut the idea of planning for this,\nright, takes a little bit more time and\n\n206\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.000\na little bit more effort to do so.\n\n207\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.320\nAnd it also requires us to use that tool\nthat we've really been talking about,\n\n208\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.130\neven though we haven't install it yet,\nthe Azure Active Directory Connect tool,\n\n209\n00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.340\nto help us out and\nto get everything set up, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.162\nSo those are really the reasons why we\nneed to synchronize when we start off,\n\n211\n00:11:55.162 --> 00:11:59.050\nand we start talking about this\nidea of trying to plan for\n\n212\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.070\nthis filtering of\nthe content that we have.\n\n213\n00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.141\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, how do we accomplish this,\nand what do we need to do it?\n\n214\n00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:08.641\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, what we really need,\n\n215\n00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:11.954\nso let's start off with the second part\ncuz that's the easiest thing, okay.\n\n216\n00:12:11.954 --> 00:12:16.365\nWe're gonna use the Azure Active\nDirectory Connect tool, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:19.905\nSo everything up to this point where\nwe've talked about preparing for\n\n218\n00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:24.105\nthe Connect tool, where we now are now\ntalking about filtering, right, it's not\n\n219\n00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:28.425\ninside of Active Directory we have to come\nup with some scripting or anything, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:34.132\nWe can use the Azure Active Directory\nConnect tool to essentially\n\n221\n00:12:34.132 --> 00:12:39.490\nhelp us to do this type of\nfiltering that we need, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.420\nThe other part behind this,\n\n223\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.020\nof course, is that you have to meet\njust a few requirements, as well.\n\n224\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.880\nFirst and foremost,\nthe hardware requirement.\n\n225\n00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.729\nExcuse me, it's still sounding strange in\nmy head as I say hardware requirements.\n\n226\n00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:59.264\nThe hardware requirements for installing\nthe Azure AD Connect tool, okay.\n\n227\n00:12:59.264 --> 00:13:03.060\nSo you've gotta make sure that your\nmachine is running at least that, okay.\n\n228\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.170\nIt can run on a domain controller,\n\n229\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.800\nit doesn't have to run\non a domain controller.\n\n230\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.520\nAs long as you have access to\nthe Active Directory, you're off and\n\n231\n00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.450\nyou're ready to go, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:18.000\nThe other thing that you have to do is,\nonce you get Azure Active Directory\n\n233\n00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.440\ninstalled, okay, it's going to go\nahead and create a scheduled task for\n\n234\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.300\nyou that is going to allow for the\nsynchronization of Azure Active Directory\n\n235\n00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.950\nand your on-premises directory to\nhappen just about every 30 minutes.\n\n236\n00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.200\nAnd we'll have to disable that,\nas well, okay.\n\n237\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.916\nThe other thing that you'll\nalso need is you'll need a user\n\n238\n00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:44.690\naccount inside of a specific group that\nAzure AD Connect is looking to have.\n\n239\n00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.954\nAnd if you don't have that particular\ngroup, and you don't have users in that\n\n240\n00:13:47.954 --> 00:13:50.829\ngroup, it's probably not gonna run\nthe way that you want to, okay.\n\n241\n00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:54.149\nSo let's take a look at each of\nthose steps at the beginning.\n\n242\n00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:59.116\nAnd then we'll talk a little bit more\nabout the way that the synchronization\n\n243\n00:13:59.116 --> 00:14:00.289\nis gonna happen.\n\n244\n00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:05.080\nOr not is gonna happen, but the filtering\nis gonna happen, because that's a little\n\n245\n00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.803\nbit kind of a mind-boggling trick\nin terms of some of the things.\n\n246\n00:14:08.803 --> 00:14:12.080\nAnd then we'll talk about, of course,\nthe options that we have available for us.\n\n247\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.779\nAll right, so\nlet me switch on over to my machine here.\n\n248\n00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:17.975\nAnd as I do this, let me log in.\n\n249\n00:14:19.972 --> 00:14:23.651\nNow, throughout the entire episode,\nyou've already seen me logged in.\n\n250\n00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:27.151\nAnd normally I've just been logged in\nas the actual network administrator.\n\n251\n00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:29.915\nNot really good practice,\nit just makes it easy for\n\n252\n00:14:29.915 --> 00:14:33.990\nme to show you the concepts\ninside of what we're doing, okay.\n\n253\n00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.426\nBut at this particular point,\nas we get started, okay,\n\n254\n00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:42.220\nwe need to go ahead to make sure that we\nhave the proper accounts that we have, and\n\n255\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.873\nthat they're actually part of a group\nthat Azure Active Directory Connect is\n\n256\n00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:49.265\nactually gonna be looking for, okay.\n\n257\n00:14:49.265 --> 00:14:55.963\nSo let me bring up here,\nThe Active Directory users and computers.\n\n258\n00:15:00.445 --> 00:15:05.420\nSo inside of the Active Directory\nusers and computers management\n\n259\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.743\nconsole, It's not actually\nan OU that I'm looking for\n\n260\n00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:13.460\nover here on the side,\nor another container.\n\n261\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.980\nBut if I go into the users group, and\nif I expand this out a little bit,\n\n262\n00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.670\nokay, here is the group that\nwe are looking for right here,\n\n263\n00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:31.640\nokay, the ADSyncAdmins,\nokay, ADSyncAdmins.\n\n264\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.131\nNow, if you're looking at your own\nActive Directory and you're going,\n\n265\n00:15:36.131 --> 00:15:40.709\nI don't see ADSyncAdmins, it means\nyou have to create that group, okay.\n\n266\n00:15:40.709 --> 00:15:47.724\nSo the AD Connect tool is gonna look for\nthis particular group here.\n\n267\n00:15:47.724 --> 00:15:52.562\nOnce you have this group, you're gonna\nadd in some user accounts to that group\n\n268\n00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:55.150\nthat's going to be used for this.\n\n269\n00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.255\nI'm gonna right-click on Properties,\nand then go to Members, and\n\n270\n00:15:59.255 --> 00:16:01.893\nyou'll see here are the two\nthat I added in.\n\n271\n00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:05.241\nThese were the accounts that we set up\nright at the beginning of our show.\n\n272\n00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:08.169\nSo I though, let's just put\nthese two in here right now.\n\n273\n00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:10.921\nNow, notice that my account isn't in here,\nZach, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:13.470\nBut you remember the principle\nthat I told you, right?\n\n275\n00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.278\nIf I am the one that's actually\nhelping another company do this and\n\n276\n00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:20.678\nI'm not responsible for\ndoing any of the rest of this here,\n\n277\n00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:23.810\nit doesn't make sense that\nI would be added in here.\n\n278\n00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.350\n&gt;&gt; You want the local admin to\ntake care of it after the fact.\n\n279\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.801\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, you want the global admin\nfrom the company to take care of it.\n\n280\n00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.928\nNot the one that set up the tenancy.\n\n281\n00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:34.930\nBut if you're one in the same,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n282\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.900\nBut I'm just trying to make sure\nthat we emphasize this is why\n\n283\n00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.150\nyou're seeing this, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.130\nSo I also did that, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.540\nSo I added them into that group, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:48.540\nNow once we do that, the other thing,\nof course, so that's actually good for\n\n287\n00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:54.530\nright now, is that we need to\ninstall the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n288\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.511\nNow we're gonna do this again when we\nget into the real synchronization part.\n\n289\n00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:00.567\nI'm not going to do it.\n\n290\n00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:04.641\nWe're gonna look this for the purpose\nof filtering is what we're gonna do.\n\n291\n00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:09.510\nBut it happens here, so\nI need to install that AD Connect tool.\n\n292\n00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:14.070\nSo let me see if I can remember where\nI actually put it, that would help.\n\n293\n00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.848\nAnd I believe it was in Downloads here.\n\n294\n00:17:15.848 --> 00:17:18.120\nWell, I'm lying to you.\n\n295\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.933\nSo it might still being\nin the Shared folder.\n\n296\n00:17:22.803 --> 00:17:25.636\nNope, it's not in\nthe Shared folder either.\n\n297\n00:17:25.636 --> 00:17:28.633\nSo let's see, I guess I'll have\nto go out and download it.\n\n298\n00:17:28.633 --> 00:17:30.551\nSo let's download it, once again.\n\n299\n00:17:37.804 --> 00:17:44.013\nAll right, so here, let's see,\n\n300\n00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:49.797\nazure active directory connect\n\n301\n00:17:49.797 --> 00:17:55.380\ntool download., all right.\n\n302\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.500\nThe azure active directory\nconnect tool download.\n\n303\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.280\nPress the arrow and there it is.\n\n304\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:10.642\nDownload the Microsoft Azure Active\nDirectory Connect Tool right there.\n\n305\n00:18:10.642 --> 00:18:13.220\nSelect Download, give it a moment.\n\n306\n00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:17.610\nAnd let me see if I can save this.\n\n307\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.630\nLet me make sure I know where\nI'm saving it, under Downloads.\n\n308\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.725\nIf not, that's why I end up losing it, cuz\nI never remember exactly where I save it.\n\n309\n00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:30.759\nSo not exactly a big\ngigantic whoop-de-doo there.\n\n310\n00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:38.919\nAll right, so in this particular directory\nnow, I want to run this installation here.\n\n311\n00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:44.260\nSo if I right-click, I can select\nInstall on the installation wizard.\n\n312\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.827\nAllow for the UAC to kick up.\n\n313\n00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:52.290\nAnd now it's gonna do something else here.\n\n314\n00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.330\nAnd this is where we want to be\na little bit careful as we begin this\n\n315\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.320\ninstallation part.\n\n316\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.520\nWe are gonna see something,\nit's gonna be a little bit more unusual.\n\n317\n00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.100\nThis particular tool\nover time has changed.\n\n318\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.970\nIt used to be called der sync and\nthen it was the AAD sync tool, and\n\n319\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.070\ntoday of course it's\nthe Azure AD Connect Tool.\n\n320\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.290\nIf you had watched the previous edition\nof this show that we're essentially\n\n321\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.790\nrefreshing at this point, right?\n\n322\n00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:28.250\nWhen I was doing this before,\nthis tool was not exactly yet out, okay?\n\n323\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.260\nSo it did look very similar,\nbut it wasn't yet out.\n\n324\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.080\nAnd they had no plans on when the actual\nfinal tool would be out at that point.\n\n325\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.635\nBut we ran through it as best as we could,\nbut this time we're gonna show you,\n\n326\n00:19:39.635 --> 00:19:41.400\nof course, what else you can do here.\n\n327\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.597\nSo Welcome to the Azure AD Connect.\n\n328\n00:19:43.597 --> 00:19:47.849\nRun this installation tool on the server\nwhere synchronization service component\n\n329\n00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:48.888\nwill be installed.\n\n330\n00:19:48.888 --> 00:19:53.472\nSo remember, Zach, what I said, you don't\nhave to actually be on this particular\n\n331\n00:19:53.472 --> 00:19:55.902\ntype of machine, this domain controller.\n\n332\n00:19:55.902 --> 00:19:58.643\nI just can be on a domain member.\n\n333\n00:19:58.643 --> 00:20:02.010\nDepending on the situation,\nokay, and the environment and\n\n334\n00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.631\nscenario that you're given, it doesn't\nnecessarily even need to be run inside of\n\n335\n00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:10.210\nan environment where you're\nactually a domain member either.\n\n336\n00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.000\nWhen you start talking about multiple\nforests and multiple domains.\n\n337\n00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.660\nBut at this point, let's just set for one.\n\n338\n00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.478\nSo let's say that this is my domain\nmember computer at this point too, okay?\n\n339\n00:20:21.478 --> 00:20:25.128\nThe unselection tool will guide\nyou in selecting a solution, okay?\n\n340\n00:20:25.128 --> 00:20:28.610\nFor example, password synchronization for\nfederation services,\n\n341\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.800\nwith Active Directory Federation Services,\nokay?\n\n342\n00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.965\nInstall identity synchronization other\nthan Microsoft software deployments.\n\n343\n00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:39.562\nVerify the integration of your on-premises\nand online directories, interesting.\n\n344\n00:20:39.562 --> 00:20:41.130\n&gt;&gt; Very good.\n&gt;&gt; How it actually does that, there we go.\n\n345\n00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.046\nAnd then, if I select Learn more,\n\n346\n00:20:43.046 --> 00:20:47.660\nit will even give me another webpage that\nI can go to and find out more information.\n\n347\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.890\nI really don't care about that, but\nI will just leave that one at the end.\n\n348\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.070\nI'm going to agree to the privacy terms.\n\n349\n00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.490\nNow this will never be on the exam, right?\n\n350\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:02.302\nBut yes, you should read these,\n[LAUGH] okay?\n\n351\n00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:05.776\nI know I don't, but yes, of course.\n\n352\n00:21:05.776 --> 00:21:09.351\nYou should read every single word\nof those as you select that and\n\n353\n00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.585\nunderstand what you're agreeing to.\n\n354\n00:21:11.585 --> 00:21:15.766\nBut Next here, and\nnow you have a couple of options, okay?\n\n355\n00:21:15.766 --> 00:21:20.572\nSo if you have a single Windows\nServer Active Directory forest, okay,\n\n356\n00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:22.342\nwe will do the following.\n\n357\n00:21:22.342 --> 00:21:26.790\nConfigure synchronization of\nidentities in the current AD forest of.\n\n358\n00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:31.198\nAnd notice, Zach, that it's already\ncustomized already for me for\n\n359\n00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:32.200\nmy own domain.\n\n360\n00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.646\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n&gt;&gt; So I didn't even have to type in\n\n361\n00:21:33.646 --> 00:21:34.621\nanything, right Zach?\n\n362\n00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:35.873\nI just kinda ran it.\n\n363\n00:21:35.873 --> 00:21:38.561\nAnd it was able to find what I wanted to.\n\n364\n00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:42.281\nConfigure synchronization password for\non-premises to Azure AD,\n\n365\n00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:44.275\nstart an initial synchronization.\n\n366\n00:21:44.275 --> 00:21:46.222\nAnd so we have that setting, but\n\n367\n00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:49.840\nnotice we also have this\nCustomized settings well, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.190\nRecommendation, okay, it's fairly simple.\n\n369\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.849\nIf you have only a single one,\nfollow the Express settings, okay?\n\n370\n00:21:58.849 --> 00:22:02.899\nIf you have multiple directories or\nyou have multiple forests,\n\n371\n00:22:02.899 --> 00:22:06.877\nyou are going to select this\noption during the install, okay?\n\n372\n00:22:06.877 --> 00:22:11.337\nThat's really the only reason why you\nwould probably end up selecting that\n\n373\n00:22:11.337 --> 00:22:15.520\nparticular option right here\nat this point in time, okay?\n\n374\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.825\nNow, can you change stuff?\n\n375\n00:22:16.825 --> 00:22:19.139\nWell, we'll talk about that in a moment.\n\n376\n00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:22.395\nBut overall, though, at this point,\nlet's just do this single one,\n\n377\n00:22:22.395 --> 00:22:24.315\nbecause that's pretty much what I have.\n\n378\n00:22:24.315 --> 00:22:27.003\nSo I'm gonna select\nUse Express Settings here.\n\n379\n00:22:27.003 --> 00:22:30.630\nAnd now it's gonna install\nthose required components.\n\n380\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:37.230\nAnd then notice it says, Enter your Azure\nDirector global administrator credentials.\n\n381\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.762\nSo this is good because I actually have\nthose particular credentials with me.\n\n382\n00:22:41.762 --> 00:22:45.218\nIf not, then I would have to get them.\n\n383\n00:22:48.557 --> 00:22:51.533\nThis is where I'm gonna have to\nuse that super secret password.\n\n384\n00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:54.889\nAnd I was just joking about this\nwhen I said, I gotta go back and\n\n385\n00:22:54.889 --> 00:22:57.613\nmake sure I have that super\nsecret password here.\n\n386\n00:23:03.725 --> 00:23:05.680\nAll right, so\nthis will actually test out and\n\n387\n00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.747\nverify if this is actually the password or\nnot.\n\n388\n00:23:07.747 --> 00:23:11.470\nI probably typed in it wrong,\ncuz it is pretty long and complex.\n\n389\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.720\nSo now notice that it's\nactually verifying,\n\n390\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.060\nconnecting, it's examining the domain.\n\n391\n00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.380\nAnd then, Enter the active directory\ndomain services enterprise administrator\n\n392\n00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.890\ncredentials at this point, okay?\n\n393\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.757\nNow, this is something I've gotta\nactually think about here for\n\n394\n00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:30.367\na moment because what if I don't know\nwhat those administrator credentials are?\n\n395\n00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:32.767\nWell, I can actually\nkind of hover over this.\n\n396\n00:23:32.767 --> 00:23:36.410\nIt says, Provide the credentials\nof the Enterprise Administrator.\n\n397\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.795\nCredentials are used to create local\nActive Directory accounts here.\n\n398\n00:23:39.795 --> 00:23:42.237\nSo this is actually trying\nto find out who owns this.\n\n399\n00:23:42.237 --> 00:23:48.627\nSo let's see what I can actually do to\nfind out if anybody is actually the dom.\n\n400\n00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:50.360\nIf not, I have to actually make one.\n\n401\n00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:58.812\nLet me go back to Users and Computers\nhere, and moment, and then, let's see.\n\n402\n00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:01.777\nEnterprise Administrators.\n\n403\n00:24:01.777 --> 00:24:05.660\nAnd the only one that's in it is\nactually administrator at this point,\n\n404\n00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.160\nbut we can add somebody in.\n\n405\n00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.250\nSo let's click Add.\n\n406\n00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.725\nAnd we'll make this one,\nwe'll make it, Don.\n\n407\n00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.285\nThere we go.\n\n408\n00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:27.780\nAll right.\n\n409\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.866\nBut then it would be\nITProTVdemo backslash don,\n\n410\n00:24:32.866 --> 00:24:37.090\nand then his particular password here.\n\n411\n00:24:42.796 --> 00:24:44.160\nAnd now there it is.\n\n412\n00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.819\nIt says, hey, once you click\ninstall we'll do the following.\n\n413\n00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.800\nWe'll install the synchronization engine.\n\n414\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.670\nSo it's actually building\na lot of information here.\n\n415\n00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.500\nWe'll configure the Active Directory\nconnector, okay?\n\n416\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.970\nWe'll configure the ITProTV\ndemo connector.\n\n417\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.600\nNotice there's actually two different\nconnectors here that we're seeing, right?\n\n418\n00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.440\nSo, the Azure AD connector to\nallow it to reach out to me.\n\n419\n00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.724\nAnd then my ITProTV demo connector to\nreach out to Azure and then the name and\n\n420\n00:25:10.724 --> 00:25:15.960\npassword synchronization, auto upgrading,\nas well as synchronization services here.\n\n421\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.789\nAnd it's gonna ask me if I want to\nstart the synchronization process when\n\n422\n00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:21.990\nthe configuration completes.\n\n423\n00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:25.496\nI do not want to start it right now cuz\nwe have shows that are coming up and\n\n424\n00:25:25.496 --> 00:25:28.123\nI don't want to synchronize\nit before those shows.\n\n425\n00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:31.510\nSo, I'm just going to uncheck that for\nnow.\n\n426\n00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:37.720\nAll right, verify down at the bottom,\nokay, synchronization will be disabled.\n\n427\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.370\nYour Active Directory force\nwill not be synchronized.\n\n428\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.220\nUntil synchronization is enabled, right?\n\n429\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.460\nSo, once I enable it then we can do that.\n\n430\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.509\nIf I Select Install and I want to do.\n\n431\n00:25:53.509 --> 00:25:56.764\nNow you actually notice\nduring this configuration,\n\n432\n00:25:56.764 --> 00:26:01.607\nit says Microsoft Server express SQL\nService being installed You end up finding\n\n433\n00:26:01.607 --> 00:26:04.840\nout depending on how big\nyour active directory is.\n\n434\n00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.430\nOkay, if it's relatively small like mine,\n\n435\n00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.306\nthe SQL express server will\nbe installed just fine.\n\n436\n00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:15.090\nIf it actually senses that there is\na large active directory there, you\n\n437\n00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:19.000\nmay end up finding out that it says, you\ndon't have all the proper requirements.\n\n438\n00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.366\nAnd that means you might\nactually have to go in and\n\n439\n00:26:21.366 --> 00:26:27.480\ninstall the actual SQL Server onto\nyour machine to make it work.\n\n440\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.037\nSo it all depends on how big the active\ndirectory is going to be, okay.\n\n441\n00:26:33.037 --> 00:26:34.826\nSo that is actually gonna be key for\n\n442\n00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:37.950\nus when we start to think\nabout this as well, okay.\n\n443\n00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.656\nNow Zach, I believe that there's\nactually a question in our chatroom that\n\n444\n00:26:42.656 --> 00:26:44.534\nwe need to take a look at here.\n\n445\n00:26:44.534 --> 00:26:48.054\n&gt;&gt; What Greg was saying is, do you make a\ngroup or is it standard out of the box for\n\n446\n00:26:48.054 --> 00:26:49.250\nWindows Server?\n\n447\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.080\nAnd then the next question is, so\nit's slash if you are using AD,\n\n448\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:00.135\nbut it's O365 if you use the at sign for\nuser names.\n\n449\n00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:03.530\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay, so yes Greg,\nthe idea is simple, right,\n\n450\n00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.530\nas you go to the Office 365 is\nalways going to be UPN name, right?\n\n451\n00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.990\nThe User Principal Name.\n\n452\n00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.410\nThat format is always going to follow.\n\n453\n00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:18.280\nFor most of us working in the on premises\nAD, we can use either one of them.\n\n454\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:20.150\nBut in this one, in the connect tool,\n\n455\n00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.470\nit gave us the example that we\nwere going to use in either case.\n\n456\n00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.140\nSo I would just follow\nthe example that it gives, and\n\n457\n00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.790\nthat way you're not gonna be confused\nabout which one that you have, okay?\n\n458\n00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.140\nNow do you make a group or\nis it standard out of the box?\n\n459\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.240\nYou've gotta make that group,\nI showed you on the synchronization group.\n\n460\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.710\nSo the AD Synch Group, you'll have to\nactually create that one on your own.\n\n461\n00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.680\nSo it's not gonna happen\nright out of the box here.\n\n462\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.370\nSo at this point, it's also connecting the\nhealth agent for synchronization as well.\n\n463\n00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.770\nSo when this thing finishes,\nwe should be ready to do a little bit,\n\n464\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.080\nof course,\nof the filtering that we need to do.\n\n465\n00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.140\nUsing the AD connect tool as well.\n\n466\n00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.142\n&gt;&gt; Configure domain base filtering.\n\n467\n00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:07.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we're gonna actually be\nconfiguring quite a few different ones.\n\n468\n00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:08.600\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But since you\n\n469\n00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.090\nhave brought it up Zach, okay.\n\n470\n00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.249\nAnd we've only got a few minutes left but\nlet's talk about some of the different\n\n471\n00:28:13.249 --> 00:28:15.763\nfiltering that we can do and\nmaybe by that point it'll finish.\n\n472\n00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:16.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds good.\n\n473\n00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.940\n&gt;&gt; And we'll be able to kind of do that,\nall right.\n\n474\n00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.150\nSo it looks like it's kind of-\nnope it's still going, okay, so\n\n475\n00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.050\nI thought maybe I'm done okay.\n\n476\n00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.720\nSo let's talk about some of\nthe filtering options here and\n\n477\n00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.580\nthen we'll also take a look and\nsee what we can do okay.\n\n478\n00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.250\nNow when we end up creating\nfiltering in the end result\n\n479\n00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.910\nthere's really gonna be four different\ntypes of filtering that we can do.\n\n480\n00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.180\nI added a fifth one here because it's\na combination of them that you can\n\n481\n00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.012\nactually do here.\n\n482\n00:28:42.012 --> 00:28:44.380\nOkay, when you start to take a look,\n\n483\n00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.320\nyou can actually do what we\ncall group based filtering.\n\n484\n00:28:48.325 --> 00:28:55.314\nGroup-based filtering allows me if I chose\nto, to filter out a single group only.\n\n485\n00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:56.844\nNow normally when we do this,\n\n486\n00:28:56.844 --> 00:29:00.310\nit's normally only on\nthe initial synchronization.\n\n487\n00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.400\nSo this particular one is probably not\nas useful as we think it's going to be\n\n488\n00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.830\non the future, but usually on the very\ninitial synchronization if we chose to,\n\n489\n00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.330\nwe could even do that, okay.\n\n490\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.170\nDomain base is like it sounds here we can\npick which domains we wanna synchronize.\n\n491\n00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.630\nAnd then later on we can actually add and\nremove if we want to\n\n492\n00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:24.530\ndifferent domains to make sure they\nactually do what we need as well.\n\n493\n00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.680\nNow just when I say that.\n\n494\n00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.748\nOn both of these, whether we're talking\nabout OU-based or domain-based,\n\n495\n00:29:31.748 --> 00:29:36.141\nthe recommendation is to just run\nthe installation process again.\n\n496\n00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.874\nAnd when it asks questions about doing\nthat and you select one to customize and\n\n497\n00:29:39.874 --> 00:29:42.720\nthat's where you go in and\nyou make the changes.\n\n498\n00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.660\nNow can you go in and\nmanually change that?\n\n499\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.120\nYes but\nyou're really doing the same thing.\n\n500\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.250\nYou're going back into customize and\n\n501\n00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.750\nyou're actually going to run\nthat in that way anyways.\n\n502\n00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.640\nSo a domain-based one sounds simple,\nagain, the whole domain.\n\n503\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.148\nFiltering out the ones you don't want\nversus the ones you do want to actually be\n\n504\n00:29:59.148 --> 00:30:00.542\nsynchronized as well, okay.\n\n505\n00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:05.209\nOU-based again is the same things select\nwhich OUs we actually synchronize as well\n\n506\n00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:09.460\nand then the last one here is\nprobably the one that's more complex.\n\n507\n00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.840\nNow all of them right,\nwe're just going to do one of these and\n\n508\n00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.152\nwe're not going to do both of these here.\n\n509\n00:30:14.152 --> 00:30:18.035\nAn attribute, an attribute- I\ndon't know why I can't say that.\n\n510\n00:30:18.035 --> 00:30:22.175\nBased filtering,\nattribute-based filtering,\n\n511\n00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:27.100\nthere are inbound filters\nthat we can go ahead and run.\n\n512\n00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:32.250\nAnd then there are outbound-based\nattributes that we can run as well, okay.\n\n513\n00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:36.110\nSo the use and the context of those and\nI'll mention it right here and\n\n514\n00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.210\nthen I'll mention them again\nas we come to that, okay?\n\n515\n00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.170\nIn terms of the Attribute-Based,\n\n516\n00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.890\nit is always recommended that you\nuse the Inbound Filtering, okay?\n\n517\n00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.230\nIf you're actually going to this level,\nokay?\n\n518\n00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.510\nIs easier to manage,\nyou don't have to think about as much.\n\n519\n00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.040\nThe time that you choose to\nuse Outbound-based though,\n\n520\n00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.200\nis when you do have multiple groups or\nmultiple domains.\n\n521\n00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.030\nInside of even multiple forests.\n\n522\n00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.830\nSo if you actually are running a multi\nforest, synchronization to a single\n\n523\n00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:10.350\nact of directory tenant\nattribute-based filtering, right,\n\n524\n00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.420\nif you're actually gonna do all that,\nokay.\n\n525\n00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:20.310\nWhere you have resources and of course\neven account groups that are there,\n\n526\n00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:24.660\nyou're probably gonna end up doing\nthe outbound-based instead, okay?\n\n527\n00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.580\nSo, that's what what else can happen.\n\n528\n00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.940\nAnd, of course, you can use any of\nthese in combination that you want to.\n\n529\n00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:33.830\nBut once we get to that,\nthat is probably a bit more complex, okay?\n\n530\n00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.820\nSo, it actually depends on the complexity\nlevel of your active directory before all\n\n531\n00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.640\nthat is actually done, okay?\n\n532\n00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.960\nSo right there, Zach, at this point.\n\n533\n00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.680\nThere we go.\n\n534\n00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:44.790\nHere's some of the stuff,\n\n535\n00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.490\nand we'll just review kind of the last\nthing before I hit Exit here.\n\n536\n00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.803\nAnd we'll call the show because\nit is pretty much down to our\n\n537\n00:31:51.803 --> 00:31:54.465\nfinal few minutes as we\ntake a look at this show.\n\n538\n00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:57.530\nSo here it is,\nthe configuration is complete.\n\n539\n00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.147\nOkay?\n\n540\n00:31:58.147 --> 00:32:02.874\nAzure AD Connect configuration, notice\nI have these kind of orangish bars or\n\n541\n00:32:02.874 --> 00:32:05.650\namber, I guess,\nif you want to call it that.\n\n542\n00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.608\nI call them orange, okay?\n\n543\n00:32:07.608 --> 00:32:10.609\nThe Active Directory Recycle Bin\nis not enabled for\n\n544\n00:32:10.609 --> 00:32:12.920\nyour forest, strongly recommended.\n\n545\n00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.200\nSo it's saying you might\nwanna turn this on.\n\n546\n00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.920\nSynchronization is currently disabled,\n\n547\n00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.850\nyour Active Directory forest will not be\nsynchronized until it's enabled, okay?\n\n548\n00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.420\nI'm not doing that on purpose, so I'm okay\nwith that which seems like an error, okay?\n\n549\n00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:30.413\nBut this one we can kind of configure and\nget that one fixed and ready to go.\n\n550\n00:32:30.413 --> 00:32:34.324\nTo sync your Windows 10 domain join\ncomputers to Azure AD as registered\n\n551\n00:32:34.324 --> 00:32:35.360\ndevices.\n\n552\n00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.200\nYou'll need to run all\nPowerShell's prompt.\n\n553\n00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.770\nNotice, initialize AD Domain Joined Sync\nComputers in the script module, okay?\n\n554\n00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.870\nADSyncPrep for ITProTV demo.\n\n555\n00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:55.510\nAzure Active Directory is\nconfigured to use AD attribute MS,\n\n556\n00:32:55.510 --> 00:33:01.360\nDS ConsistencyGuid, okay,\nas the source anchor attribute.\n\n557\n00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.100\nSo it already gives us this.\n\n558\n00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.550\nNow if there's anything that\nyou want to write down, okay?\n\n559\n00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.510\nBecause the rest of them seemed kind\nof steps that you'll be able to do,\n\n560\n00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.080\nis probably these last two right here,\nright?\n\n561\n00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.852\nSo if you're actually saying, hey, I'm not\ngonna join computers to Azure AD, well,\n\n562\n00:33:16.852 --> 00:33:18.279\nthat's up to you, okay?\n\n563\n00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:21.230\nBut if you are, make sure you write\nthis down and this command so\n\n564\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.680\nthat you can run that a little bit later.\n\n565\n00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.398\nAnd you also wanna make sure you keep\na track of this in terms of the AD\n\n566\n00:33:28.398 --> 00:33:34.780\nattribute, the MS-DS-ConsistencyGuid\nas the source anchor attribute.\n\n567\n00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.830\nYou'll probably end up using that later\non for something really important, okay?\n\n568\n00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.740\nAnd my particular record of remembering\nstuff that's really important\n\n569\n00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.440\nprobably not as soon as\nsome people's records are.\n\n570\n00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.160\nSo writing this stuff down is probably\ngonna be very helpful for use, okay?\n\n571\n00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.050\nSo Zach,\nin this particular episode, right?\n\n572\n00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.780\nI know there's a lot of talk, but\n\n573\n00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.640\nthere's a lot of concepts you\nhave to understand behind this.\n\n574\n00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.651\nAnd we still haven't even gotten to the\nfact that where does the filtering take\n\n575\n00:34:01.651 --> 00:34:05.630\nplace, and how is this actually gonna\nwork, and we still need to cover that.\n\n576\n00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.160\nAnd we still need to actually create\nsome of these different filters as well.\n\n577\n00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.370\nSo, Zach,\nthat's all gonna have to wait for\n\n578\n00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.270\nat least our part two here as\nwe continue to move forward.\n\n579\n00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.280\n&gt;&gt; And there will be a part two.\n\n580\n00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:15.890\nThank you, Ronnie.\n\n581\n00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:21.050\nGreat job as usual as we plan for\nfiltering Active Directory part two.\n\n582\n00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.390\nAnd this is part one.\n\n583\n00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:25.710\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 series\n\n584\n00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.560\nit's good for you.\n\n585\n00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.619\nAnd also visit our course library,\nhundreds of videos there.\n\n586\n00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:31.900\nAnd they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n587\n00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.430\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nITPro TV, they'll be very glad you did.\n\n588\n00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:37.090\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n589\n00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:37.802\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

00:00:08.300\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.044\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:15.650\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thank you for choosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.110\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Office 365, and\n\n7\n00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.100\nRonnie Wong is gonna\nhelp us as we plan for\n\n8\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.130\nfiltering Active Directory part two, make\nsure you see part one, very importante.\n\n9\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.180\nRonnie great to have you here,\nlet's keep going.\n\n10\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.810\n&gt;&gt; All right Zach, thank you for\nhaving me back as we\n\n11\n00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.328\ncontinue on taking a look at planning for\nfiltering Active Directory.\n\n12\n00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:39.500\nNow we are at this point\nwhere everything has kind of\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.780\nfinished installing on the active\ndirectory connect tool.\n\n14\n00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.403\nAnd we saw of course, there were a couple\nof other additional components that\n\n15\n00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:50.361\ninstalled, so even though it seems like\na small download, the installation of it,\n\n16\n00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.226\nof course, takes a little bit of time.\n\n17\n00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:54.680\nIt actually integrates very well,\nit does everything.\n\n18\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.595\nWe, on purpose, did not begin\nthe synchronization right away, because\n\n19\n00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:04.570\nwe wanna talk about this idea of filtering\nout some information that we want.\n\n20\n00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.500\nSo in the previous episode we\nshowed you of course even a list.\n\n21\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.772\nLet's go ahead and take a look at this\nagain on my screen, where we talked about\n\n22\n00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:15.410\nsome of the filtering options that\nyou will have available to you.\n\n23\n00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.022\nGroup based, Domain-based,\nOU Based, Attribute-Based and\n\n24\n00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:21.989\nthen you can do a combination\nof these to help you out.\n\n25\n00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.444\nAnd we're gonna kind of go through,\nI'm gonna say all of them, okay,\n\n26\n00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:26.575\nthe majority of them.\n\n27\n00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.310\nAttribute-based is gonna\nbe a little bit trickier so\n\n28\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.180\nwe might kind of see what we can do there.\n\n29\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.670\nBut overall though, okay, we can actually\ndo one or we can do all of them.\n\n30\n00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.920\nThe group based is probably the one,\nat this point here,\n\n31\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.333\nthat you're only gonna do during\nthe initial synchronization part, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.567\nBut that's pretty much the only\none that you'll probably end\n\n33\n00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:48.820\nup doing at that point.\n\n34\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.503\nSo that's not super useful,\nbut Domain-based OU based,\n\n35\n00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:55.819\nAttribute-based, these\nare all relatively common\n\n36\n00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.223\nin terms of the filtering\nof Active Directory, okay.\n\n37\n00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:04.165\nNow as we start to talk I've gotta kind\nof give you a visualization of what\n\n38\n00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:10.070\nactually happens here and why this\nis gonna be important as well, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.660\nNow, it's all about directionality of\ncertain things, right, when you start\n\n40\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.690\nto actually do the synchronization and\nthe filtering and where it happens, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.077\nSo when you start to actually\ndo this idea of synchronization,\n\n42\n00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:28.987\nof course,\nyou are just really synchronizing up down.\n\n43\n00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:33.858\nSo it's actually this, that's a terrible,\nthere we go, a little bit better,\n\n44\n00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:35.293\nnot exactly great here.\n\n45\n00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:39.437\nBut you're kind of doing that, right,\nyou're actually trying to make sure that\n\n46\n00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:43.779\nyou synchronize all the stuff between here\nand there and everything seems to be good.\n\n47\n00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:48.375\nBut when you add synch, or not synch, when\nyou add in filtering between I'm gonna\n\n48\n00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:51.105\nmess those two up I'm\ngonna guarantee you Zach,\n\n49\n00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:55.391\nthat's just in my mind now just like\nyour earworm was during the break here.\n\n50\n00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.932\nSo now, when you start adding in filtering\nto your On-Premises Active Directory,\n\n51\n00:03:00.932 --> 00:03:05.570\nwe already told you in the previous\nepisode that the goal is simple.\n\n52\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.740\nWe really only want what's\nup here to be up here,\n\n53\n00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.850\neverything else we want to filter out,\nokay.\n\n54\n00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.720\nBut there's a couple of ways that\nthese filters end up working.\n\n55\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.840\nAnd the way that it happens is right\nhere what we call this MetaVerse.\n\n56\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.447\nOkay, not versa I just can't spell\nthat's my particular fault there okay.\n\n57\n00:03:24.447 --> 00:03:29.214\nMetaVerse now that's not an actual\nphysical location in terms of some\n\n58\n00:03:29.214 --> 00:03:31.830\nplace out there on the planet.\n\n59\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.660\nIt's on the same server as your AD\nconnect tool is gonna as just an area,\n\n60\n00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.640\nokay, in which it takes all of your data\nand essentially crunches it up here, okay.\n\n61\n00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.970\nSo when you start hearing like especially\non the attribute cuz that's kinda\n\n62\n00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.630\neasiest example here, okay.\n\n63\n00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.850\nWhen you start taking a look\nat the idea of attribute based\n\n64\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.520\nfiltering of your active directory okay.\n\n65\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.701\nWhen you talk about the idea of inbound\nfiltering, what you may believe here,\n\n66\n00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:04.290\nright, is that,\nThis is Inbound Filter, okay.\n\n67\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.390\nWhere it's actually coming from what?\n\n68\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.510\nThe On-Premises to Azure Active Directory,\nso\n\n69\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.840\nyou're filtering Inbound from\nOn-Premises to Azure Active Directory.\n\n70\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.310\nTechnically, almost right, okay,\nreally, this is what you're doing.\n\n71\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.910\nYou're actually filtering it out and\n\n72\n00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.430\nthen what is left in\nthe MetaVerse up there, right.\n\n73\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.630\nIn other words, the filtered content,\nthat is what we'll actually get over to\n\n74\n00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.670\nthe Azure Active Directory at that point,\nokay.\n\n75\n00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.200\nSo this is essentially\na holding place that says\n\n76\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.510\nlet's make sure we got all\nthe filtering done that we need to.\n\n77\n00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.820\nAnd then when we're ready to synchronize,\nwe'll take this and\n\n78\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.540\nthen we'll filter it out that way, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.620\nSo, this is probably the easiest way to\nget things set up is doing the Inbound.\n\n80\n00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.130\nSo that means of course\nif there's Inbound,\n\n81\n00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.970\nthere also has to be an Outbound as well.\n\n82\n00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.330\nNow this is where it gets a little\nbit tricky, some people go all right,\n\n83\n00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.390\noutbound, what is that?\n\n84\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.092\nIs that actually going the opposite away,\n\n85\n00:05:05.092 --> 00:05:08.638\nAzure Active Directory back\nto the On-Premises then?\n\n86\n00:05:08.638 --> 00:05:13.010\nNope, okay, Outbound is when\nyou actually choose to filter\n\n87\n00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.780\nafter it comes in to that MetaVerse area,\nokay.\n\n88\n00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.790\nYou're not gonna get tested on this on\nthe exam, but at the same time, when you\n\n89\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.730\nactually think about, okay, you might be\nwondering why do they actually need that?\n\n90\n00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.543\nIt's still Inbound into\nAzure Active Directory no matter which way\n\n91\n00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:29.860\nyou go, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.638\nYou normally only need this Outbound,\n\n93\n00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:41.936\nis if I have, Multiple, so, number 2 here.\n\n94\n00:05:49.468 --> 00:05:56.800\nActive Directories or even forrest, okay,\nand I need to filter, but all of them.\n\n95\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.120\nThe problem that we have is right now, the\nway that our Azure AD tool is connected\n\n96\n00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.920\nup, right, is that I can get access to\none of them, but not to all of them okay.\n\n97\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.510\nBecause of the way that that\ntool ends up working, for\n\n98\n00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.470\nme to be able to do this type of filtering\nto happen between all of them and\n\n99\n00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.920\nfilter out only some of here only\nsome of there, only some of here.\n\n100\n00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.570\nWell, I can actually not to\ndo that before it gets where?\n\n101\n00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.770\nInto the MetaVerse here, okay.\n\n102\n00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.080\nI would actually have to filter it after\nI pull all the data that I want from\n\n103\n00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.770\nall of this into an area that essentially\nAzure AD Connect in the background, and\n\n104\n00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.620\nthe tools that are there available,\n\n105\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.930\nit is here that I can actually\nadd the filters in then.\n\n106\n00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.390\nAnd then it filters it Outbound instead.\n\n107\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.620\nSo that's really the only difference,\nif you tend to hear this and\n\n108\n00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.910\nyou're not understanding what's going on.\n\n109\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.720\nSo that's why you're actually\nseeing some of this.\n\n110\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.000\nNow normally we don't have to\nworry about it at all, right,\n\n111\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.500\nbecause even though this is how it\nactually happens with all of them,\n\n112\n00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.250\nInbound just says you're\nfiltering it where?\n\n113\n00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.900\nOn your own premises Active Directory\nanyways, or right there at that machine,\n\n114\n00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.650\nand then the MetaVerse, whatever's left\nof that is what goes directly here okay.\n\n115\n00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.510\nBut Outbound,\nyou gather all the data first and\n\n116\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.190\nthen you go through and filter it.\n\n117\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.090\nInstead of filtering out and then\nsending the data up to be synchronized.\n\n118\n00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.780\nSo it's really about that process and\nyou can see why one would actually work\n\n119\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.500\nbetter than the other depending\non the scenario that we have.\n\n120\n00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.438\nSo that will help you to\nplan a little bit more for\n\n121\n00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:32.925\nthe idea of multi-forest plans when\nyou start to have to do some of that.\n\n122\n00:07:32.925 --> 00:07:37.687\nNow, I wanted to make sure that we\ngot that in there because if not I'll\n\n123\n00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:41.659\nforget it and\nthen I'll probably never mention it again.\n\n124\n00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:45.019\nBut this is very important that we at\nleast understand the basic process and\n\n125\n00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:45.884\nthe terminology.\n\n126\n00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:50.500\nBecause we can't get a little bit kind\nof wiggy on your, if you don't, and\n\n127\n00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.521\nthat's a technical term Zach,\nthe term wiggy.\n\n128\n00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:56.931\nIt can get a little bit strange,\nright, if you're not exactly sure.\n\n129\n00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.850\nAnd reading about it doesn't help when\nyou don't have this concept in your mind\n\n130\n00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.794\na little bit more.\n\n131\n00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:03.387\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, I wake up wiggy.\n\n132\n00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:05.540\n&gt;&gt; Well I understand.\n\n133\n00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.723\nIt does happen sometimes, and\nas long as you don't have to deal\n\n134\n00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:11.378\nwith your metaverse you're\nprobably always fine.\n\n135\n00:08:11.378 --> 00:08:12.526\n&gt;&gt; That's true I say that too.\n\n136\n00:08:12.526 --> 00:08:14.415\nI said, as long as I don't have to\ndeal with that metaverse I'll be fine.\n\n137\n00:08:14.415 --> 00:08:16.559\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n138\n00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.386\nAll right let's see how we\ncan actually work this out.\n\n139\n00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:24.950\nLet's go back over to my machine,\nand we'll log in as Cherokee.\n\n140\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.847\nNow, why am I logging in\nas Cherokee at this point?\n\n141\n00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:32.560\nBecause she's a part of that sync admins\ngroup that we're looking for, okay?\n\n142\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.830\nThat sync AD admins group.\n\n143\n00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.517\nSo, she's a member of that,\n\n144\n00:08:36.517 --> 00:08:40.905\nthat is what allows me to be able to do\nsome of the stuff that I want to do, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:44.541\nSo from this point,\nI'm not really launching up the Azure AD\n\n146\n00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:49.318\nconnect again but one of those of those\nelements that it added in, as I showed you\n\n147\n00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:53.980\nkind of at the beginning, look it's\nadding in these other elements in here.\n\n148\n00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.112\nSo what I'm actually looking for,\nif I click on the Windows button, and\n\n149\n00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:01.635\nI scroll down I'm gonna actually\nhave to use the search here,\n\n150\n00:09:01.635 --> 00:09:05.860\nis I am looking for\nsomething called the synchronization.\n\n151\n00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.330\nThere it is, okay, notice it actually\nsays synchronization service.\n\n152\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.820\nSo that is the one that\nwe are looking for.\n\n153\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.410\nYou may also hear the term synchronization\nservice manager, I'm pointing that out for\n\n154\n00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:24.300\nthe exam, just in case you go, well,\nRonnie says synchronization service,\n\n155\n00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.170\nbut notice that even though\nit's listed that way,\n\n156\n00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.240\nyou can see right here where it says\nSynchronization Service Manager,\n\n157\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.210\nis actually what we end\nup seeing here instead.\n\n158\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.790\nSo know both of them, don't get fooled\nby one or the other as we get started.\n\n159\n00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.806\nSo now that I'm logged in as\none of the AD sync admins,\n\n160\n00:09:45.806 --> 00:09:51.602\nand I've launched up\nthe Synchronization Service Manager,\n\n161\n00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:56.856\nI need to go ahead and\nconnect into my Active Directory.\n\n162\n00:09:56.856 --> 00:09:58.430\nSo on this next row.\n\n163\n00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.380\nLet me see if I can zoom in up here\non the upper left-hand corner.\n\n164\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.118\nInside of that I'm going\nto select connectors and\n\n165\n00:10:06.118 --> 00:10:10.130\nnotice I have two different\nones that are right here.\n\n166\n00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.549\nThe Microsoft Azure Active Directory, and\n\n167\n00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:20.885\nthen there is of course\nthe Active Directory Domain Services.\n\n168\n00:10:20.885 --> 00:10:25.960\nThis is the one that I have for us on\npremises, was just about to say online.\n\n169\n00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.847\nBut this is the one that's actually\n[LAUGH] online up here at the top.\n\n170\n00:10:28.847 --> 00:10:34.959\nThough it is the ITProTv demo one\nthat I want to be able to adjust.\n\n171\n00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:39.048\nNow when I'm talking about the idea\nof filtering at this point,\n\n172\n00:10:39.048 --> 00:10:41.850\nwhat we're actually talking about right is\n\n173\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.181\nthe idea of us taking on-premise\nactive directory and doing this.\n\n174\n00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:50.867\nSo I'm gonna select the ITProTV demo,\nand let me see if I zoom back out just\n\n175\n00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:55.934\na little bit more, and see nothing's\nactually showing up underneath here, so\n\n176\n00:10:55.934 --> 00:11:01.650\nlet's make sure we kind of see the whole\nuniverse before I just zoom in on one.\n\n177\n00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.929\nSo we have Operations, Mediverse,\nlook, Mediverse Designer,\n\n178\n00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:09.563\nMediverse Search, okay,\nthat we have the ability to do.\n\n179\n00:11:09.563 --> 00:11:12.848\nOver here on the right-hand\nside is our action pane.\n\n180\n00:11:12.848 --> 00:11:17.215\nSo things that we can do, and then down\nhere at bottom essentially is gonna be\n\n181\n00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:19.685\nStatistical Information, that we have.\n\n182\n00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:23.387\nSynchronization errors that may appear\nas well as the connection status.\n\n183\n00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:29.182\nWell, let me just select this one, which\nis our on-premise, this one, ITProTv Demo,\n\n184\n00:11:29.182 --> 00:11:34.472\nand its status is idle, and I forgot to\nmention, this is the domain base folder.\n\n185\n00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:35.942\nThat was what I was trying to get to.\n\n186\n00:11:35.942 --> 00:11:37.390\nWe're talking about\ndomain-based filtering.\n\n187\n00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.490\nI'm selecting one, if I had multiple\nones they would be listed right here.\n\n188\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.710\nThen we are going to select\nproperties at this point.\n\n189\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.720\nSo now if I select, properties inside\nof the properties dialogue box\n\n190\n00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.695\nhere, I want to select\nconfigure directory partitions.\n\n191\n00:11:57.695 --> 00:12:01.558\nConfigure directory partitions.\n\n192\n00:12:01.558 --> 00:12:06.500\nIf you had multiple directories, they\nwould all be listed right here for you.\n\n193\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:13.410\nSo this gives you that ability\nto uncheck or to check so you\n\n194\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.170\nhave to use your imagination, cuz I only\nhave one active directory at this point.\n\n195\n00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.060\nSo if I wanted to filter out\none of them and not the other,\n\n196\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.350\nI would simply uncheck the one that\nI didn't want, and when I'm done\n\n197\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.620\nI need to hit the refresh button here, and\nnow it's asking me for the password and\n\n198\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.010\nthe user name, which I don't have, so\nI'm not gonna worry about refreshing it.\n\n199\n00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:40.555\nI don't know whose user name that is,\nbut [LAUGH] I really don't.\n\n200\n00:12:40.555 --> 00:12:44.019\nIt's a service account user name, so\nI'm not gonna worry about it right now.\n\n201\n00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:46.398\nBut that's what you would end up doing,\nis that you would refresh that,\n\n202\n00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:48.558\nand then you would have to provide\nyour particular credentials.\n\n203\n00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:51.979\nNow the only thing about those\ncredentials, if you go hey,\n\n204\n00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:55.545\nam I supposed to leave that there\nin terms of the credentials?\n\n205\n00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:57.350\nNot necessarily.\n\n206\n00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.485\nIn other words, you can wipe that out and\nit'd be perfectly fine.\n\n207\n00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:04.850\nAll you have to do is make sure\nthat as you add in username and\n\n208\n00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.833\ndomain credentials at this point,\nyou wanna ensure that whoever's\n\n209\n00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:13.657\ncredentials that you use have at least\nread-only access to the active directory.\n\n210\n00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:17.578\nThat's the only real minimum\nrequirement at this point,\n\n211\n00:13:17.578 --> 00:13:20.160\nis that they have read-only access.\n\n212\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.450\nSo you don't have to leave that there but\nI didn't, I don't have any more than one,\n\n213\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.820\nso I'm not gonna worry about\nchanging it at this point.\n\n214\n00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:33.030\nAll right, so once I've selected that,\nand now we've got our domain here,\n\n215\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.530\nand everything is pretty much verified,\nif I select another one, well,\n\n216\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.520\nthat's pretty much all we really have to\ndo at that point, and then I click OK.\n\n217\n00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.615\nSo if I've changed anything at that point,\nand I've refreshed it,\n\n218\n00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:47.910\nmade sure everything is updated the way\nthat we want, the next thing to do of\n\n219\n00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:53.540\ncourse is simply to run the actual\nfiltering process at this point,\n\n220\n00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.000\nand so if I select run, now,\nnotice it gives me profiles here, and\n\n221\n00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.490\nthese profiles essentially\nallow me to select what it\n\n222\n00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.970\nis that I want to do, full import,\nor full synchronization.\n\n223\n00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.210\nFull import, and probably is only\nthe very beginning time, where you say,\n\n224\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.070\nnothing over in Azure Active Directory\nis already existing out there.\n\n225\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.070\nLet me just go ahead and\nimport it up there right away.\n\n226\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:24.220\nFull synchronization is making sure\nthat both sides are fully synchronized,\n\n227\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.920\nmake sure that they match.\n\n228\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.200\nNotice this one though is at.\n\n229\n00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.390\nDelta Import and Delta Synchronization.\n\n230\n00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.881\nThis idea of the Delta,\nof course is changes only.\n\n231\n00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.915\nSo if you already done a full import,\nand you go,\n\n232\n00:14:40.915 --> 00:14:45.209\nI added in a few more people in my\nOn-Premises Active Directory, and\n\n233\n00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:49.058\nI still need to actually get\nthose up there, you don't have to\n\n234\n00:14:49.058 --> 00:14:54.100\ndo a full synchronization again,\nyou can actually instead just do what?\n\n235\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:59.210\nDo a delta instead, or a delta import,\nor a delta synchronization, and\n\n236\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:02.280\nthat will only take a look at what\nis different between them and\n\n237\n00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.850\nsynchronize those instead, and\n\n238\n00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.680\nthen of course there's exporting the data\nout to wherever you want to go as well.\n\n239\n00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.020\nSo that would, for us here on this run\nconnector, that'd be the same as the way\n\n240\n00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.470\nthat we would choose to be able to\nactually do that filtering as well.\n\n241\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.970\nSo once that's done,\nthere you go, and centrally we\n\n242\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.730\ndon't have anything synchronizing,\nso it's not gonna actually work.\n\n243\n00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.670\nSo we're right at this point here.\n\n244\n00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.900\nBut it shows you,\nthat if you were doing this, it would go.\n\n245\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.187\nNow at the bottom,\n\n246\n00:15:33.187 --> 00:15:38.673\nnotice you can see this Synchronization\nStatistics start to populate, right?\n\n247\n00:15:38.673 --> 00:15:44.565\nThere it is so running as Cherokee here\nwho is part of the AD Synchronization\n\n248\n00:15:44.565 --> 00:15:51.017\nwhich I'm not gonna say, and here I\nselected the Step Synchronization instead,\n\n249\n00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:55.525\nand of course date and time,\nand the correct partition.\n\n250\n00:15:55.525 --> 00:16:00.820\nIf you have all of that, then you can\nperform a domain type of filtering that\n\n251\n00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:07.300\nwill go on, that will allow you to do just\nsomething like that if you need to, okay?\n\n252\n00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.420\nSo that's kind of the basis there\nof how we can actually perform\n\n253\n00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.290\njust a regular synchronization of\na sort to help us to do that, okay?\n\n254\n00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.740\nSo remember that at this\nstage on a single one, right?\n\n255\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.380\nWhere we only have one\nactive directory domain,\n\n256\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.930\nwe don't really even have to do this,\nokay.\n\n257\n00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.990\nWe simply run the initial set up\non Azure AD connect, we uncheck or\n\n258\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.060\nwe actually verify and mark that we\nwant the synchronization to happen.\n\n259\n00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.910\nImmediately after it gets set up,\nand we are off and ready to go, and\n\n260\n00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.650\nwe'll begin that process.\n\n261\n00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.360\nNow, just when I did this, Zach,\nI realized I made a mistake, okay?\n\n262\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.128\nAnd let me kind of go, it's a great\nthing we're not synchronizing.\n\n263\n00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:49.315\n&gt;&gt; Live action debugging.\n\n264\n00:16:49.315 --> 00:16:50.440\n&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.\n\n265\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.330\n&gt;&gt; Moment.\n&gt;&gt; I made a mistake here, okay?\n\n266\n00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.950\nSo all that probably would've worked,\nokay,\n\n267\n00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:01.290\nexcept that remember that in the\nbackground when everything is done okay?\n\n268\n00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.682\nIf I go to the task scheduler that in\nthe task scheduler here somewhere.\n\n269\n00:17:12.475 --> 00:17:15.456\nThere normally is going to\nbe a scheduled task for\n\n270\n00:17:15.456 --> 00:17:19.604\nthe synchronization itself which\nI'm not gonna find right here for\n\n271\n00:17:19.604 --> 00:17:23.920\nright now cuz I don't know\nexactly where it's located okay?\n\n272\n00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.940\nBut we need to turn it off okay and so\nthe way to turn that off instead so\n\n273\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.670\nI'm not leading you down the wrong\npath that's what I don't want to do.\n\n274\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.530\nIs we are of course gonna run\nit in PowerShell instead.\n\n275\n00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:42.605\nSo let me select run and\nthen let me make sure that we can stop,\n\n276\n00:17:42.605 --> 00:17:45.264\nlet me change the size here.\n\n277\n00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:52.775\nSo we need to make sure that we turn off\nthis synchronization during this point as\n\n278\n00:17:52.775 --> 00:17:54.258\nwe start doing stuff here.\n\n279\n00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:02.310\nAll right, so now that's nice and big.\n\n280\n00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:08.250\nMake sure I get you the right\ncommand here before I move on.\n\n281\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.720\nSo this should have actually happened\nbefore what I just showed you, okay?\n\n282\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.650\nSo if you already have it syncing up,\nyou need to stop that\n\n283\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.900\nbecause this next particular time\nwould be 30 minutes from now.\n\n284\n00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.130\nAnd so once you've actually finished\nrunning that, then you can start again.\n\n285\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.229\nSo what we'll do is we do set-ad,\n\n286\n00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:32.105\nOops, Sync, it's taking a moment here.\n\n287\n00:18:32.105 --> 00:18:38.380\nADSyncScheduler, then\n\n288\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:46.170\ndo a Sync Cycle enabled.\n\n289\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:52.580\nAnd at this point to turn it off,\nwe would do enable, not enabled, false.\n\n290\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.143\nI'm gonna type in the wrong stuff.\n\n291\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.110\nNow if that were the only thing\nthat we're doing those at.\n\n292\n00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.510\nAnd we've done our domain.\n\n293\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.360\nWe've added the change that we want to.\n\n294\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.990\nNow, we would want to turn it back on.\n\n295\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.680\nWe would simply come back at the end.\n\n296\n00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.010\n&gt;&gt; True.\n&gt;&gt; And set up true.\n\n297\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.960\nOkay and that's what you want to do if\nyou're making these types of changes\n\n298\n00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.900\nto filter inside of your active directory.\n\n299\n00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.670\nSo do not forget that by default,\n\n300\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.090\nthis stuff is not actually set\nup as faults at the beginning.\n\n301\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.430\nWhen everything is actually installed with\nAzure AD Connect here, its default is\n\n302\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.600\ngonna be that it's enabled, which is true,\ncuz I want you to sync as soon as you can.\n\n303\n00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.990\nAnd then it's gonna check every 30 minutes\nand make that synchronization happen and\n\n304\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.250\npossible for what you want, okay?\n\n305\n00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.510\nSo if you are gonna make changes\nmake sure you changes to faults and\n\n306\n00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.540\nthen go back in and\nmake the changes that you want to, okay?\n\n307\n00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.050\nRun it, make sure everything is done at\nthe end, go back and turn it back on.\n\n308\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.350\nAll right Zach, so that is the idea\nof just basic domain filtering.\n\n309\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.660\nNow, of course sometimes you actually\nneed to go beyond this idea of just\n\n310\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.580\na domain, okay?\n\n311\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.550\nBut you can also change\nthe OU filtering as well.\n\n312\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.070\nNow the preferred method to doing\nthis is not to go through here\n\n313\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.300\neven though you can, okay.\n\n314\n00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.580\nThe preferred method to actually doing\nsomething like this instead is for\n\n315\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.240\nyou to just run the installation\nwizard again and\n\n316\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.240\nchange the options in the domain and\nthe OU filtering okay?\n\n317\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.710\nSo but what if we don't do it there, and\nwhatever we're ready here, and you go.\n\n318\n00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:42.680\nI don't want to run it again.\n\n319\n00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.580\nWell, that's the way they would\nprefer you do something, but\n\n320\n00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.790\nif you don't, here's what we'll\nactually end up doing again, okay?\n\n321\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:54.930\nSo let's make sure, once again, if I\nwas doing this for idea of OU filtering\n\n322\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.890\nI would select connectors once I launch\nthe synchronization service manager.\n\n323\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.400\nAnd then from that point, I would make\nsure that I select the right domain,\n\n324\n00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.250\nwhich is gonna be my ITProTV demo.\n\n325\n00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:13.580\nLet's go back into our properties\nagain over on the right-hand side or\n\n326\n00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.320\nthe action pane.\n\n327\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.380\nConfigure the domain,\nour that directory partitions once again,\n\n328\n00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.746\nit's a pretty much the same location so\nfar.\n\n329\n00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:26.430\nVerify that this is checked for\n\n330\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.630\nour correct directory partition and\nonce we have that,\n\n331\n00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:36.420\nthen down at the bottom here\nwhere it says containers.\n\n332\n00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.970\nSo let containers for this partition,\nthis is instead where you would go for\n\n333\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.160\nchanging and adding in the OUs okay?\n\n334\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.980\nOr modifying them.\n\n335\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.590\nSelect containers,\nat this point we would have to add in\n\n336\n00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.310\nsomeone that has read only access, so\nI'm gonna use Zach's name this time.\n\n337\n00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.430\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say use me.\n\n338\n00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:58.250\n&gt;&gt; So here we go yep.\n\n339\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.870\nHopefully he has read only.\n\n340\n00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.230\nWe'll see here.\n\n341\n00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.360\nLet's see what Zach actually has.\n\n342\n00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.660\nWe may not be able to do so, Zach.\n\n343\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.262\nI don't know if I actually\ngave you a read only here.\n\n344\n00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:09.872\nZach.\n\n345\n00:22:15.198 --> 00:22:19.458\n[NOISE] My mouse locked up there for\na moment.\n\n346\n00:22:19.458 --> 00:22:21.760\nA long time ago, I learned how to read,\nand when you do read,\n\n347\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.960\nyou read the black parts,\nnot the white parts.\n\n348\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.096\nThat's what I learned.\n\n349\n00:22:27.753 --> 00:22:31.381\n&gt;&gt; And the username can't contain any\nof the following characters, what?\n\n350\n00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:37.960\nSo it has to be just Zach.\n\n351\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.460\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n352\n00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.131\nOur analysis is locking up pretty good.\n\n353\n00:22:44.268 --> 00:22:45.720\nHere we go, okay.\n\n354\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.070\nSo with that you at least\nhave read only credentials.\n\n355\n00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.230\n&gt;&gt; I knew it.\n\n356\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.165\n&gt;&gt; Good, cuz I didn't.\n\n357\n00:22:51.165 --> 00:22:55.785\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] Zach has been playing\naround in my active directory and\n\n358\n00:22:55.785 --> 00:22:57.195\nnot even telling me.\n\n359\n00:22:57.195 --> 00:22:57.785\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n360\n00:22:57.785 --> 00:22:59.495\n&gt;&gt; Well there you go okay?\n\n361\n00:22:59.495 --> 00:23:03.015\nAll right so now that we have this\nright we are now ready to select\n\n362\n00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:06.325\nthe containers that we want or\ndon't want to be synced.\n\n363\n00:23:06.325 --> 00:23:10.335\nSo you have to kind of decide what's\nactually gonna happen at this point okay?\n\n364\n00:23:10.335 --> 00:23:15.435\nSo for this one here what we wanna do is\nwe wanna uncheck the ones that we do not\n\n365\n00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:17.050\nwant synced.\n\n366\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.000\nSo if I were doing this you would\nthen select the ones that you\n\n367\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.850\npossibly really don't\ncare about syncing up.\n\n368\n00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.490\nSo let's say for example Managed Service\nAccounts we might not want to sync\n\n369\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.550\nup here and, let's see,\ncomputers at this point.\n\n370\n00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.650\nNow if you are actually going\nto be managing your computers by\n\n371\n00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.230\nregistering them in Azure AD Sync.\n\n372\n00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.270\nYou are going to want those\ncomputers in there as well.\n\n373\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.720\nBut just kinda realize\nthat you may do that.\n\n374\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.810\nIf you’ve got your computers in your OUs,\nyou don’t have to worry about this.\n\n375\n00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.191\nBut let’s just say that for example.\n\n376\n00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:51.727\nSo I’ve made my changes\nthat I want here and\n\n377\n00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:55.964\nI’ve unchecked the ones that I really\ndo not want to sync at this point.\n\n378\n00:23:55.964 --> 00:23:57.862\nI click OK.\n\n379\n00:23:57.862 --> 00:24:01.150\nLet's take a look at the Advanced tab and\nsee if there's anything else.\n\n380\n00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.221\nSo here are we including?\n\n381\n00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.626\nSo yes, you can can see that, okay?\n\n382\n00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:10.269\nSo here it actually shows the ones\nthat I chose not to sync up.\n\n383\n00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:13.965\nComputers which is one that I did uncheck,\nLostAndFound, I think was already\n\n384\n00:24:13.965 --> 00:24:17.980\nunchecked for me and Managed Service\nAccounts, I chose not to check those.\n\n385\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.604\nSo that's just an example\nof what we can do.\n\n386\n00:24:20.604 --> 00:24:24.013\nAlso note I can add in another container,\nwhether to include or\n\n387\n00:24:24.013 --> 00:24:25.374\nto exclude this as well.\n\n388\n00:24:25.374 --> 00:24:26.275\nAll right, so\n\n389\n00:24:26.275 --> 00:24:30.940\nif you don't like using the check boxes\nit gives you the other way to do so.\n\n390\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.360\nLet's click OK.\n\n391\n00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.135\nAnd once I've actually selected that and\nwe now have that ready to go,\n\n392\n00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:40.637\nI'm gonna click OK again.\n\n393\n00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:50.730\nAnd then of course it means we have\nto run the actual profile instead.\n\n394\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.800\nSo unlike earlier where I selected Run,\nokay?\n\n395\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.300\nI may actually choose Run profile and\n\n396\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.680\nI think even the other one I could\nhave choose the Run profile as well.\n\n397\n00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.590\nSo here notice that it actually\nallows me to then change\n\n398\n00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.910\nif I select the Run profile.\n\n399\n00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.770\nLooks like I can even get,\nno I can't change it.\n\n400\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:12.500\nI was like, maybe I can change these,\nnope I can't change those as well, okay.\n\n401\n00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.100\nSo you can select the way that you\nwant to actually choose this one and\n\n402\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.900\nthen click OK.\n\n403\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.710\nAnd that will actually allow you\nto configure the Run profile and\n\n404\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.590\nthen run it here at the end.\n\n405\n00:25:26.454 --> 00:25:29.820\nAll right, click OK, and there you go.\n\n406\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.746\nThat would actually allow that\nrun to actually end up happening.\n\n407\n00:25:32.746 --> 00:25:37.594\nAnd from that point you are pretty much\nready to go in terms of OU based filtering\n\n408\n00:25:37.594 --> 00:25:38.690\nas well.\n\n409\n00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.200\nSo either way works.\n\n410\n00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.390\nYou're pretty much going\nto the same location and\n\n411\n00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.350\nyou're seeing the same aspects of it here.\n\n412\n00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.639\nSo far in this episode,\n\n413\n00:25:47.639 --> 00:25:51.254\nright, we've talked about quite\na few different things, okay?\n\n414\n00:25:51.254 --> 00:25:54.722\nIncluding kind of the basic\nconcept in how this lays out,\n\n415\n00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:57.940\nof how the synchronization\nends up working.\n\n416\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.480\nAnd then we also showed you some\nthings that should go on first.\n\n417\n00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.715\nOne, if you're going to be modifying it,\nmake sure you stop the scheduled sync.\n\n418\n00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:08.075\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm\n&gt;&gt; After you finish and\n\n419\n00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:08.642\nthat you are ready to go.\n\n420\n00:26:08.642 --> 00:26:09.572\n&gt;&gt; Once you get PoweShell [CROSSTALK].\n\n421\n00:26:09.572 --> 00:26:13.949\n&gt;&gt; Yep, make sure you run the steps\njust like what we've shown you,\n\n422\n00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:18.450\nwith the domain based, or\nthe OU based filtering here.\n\n423\n00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:21.340\nThen at this point, enable it all back and\n\n424\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.040\nit will start to actually do\nall the synchronization and\n\n425\n00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.650\nallow it to get back on that 30\nminute schedule as well, okay?\n\n426\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.290\nNow Zach, we still have to go over kind\nof the more difficult concept here,\n\n427\n00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.200\nwhich is going to be that\nattribute based filtering.\n\n428\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.010\nBut we really only have a few minutes\nleft, and I'd rather not get stuck in\n\n429\n00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:43.220\nthe middle of a process here as\nwe kind of have to end this show.\n\n430\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.820\nSo let's go ahead and say that and\nmove on to a part 3 or\n\n431\n00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.550\ntaking a look at attribute\nbased filtering.\n\n432\n00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.010\n&gt;&gt; And we're gonna do just that.\n\n433\n00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.574\nNow do you want to add anything\nbefore we move on though, Ronnie?\n\n434\n00:26:52.574 --> 00:26:56.828\n&gt;&gt; Well remember that when you start to do\nthis, right, the great thing is if you're\n\n435\n00:26:56.828 --> 00:27:00.730\ndoing this for real,\nI would do the same thing I just did here.\n\n436\n00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.370\nTake a look and verify what you can and\n\n437\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:07.450\nsee if it makes sense to\nyou to do all this, right?\n\n438\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.160\nIn the end result,\nMicrosoft's best practice is saying,\n\n439\n00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.710\nlook, if you can allow all of\nit to be done, let it be done.\n\n440\n00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.094\nBut if you are going to start doing\nthis or if you have multiforest,\n\n441\n00:27:19.094 --> 00:27:21.392\nmultidomains that you're doing this with,\n\n442\n00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:25.150\nyou'll have to do little bit more\ncustomization like were we're doing.\n\n443\n00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.882\nBut in the end on a single one let it run,\nlet it do it's job.\n\n444\n00:27:28.882 --> 00:27:29.799\nThat's fairly easy.\n\n445\n00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:32.867\nBut we'll actually end up seeing that\nprocess just like we said when we run\n\n446\n00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:35.555\nthrough the real process to get\neverything connected up there.\n\n447\n00:27:35.555 --> 00:27:40.330\nBut Zach we still do have to actually take\na look at that attribute based filtering.\n\n448\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.330\nMore complex in terms of\nthe steps that are there, but\n\n449\n00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.390\nyou'll see that it really\ndoes matter in the end.\n\n450\n00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.472\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie for\ndoing such a comprehensive job.\n\n451\n00:27:48.472 --> 00:27:50.880\nSo Plan for\nFiltering Active Directory Part 2.\n\n452\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.290\nThere was a part 1, there'll be a part 3.\n\n453\n00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.000\nSo watch them all.\n\n454\n00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.662\nIn fact, watch all the episodes of Office\n365 that Ronnie is preparing for you and\n\n455\n00:27:58.662 --> 00:27:59.918\nhas prepared for you.\n\n456\n00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:00.659\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n457\n00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:04.055\nAnd visit our course library,\nhundreds of videos there,\n\n458\n00:28:04.055 --> 00:28:06.211\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n459\n00:28:06.211

for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n7\n00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.240\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n8\n00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.410\nI'm your host, Zack Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.960\nPlan for\nfiltering Active Directory part three.\n\n10\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.940\nYes, there's a part one and two.\n\n11\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.180\nThis is part three.\n\n12\n00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.800\nAnd of course Ronnie Wong, our Office\n365 expert, is here to help us out.\n\n13\n00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.850\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n14\n00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.540\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Zach, once again for having\nme back on the show as we continue on with\n\n15\n00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.350\nplanning for filtering Active Directory.\n\n16\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.160\nIf you are now like, are you joking?\n\n17\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.190\nThere's more?\n\n18\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.820\nNo, I'm not.\n\n19\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.560\nThere is a little bit more for\nus to go and do.\n\n20\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.253\nBut you can see where\nthe granularity of this,\n\n21\n00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:51.090\nright, comes into play is when\nyou really do need to do it.\n\n22\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.436\nIf you don't need to do it,\nlet the Azure Active Directory connect\n\n23\n00:00:56.436 --> 00:01:01.220\ntool do it's thing,\ndon't think about it, just go do it.\n\n24\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.458\nI'm not gonna trouble you,\nI'm not gonna worry about it, but\n\n25\n00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.090\nthere are a lot of places for\nus to go, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.437\nSo that is what we're actually\ntaking a look at now.\n\n27\n00:01:09.437 --> 00:01:13.380\nNow we've really talked in\nprevious episode here, of course,\n\n28\n00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.030\nabout implementing domain based as well as\nOU based filtering in Active Directory.\n\n29\n00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.930\nAnd now we are moving into that realm of\nthe attribute based Active Directory.\n\n30\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.730\nNow Zack, if you kind of think about\nthe concept here, the domain is kind of\n\n31\n00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.450\nthe largest unit, okay, and then OU is\na small unit with inside of the domain.\n\n32\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.840\nAn attribute, though,\nis actually a smaller subset of anything\n\n33\n00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.620\nwithin even an object inside of an OU\nwhich is inside of a domain, okay.\n\n34\n00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.460\nSo attributes are essentially\nthe smaller individual unit\n\n35\n00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.810\nthat we can filter by\nif we choose to do so.\n\n36\n00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.100\nNow when you do something like this,\n\n37\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.830\nthis is where that metaverse idea\nthat we've been talking about\n\n38\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.722\nduring this whole time here, let me see if\nI can pull that up correctly here, okay.\n\n39\n00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:07.980\nWhere this metaverse idea actually\ncomes into play a little bit more.\n\n40\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.260\nSo let's make sure that we review here,\nokay.\n\n41\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.770\nSo on my screen we do have\nthe idea of this concept again.\n\n42\n00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.700\nAnd this is where we're actually\ngoing to see this more often, okay.\n\n43\n00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.450\nInside the attribute arena, you'll have to\nkinda choose and pick what you want to.\n\n44\n00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.140\nBut more than likely, in the actuary area,\n\n45\n00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.790\nthis is where you'll actually set\nup your inbound or outbound, okay.\n\n46\n00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.230\nOn the other one we really\ndon't have to worry about it so\n\n47\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.850\nmuch because pretty much\neverything is actually gonna be\n\n48\n00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.210\ninbound at that point cuz\nwe're just filtering that out.\n\n49\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.205\nBut if you happen to have to do this,\nthis is the way it's gonna be.\n\n50\n00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:45.091\nInbound and outbound rules pretty much\nline up with that idea of the attribute\n\n51\n00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.970\nbased filtering instead.\n\n52\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.320\nAnd that's kind of a key concept\nwhen we get into it, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.240\nNow, how do we actually get something\nlike the attribute based filtering done?\n\n54\n00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.360\nWell you would think that, hey,\n\n55\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200\nit actually worked on the synchronization\nmanager last time, that it will work in\n\n56\n00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.210\nthe synchronization manager this time\ntoo because OU and the domain one did.\n\n57\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.570\nWhy not here?\n\n58\n00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.840\nBecause this is different, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.870\nSo this time we're actually going to\nuse another different utility that was\n\n60\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.720\nonly installed when we also installed\nin the Azure AD connect tool.\n\n61\n00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.750\nSo let me click on the Windows button,\nand then up here at the top,\n\n62\n00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.050\nyou'll see the recently added.\n\n63\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.420\nI was probably a little\nimpatient last time.\n\n64\n00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.320\nHere's the tool that we're working\nwith with the previous filtering,\n\n65\n00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.030\nright, the Synchronization Service tool,\nokay.\n\n66\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.870\nThis time though we are going to select\nSynchronzation Rules Filter, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.350\nSo now if I select\nthe Synchronzation Rules filter,\n\n68\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.730\nyou can now see that there are already,\nokay,\n\n69\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.660\na ton of different rules that\nare actually here, okay.\n\n70\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.490\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, what is so\nspecial about this rules editor?\n\n71\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well,\nthat's a good question here.\n\n72\n00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.900\nThis rules editor allows us to be\nable to see some of these different\n\n73\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.010\nsynchronization rules that\nare also already in place.\n\n74\n00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.490\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about here, okay.\n\n75\n00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.330\nSo as I've launched this up, right,\nwe can of course see inbound and\n\n76\n00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.890\noutbound rules that are currently existing\ninside of these synchronization rules.\n\n77\n00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.810\nSo pretty much at this point the Azure AD\nConnect is gonna follow the rules that\n\n78\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.320\nare in place for both the inbound and\nthe outbound situation that we have.\n\n79\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.760\nI can use these objects up here for\nfiltering, okay, for what I need here.\n\n80\n00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.830\nMV stands for multiverse,\nnot multiverse, the metaverse.\n\n81\n00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.515\nMultiverse.\n\n82\n00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:40.986\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Metaverse object type.\n\n83\n00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:42.163\n&gt;&gt; That's comic book stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:45.469\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Metaverse object type that's actually\n\n85\n00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:46.500\nout there.\n\n86\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.360\nAnd then, there's our connector which\nessentially is our domain that we have.\n\n87\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.090\nWe can do all that,\n\n88\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.352\nwhere we can filter all this\ninformation out just to look at it.\n\n89\n00:04:54.352 --> 00:04:56.370\nAnd notice it actually just did that,\n\n90\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.400\nit took away the other one\nwhich is the on Microsoft.\n\n91\n00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.060\nSo notice that I can do all\nof them that I want, and\n\n92\n00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.240\nwe can select different attributes\nthat are available for us.\n\n93\n00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.910\nA particular person versus a device\nthat we have versus a group, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.330\nSo all these up here are filters.\n\n95\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.170\nBut if we want to create a new inbound\nfilter, okay, we're going to select,\n\n96\n00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.240\nwell this, which is a new rule.\n\n97\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.120\nSo if I select the new rule it will\nof course put up this dialog box.\n\n98\n00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.160\nTrying to get the whole thing on\nthe screen so that we can see it.\n\n99\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.590\nAnd at this point we're\ngonna create just a new one.\n\n100\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.491\nNow following the convention as\n\n101\n00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.671\nthe name, in from AD here.\n\n102\n00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:51.270\nYou're -user do\n\n103\n00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.880\nNot sync filter.\n\n104\n00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.930\nSo I don't want to sync,\nlet's say, a particular user here.\n\n105\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.807\nThe connected system will be ITProTV Demo.\n\n106\n00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:07.740\nThe system object type\nis gonna be a person.\n\n107\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.280\nI need to scroll all the way down, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.120\nNow when I select this, right, and\nI'm actually trying to line up\n\n109\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.862\nthe object types that exist in\nAzure AD is what I'm trying to do.\n\n110\n00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:20.050\nSo I'm gonna select person\n\n111\n00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.690\nin the system object type as well\nas in the metaverse object type.\n\n112\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.910\nSelect the same thing which is\ngoing to be person as well.\n\n113\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.890\nNow on the link type here,\nthis is the one that I got,\n\n114\n00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.060\nI want to make sure I select, join.\n\n115\n00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.240\nThere's actually three different\nones that are here, provision,\n\n116\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.650\nsticky join, and join.\n\n117\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.450\nYou might be wondering like\nwhat is all about that, okay.\n\n118\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.230\nProvisioning of course means create it,\nokay.\n\n119\n00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.020\nThe idea of join for us means run\na particular type of query against it\n\n120\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.754\nwhich is normally gonna\nbe an inter join here.\n\n121\n00:06:53.754 --> 00:06:55.650\nSticky join means, of course like it says,\n\n122\n00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.080\nmake it persist across\nwhatever else it needs to.\n\n123\n00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.300\nFor this one on the precedence here,\nI'm just gonna type\n\n124\n00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.560\nin 50 to give it a particular\norder of preference that we want.\n\n125\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.580\nSo when we do that it says if\nit's not actually used by another\n\n126\n00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.540\nsynchronization rule right now,\ngive it 50 and\n\n127\n00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.510\nthat will kind of put it right in\nthe middle of everything that it needs to.\n\n128\n00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.190\nSo yeah, if it's not set, set it to 50 and\n\n129\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.830\nthat will kind of put in the middle\nof everything else that we have.\n\n130\n00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:32.280\nIn the scoping options, this is where\nI can add in another attribute.\n\n131\n00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.058\nSo if I click Add Group,\nand then select Add Clause,\n\n132\n00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:40.650\nforgot that I wasn't zoomed in there.\n\n133\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.420\nNow I can click on this drop down, and\n\n134\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.130\nI can choose from any of\nthese that you see, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.600\nWhat if I have a custom one?\n\n136\n00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.820\nWell if I have a custom type of attribute,\nI'm gonna look for\n\n137\n00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.700\nsome exchange, let me see if I went down\ntoo far, it's actually the e's here,\n\n138\n00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.960\nextension attributes is what\nI'm looking for, whoops.\n\n139\n00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.989\nDid I scroll away here?\n\n140\n00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:07.780\nWhere are my extension attributes here?\n\n141\n00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.610\nDid I select the wrong one here?\n\n142\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.126\nIn scoping add group.\n\n143\n00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:16.880\nI did that.\n\n144\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.616\nAll right, we'll just pick something\nelse then since I don't see what\n\n145\n00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:25.954\nI'm hoping to see here which\nwas an extension attribute.\n\n146\n00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:31.108\nMaybe I'm not seeing, let's see.\n\n147\n00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:32.686\nWe have MSDS here.\n\n148\n00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:38.352\nWe'll just do this one.\n\n149\n00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.410\nI don't know,\nwe'll pick that one for right now.\n\n150\n00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.158\nThis is going to be equal to no sync.\n\n151\n00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:52.823\nNow that's probably not gonna\nwork because that's, but I don't\n\n152\n00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:56.740\nsee the actual attribute that I'm looking\nfor which is extension attribute 15.\n\n153\n00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.375\nSo I picked one, but\nit says MSDS cloud attribute instead.\n\n154\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.099\nIn the join I'm not gonna worry about it,\nwe're gonna leave it at default for\n\n155\n00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:12.220\nright now, and then click Next here.\n\n156\n00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:18.720\nAnd then the transformation, we're\ngonna add a transformation right here.\n\n157\n00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.289\nAnd on the flow type\nwe're going to select,\n\n158\n00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:28.274\nmake sure I'm telling you right on\nthe select here, Constant load type.\n\n159\n00:09:28.274 --> 00:09:32.550\nAnd the target attribute,\nit's gonna be cloud filtered.\n\n160\n00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.567\nAnd then the source here, true, okay.\n\n161\n00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:41.873\nSo this pretty much provides\nhow it's going to do things,\n\n162\n00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.552\nwhether it's constant or is it directed?\n\n163\n00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:46.930\nOr a direct one, or\nan expression of something here?\n\n164\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.840\nI'll just take a look and so\nsome other things with it.\n\n165\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.690\nWhere is that other attribute\ngoing to be and true?\n\n166\n00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.120\nThis is where we'll actually start seeing\nthe filtering, okay, of the information,\n\n167\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.280\nand it will follow these rules when it\nactually gets sent into the metaverse,\n\n168\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.820\nas well, all right.\n\n169\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.083\nNow once I've got that, I now click Add.\n\n170\n00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:19.730\n&gt;&gt; So what is this error all about,\nRonnie?\n\n171\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, so having looked at it, so\nhere's what goes on during a show, right,\n\n172\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.580\nBefore the show I normally practice\nby creating one of these rules.\n\n173\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.300\nAnd I created that rule already\nis what ended up happening.\n\n174\n00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.048\nSo now-\n&gt;&gt; Duplication.\n\n175\n00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:35.859\n&gt;&gt; Yep, I was duplicating it, but\n\n176\n00:10:35.859 --> 00:10:40.190\nthe real error in that is not that I\ncouldn't have created a duplicate rule.\n\n177\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.140\nThe real error that I had right there at\nthat particular point where it deadlocked\n\n178\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.880\nthe SQL server, okay,\nis instead the precedence number.\n\n179\n00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.730\nSo I chose precedence number 50, which I\nhad done previously before the episode.\n\n180\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.530\nAnd then I chose that\nagain on the episode, and\n\n181\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.060\nit said, I will not let you do that.\n\n182\n00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.826\nI simply changed that number over to 70 or\n75,\n\n183\n00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:07.240\njust trying to add a number in,\nand it did it.\n\n184\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.950\nAnd here's the end result here.\n\n185\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.230\nOkay, so we can look at the screen.\n\n186\n00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.020\nI wish I can go back and\nshow you this again, but it took it and\n\n187\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.990\nI was joking about it as we\nwere taking a look here, okay.\n\n188\n00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.060\nSo I simply changed the number\nof the precedence and\n\n189\n00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.560\nthen it actually added in\nwhat it wanted to in there.\n\n190\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.210\nAnd so now, let me see if I,\nno, go to groups here,\n\n191\n00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.140\npersons as well.\n\n192\n00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.520\nAnd you'll see,\nthere's a couple of them, okay.\n\n193\n00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.960\nSo earlier, before the show,\nhere's what I had actually created.\n\n194\n00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.950\nWhich is this, I selected\na different object type connector.\n\n195\n00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.360\nBut when I had the 50 and 50,\nit just didn't like that.\n\n196\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.160\n&gt;&gt; It didn't like that.\n&gt;&gt; It said no, yeah, yeah.\n\n197\n00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.760\nI'm seeing this as far as our precedence\nvalue goes, it shouldn't be that way.\n\n198\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.910\nNotice how each one of these numbers\nis independent and individual?\n\n199\n00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.140\nIt's saying you can't do that.\n\n200\n00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.090\nAnd that was my fault for\nnot even thinking about it, okay.\n\n201\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.940\nSo now it added in an error.\n\n202\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.660\nSo here's the one, I changed it,\n\n203\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.038\nI thought it's 75 I changed it to 70 and\nit simply added it in there, okay.\n\n204\n00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:16.810\nVery easily here, so there's what\nwe ended up seeing to add it, okay.\n\n205\n00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.495\nSo that's an inbound rule.\n\n206\n00:12:18.495 --> 00:12:22.190\nWhoops, let's see if I can\nmove that up a little bit.\n\n207\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.740\nAnd this is where you can go back in and\nedit it and\n\n208\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.860\nadd in a new rule if you want to.\n\n209\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.900\nThe great thing about this,\nZack, though, okay,\n\n210\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.660\nis that the outbound rule works\npretty much the same way.\n\n211\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.555\nInstead when we actually do it we just\nchoose outbound rule instead, and\n\n212\n00:12:38.555 --> 00:12:41.970\nit will essentially allow us to\ndo the very same thing, okay.\n\n213\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.160\nAnd so it's really not that different,\n\n214\n00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.670\nyou still create the same\nrules that are there.\n\n215\n00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.370\nAnd then you just select outbound instead\nand then you're off and ready to go, okay.\n\n216\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.280\nSo there's really not a lot of difference\nhere, once you to actually learn how to do\n\n217\n00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.610\nan inbound, outbound is pretty much\nidentical as what we have, okay.\n\n218\n00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.132\nNow there's one last thing that I\nhinted at, okay, just a little bit.\n\n219\n00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:07.627\nBut I wanna make sure that we go over just\na couple of informational pieces here,\n\n220\n00:13:07.627 --> 00:13:12.137\nespecially in dealing with multi\nforest support when you start to\n\n221\n00:13:12.137 --> 00:13:15.270\ndo this idea of synchronization, okay.\n\n222\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.495\nLet's go and take a look a diagram\nthat I have created here, okay.\n\n223\n00:13:18.495 --> 00:13:21.920\nThere's a couple of things that\nyou do wanna make sure that\n\n224\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.710\nyou can understand in terms of\nplanning for multi forest situations.\n\n225\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.660\nOver on the left hand side, let's say\nthat these are three different forests\n\n226\n00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.460\nthat you have in mind and\nin hand, and ready to go.\n\n227\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.410\nNow these can be in all types of\nconfigurations that are out there, okay.\n\n228\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.620\nIf you're gonna do this idea where you\nhave multiple forests with a single\n\n229\n00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:45.360\ntenant, you do not need three different\nAzure Active Directory connections, okay.\n\n230\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.548\nYou can simply build a single server,\nadd in the Azure Active Directory Connect\n\n231\n00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:54.040\ntool to be your server,\nput it inside of a DMZ, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.577\nAnd then ensure that you can connect\nto each one of these different\n\n233\n00:13:58.577 --> 00:14:03.364\nforest to essentially allow you to\ndo the connection that we want to as\n\n234\n00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:08.550\nwell as the filtering that we want\nto to bring everything in, okay.\n\n235\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.620\nNow when you set something like this up,\nright, you will actually have\n\n236\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.900\ndifferent options that you must\npay attention to as well, okay.\n\n237\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:24.250\nThe whole goal behind doing it this way\ninstead of three different AD Connect\n\n238\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:29.560\nserver tools that are available, right,\nis so that through this one server,\n\n239\n00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.710\nwhen we do the filtering, we can tell\nit look for duplicate records, okay.\n\n240\n00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.490\nBecause we want to ensure that\nwe're not bringing duplicates\n\n241\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.770\nover into the Azure AD.\n\n242\n00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.330\nSo by doing it all off of one\nserver we can do that instead.\n\n243\n00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.980\nYou have three different ones,\n\n244\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.380\neven on each one of those three\nthey should be unique all over.\n\n245\n00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.980\nBut if this is all within your\norganization, you might be wondering,\n\n246\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.310\nwho the heck would actually create that?\n\n247\n00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.938\nWell let's say you have an accounting\ndepartment that has to be legally\n\n248\n00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:00.929\nseparated out from your actual internal\ndomain, but they're really still in\n\n249\n00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:04.270\nthe same building and\nthey still actually work together, okay.\n\n250\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.300\nBut you may actually have different\nforests that do that, okay.\n\n251\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.860\nSo don't think that it's not\npossible that you can't do this, but\n\n252\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.060\nit actually does work that way.\n\n253\n00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.460\nSo you wanna make sure\nthat you can do this.\n\n254\n00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:20.234\nThe other thing that you also want\nto know at this particular point is\n\n255\n00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:24.864\nthat when you start to also work\nwith Exchange in this situation.\n\n256\n00:15:24.864 --> 00:15:29.562\nAs you pull the values in for\nyour global address list,\n\n257\n00:15:29.562 --> 00:15:34.262\ngo back to your individual\nforest Active Directory for\n\n258\n00:15:34.262 --> 00:15:38.690\nyour global address list\ninside of Exchange.\n\n259\n00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.170\nThat will always be your\nbest data value points for\n\n260\n00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.110\nwhat you'll see in the global\naddress list over here and Azure AD.\n\n261\n00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.390\nDon't pull it from the filtered stuff,\n\n262\n00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:55.540\nmake sure you get your original that\nyou actually want to first to do so.\n\n263\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:00.490\nYou also want to actually understand\nif you have link accounts in here,\n\n264\n00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.680\nokay, if you do, remember that that means\nthat you may have a user that has not\n\n265\n00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.630\nonly an account over here in one forest,\nbut maybe another account over here.\n\n266\n00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.480\nAnd those are actually linked together\nas well, which can cause some issues.\n\n267\n00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.950\nBut just realize that it is possible\nwhere you may end up with a user that\n\n268\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:23.340\nhas two different accounts, and you gotta\npay attention to their two as well, okay.\n\n269\n00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.703\nSo overall though, those are kind\nof the basic benefits that you, or\n\n270\n00:16:27.703 --> 00:16:31.329\nbasic kind of gotchas that you\nmay also have to deal with.\n\n271\n00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:32.782\nAre there more?\nYes, okay,\n\n272\n00:16:32.782 --> 00:16:36.545\nforeign security principles are a big one,\nokay.\n\n273\n00:16:36.545 --> 00:16:39.531\nAnd that means that you have objects\nthat exist that don't belong in one,\n\n274\n00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.030\nthat are ready over here.\n\n275\n00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.180\nThey are actually going\nto get linked somehow.\n\n276\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.630\nOver in Azure itself,\nthey become individual objects.\n\n277\n00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.260\nIt's not that it matters to\nthe end users so much, but\n\n278\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.260\nin terms of management, you actually\nwant to know that as well, okay.\n\n279\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.100\nSo every thing that you actually\nsetup here as far as planning,\n\n280\n00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.480\nyou want to make those considerations\nbefore you move forward, okay.\n\n281\n00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.070\nAnd understand what are some of\nthose requirements that are there.\n\n282\n00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:10.120\nI'm gonna say that on the exam, at least\nas you're preparing for this, having\n\n283\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:15.340\na high level overview that adding in\nmultiple forests adds in more complexity.\n\n284\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.980\nYou should understand that.\n\n285\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.076\nAnd so just making sure you go over some\nof the basic concepts of what can get in\n\n286\n00:17:21.076 --> 00:17:25.172\nthe way and what's actually assumed is\nprobably gonna go for your best bet.\n\n287\n00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:29.979\nBut overall, Zach, that's a good run down\nand a few different demonstrations of how\n\n288\n00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:34.383\nwe can do, of course, the filtering in\nour Active Directory as we get ready for\n\n289\n00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:38.410\nthe synchronization of everything\nto happen in the near future.\n\n290\n00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.220\n&gt;&gt; Thanks again, Ronnie,\nvery, very well done, sir.\n\n291\n00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.340\nAnd that was planned for\nfiltering Active Directory part three.\n\n292\n00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.850\nThere's a part one, there's a part two.\n\n293\n00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.805\nNow before we move on, Ronnie,\nwould you like to add anything?\n\n294\n00:17:49.805 --> 00:17:51.490\n&gt;&gt; No, that pretty much rounds out this.\n\n295\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.790\nNow next step, of course, is actually\ndoing this idea of the AD Connect and\n\n296\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.770\nallowing us to see the synchronization\nthat ends up happening from that point.\n\n297\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.360\nSo we are ready to move on to that\nparticular subject when we get back for\n\n298\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.030\nanother episode.\n\n299\n00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.320\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, well done.\n\n300\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.780\nMake sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 series\n\n301\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.710\nthat Ronnie's put together for you.\n\n302\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:12.392\nAwesome stuff.\n\n303\n00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:14.310\nAnd then go to our course library too and\n\n304\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.295\ncheck out all the hundreds\nof videos there.\n\n305\n00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:19.430\nThey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n306\n00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.570\nAnd tell somebody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n307\n00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.240\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n308\n00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.050\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n309\n00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.708\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n310\n00:18:26.708 -->

00:00:11.914\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.914 --> 00:00:14.173\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:17.100\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n6\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.910\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Office 365.\n\n7\n00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.200\nThis episode, interesting, is going\nto be set up Azure AD Connect Tool.\n\n8\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.320\nAnd the IT expert bringing us all\nthe information we need is the one and\n\n9\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.250\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.430\nRonnie, great to have you here,\nthank you so much.\n\n11\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.533\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback on the show as we continue to\n\n12\n00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.310\ntake a look at setting up for, of course,\nusing the Azure AD Connect Tool.\n\n13\n00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.612\nWhere we're gonna be able to synchronize\nour directory is the one that we already\n\n14\n00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:46.650\nhave going inside of our\non-premises Active Director,\n\n15\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.211\nalong with Azure's Active Directory\nthat's in the cloud for us.\n\n16\n00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:54.864\nSo in previous episodes, we've already\ntaken a look at a lot of things,\n\n17\n00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:56.235\nsuch as, of course,\n\n18\n00:00:56.235 --> 00:01:01.222\nall the preparation that is to be done\non the on-premises Active Directory.\n\n19\n00:01:01.222 --> 00:01:06.488\nNow, we also of course then need to\nturn our attention, briefly at least,\n\n20\n00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:11.795\nto take and look at the set up that is\nrequire then for the Azure side as well.\n\n21\n00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:16.220\nNow, there's not a lot of setup for that,\nbut this particular episode, of course\n\n22\n00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.110\nmeans that we're gonna get everything kind\nof up and going the way that we need to\n\n23\n00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.090\nfor the Azure AD Connect tool to end\nup working the way that we need it to.\n\n24\n00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.060\nSo in that sense, this particular\nepisode's a little bit more of a review.\n\n25\n00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.322\nSo unlike laying everything out, it's\nkind of truncating everything together.\n\n26\n00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.970\nAllowing us to make sure that we\nunderstand, cuz it's a good review\n\n27\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.470\nprocess, it's something that we need to\nmake sure that we go over more than once,\n\n28\n00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.080\njust for the exam, because you'll see\ndetails of this, especially for the exam.\n\n29\n00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.610\nBut also ensuring that we\nsee the entire process and\n\n30\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.440\nthat we understand that planning is\na big part of that process as well.\n\n31\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.910\nSo that is what we're actually doing is\nmaking sure that we've got everything set\n\n32\n00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.340\nup to do what we need to do.\n\n33\n00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.720\nThe Azure AD Connect tool itself,\nremember, is going to essentially be\n\n34\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.710\nthat server that is running\non a Windows machine for us.\n\n35\n00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.170\nThat will allow for\nthat synchronization to happen.\n\n36\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.172\nWhen we synchronize the information\nbetween our on-premises AD,\n\n37\n00:02:13.172 --> 00:02:16.350\nas well as that inside of\nAzure AD as well, okay.\n\n38\n00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.660\nAnd this will give us the ability\nto do several different things and\n\n39\n00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.300\nwhat we need to do.\n\n40\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.390\nSo let's talk about at least at\nthe beginning here, just briefly.\n\n41\n00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.180\nThat as we start to take a look\nthe idea of best practices and\n\n42\n00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.460\nwhat the Azure AD Connect tool\nallows as to be able to do, okay.\n\n43\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.014\nSo when we start to think about\nthis idea of synchronization or\n\n44\n00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:42.969\nnot to synchronize,\nthat's a good question to ask.\n\n45\n00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.250\nIs it something that our\norganization really does need?\n\n46\n00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.860\nWell, that again depends on\nwhat you need to be able to do.\n\n47\n00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.520\nThere are organizations out there\nthat say I don't really need it.\n\n48\n00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.840\nI can log in to my domain join machines\nthat are right here in the building\n\n49\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.660\nperfectly fine.\n\n50\n00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.120\nI can use one password for that, and then\nother users of course as they come in and\n\n51\n00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.330\nthey do that, and\nthey wanna use Office 365,\n\n52\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.730\nthey just use their particular\npassword and do that instead.\n\n53\n00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.110\nSo, you have two separate passwords,\nit works just fine.\n\n54\n00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.380\nSo, as long as that's all that you need,\n\n55\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.850\nthen you don't really have\nto do the synchronization.\n\n56\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.703\nBut, as you start to have a little\nbit more complexity added in and\n\n57\n00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.085\nwhat I mean by complexity here,\n\n58\n00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:30.602\nis you decide that I want to\nuse one password instead, okay.\n\n59\n00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:34.714\nOr, I wanna use the same credentials,\nokay, instead,\n\n60\n00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:40.650\nto be able to log into both, Office 365\nand my on-premises Active Directory.\n\n61\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.780\nWell now, we need to start considering\nthat idea of that directory\n\n62\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.840\nsynchronization which the AD\ntool will help us to do.\n\n63\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.390\nThe other fashion behind this,\nor the technicality or\n\n64\n00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.099\ncomplexity that we might add in is if\nyou're using some type of third-party,\n\n65\n00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.410\nmulti-factor authentication for both.\n\n66\n00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.350\nWell then you might also need to\nconsider using the AD Connect tool to\n\n67\n00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.970\nhelp you to get all that\nconfigured as well.\n\n68\n00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.000\nOr if you actually are deciding\nto do federated services too,\n\n69\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.910\nyou may actually have to consider some\nof those different aspects of things\n\n70\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.965\nthat are also there as well.\n\n71\n00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:17.820\nAnd there's a lot of different\ncomplexities in what you choose to do.\n\n72\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.590\nSo if you can plan that out and\nthink about just the idea\n\n73\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.450\nof what I really need to do, well,\nthat's something you want to talk about.\n\n74\n00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.074\nNow, in that sense, right, that goes\nmore toward project management areas,\n\n75\n00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:32.144\nokay, which you and your company,\n\n76\n00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:36.437\nor you as a contractor, you're kind\nof told what the prerequisites are.\n\n77\n00:04:36.437 --> 00:04:40.740\nAnd then you'll decide what has to be done\nat that point, and you'll report to them.\n\n78\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.110\nHere's how it has to be done if\nthis is gonna be the requirement.\n\n79\n00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.440\nMake sure you think about those scenarios\nin terms of what you need to make it\n\n80\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320\nwork the way that you want to.\n\n81\n00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.390\nSo, that's really gonna\nbe of a good help for\n\n82\n00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.310\nwhat we actually want to be able to do,\nokay.\n\n83\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.350\nNow the other part are some of the things\nwe've already covered in the preparation.\n\n84\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.890\nUnderstanding what needs to\nbe synchronized versus what\n\n85\n00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.810\ndoesn't need to be synchronized.\n\n86\n00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.300\nAnd if you think about it,\nsince we already went over the idea that\n\n87\n00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.339\ninside of Azure's Active Directory, they\nreally only want what's gonna be active,\n\n88\n00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.250\nokay, to be synchronized\nup into the cloud.\n\n89\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.360\nBut our best bet as beginners, right,\n\n90\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.870\nif we're just first doing this,\nit's to synchronize everything.\n\n91\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.160\nTo make essentially, what we have inside\nof our on-premises Active Directory\n\n92\n00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.520\nmatch what's inside of\nAzure's Active Directory, as well.\n\n93\n00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.600\nAnd that is probably the easiest thing for\nus to do.\n\n94\n00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.370\nThe way that we do that, of course,\nis using the Azure AD Connect tool, again.\n\n95\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.335\nAnd we go with the default settings and\nthat will kind of set it up for us and\n\n96\n00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:41.358\nwe don't have to worry them, okay.\n\n97\n00:05:41.358 --> 00:05:44.130\nSo you can actually think about that too.\n\n98\n00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.690\nSetting up, of course, your on-premises\nActive Directory, getting all that ready.\n\n99\n00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.140\nUsing a tool like ID fix will\nalso help us out as well.\n\n100\n00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.890\nGetting all this stuff kinda\nplanned out and supported and\n\n101\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.470\nready to go is a big one.\n\n102\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.245\nSo, once again, this all comes from\ngetting the preparation that we need.\n\n103\n00:06:00.245 --> 00:06:03.670\nNow, once all that is done, all right,\nthere's still a few other things that we\n\n104\n00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.690\nneed to understand what the Azure AD\nConnect tool helps us to do, as well.\n\n105\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.335\nSo, let's take a look on my screen here\nand, let's just make sure that we review,\n\n106\n00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:14.487\nand why this is actually important for\nus, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.420\nIn the sense that we are now saying,\nall right, we are going to connect and\n\n108\n00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.580\ndo this synchronization, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.120\nThe Azure AD Connect tool really\nconglomerates three different tools\n\n110\n00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.410\ntogether for us.\n\n111\n00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.730\nAnd allows us to actually have a very\nunified interface that we don't\n\n112\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.880\nhave to worry about too much.\n\n113\n00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.990\nNow, you can see some of\nthose separate processes.\n\n114\n00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.550\nAnd if you went through\nthe Active Directory filtering show,\n\n115\n00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.960\nI was trying to remember what\nepisodes that we did there,\n\n116\n00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.820\nyou actually see where we separated\nout into that synchronization manager.\n\n117\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.080\nAnd we also saw that connection\ntool that was there.\n\n118\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.680\nYou name it,\nyou can actually go in there and\n\n119\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.860\nchange some of those different aspects.\n\n120\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.320\nBut for us here the overall idea\nof using the Azure AD Connect that\n\n121\n00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.070\nbreaks up into three different components,\nis, of course,\n\n122\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.770\nit helps us with the synchronization,\nokay.\n\n123\n00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.470\nSo if we want to do the synchronization\nthe Azure AD Connect tool says,\n\n124\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.740\nI can do that.\n\n125\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.270\nIt can help us to create users, groups,\nand other Office 365 objects, okay.\n\n126\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.150\nAnd also ensures that whatever\non-premises ID info that we already have\n\n127\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.430\nsuch as a user.\n\n128\n00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.560\nSo let's take Zach exact from the example,\nright.\n\n129\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.000\nSo at the very beginning\nof our entire series\n\n130\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.800\nwe created three separate accounts here.\n\n131\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.010\nOkay, first couple of episodes in\nthe entire series, I did with Cherokee.\n\n132\n00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.092\nSo we created an account for Cherokee,\nmyself, and then later on, as Zach jumped\n\n133\n00:07:37.092 --> 00:07:41.800\non board as well to begin hosting there,\nwe also created an account for him.\n\n134\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.050\nWell, in that aspect, right, Zach may\nactually have an Office 365 account.\n\n135\n00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.570\nAnd that's different from his\non-premises Active Directory account.\n\n136\n00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.610\nBut they both may be named\nthe exact same thing.\n\n137\n00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.093\nSo in that sense, the synchronization\nallows us to take whatever is on premises.\n\n138\n00:08:01.093 --> 00:08:06.348\nAnd his existing email address, or\nhis UPN, right, zach@itprotvdemo.com,\n\n139\n00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:10.552\nand then the one that we created for\nhim in Office 365, right?\n\n140\n00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:15.230\nSo in a separate one here,\nwhich is zach@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n141\n00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.952\nWe talked about the synchronization,\nwe're saying what?\n\n142\n00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:20.990\nMake sure that both of those\ncan actually match and\n\n143\n00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.860\nend up merging into a single identity,\nis what we are actually taking a look at.\n\n144\n00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.681\nSo it can do that.\n\n145\n00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:29.898\nWe can actually allow for\nthe Azure AD Connect tool and\n\n146\n00:08:29.898 --> 00:08:34.261\nsynchronization to be able to ensure\nthat those on premises ID info, and\n\n147\n00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:38.640\neven group information,\nmatches the same thing in the cloud.\n\n148\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.030\nSo it can actually take a look at both,\nand actually end up generating for\n\n149\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.470\nus what we need to.\n\n150\n00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.720\nAnd we do have to be careful, there is\na little bit of trickiness to some of this\n\n151\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.450\nstuff, but overall though, this relies\nthat that's its purpose in what we do.\n\n152\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.405\nThe other one of course is now when we\ntalk about the complexity that I was\n\n153\n00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:59.764\nmentioning just a few minutes ago.\n\n154\n00:08:59.764 --> 00:09:04.584\nThe AD, or\nActive Directory Federation Services,\n\n155\n00:09:04.584 --> 00:09:08.097\nusually abbreviated as ADFS, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:11.221\nSo when you see that abbreviation\nin any documentation out there,\n\n157\n00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.930\nthat's what it refers to is\nActive Directory Federation Services.\n\n158\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.583\nThis is optional, it means you\ndon't ever have to do it this way.\n\n159\n00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:21.365\nBut it depends on what your\norganization requires here.\n\n160\n00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:25.213\nUsed to configure a hybrid\nenvironment with on-premises\n\n161\n00:09:25.213 --> 00:09:30.869\nActive Directory Federation Services,\nsuch as using Domain Join Single Sign-On,\n\n162\n00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:35.817\nor Active Directory sign-on policies\nthat you may already have in place,\n\n163\n00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:39.529\nSmart Cards, or\neven multi-factor authentication.\n\n164\n00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:44.446\nWell now the Active Directory Connect tool\nis what will help us to ensure that we\n\n165\n00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:47.050\ncan get that set up correctly.\n\n166\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:52.020\nSo this is another instance in which we\nmight choose to use the AD Connect tool.\n\n167\n00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.450\nNot only for synchronization but\n\n168\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.180\nto ensure that we can work with our Active\nDirectory Federation Services as well.\n\n169\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.530\nMake sure that everything goes on.\n\n170\n00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.880\nAnd we've got episodes, if you're\nactually watching this in the sequence in\n\n171\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.740\nwhich they're presented on the website,\nthere are episodes that will follow this\n\n172\n00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.630\nparticular episode, in which we'll set up\nthe Active Directory Federation Services\n\n173\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.730\nfor Single Sign-On, making sure that we\nget all that set up for you as well, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.850\nSo, there's also of course\nHealth Monitoring, and\n\n175\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.970\nthis is a big part of what we have to do.\n\n176\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.490\nThe larger your organization grows,\n\n177\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:29.950\nthe more you have to be conscious\nof monitoring the information, and\n\n178\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.600\nthe equipment, and whether or not things\nare functioning the way that we want to.\n\n179\n00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.078\nBut inside of this, okay,\n\n180\n00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:40.160\nmonitors from a central location that\nyou can find in the Azure Portal.\n\n181\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.293\nThat way you can verify if everything\nis actually working the way that we\n\n182\n00:10:45.293 --> 00:10:45.860\nwant it to.\n\n183\n00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.240\nAnd that's gonna be important because now,\nif we're actually doing this\n\n184\n00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.050\nhybridized type of environment, we've\ngotta be careful about what can happen.\n\n185\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.730\nWhat if my on-premises AD goes down?\n\n186\n00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.441\nWhat does that actually end up meaning for\n\n187\n00:11:01.441 --> 00:11:05.866\nme if I'm actually doing this idea\nof the synchronization, okay?\n\n188\n00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.150\nWhat is the help?\n\n189\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.592\nHow do I know that it's happening?\n\n190\n00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:10.034\nWhere do I know to troubleshoot?\n\n191\n00:11:10.034 --> 00:11:15.038\nWell that Health Monitoring is really\ngoing to ensure that we understand\n\n192\n00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:20.070\nwhat the process is when that does\nend up happening as well, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.260\nNow there is one other thing that I\nwant us to actually consider that I\n\n194\n00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.220\ndid not put down right here because these\nare kind of the three main components.\n\n195\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.168\nBut the other element, okay, that I\ndefinitely don't want to forget about,\n\n196\n00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:35.860\nokay, is that if you now actually\n\n197\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:41.390\nmove beyond the idea of a single\ndomain inside of a single forest,\n\n198\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.800\nThe Azure AD Connect tool will help us to\nbe able to add in that additional forest,\n\n199\n00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.420\nas well, and combine all that\ninformation together, too.\n\n200\n00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.780\nSo, it is something that\nwe need to be cognizant of.\n\n201\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.924\nIf you only have a single domain and\na single forest,\n\n202\n00:11:57.924 --> 00:12:00.294\nyou install the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n203\n00:12:00.294 --> 00:12:02.420\nMake sure meets all those requirements.\n\n204\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.000\nYou run through the installation,\nyou double-click on the icon, and\n\n205\n00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.990\nsay accept whatever default settings\nare there, it's designed to do that, and\n\n206\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.630\nyou just kind of have to wait.\n\n207\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.190\nAnd once everything is done it'll tell\nyou everything's kind of ready and done.\n\n208\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.814\nBut if you have multiple forests, okay,\nand even more importantly, what if you\n\n209\n00:12:19.814 --> 00:12:24.438\nactually are gonna end up with multiple\nforests, you wanna begin to plan that one\n\n210\n00:12:24.438 --> 00:12:29.270\nday I may end up buying Zach's company and\nI want to actually integrate that in here.\n\n211\n00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.824\nI don't wanna set it up for the idea of\njust setting up for Single Sign-On at\n\n212\n00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:38.234\nthis point and just doing that when\nyou may actually want to go ahead, and\n\n213\n00:12:38.234 --> 00:12:42.300\nunderstand that the Azure AD Connect\ntool can help us.\n\n214\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.070\nEven after we've set it up\nto now begin to say hey,\n\n215\n00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:51.190\nhere's another forest that we're gonna\nbe adding in to the Office 365, as well.\n\n216\n00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.080\nAnd we went through some of\nthose different scenarios and\n\n217\n00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.322\nthe way that it needs to work inside of\nthe preparing for the synchronization.\n\n218\n00:12:59.322 --> 00:13:03.020\nBut, just kinda remember, this is like I\nsaid again, it's kind of a little bit of\n\n219\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.630\na truncated reminder of all the things\nthat we've talked about over\n\n220\n00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:13.060\nseveral episodes as well, that we need to\nmake sure that we understand as we begin.\n\n221\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.520\nSo it's easy enough to run, and\n\n222\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.380\nthere's a reason why I'm kind\nof taking the time to do this.\n\n223\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.620\nNow Zach, some of the things\nthat we actually kind of\n\n224\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.080\nunderstand how to do on end-user side\nsometimes is relatively easy, right?\n\n225\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.353\nWe install an application,\nwe open it up, we use it, and\n\n226\n00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:32.824\nwe realize it doesn't work for me, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:32.824 --> 00:13:34.639\nWell then, what do we do?\n\n228\n00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:38.257\nWe simply can uninstall that application\nand everything goes away, and\n\n229\n00:13:38.257 --> 00:13:41.350\nnothing else is really\naffected at that point.\n\n230\n00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.600\nBut the Azure AD Connect tool is\n100% different, okay, in the very\n\n231\n00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.000\nfact that if I just simply say hey,\nI'm just gonna stop this synchronization\n\n232\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.300\nby uninstalling this tool, you're gonna\nfind out you're gonna break stuff, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.790\nSo, why am I mentioning that?\n\n234\n00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.810\nBecause when people don't realize that,\nthey break it unintentionally.\n\n235\n00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.820\nWhen they break it unintentionally,\n\n236\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.010\nit means they don't know how\nto fix it intentionally again.\n\n237\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.950\nSo this is why planning out things\nthat end up happening, okay,\n\n238\n00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.490\nthat we can do,\nis gonna be very important to do.\n\n239\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.380\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I'm very sure that you're\ngonna be showing us how to install and\n\n240\n00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.360\nuninstall objects inside of\nthe AD Azure Connect tool.\n\n241\n00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.196\nBut you can uninstall something\nthat has been installed, right?\n\n242\n00:14:25.196 --> 00:14:28.500\n&gt;&gt; Sure, you can do it, but\nthere has to be a certain order to it.\n\n243\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.894\nSo the reason why I'm being very careful\nand making sure that we understand some of\n\n244\n00:14:32.894 --> 00:14:36.458\nthese things, right,\nis because once we begin this process, and\n\n245\n00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.515\nusing the tool, and\ngetting everything synchronized,\n\n246\n00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:44.126\nsimply turning off synchronization, okay,\nsounds like a neat and easy thing to do.\n\n247\n00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.634\nOr simply uninstalling\nthe Azure AD Connect tool,\n\n248\n00:14:46.634 --> 00:14:50.482\nyou're going to see that it may get you\nto that point and process where it says,\n\n249\n00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:53.396\nyou're not gonna be able to do\nthat because to do that breaks\n\n250\n00:14:53.396 --> 00:14:57.860\nthe synchronization and we can't allow\nyou to break the synchronization.\n\n251\n00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.270\nYou can say well, I've tried to uninstall,\nit won't let me uninstall.\n\n252\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.610\nSo you've got to pay attention to the way\nthat things are actually gonna be set up\n\n253\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.500\nright at the beginning.\n\n254\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.050\nAnd this is why planning\nis an important part\n\n255\n00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.540\nof some of the stuff that\nwe have to be able to do.\n\n256\n00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.290\n&gt;&gt; So is this a nod to dependencies, too?\n\n257\n00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.293\nI'm guessing that's what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n258\n00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:20.258\n&gt;&gt; It's the idea of dependencies but just\nkind of realizing that some tools really\n\n259\n00:15:20.258 --> 00:15:25.693\ndo when they talk about integrating in,\nit integrates fully into everything, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:29.460\nYeah, that is not just a simple as\njust saying, let me remove this, and\n\n261\n00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.890\nit unwinds itself from things.\n\n262\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.082\nOnce things get that idea of the\nconnection and the synchronization, and\n\n263\n00:15:36.082 --> 00:15:40.823\nall that other stuff the way they want to,\nit doesn't like letting go of it, okay?\n\n264\n00:15:40.823 --> 00:15:41.948\nIt really doesn't So\n\n265\n00:15:41.948 --> 00:15:45.632\nyou have to actually be careful on\nsome of the stuff that you are doing,\n\n266\n00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:50.720\nthat you are starting to see as well, and\nunderstand what ends up happening, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.592\nSo on that instance of all the things\nhere, okay, we wanna make sure\n\n268\n00:15:55.592 --> 00:16:00.727\nthat we also pay attention to a couple\nof the prerequisites too, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:02.870\nSo, I think I brought it up here.\n\n270\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.115\nThere we go, okay.\n\n271\n00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:07.186\nAll right,\nnow I want to leave this up here,\n\n272\n00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:10.350\nbecause this is kind of\nthe official source.\n\n273\n00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.420\nSo, I'm going to leave\nup the url right here.\n\n274\n00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.640\nSo, that way everybody can get\na good screenshot if they want to\n\n275\n00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.690\nto be able to look at this,\nand not only that though.\n\n276\n00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:26.340\nI like this particular shot because\nIt's really only a couple of months,\n\n277\n00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.890\nthree months just about now.\n\n278\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:28.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, recent.\n\n279\n00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.800\n&gt;&gt; From the recording of\nthis to the time that\n\n280\n00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.070\nthis particular document was\nactually last updated here.\n\n281\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.120\nSo, that way you have the latest\ninformation that's actually\n\n282\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.520\navailable to you.\n\n283\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.130\nPrerequisite information, especially\nfacing the Microsoft 346 exam here,\n\n284\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.480\nyou're gonna see,\nit's not gonna give you on everything.\n\n285\n00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.650\nBut there are certain things that\nthey really want you to know that,\n\n286\n00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.660\nbefore you can install Azure AD Connect,\n\n287\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.070\nthat you have to make sure that you\nget that in there as well, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.740\nOf course, if you're doing this for\n\n289\n00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.280\na production network, getting your\ntrial up and going is actually key.\n\n290\n00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.620\nBut then, of course, paying for\n\n291\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.960\nthe ongoing subscription\nmay also be key as well.\n\n292\n00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.340\nAdding in and\nverifying your domain as a big one and\n\n293\n00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.950\nwe did that really on\nthe beginning of the show itself.\n\n294\n00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:21.020\nWhere it really is relatively simple and\nwhen we start verifying our own domain.\n\n295\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.750\nThis is where we had to go to our third,\nnot a third, our outside or\n\n296\n00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:30.270\nour public DNS registrar that we had and\nadd in a text record,\n\n297\n00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.960\nand that actually verified it for Office\n365 that that domain did belong to us.\n\n298\n00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.680\nSo it knew that we could add in all\nthe information that we wanted to.\n\n299\n00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.720\nSo it actually allowed\nus to do that as well.\n\n300\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.650\nSo we've seen episodes on that,\nI'm not so worried.\n\n301\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.740\nSome of the other things that we wanna\npay attention to actually happens\n\n302\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.912\nin these particular last\nbullet point right here,\n\n303\n00:17:50.912 --> 00:17:53.730\nlet me see if I can get\nthat on the screen.\n\n304\n00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.450\nBy default right these is what the actual\nme actually doing anything else.\n\n305\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.110\nAzurre tenant allows us by\ndefault 50k objects okay.\n\n306\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.601\nWhich is a lot don't get me wrong,\nbut once we actually do that, so\n\n307\n00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:11.571\njust by default 50,000 objects, but\n\n308\n00:18:11.571 --> 00:18:17.420\nonce I get my domain verified the object\nlimit is increased to about 300,000.\n\n309\n00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:22.151\nNow if you have an active directory that's\nbigger and there's probably a lot of\n\n310\n00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:27.178\npeople that have active directories\nthat are larger than 300,000 objects.\n\n311\n00:18:27.178 --> 00:18:32.183\nThey do say that you will\nneed to open a support\n\n312\n00:18:32.183 --> 00:18:36.870\ncase to have the limit even further.\n\n313\n00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:42.473\nNow that's all the way up to 499,999.\n\n314\n00:18:42.473 --> 00:18:45.434\nOnce you get over 500,000 objects,\n\n315\n00:18:45.434 --> 00:18:49.740\nyou may have to actually\nchange your licensing, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.740\nI'm highlighting this for\na particular reason here.\n\n317\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.310\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n318\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.630\nThat once you get to a certain limit,\nit may not be just a limitation of what\n\n319\n00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:03.670\nAzure can do, but it's a limitation of\nyour licensing and what you have in place.\n\n320\n00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.320\nSo make sure you pay attention\nto something like that\n\n321\n00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.140\nbefore you begin the process of using\nAzure AD connect and go I don't care.\n\n322\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.000\nI've got this many objects.\n\n323\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.800\nIt should handle it just fine.\n\n324\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.530\nIt's not that it can't but\nit may be that what, your license,\n\n325\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.600\nmay have to go from whatever it\nis here to maybe to the premium.\n\n326\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.090\nOr Enterprise Mobility and Security here,\nto make sure that everything else happens,\n\n327\n00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.400\nespecially if you have your BYOD, yeah.\n\n328\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.350\nI wanted to tell you the other one, BYOB.\n\n329\n00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.560\nThat's not the correct one.\n\n330\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.060\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n331\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.420\n&gt;&gt; So, BYOD devices that you\nwanna make sure that you do that.\n\n332\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.720\nWe've done complete episodes on preparing\nour on-premises active directory.\n\n333\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.560\nSo make sure you understand that,\nas well, too.\n\n334\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.630\nAnd then you have to decide on\nyour on premises directory,\n\n335\n00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.040\nsome of the different things\nthat you need to be able to do.\n\n336\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.550\nOne of the things that's easily forgotten,\nokay,\n\n337\n00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.540\nis make sure you understand that\nthe forest functional level,\n\n338\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.440\nit has to at least be this,\nwhich is not very difficult today,\n\n339\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.830\nespecially since we're at the end of 2017\nas we've recorded this episode here.\n\n340\n00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.770\nBut normally because we're also\nrunning on 2016 servers here,\n\n341\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.350\nit says you're probably going to see that.\n\n342\n00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.070\nHey, it's probably going to be fine.\n\n343\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:22.000\nOkay but if you happen to be\nrunning on older ones, kinda weird.\n\n344\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.120\nHave you happen to have lower your\n\n345\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.460\nforest functional level back down\nto whatever it was before 2003?\n\n346\n00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.700\nThen you have to at least raise that,\ntoo, okay?\n\n347\n00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.900\nPassword writeback features,\nokay, it's actually another one.\n\n348\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.650\nNow this is a little bit different in that\nidea of synchronization, that happens.\n\n349\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.500\nNotice they talk about,\nif you plan to use that feature here.\n\n350\n00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.590\nPassword writeback is\nkind of a neat feature.\n\n351\n00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.350\nAnd just to everything that we will do\nin the synchronization process, and\n\n352\n00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.168\nin the reality that ends up happening\nis that the ideas source of authority,\n\n353\n00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:59.570\nnormally is on the premises\nactive directory.\n\n354\n00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.408\nAnd that means anything that is\nchanged there tends to get migrate or,\n\n355\n00:21:04.408 --> 00:21:06.874\nflood, or filled in on Cloud side.\n\n356\n00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:10.499\nSo that means that if you changed\nsomething on the cloud side,\n\n357\n00:21:10.499 --> 00:21:14.681\nit normally doesn't go back to over\nto the on premises side, except for\n\n358\n00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:17.670\nwhat we call password writeback, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.690\nPassword writeback, though,\nallows us to do that.\n\n360\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.480\nIt wants us to be careful about\nthe domain controllers that we're on, so\n\n361\n00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.150\nthat makes sense too.\n\n362\n00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.670\nAlso, this one,\nremember that it must be writable.\n\n363\n00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:34.000\nThis is not supported on read\nonly domain controllers.\n\n364\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.300\nOkay, so that's actually an important\naspect to be able to do this as well.\n\n365\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.820\nThe other one, let me see.\n\n366\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.980\nI may be kind of skipping\nover here a little bit more.\n\n367\n00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:50.130\nSo for us a single level domains\ndon't use, don't net bios,\n\n368\n00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:57.620\nand this one right here, okay,\nenable the active directory recycle bin.\n\n369\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:03.160\nAzures Ad, inside of\nAzure's Active Directory itself, right.\n\n370\n00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.850\nIt already has its own\nrecycle bin turned on.\n\n371\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:12.210\nIf we are going to enable this for\nthe connect tool here, it says we should\n\n372\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.100\nalso enable it right here on the on\npremises side as well, to match up\n\n373\n00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.360\neverything that needs to be matched up for\nthe synchronization to end up happening.\n\n374\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.850\nNow on the Connect side, there's a couple\nof different things that we want to\n\n375\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.210\nmake sure that we pay\nattention to as well, okay.\n\n376\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.970\nIf you are, of course we already talked\nabout some of these requirements here, but\n\n377\n00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.740\nI want to get down to the one\nwhere it talks about, there it is.\n\n378\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.440\nThat one, okay?\n\n379\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.970\nThe Azure Connect server must\nhave the full GUI install.\n\n380\n00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.280\nSo, you have a choice between can\nit be installed on server core?\n\n381\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.440\nDoes it need the full GUI?\n\n382\n00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.520\nMake sure you understand that.\n\n383\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.270\nIt needs the full GUI edition,\nthe Graphical User Interface.\n\n384\n00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.960\nMake sure you pay attention\nto that one as well, okay?\n\n385\n00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.086\nThe other things here, again,\ndifferent types of requirements,\n\n386\n00:23:03.086 --> 00:23:08.580\n.NET Framework 4.5,\nother name resolutions here.\n\n387\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.310\nIf you're using Active Directory\nFederation Services you'll need\n\n388\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.330\na certificate.\n\n389\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.980\nThat's a good one to remember,\n\n390\n00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.220\nyou can't run Federation Services\nwithout the SSL certificate as well.\n\n391\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.550\nYou can't do it without having\nall of your DNS records\n\n392\n00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.840\nset up the way that you need to.\n\n393\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.580\nAnd you also normally are gonna need,\n\n394\n00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.130\nif you're using Federation Services,\na public IP address.\n\n395\n00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.160\nThat's gonna be a kicker as well.\n\n396\n00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.660\nWith the SQL Server,\nthat's normally used as your AD Connect.\n\n397\n00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.180\nWe'll normally install the version of SQL\nExpress Is essentially what you'll end up\n\n398\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:45.260\nseeing but\nif you have over 100,000 objects,\n\n399\n00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.150\nit's going to recommend that you do\na full install of SQL Server itself.\n\n400\n00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:57.000\nSo you have above 100,000 objects, then\nyou have to go to the full version here.\n\n401\n00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.501\nThe other things of course, notice that\nyou'll need two accounts to make this work\n\n402\n00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:04.803\nThe global administrator\naccount inside of Office 365.\n\n403\n00:24:04.803 --> 00:24:11.304\nAnd then, also, okay, you'll need\nthe Enterprise Administrator Account for\n\n404\n00:24:11.304 --> 00:24:15.905\nActive Directory Two,\nif you're gonna do this.\n\n405\n00:24:15.905 --> 00:24:19.230\nOr the synchronization, there's also\na group that needs to be there,\n\n406\n00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.360\nwhich is gonna be the AD Sync Admins.\n\n407\n00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.520\nThat's a group that we created\nin a previous episode.\n\n408\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.580\nWe added in a couple of counts.\n\n409\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.470\nI believe I added in Zach's\naccount to that, as well.\n\n410\n00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.990\n&gt;&gt; Thank you [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:35.910\n&gt;&gt; That needs to be there, if these things\nare gonna end up working out for us, too.\n\n412\n00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.300\nConnection, of course,\nthat means networking resolution.\n\n413\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.320\nStuff that you can follow on your own.\n\n414\n00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.590\nI don't want to point all that out.\n\n415\n00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:47.500\nPowershell, enabling for, of course,\nAzure AD connect, if you're going to\n\n416\n00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:51.850\ndo TLS here over your federation, you\nwant to make sure you get all that done.\n\n417\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.330\nBut that's pretty much kinda the basic\nprerequisites, right, that we also have,\n\n418\n00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:02.290\nnot only the best practices, but also just\nthat idea of those prerequisites, okay.\n\n419\n00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.880\nSo, Ronnie, okay, you've gone over\nthat in multiple episodes and\n\n420\n00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.060\nyou're doing it again, so\nwhat's the whole point here?\n\n421\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.530\nThe whole point is everything\nneeds to be planned out, and\n\n422\n00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.550\nyou need to understand those facts\nrelatively solid as you move on.\n\n423\n00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.830\n&gt;&gt; It's all about preparation isn't it,\nRonnie?\n\n424\n00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.470\n&gt;&gt; It is really all about preparation.\n\n425\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:20.550\nSo, what about the cloud side, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.540\nWhat is there really that needs\nto be done on the cloud side?\n\n427\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.750\nWell, the key thing right if you're\ndoing this for your production network.\n\n428\n00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:30.680\nIs have your Azure AD Subscription.\n\n429\n00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.920\nWhatever it is that you need\nto actually think about.\n\n430\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.520\nCount it up here.\n\n431\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.980\nDo yo think that your particular\nsubscription is going to go over\n\n432\n00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.484\nthat limit.\n\n433\n00:25:38.484 --> 00:25:40.470\nThat 300,000 limit.\n\n434\n00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.080\nBe ready to call Microsoft for\n\n435\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.440\nadditional help to expand\nout the object limit, there.\n\n436\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.190\nOkay?\n\n437\n00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.970\nBe ready to change your product\nsubscription, okay, if you need to.\n\n438\n00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.300\nSo, that doesn't sound exactly difficult.\n\n439\n00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.200\nBut it is easy things that we'll miss\non the exam if we don't think about\n\n440\n00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.370\nit, as well.\n\n441\n00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.300\nThe other thing, of course,\nis we need to make sure\n\n442\n00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.990\nthat the synchronization will actually\nhappen, essentially on both sides.\n\n443\n00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.820\nThe Azure AD connect tool allows us\nto be able to run the synchronization\n\n444\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.540\nto get everything ready to go.\n\n445\n00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.220\nBut on the active directory side,\n\n446\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.820\non Azure's active directory side,\nwe need to enable it, okay?\n\n447\n00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.210\nAnd the enabling of this synchronization\nthat we're talking about here,\n\n448\n00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.080\nhas to be done.\n\n449\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.970\nIt doesn't have to be done.\n\n450\n00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.820\nBut it is going to be done at least\non our end here through PowerShell.\n\n451\n00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.630\nThat's what we're gonna have.\n\n452\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:37.250\nSo, I'm going to log in as our domain\nadmin as well as our global administrator.\n\n453\n00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.060\nThen we're going to bring\nup the PowerShell and\n\n454\n00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.621\nconnect into azureAD, so connect\n\n455\n00:26:47.621 --> 00:26:52.280\nmsolservice.\n\n456\n00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.180\nBefore I do that let me create\nmy variable for my credentials.\n\n457\n00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.520\nI always forget this part.\n\n458\n00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:08.914\nAnd remember, also in this, even though\nI probably done it just about in\n\n459\n00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:14.180\nevery other episode, make sure you use\nthe UPN type of name and not the slash.\n\n460\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.518\nITProTVdemo slash name instead,\nitprotvdemo.com,\n\n461\n00:27:19.518 --> 00:27:25.322\nI got to make sure I spell that correctly,\nsince it's so tiny, there we go.\n\n462\n00:27:25.322 --> 00:27:28.120\nAnd then, the super secret password.\n\n463\n00:27:37.754 --> 00:27:41.460\nSo, as long as I typed that in right,\nI'm pretty much okay here.\n\n464\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.930\nWe do the connect- msllService and\ndo verbose here.\n\n465\n00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:49.940\nYou don't have to do the verbose.\n\n466\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.480\nThen the credentials.\n\n467\n00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.531\nSupply it with a variable here.\n\n468\n00:27:56.531 --> 00:27:57.887\nNow, if it gives me red letters,\n\n469\n00:27:57.887 --> 00:28:00.640\nit means I probably fat-fingered\nthe actual password.\n\n470\n00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.470\nBut everything is accepted and\nconnected here.\n\n471\n00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:10.801\nAnd once I'm actually done with this,\nokay, if I'm just setting up and\n\n472\n00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:16.570\nmaking sure that the Azure\nside is actually connected and\n\n473\n00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:24.640\ndoing what we want to this is were we\nneed the set-msoldirsyncEnabled, okay?\n\n474\n00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:32.320\nSo, be careful here, make sure you see\nthat dirsyncEnabled then do a dash.\n\n475\n00:28:34.325 --> 00:28:40.504\nEnabledirSync, then $true.\n\n476\n00:28:40.504 --> 00:28:44.850\nNow, notice that we have a true and\nwe have a false here.\n\n477\n00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:52.130\nSo, set MsoldirSyncEnabled,\nthen the option here the -EnabledirSync.\n\n478\n00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.790\nSo, kind of neat, right?\n\n479\n00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:58.030\nSo, you're either enabling it,\nor you are disabling it.\n\n480\n00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.460\nOne of the things I can tell you right\nnow, as if all of a sudden you run\n\n481\n00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.450\nthrough, and you get everything\nsetup the way that you want to,\n\n482\n00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.010\nand then you realize something,\nthat you really didn't want that.\n\n483\n00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:13.360\nYou have to come in here and\nat least change that defaults first before\n\n484\n00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.270\nyou start uninstalling everything else\nthat you want to be able to uninstall.\n\n485\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.760\nIf you don't, it will keep it as true, and\n\n486\n00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:24.490\nit will expect to find\neverything still synchronized.\n\n487\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.410\nSo, that can end up giving you a lot of\nerrors, and cause a lot of heartache.\n\n488\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.000\nIf you're not careful.\n\n489\n00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.100\nSo, make sure that you understand this is\nprobably the first that you'll have to do\n\n490\n00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.580\nas to stop the synchronization\nthat happening on both ends,\n\n491\n00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.260\njust to make sure that is going on.\n\n492\n00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.360\nHere it is, it says confirm here,\nI was like typing the Y,\n\n493\n00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:50.090\neven the default than others putting in\nthere is took a D-A-Y, which is for yes.\n\n494\n00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:55.240\nAnd now on that side,\neverything is pretty much good here, okay?\n\n495\n00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.800\nSo, on the Office 365 side, this should\nnow be ready for the synchronization\n\n496\n00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.420\nto happen, if I've prepared everything on\nmy on premises active directory in the way\n\n497\n00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.440\nthat it needs to be that should\nalso be ready to go as well, okay?\n\n498\n00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.200\nSo, now that we've got both of those\nready to go, it is now time for\n\n499\n00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.170\nus to run that tool, make sure everything\nis actually the way that we want to.\n\n500\n00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.180\nAnd show you some of the options that\nwe may have to go through and select.\n\n501\n00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.860\nAnd we are actually gonna make sure\nthat everything is set up the way that\n\n502\n00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.530\nit needs to be as we continue\nto move on through, and\n\n503\n00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.600\nunderstand the synchronization\nprocess that we have in place.\n\n504\n00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.240\nBut, Zach, that's gonna actually be for\nanother episode at this point.\n\n505\n00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.210\nBut at least now, we've got a good review.\n\n506\n00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.410\nWe've now actually set it up,\nmade sure that both sides are ready to go.\n\n507\n00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.920\nAnd that's what we actually\nhave to make sure of, and\n\n508\n00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.330\nthen we'll be ready to run the tool,\nprobably in the next episode.\n\n509\n00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.620\n&gt;&gt; Set up Azure AD connect tool part one,\nthere will be a part two.\n\n510\n00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.900\nMake sure you see everything\nin the series of Office 365,\n\n511\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.620\nand everything in our course library.\n\n512\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.080\nHundreds of videos,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n513\n00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.960\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n514\n00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.590\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n515\n00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.330\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n516\n00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.196\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you again soon.\n\n517\n00:31:07.196 --> 00:31:13.181\n[MUSIC]\n\n518\n00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:20.379\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

you live from San Francisco,\nCalifornia.\n\n4\n00:00:05.878 --> 00:00:09.850\n[CROSSTALK] [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.910\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.150\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.370\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.770\nThis is Part 2,\nSetup Azure AD Connect Tool.\n\n9\n00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.898\nAnd we once again asked Ronnie Wong\nto come in and help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:29.470\nRonnie, thanks for being here,\nand thanks for helping us out.\n\n11\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.070\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Zach for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look\n\n12\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.240\nat this idea of the Azure Connect tool,\nor the AD Connect tool,\n\n13\n00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.060\nthat we have ready to go.\n\n14\n00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.620\nSo everything that we've\ntalked about up to this point,\n\n15\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.340\nreally is about the preparation and\nthe planning.\n\n16\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.870\nMaking sure that we understand\nthe requirements that are actually\n\n17\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.140\nset up there.\n\n18\n00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.200\nAnd some of the other utilities on\nother things that we have to do to\n\n19\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.690\nmake sure that we're\nready to run the tool.\n\n20\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.400\nNow when we start the install, I've all\nready got it installed on my computer, but\n\n21\n00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.650\nthere's a couple of things that I need\nto make sure that we understand, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.050\nOne, I'm in the lab environment, okay?\n\n23\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.990\nAnd lab environment,\n\n24\n00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.490\nbecause I have limitations on my own\nmachine which I've set it up on,\n\n25\n00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.710\nit means I'm also running that Azure\nAD Connect tool on my domain control.\n\n26\n00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.750\nNow, is that a bad thing?\n\n27\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.260\nNot necessarily in a lab environment.\n\n28\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.970\nBut in a real production environment,\nthe goal and\n\n29\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.660\nidea is not to have it tied\nto your domain controller.\n\n30\n00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.800\nSo the best practice at that point\nwould be for you to go ahead and\n\n31\n00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.940\ninstall whatever Server edition,\nI would recommend Server 2016,\n\n32\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.720\nmake sure it meets all of\nthe actual prerequisite and\n\n33\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.280\nrequirements there, and then run\nthe Azure AD Connect tool there, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.650\nThe only other requirement that\nyou have is that, of course,\n\n35\n00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150\nthat you give the access to the domain\ncontroller and that you've already set up,\n\n36\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.840\nof course, your AD sync admins and\nthat you're ready to go.\n\n37\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.500\nOkay, so as long as those two\nthings are actually good.\n\n38\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.830\nBecause we want that really to become the\nserver, that standalone, that allows for\n\n39\n00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.770\nthe synchronization and the management of\nit, to not necessarily be tied to that\n\n40\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.580\ndomain controller, so that\nthe synchronization can happen fully and\n\n41\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.900\nfreely without having to worry of whether\nor not it's bogging down your domain\n\n42\n00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.210\ncontroller, especially if things start\nto get a little bit hefty there.\n\n43\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.960\nSo in a production environment,\n\n44\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.900\ndo not put it on the same machine\nas your domain controller..\n\n45\n00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.647\nIn a lab environment,\nwe're gonna do it just for the ability\n\n46\n00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:29.290\nto conserve resources on my machine so\nthat I can run what we need to, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.920\nSo that's where it's actually running.\n\n48\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.960\nSo I just want to make sure I actually set\nit up before somebody goes well you're\n\n49\n00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.860\nrunning on them in controller, I should\ntoo in my Active Directory environment.\n\n50\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.529\nNo, you shouldn't, okay so let's just\nmake that perfectly clear at this point.\n\n51\n00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.410\n&gt;&gt; Do as I say, not as I do.\n\n52\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.930\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's gonna be true\non just about every lab setting,\n\n53\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.590\nespecially when you have\nlimited resources to deal with.\n\n54\n00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.410\nSo, in that sense,\njust kind of remember that, okay,\n\n55\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.220\nbecause that's the most\nrealistic situation.\n\n56\n00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.380\nIf your environment is already\nrunning Active Directory and if you've\n\n57\n00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.430\ngot things going on, you'll probably see,\nand the recommended practice for as long\n\n58\n00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.570\nas I know is let the domain controller\nbe exactly that, the domain controller.\n\n59\n00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.130\nDon't turn it into a multi-purpose server.\n\n60\n00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.970\nDon't do all that other stuff on it.\n\n61\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.810\nLet it be what it's designed to be.\n\n62\n00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.200\nAnd then build another machine to do\nthose other things that we need to do.\n\n63\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.045\nAnd that's normally the real environment,\n\n64\n00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:22.400\nthat production environment\nthat we want to do.\n\n65\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.610\nNow when you install it,\nyou download the tool.\n\n66\n00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.350\nAnd we've gone over that several\ntimes during our shows at some point.\n\n67\n00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.210\nAnd once you get all those prerequisites\nmet, you run through the installation\n\n68\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.450\nprocess, and everything should be up and\nready to go.\n\n69\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.460\nAnd your result should pretty much look\nlike what I have on my screen, too, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.049\nSo I'm running this on a 2016 Server.\n\n71\n00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.356\nI am now logged in as Cherokee and\nhere it is, the Azure AD Connect tool and\n\n72\n00:03:49.356 --> 00:03:54.054\nends up leaving for us a nice\nshortcut right here on the desktop,\n\n73\n00:03:54.054 --> 00:03:57.198\nwhich is the Azure AD Connect tool, okay?\n\n74\n00:03:57.198 --> 00:04:01.294\nNow if you leave it running long enough\nby itself without you kind of clicking\n\n75\n00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:04.750\nthrough and trying to examine it,\nand after a while it will start\n\n76\n00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.200\nbuilding other information if you've\nalready got things set up for you.\n\n77\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.855\nLet me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about,\n\n78\n00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:15.335\nby launching the Active Directory Users\nand Computers here.\n\n79\n00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:20.570\nSo inside of Active Directory Users and\nComputers, if I go down to Users,\n\n80\n00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.010\nyou will see here is the ADSyncAdmins\n\n81\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.142\ngroup that I created earlier\nin one of the episodes I did.\n\n82\n00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:35.370\nAnd Inside that are the members here,\nwhich is Cherokee and Zach.\n\n83\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.230\nSo these were the ones that we created,\n\n84\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.170\ncuz we knew that we're gonna be\ndoing the directory synchronization.\n\n85\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.250\nI wanna have at least two accounts\nthat would kinda help me out.\n\n86\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.870\nBut this one though, okay,\nthis particular account right here,\n\n87\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.330\nZach, is not one that I created.\n\n88\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.780\nI can even tell you if I created this,\nthat I would come up with this,\n\n89\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.101\neven by random that I\nwould come up with this.\n\n90\n00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:58.949\nWell this is actually generated\nas Azure Active Directory and\n\n91\n00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.780\nof course underscore and this number.\n\n92\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.442\nAnd as you see it, it actually tells you\nthat this is the Service account for\n\n93\n00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:08.299\nSynchronization Services.\n\n94\n00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:12.070\nOoh, let me see if I can\nscroll over a little bit more.\n\n95\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.011\nWith the installation identifier,\nand you see that that number\n\n96\n00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.902\nis actually longer than we think,\nas you go on through, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:20.430\nSo it's actually running on\nthat particular computer, and\n\n98\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.270\nnames the computer, which is DC01,\nwhich is the one that I'm running on.\n\n99\n00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.310\nSo that particular service\naccount is off and it is running,\n\n100\n00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.880\nit is doing what it needs\nto do in the background.\n\n101\n00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.610\nIt's allowing for\n\n102\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.310\nthat synchronization stuff to happen\nusing that particular account.\n\n103\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.878\nSo, I didn't do anything but\n\n104\n00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:41.929\njust a simple install of\nthe Azure AD Connect tool, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:46.645\nSo that's pretty much all that I did,\nand the only other thing that ended\n\n106\n00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:50.357\nup happening between the installation and,\nof course,\n\n107\n00:05:50.357 --> 00:05:55.768\nus talking about the planning, is that I\nwent in and I ran that particular command,\n\n108\n00:05:55.768 --> 00:06:00.132\nthat set up the Office 365 side,\nto also use the directory syn.\n\n109\n00:06:00.132 --> 00:06:05.710\nAnd I enabled that by setting true as\na value a Boolean value there, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.310\nSo that's some of the stuff that's\nalready going on in the background, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.380\nNow once we've got that and everything\nelse is setup, it means we are now\n\n112\n00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.180\nready to run through the tool and talk\nabout some of the different aspects and\n\n113\n00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.290\nelements that we have to\nunderstand as we go through this.\n\n114\n00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.007\nCuz there are a few different\nrequirements that we may have to choose\n\n115\n00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:31.336\nhere depending on what is set up.\n\n116\n00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:34.789\nNow, one other kind of\nprerequisite requirement,\n\n117\n00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.161\nbecause I know how things\nare gonna end up working,\n\n118\n00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:44.200\nif I run this completely right now, okay,\nand just run through it as fast as I can.\n\n119\n00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.120\nUsually that's my habit, right?\n\n120\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.954\nI'm not patient, I wanna run through it, I\nwanna see what it does in the end result,\n\n121\n00:06:49.954 --> 00:06:51.259\nand I don't think about it.\n\n122\n00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:56.130\nI may end up with some issues,\nokay, that I didn't even expect.\n\n123\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.330\nSo what are some of those\nissues that I don't expect?\n\n124\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.040\nIt happens to deal with the account that I\nam using right now on this computer, which\n\n125\n00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.680\nI know it's hard to see but you can barely\nsee it, is Cherokee's account, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.190\nSo Cherokee is logged\nin with this account.\n\n127\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:19.128\nNow, if this account has a different\npassword, because this is a domain\n\n128\n00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:24.020\njoined machine, it's my domain controller,\nso she has the ability to do that.\n\n129\n00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.213\nShe has a different password than\nthe one that I created in Office 365.\n\n130\n00:07:29.213 --> 00:07:32.331\nZach, I've been using that\nsuper secret password.\n\n131\n00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:36.060\nYou know, the one that's like 15 or\n20 characters long at this point.\n\n132\n00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.450\nIf I'm using that, and\n\n133\n00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.370\nI do the direct resynchronization,\nokay, this is where things get tricky.\n\n134\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.500\nAnd this is what we have to understand\nabout what's gonna happen here,\n\n135\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.250\nwhich has to deal with\nthe source of authority\n\n136\n00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.171\nof what's gonna happen when\nthings start to sync up, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.621\nSo if that happens,\nif I set up another password.\n\n138\n00:07:55.621 --> 00:07:59.407\nSo, just as an example, so\nplease don't persecute me for this.\n\n139\n00:07:59.407 --> 00:08:04.870\nLet's say I say it's password one\nas Per domain password here, okay?\n\n140\n00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.167\nIf I do that, and then I sync up with the\nOffice 365 with the super secret password,\n\n141\n00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:15.460\nwhat is actually eventually going to\nhappen between both of those accounts?\n\n142\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.320\nThe one that's in Office 365, and the one\nthat's on my on-premises active directory,\n\n143\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.160\nwhich password actually\nends up taking place here?\n\n144\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.980\nWell, that's the key, is how do you know\nwhat's actually gonna end up happening or\n\n145\n00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.330\nwhat could happen here.\n\n146\n00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.300\nWell, what could actually\nend up happening,\n\n147\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.610\nright, is that the on-premises\nActive Directory password at that point\n\n148\n00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.340\nends up being the one that's\nsynced up to the Office 365 Cloud.\n\n149\n00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.885\nAnd the next time that Cherokee tries to\nlog in with the super secret password,\n\n150\n00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:48.280\nit's not there, it doesn't end up working.\n\n151\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.560\nIt actually checks and goes, hey, that\npassword is supposed to be the one that is\n\n152\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.450\nin the on-premises active\ndirectory instead.\n\n153\n00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.030\nAnd that can cause some issues, especially\nif you are not paying attention.\n\n154\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.920\nNow, it does not matter if Cherokee\nis logged on the Office365,\n\n155\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.340\nit's going to stay with her original\ncredentials until she logs off, or\n\n156\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:12.120\nuntil she clicks some place else inside\nof the admin portal that leads her some\n\n157\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.420\nplace else, such as the Azure\nactive directory portal instead.\n\n158\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.830\nThen it's going to ask her to\nrun the new credentials, and\n\n159\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.940\nif I don't know what those credentials\nwere, now I'm actually in trouble.\n\n160\n00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.380\nSo you want to make sure that you\nunderstand that there are a few\n\n161\n00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.450\ntricky things that can happen if\nyou're not paying attention okay?\n\n162\n00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.189\nSo the good thing is I've paid attention,\nand\n\n163\n00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:40.965\ninstead to make sure that everything ended\nup working the way that I wanted it to,\n\n164\n00:09:40.965 --> 00:09:43.918\nI also took Cherokee's\non-premises password,\n\n165\n00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:48.555\nright here in this active directory\nthat you're, you're not seeing it, but\n\n166\n00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:53.367\nright here on this machine, inside of\nthis active directory right here, okay?\n\n167\n00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:56.389\nFor Cherokee's account right here, okay,\n\n168\n00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:59.895\nI have set it to match what\nwas actually in the Cloud.\n\n169\n00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:00.627\nAnd that way,\n\n170\n00:10:00.627 --> 00:10:05.570\nthe password should be the same which ever\nway at least at the initial beginning.\n\n171\n00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.210\nSo let's review it in a little\nbit of a different fashion here.\n\n172\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.750\nLet me see if I can bring up\nmy simple diagram again, okay?\n\n173\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.660\nAnd let's talk about what should\nend up happening as well, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.290\nSo with the Azure AD, a couple of\nthings can end up happening for\n\n175\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.650\nwhat we want, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.310\nSo if we start setting things up,\nright now, currently, okay,\n\n177\n00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.670\nfor everything that we're doing,\nwe haven't done any synchronization,\n\n178\n00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.420\nnothing is happening here, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:40.068\nRemember that the active directory,\nITProTV Demo, If I sign on it's going\n\n180\n00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:45.557\nto check against the active directory\nright here inside of my own domain.\n\n181\n00:10:45.557 --> 00:10:47.875\nIt works perfectly fine, no big deal.\n\n182\n00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:50.640\nIt gives me access to\nthe resources I need right here.\n\n183\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.730\nSo the source of authority for that user\naccount is right here at ITProTV demo.\n\n184\n00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.200\nIf that same user takes his laptop,\nopens up a web browser,\n\n185\n00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.160\nand he's at Starbucks for one reason or\nanother, I don't know, I'm joking.\n\n186\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.970\nStarbucks is a perfectly fine place,\nI go there with my daughter.\n\n187\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.621\nIf he goes there, okay,\nand logs into Office 365,\n\n188\n00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:16.588\nenters in his username and password, well,\n\n189\n00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:22.076\nhis account will again check against\nthe Azure Active Directory in Office 365.\n\n190\n00:11:22.076 --> 00:11:24.250\nAnd it's source of\nauthority is right here.\n\n191\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.766\nNotice that it's not going back\nover here to the IPTPRO.TV demo.\n\n192\n00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:31.932\nIt actually is gonna be it's\nown source of authority.\n\n193\n00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:35.170\nSo, essentially,\ntwo different accounts, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.280\nCan they have the exact same password?\n\n195\n00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.700\nYeah, they are actually two different\naccounts with the same password.\n\n196\n00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.590\nCould they have the same possible name?\n\n197\n00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.490\nYeah, because we are not even talking\nabout two systems that are tied together.\n\n198\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:53.660\nThese are two separate systems which will\nuse the same central ID and passwords.\n\n199\n00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:59.880\nSo this gives us that ability to do\nwhat we call simply has the same log-on.\n\n200\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.300\n&gt;&gt; I've just used the same log-on\ninformation in both places.\n\n201\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.940\nBut if I want to begin for\nthem to coexist where I want them to have\n\n202\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.720\nthe use of a single one, well then, this\nis where it becomes a little bit trickier.\n\n203\n00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.450\nAnd depending on how you set it up,\n\n204\n00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.110\nwe can now have what we call\nsingle sign-on instead.\n\n205\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.030\nWe're going to into that when we\nactually set up federation services.\n\n206\n00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:26.560\nBut at this point, notice users will\nhave a single identity to access both.\n\n207\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.110\nIf we run the synchronization\nbetween them, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.400\nNow, from this point on,\nonce everything is synchronized,\n\n209\n00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:41.240\nthe initial source of authority\nbegins over here in the Cloud.\n\n210\n00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.000\nBut once everything is synchronized,\nit transfers that authority\n\n211\n00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.800\nover here to the on-premises\nactive directory.\n\n212\n00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.890\nSo even if the user is actually\nlogging into Office 365,\n\n213\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.980\nit checks that credential or\nthe hash of that credential,\n\n214\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.900\nwhatever you wanna call it,\nagainst the source of authority over here.\n\n215\n00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.990\nAnd this side says yeah,\nthat's actually right.\n\n216\n00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.420\nOr it says nope, that's not correct.\n\n217\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.290\nAnd that person will be\nable to access this,\n\n218\n00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.080\nbecause this side says it's actually okay.\n\n219\n00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.350\nThis person will also access this\nbecause this side says it's okay.\n\n220\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.790\nSo notice the source of authority.\n\n221\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.230\nOnce this happens at this point,\n\n222\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.900\nthat means that\nthe synchronization will change.\n\n223\n00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.478\nLet me see if I can grab that arrow for\na moment, and increase it,\n\n224\n00:13:27.478 --> 00:13:30.347\nand change the color just so\nthat we can see it here.\n\n225\n00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.974\nSee if I've actually got the right one,\nokay?\n\n226\n00:13:33.974 --> 00:13:35.813\nIt will change, essentially,\n\n227\n00:13:35.813 --> 00:13:40.450\nwhere the synchronization happens\nin this direction first, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.530\nUnless we actually choose some of\nthe things to happen in what we call right\n\n229\n00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.920\nback fashion instead, okay?\n\n230\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.390\nSo now, once everything is done,\n\n231\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.900\nthe source of authority in terms\nof synchronization of information\n\n232\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.530\nwill then happen over here and\nsync up to the Cloud, okay?\n\n233\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.930\nThis will also include\nthings like deleting users,\n\n234\n00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.760\ncreating users, doing all that stuff here.\n\n235\n00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.610\nIf I now try and\ndelete a user over here in Office 365,\n\n236\n00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.270\nit's gonna give me an error that\nsays you can't do that from here.\n\n237\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.510\nIf you want to do that,\ngo over to the source of authority.\n\n238\n00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.120\nGo over to the on-premises\nActive Directory and\n\n239\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.200\ndelete it over here,\nwait that synchronization time period, and\n\n240\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.210\nthen that will end up\nsynchronizing back over here, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.180\nSo you do need to pay attention to that or\n\n242\n00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.060\nit's going to seem a little bit weird as\nyou try and get things up and working.\n\n243\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.870\nSo, those are some of the things\nwe also have to think about\n\n244\n00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.850\nas we continue to go through, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.790\nThe other consideration,\nonce we start doing this, let's see here.\n\n246\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.060\nLet me get that kinda going on.\n\n247\n00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.570\nThere are some basic assumptions when\nwe start working with multi-forest\n\n248\n00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.990\naccounts as well.\n\n249\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.431\nNow, this is a little bit different in\nthat there are multi-forest assumptions\n\n250\n00:14:56.431 --> 00:14:58.000\nthat are here.\n\n251\n00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.810\nA user inside of Office 365,\n\n252\n00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:04.040\nit actually assumes that you're\ngoing to end up with one account.\n\n253\n00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.963\nSo, even if you have two different\naccounts that are available there,\n\n254\n00:15:06.963 --> 00:15:08.340\nyou're going to end up with one.\n\n255\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.620\nEven if you have multiple mailboxes for\none reason or another,\n\n256\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.345\nbecause you have two different\nforests that are going on,\n\n257\n00:15:15.345 --> 00:15:18.340\nit's gonna assume that you\nreally want one, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.440\nSo what if you have one account\nthat doesn't have any mail in it?\n\n259\n00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.930\nWell, then you can actually use another\n\n260\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.402\nattribute that will sync\nup both of those first.\n\n261\n00:15:26.402 --> 00:15:30.400\nOr if you have a linked mailbox, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.840\nIt will also give you something\nelse that you can do as well.\n\n263\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.140\nBut just kinda realize that the whole\ngoal behind all of this, right, is that\n\n264\n00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.250\nthere has to be a way in Office 365, when\nyou have multiple forests that are tied to\n\n265\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.370\nyour user account, that your user account,\nor whoever you are in Office 365,\n\n266\n00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.080\ncan be identified as one account,\nis what it can be done, all right?\n\n267\n00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.720\nSo, very important process\nthat we remember that.\n\n268\n00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.890\nSo, even with multiple forests, it's\ngoing to try and whittle it down to one.\n\n269\n00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.046\nAnd the way it does that is by using\ncertain attributes between both of them.\n\n270\n00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:06.772\nTo link those two first, and\nthen that gets reported to Office 365.\n\n271\n00:16:06.772 --> 00:16:09.793\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, I think that would\nbe easier on the end user, the users,\n\n272\n00:16:09.793 --> 00:16:12.330\neven the admin,\nto have just the one password.\n\n273\n00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:12.884\nDon't you think?\n\n274\n00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:14.430\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it really would be.\n\n275\n00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.680\nSo that's why most people\nare starting to do this.\n\n276\n00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.032\nA few years ago,\njust a couple of years ago, okay,\n\n277\n00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:26.891\nthis was really not kind\nof a forefront idea.\n\n278\n00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:29.515\nAnd that means that people just said,\nlook, let's just do this.\n\n279\n00:16:29.515 --> 00:16:34.010\nWe'll make the same account on Office\n365 as we have inside of our own\n\n280\n00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.560\nActive Directory network.\n\n281\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.155\nThat's fine,\nuntil you can't sync up Windows.\n\n282\n00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:43.033\nThose particular changes are to happen if\nyou enforce password policy online inside\n\n283\n00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:44.613\nof your Active Directory,\n\n284\n00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:48.410\nand then if you actually don't\nenforce it in your Office 365.\n\n285\n00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.680\n&gt;&gt; But within a couple years, and\n\n286\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.340\nof course with the advent\nof the connect tool,\n\n287\n00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:00.760\nthe Azure AD Connect tool, I'm gonna\nnot remember that, that connect tool.\n\n288\n00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.750\nWell, that has helped out tremendously,\n\n289\n00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.160\nof everything else that we've done\nthat says I can make all this work.\n\n290\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.790\nTrust me, I can do this,\nif that's what has to be done.\n\n291\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.060\nSo it's important that we at least\ntake that time to understand\n\n292\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.300\nthat there's some complexity issues\nbehind this, before you click.\n\n293\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.161\nAnd let me try and\nfind that machine, there we go.\n\n294\n00:17:24.161 --> 00:17:26.821\nBefore we run, and we go all right,\n\n295\n00:17:26.821 --> 00:17:31.257\nI'm gonna click on this tool and\njust let it run like crazy,\n\n296\n00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:35.805\nyou've got to know what is ahead\nof you as you do this, okay?\n\n297\n00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:40.098\nSo without me trying to leave this alone\nfor a long time, what can happen is if you\n\n298\n00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:43.815\nleave this alone long enough, or\nif you just explored it and you kinda\n\n299\n00:17:43.815 --> 00:17:48.044\nwent backwards, it will assume that\nyou've already done some of the setup and\n\n300\n00:17:48.044 --> 00:17:51.730\nit will lead you to a different\nplace when you first open it.\n\n301\n00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.445\nSo if it assumes that you've already\nrun it, it says you've already run this\n\n302\n00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:59.105\none time, some things are already\ngonna be set up for us, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:59.105 --> 00:18:03.705\nSo notice at the very beginning,\nthe Active Directory or\n\n304\n00:18:03.705 --> 00:18:07.055\nthe Azure Active Directory Connect\ntool here, okay?\n\n305\n00:18:07.055 --> 00:18:11.955\nIt will go ahead and\nassume that you are doing this for\n\n306\n00:18:11.955 --> 00:18:15.570\na single domain.\n\n307\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.548\nIf you have a single Windows Server Active\nDirectory forest, here's what we'll do.\n\n308\n00:18:19.548 --> 00:18:21.480\nAnd notice all the things it will do.\n\n309\n00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.915\nConfigure the synchronization\nof identities,\n\n310\n00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:26.470\nthat says I'll go ahead and I'll do that.\n\n311\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:31.250\nI'll sync up what I have here versus what\nI see up in Active Directory in the cloud.\n\n312\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.620\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand this example, Zach.\n\n313\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.870\nSo there's an account for you inside\nof the on premises Active Directory.\n\n314\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.320\nEarlier though, during our series\nof shows, I made an account for\n\n315\n00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.040\nyou where, inside of Office 365.\n\n316\n00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.070\nSo this is saying,\nI'll take a look at both of those, okay.\n\n317\n00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.460\nAnd whatever matches up, I'll say hey,\nthat account looks like on premises,\n\n318\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.920\nlooks like it matches up\nto the Office 365 account.\n\n319\n00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.720\nSo I'll go ahead and synchronize\nbased off of that information, too.\n\n320\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.690\nSecondly, it will configure\npassword synchronization.\n\n321\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.190\nAnd notice the key here, Zach.\n\n322\n00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.050\nLook at the directionality\nof that second step.\n\n323\n00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.666\nConfigure password synchronization,\n\n324\n00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:24.140\nnotice the directionality,\non-premises to Azure AD by default.\n\n325\n00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:30.800\nThat is key, the default configuration\nhere is on-premises to Azure AD.\n\n326\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.426\nIf we say then in Office 365, I go, Zach,\n\n327\n00:19:34.426 --> 00:19:37.288\nI'm gonna change your\npassword in Office 365.\n\n328\n00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:39.760\nAnd I click on reset the password.\n\n329\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.752\nI type it in,\nI tell it to save the changes.\n\n330\n00:19:42.752 --> 00:19:45.500\nAnd I come back, and\nit's gonna tell me password didn't save.\n\n331\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.140\nWhy didn't it save?\n\n332\n00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.310\nBecause it's actually\nexpecting synchronization.\n\n333\n00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.911\nAnd according to this, the source of\nauthority is from the on premises,\n\n334\n00:19:55.911 --> 00:19:58.030\nwhere the source of authority is.\n\n335\n00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:02.177\nAnd it actually filters up to Azure AD.\n\n336\n00:20:02.177 --> 00:20:04.760\n&gt;&gt; It sounds like that might be something\nvery important on the exam too.\n\n337\n00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.064\n&gt;&gt; It could be, yeah.\n\n338\n00:20:06.064 --> 00:20:07.510\n&gt;&gt; It could be!\n&gt;&gt; There you go, yeah.\n\n339\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.190\nSo just kind of realize\nthat this is a part of it.\n\n340\n00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.220\nAnd then of course,\nthe initial synchronization.\n\n341\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.450\nNow this initial synchronization\nmeans all the stuff that\n\n342\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.970\nit thinks it can go ahead and match up and\ndo, it's gonna start the synchronization.\n\n343\n00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.400\nAnd then this is kinda the key here.\n\n344\n00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.170\nRemember in a previous episode,\nactually I think in the one right before.\n\n345\n00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:32.560\nI said there's gonna be issues if we just\ngo, all right, I don't want this anymore.\n\n346\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.930\nI'm just gonna go ahead and\nuninstall Office 365.\n\n347\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:42.620\nThis one is the scary one,\nsynchronize all attributes, okay?\n\n348\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.200\nWhen you start doing that, you're saying,\n\n349\n00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.220\nhey, we're actually making sure that\neverything that's up here in Office 365\n\n350\n00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.240\nmatches what is in the on-premises\nActive Directory, as well.\n\n351\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.360\nSo if it begins to synchronize\nevery single attribute,\n\n352\n00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.360\nit's saying I should find\na match to it somewhere.\n\n353\n00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.620\nIf you go, I'm not gonna give you that\nability to find the match, someone's going\n\n354\n00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.280\nto actually raise an alarm and go, yeah,\nI don't think I'm letting you do that.\n\n355\n00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.128\nBecause if you do that,\nI'm gonna break the synchronization here.\n\n356\n00:21:12.128 --> 00:21:14.100\nAnd that's not going to work.\n\n357\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.010\nSo you might have to kind of\nfirst of all then, stop or\n\n358\n00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.770\ndisable that synchronization, okay?\n\n359\n00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.320\nAnd the easiest way is by\nusing that PowerShell command,\n\n360\n00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.300\nthe same one that we used to enable it,\nokay?\n\n361\n00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.730\nWhich was the,\nmake sure I'm telling you right here,\n\n362\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:35.240\nthe Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled command, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.757\nAnd then, we did -EnableDirSync\nwith the dollar sign true.\n\n364\n00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.570\nWe would set that one\nto dollar sign false.\n\n365\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.230\nStop the synchronization first.\n\n366\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.220\nAnd then from that point, once you\nensure that that's all stopped and\n\n367\n00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:55.430\nthat there's nothing synching up, then you\ncan start to carefully uninstall things,\n\n368\n00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.686\nor delete things that you want to.\n\n369\n00:21:57.686 --> 00:22:00.380\nYou might find out that there is still\nsome things that you're not gonna be able\n\n370\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.920\nto do through the GUI interface anymore.\n\n371\n00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.500\nAnd that means you'll have\nto rely on PowerShell and\n\n372\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.090\nsome of those remove\ndash commands instead.\n\n373\n00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.610\nAnd that will get you through that too.\n\n374\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.470\nSo not everything is as easy as,\nI'm just gonna check all these and\n\n375\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.610\njust delete them out.\n\n376\n00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.130\nIt's not gonna work that way.\n\n377\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.480\nAnd I hope that I'll be able to\nshow you some of this issues and\n\n378\n00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.760\nproblems that I'm talking about.\n\n379\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.870\nCuz that's where it gets\na little bit tricky.\n\n380\n00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.202\nEspecially, you'll find out something,\nZach, that it might be where you go,\n\n381\n00:22:28.202 --> 00:22:32.848\nI wanted everybody synched up except for\nthose ten accounts there.\n\n382\n00:22:32.848 --> 00:22:35.050\nWell, now that those ten\naccounts have synced up,\n\n383\n00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.190\nnow you have to get rid of them.\n\n384\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.930\nAnd all of a sudden,\nyou're fighting every inch of the way\n\n385\n00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.130\nbecause it's not working\nthe way that you do.\n\n386\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:46.555\nAnd the other thing, if you read\non Microsoft's Office 365 site,\n\n387\n00:22:46.555 --> 00:22:49.930\nis that for troubleshooting,\nit says do not ever just\n\n388\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.830\ndisable the directory synchronization\njust for troubleshooting.\n\n389\n00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.592\nSo even their own documentation says,\n\n390\n00:22:57.592 --> 00:23:01.617\ndon't just disable and\nenable it for troubleshooting.\n\n391\n00:23:01.617 --> 00:23:05.957\nSo now it just says hey, I didn't want\nthis to happen, and throwing errors.\n\n392\n00:23:05.957 --> 00:23:08.640\nIt's saying, don't turn off\nthe directory synchronization.\n\n393\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.490\nSo this is actually saying that this\ncan kind of mess some things up,\n\n394\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.305\nif you're not careful.\n\n395\n00:23:12.305 --> 00:23:16.350\nSo be aware that if you're doing this,\nit is a major issue for\n\n396\n00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.220\nyou to stop the synchronization process.\n\n397\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.865\nEspecially in a production environment\nwhere things are constantly changing,\n\n398\n00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:24.340\nthat you may not want that to happen.\n\n399\n00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.000\nSo be aware that this is kind\nof a key here on some things.\n\n400\n00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.020\nNow, I say that not so\nmuch for the exam, right?\n\n401\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.080\nBut in real life, when stuff like this\nhappens, don't just go, Ronnie just said\n\n402\n00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:38.400\nlet me stop the synchronization and\neverything should be fine.\n\n403\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.730\nExcept when everybody on the planet is\ntrying to connect to your Office 365 and\n\n404\n00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.560\nget stuff done, and\nnow you've disabled the synchronization,\n\n405\n00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.690\nsource of authority is gone,\nnow you're toast.\n\n406\n00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.880\nSo be aware [LAUGH].\n\n407\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.920\nSo things can actually happen\nhere that you are not sure of.\n\n408\n00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.270\nSo let's take a look, then.\n\n409\n00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.286\nNow once again, my preaching has kind of\ngotten to the extreme here, at this point.\n\n410\n00:23:59.286 --> 00:23:59.836\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n411\n00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:04.335\nlook at the two options that we have right\ndown here at the bottom of the scream.\n\n412\n00:24:04.335 --> 00:24:05.509\nScreen, scream?\n\n413\n00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:06.177\n&gt;&gt; Scream.\n\n414\n00:24:06.177 --> 00:24:09.279\n&gt;&gt; Scream, it is Halloween,\nat least for our sake.\n\n415\n00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:12.050\n&gt;&gt; Scream! [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; On the bottom\nof the screen here, okay.\n\n416\n00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.660\nNotice one says, use express settings.\n\n417\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.245\nThe other one says Customize.\n\n418\n00:24:15.245 --> 00:24:17.840\nWe've just told you what\nthe express settings do.\n\n419\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.056\nAnd the idea behind\nthe express settings is simple.\n\n420\n00:24:20.056 --> 00:24:24.489\nOne domain, one forest, done, okay?\n\n421\n00:24:24.489 --> 00:24:26.200\nAnd that's all you have to do.\n\n422\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.832\nBut remember, if there's any\nother additional complexity,\n\n423\n00:24:29.832 --> 00:24:33.370\nyou're using multi-factor authentication.\n\n424\n00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.160\nYou decide in the future that\nyou're probably gonna end up using\n\n425\n00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.140\nsingle sign-on in the future.\n\n426\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.300\nYou end up doing anything\nelse where you go,\n\n427\n00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.060\nI'm gonna possibly have another forest.\n\n428\n00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.765\nThat may be something\nelse I need to add in.\n\n429\n00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:49.130\nThen using the express heading,\neven though you can do that now,\n\n430\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.210\nit's probably better if you actually\nthink about planning and setting it up.\n\n431\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.450\nAnd if you have to, that means you're\ngonna select the Customize instead.\n\n432\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.970\nWell, even though I only have a single\nforest, I want us to walk through\n\n433\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.570\nthese options that we see over here on\nthe left hand side, to help us out and\n\n434\n00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.300\nto make sure that we understand what\nit is that we're actually seeing.\n\n435\n00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.050\nAnd so each of these options,\nwhere we see single user sign-in,\n\n436\n00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.200\nand we'll talk about some of these\ndifferent options that are available.\n\n437\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.630\nConnecting, and\nthen the synchronization, and\n\n438\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.930\nall these filtering options,\nwe still need to actually go through and\n\n439\n00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.540\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat's happening here, okay?\n\n440\n00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.330\nNow, Zach,\nthere's a lot of information here.\n\n441\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.780\nAnd I realize I only have two minutes\nleft, really, when it comes down to it.\n\n442\n00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.730\nSo Zach, it looks like it's better\nif we actually take this and\n\n443\n00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.150\ngo into another part.\n\n444\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.406\n&gt;&gt; Hey, that's okay with me,\nbecause you've been doing an awesome job.\n\n445\n00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:41.530\nAnd so this has been\nSet Up Azure AD Connect Tool, Part Two.\n\n446\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.940\nThere will be Part Three.\n\n447\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.896\nSee all of those, and\nsee everything in the Office 365 series.\n\n448\n00:25:45.896 --> 00:25:47.860\nRonnie's an amazing teacher.\n\n449\n00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.720\nAnd also in our course library,\nthere's hundreds of other videos.\n\n450\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.870\nAnd they're all designed\nto help you go further.\n\n451\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:55.764\nAnd tell someone you know about ITProTV.\n\n452\n00:25:55.764 --> 00:25:56.764\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n453\n00:25:56.764 --> 00:25:58.350\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n454\n00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.140\n&gt;&gt; And, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n455\n00:25:59.140 --> 00:25:59.696\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n456\n00:25:59.696 --> 00:26:06.799\n[MUSIC]\n\n457\n00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:09.470\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.323\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:11.921\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:14.041\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.370\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.990\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.596\nAs we continue on with Office 365.\n\n9\n00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:25.310\nThis is part three of set\nup Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n10\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.510\nAnd who should bring us this information?\n\n11\n00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.410\nWhy, it's Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.468\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie thanks for joining us.\n\n13\n00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:35.130\n&gt;&gt; Thank you Zach for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to dive into some\n\n14\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.840\nof the details inside of\nthe Azure AD Connect tool, and\n\n15\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.240\nthis is really where we're starting\nto begin to use the tool itself.\n\n16\n00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.450\nSo in a previous episode, we kind of led\nyou up to this point and talked about\n\n17\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.240\nthe express settings, that, and what it\nactually accomplishes for us with a single\n\n18\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.870\ndomain and a single forest, and\nnow we're moving onto the customization.\n\n19\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.260\nIf we have anything beyond the complexity,\nand\n\n20\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.310\nwhat we've been talking about in terms\nof single forces, single domain.\n\n21\n00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.600\nThis is where we gonna need to\nset up the customized settings.\n\n22\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.380\nAnd this will get us an opportunity\nto walk through those NAS where\n\n23\n00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.540\nwe are right now.\n\n24\n00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.060\nLet's go ahead and\njump right then to this, so\n\n25\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.170\nthat we can see that should be\nhappening for us as we go through here.\n\n26\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.420\nSo, instead of actually ending up\nchoosing the Express Settings which\n\n27\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.940\nwould have been perfectly fine for\nwhat we're doing.\n\n28\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.800\nAnd that's probably all I should do but\nfor\n\n29\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.260\nus to take a look at the complex settings.\n\n30\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.960\nNotice that once we get into it, and\n\n31\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.990\nwe chose to customize, the first\nthing here is about the User Sign-on.\n\n32\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.110\nAnd this is where we have four\ndifferent methods that we can choose,\n\n33\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.130\ndepending on what we actually\nwant to do here, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.550\nSo let's make sure we understand these\noptions in terms of user sign-on, and\n\n35\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.790\nwhat it's going to do for us, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.590\nWhen we start with this idea of connecting\nthe Active Directories together we\n\n37\n00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.100\nhave to think about what's going to happen\nwith our passwords and the sign-ons and\n\n38\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950\nwhat we end up doing it, okay?\n\n39\n00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.040\nSo now with these four options available\nconsider what was gonna be here, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.540\nAlso as you do this on your own take\na look at when you hover over that\n\n41\n00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.680\nblue dot every once in a while\nmine disappears very quickly.\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.510\nI'm kinda surprised it actually stayed\nup as long as it has right now.\n\n43\n00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.810\nBut you'll actually be able to see some\ninformation, and you wanna get these\n\n44\n00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.500\nparticular scenarios in your mind,\nas what you actually end up using here.\n\n45\n00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.980\nIt's gonna be the key.\n\n46\n00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.425\nNow once you set this up it doesn't\nmean you can't run back through this and\n\n47\n00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:27.740\nreset it up again.\n\n48\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.300\nBut in the end I'm gonna choose\njust the do not configure for\n\n49\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.940\nright now because we are gonna get into\nthe other signing of what we wanna do.\n\n50\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.100\nBut by default,\nthis is probably the first one here, okay,\n\n51\n00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.340\nwhich is gonna be\nthe Password Synchronization.\n\n52\n00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.010\nWith Password Synchronization,\nif we choose this option,\n\n53\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.695\neven though we are connecting\nthe Active Directory tool together,\n\n54\n00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:52.970\nokay, we're still actually\nhaving two different accounts.\n\n55\n00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.930\nSo the synchronization will take\nwhatever is in my Active Directory, and\n\n56\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.570\nthen if Zach has an account there\nit will link it up and match.\n\n57\n00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.030\nIf someone does it, lets take for\n\n58\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.920\nan example Taylor, if he does not have\nan account on Office 365, it will create\n\n59\n00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.708\na duplicate account in Office 365\nof what he has here on his Azure.\n\n60\n00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:18.276\nOn his on-premises Active Directory,\nand will then create another\n\n61\n00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:23.090\naccount that will be named exactly\nthe same thing over an Office 365.\n\n62\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.520\nThe second thing it would do is this\nidea of password synchronization.\n\n63\n00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.850\nPassword synchronization will then\nlook at the source of authority,\n\n64\n00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.240\nwhich is the on-premises\nsource of authority for us.\n\n65\n00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.360\nAnd it will say here's the password.\n\n66\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.440\nAnd Office 365 will say,\nI don't have a password at this point.\n\n67\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.860\nAnd then it will actually say, well,\n\n68\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.840\nmake your password the same\nas the on-premises side.\n\n69\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.030\nSo you have really this idea\nof two accounts here, right.\n\n70\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.940\nWhere you have one for\nyour on-premises with a password,\n\n71\n00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.050\nyou also have the Office 365 account,\n\n72\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.140\nthey’ll end up having the same password\nas well and the same user account too.\n\n73\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.110\nBetween those they will\nend up synchronizing\n\n74\n00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.370\nbased on the password itself.\n\n75\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.920\nSo in that sense here,\n\n76\n00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.080\nthey are still two separate accounts\nthat are actually being used, but\n\n77\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.470\nthe only thing that they're really sharing\nbetween them is really that password.\n\n78\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.050\nIf we enable another feature and I'm not\nexactly sure where it actually occurs in\n\n79\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.240\nthis, where it's password write back.\n\n80\n00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.694\nI can change the actual password in Office\n365, and that will allow me to write\n\n81\n00:04:28.694 --> 00:04:32.312\nthe feature back to the on-premises and\nchange it there as well.\n\n82\n00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:36.465\nBut normally by default, if that's not\nactually enabled the password write back,\n\n83\n00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.686\nit means that if I wanna\nchange the password,\n\n84\n00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:41.920\nI'll have to change it on\nthe on-premises side instead, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.480\nSo that is that Password Synchronization,\nif you choose that particular option.\n\n86\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.040\nThe second option here, okay,\nis Pass-through authentication.\n\n87\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.760\nNow, notice how similar that they sound.\n\n88\n00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.700\nAnd even the little description\nthat they put with these\n\n89\n00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.330\nquestion marks that are here.\n\n90\n00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.820\nThey actually almost sound the same, too.\n\n91\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.740\nThe first one,\nthis option allows users to sign-in\n\n92\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.680\nto the cloud using the same password\nthat they use in the on-premises here.\n\n93\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.552\nPassword synchronization does not store or\nsend clear text.\n\n94\n00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:17.870\nThey're just saying, look they're gonna\nmatch on both sides that's pretty much it.\n\n95\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.346\nNow, if I select this one here, okay.\n\n96\n00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:26.958\nHere it goes it's gonna disappear on\nme really quickly and yep, I'm trying.\n\n97\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.037\n&gt;&gt; That happened last time,\ndidn't it, Ron?\n\n98\n00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:28.920\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it sure did.\n\n99\n00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.742\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:31.748\n&gt;&gt; So,\njust trying to get it to pass up here.\n\n101\n00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:35.600\nIt's not gonna work, but it almost\nsays almost the identical thing so\n\n102\n00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.026\nI'm not gonna get it to come up.\n\n103\n00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:40.140\nIf I won't and even trying it would\nprobably come back up here but\n\n104\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.560\nit almost sounds exactly alike.\n\n105\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.470\nSo, what's the difference here, okay?\n\n106\n00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.750\nThe difference in Pass-through, okay,\nis that what it will do instead is,\n\n107\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.430\neven though it will\ncreate an account here,\n\n108\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.400\nand it will also create\nthe idea of a password?\n\n109\n00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.030\nIt's not actually creating\ntwo separate passwords.\n\n110\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.450\nWhen you now sign-in to Office 365,\nokay, from the outside or\n\n111\n00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.520\nfrom wherever you are, it will instead,\nOffice 365 will say, I need to check your\n\n112\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.370\npassword against the on-premises password,\npassing-through Office 365,\n\n113\n00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.630\ncoming back to the on-premises side\nto check with the authentication.\n\n114\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.165\nNow, you're probably saying, well, why\nthe heck would I do something like that?\n\n115\n00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:26.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Why would I even choose to do that?\n\n116\n00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.320\nThe first one is sounds exactly\nlike what I would want to,\n\n117\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.130\nwhen I'm not having to worry about.\n\n118\n00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.010\nSo why would I choose pass-through if I\ncan do just a password synchronization?\n\n119\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.560\nLet's say that your organization\nhas a security policy\n\n120\n00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.630\nwhich has to follow\na particular password policy\n\n121\n00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.360\nthat is on-premises type of\npassword policy that you have.\n\n122\n00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.510\nIf you need for your passwords\nto follow the on-premises type\n\n123\n00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.160\nof password policy that you have set,\nthe pass-through is the way to go\n\n124\n00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.870\nto ensure that you enforce your\non-premises policies, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.370\nSo even if the user logs in Office 365,\nis gonna follow the password policies\n\n126\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.290\nthat are right there on\nthe on-premises side instead.\n\n127\n00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.420\nSo if that's your scenario,\n\n128\n00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.578\nwhere you have to ensure that\nthose policies are followed,\n\n129\n00:07:13.578 --> 00:07:19.380\nthen the pass-through is the way to go\nin terms of pass-through authentication.\n\n130\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.110\nSo the password synchronization,\n\n131\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.450\ntwo different accounts really\nsynchronizing on the password.\n\n132\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.035\nSynchronization really means two different\npasswords but they will be the same.\n\n133\n00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:33.455\nPass-through says when you present yours,\nI'm really going to check against\n\n134\n00:07:33.455 --> 00:07:39.110\nthe on-premise side and they say you're\nokay, then you can actually log on, okay.\n\n135\n00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.978\nSo that's what it is.\n\n136\n00:07:39.978 --> 00:07:42.280\nTo the end-user,\n\n137\n00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.090\nthey don't have a clue which one of these\ntwo actually happen and really don't.\n\n138\n00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.390\nIt doesn't really matter\nthem either way that it go.\n\n139\n00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.003\nIt just depends on what you need to do.\n\n140\n00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:52.388\nAnd as administrator,\n\n141\n00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:56.474\nremember following those stricter\nprocedures on those policies that\n\n142\n00:07:56.474 --> 00:08:01.830\nare placed is pretty much part of what you\nhave to be able to do to make it work.\n\n143\n00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.147\nFederation here, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:03.147 --> 00:08:07.080\nNow let me kind of cuz do you\nactually do see a change.\n\n145\n00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.740\nSo before,\n\n146\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.740\nremember that if I selected this one\nit didn't show anything at the bottom.\n\n147\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.430\nBy selecting the second one I didn't\nactually kind of emphasize this,\n\n148\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.540\nnow let's see if I can do this, okay?\n\n149\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.880\nSo if I select pass-through,\n\n150\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.710\nwe recommend that you have a cloud\nonly Company Administrator account\n\n151\n00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.680\nthat you're able to manage this in\nthe event of an on-premises failure.\n\n152\n00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.015\nNow, what is that about?\n\n153\n00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:32.490\nOkay?\nWell, what that's about is what I've said\n\n154\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.370\nin the previous episode here.\n\n155\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.040\nWhat happens is with\nthe pass-through authentication.\n\n156\n00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.860\nWhat if your on-premises Active Directory\ngoes down, or what if for some reason or\n\n157\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.370\nanother you're not able to connect your\ndomain up to the Office365 Cloud and\n\n158\n00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.440\nyou have users out there that\nare trying to connect to Office365.\n\n159\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.200\nIt cannot pass the authentication through.\n\n160\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.780\nWhen that happens, that means nobody's\ngonna be able to authenticate.\n\n161\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.370\nSo you must be careful.\n\n162\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.940\nThis is when it actually does\nI know that's a weird word.\n\n163\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.120\nYeah, to make sure that you\nhave a company administrator or\n\n164\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.360\na global administrator account okay\nthat can manage that pass-through\n\n165\n00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.480\nauthentication in the event of\nan on-premises failure, okay?\n\n166\n00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.080\nSo you have to actually worry about\nthat if you choose that pass-through\n\n167\n00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.940\nauthentication as well.\n\n168\n00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:31.050\nThe federation with using ADFS, or the\nActive Directory Federation Services here.\n\n169\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.560\nThis allows us to perform what\nwe call single sign on, okay.\n\n170\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.410\nWe present our particular methodology,\n\n171\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:45.240\nour authentication one time,\nregardless of where I go, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.170\nIn that organization or\nwith a partner organization\n\n173\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.500\nthat I'm connected through the Federation\nServices, I'm not signing on again.\n\n174\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.110\nSo it is using one\nparticular account to do so.\n\n175\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.590\nSo if I use Federation Services,\nI can access my on-premises resources.\n\n176\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:07.750\nI can access Office365 and I don't have\nto re-sign on every place that I go,\n\n177\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.870\nbecause it's federated, in that sense.\n\n178\n00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.560\nNow, on this one, notice it says\nwill install Federation Services or\n\n179\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.910\nuse an existing ADFS form.\n\n180\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.860\nNow if you're doing this,\nnoticed the requirements here, to do so.\n\n181\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.870\nSo here, it's actually going to be for\nfederation server, or even for\n\n182\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.060\nthe Web Application Proxy\nserver that's available.\n\n183\n00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.340\nNotice an SSL certificate with\nthe federation service's name\n\n184\n00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.120\nis something else we also\nhave to be able to do too.\n\n185\n00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.120\nThis is actually going to be very\nimportant for what we'll set up\n\n186\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.000\nwhen we go into the Active Directory\nFederation Services for single sign-on.\n\n187\n00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.750\nWe probably are gonna\nend up doing this one.\n\n188\n00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.000\nBut for right now, I don't want\nit to be controlled right now.\n\n189\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.410\nAnd the reason why is,\n\n190\n00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.770\nall the rest of this stuff at this\npoint in our shows are not set up.\n\n191\n00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.200\nWe have to talk about the setup of\nthat and how it has to go about.\n\n192\n00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.710\nSo we will not be choosing\nthis one right now.\n\n193\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.320\nLet's do the do not configure, okay.\n\n194\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.010\nThe do not configure is kind of strange,\nlet me see if I can zoom out a little bit.\n\n195\n00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.370\nLet's zoom out a little bit more [LAUGH].\n\n196\n00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:15.925\nAll right.\n\n197\n00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.451\nSo this option allows your user\nto do federated sign in using\n\n198\n00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:22.975\na solution not managed by\nthe wizard is what this is saying,\n\n199\n00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:27.630\nwhile logged in to the corporate network\nyour users can access cloud resources\n\n200\n00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.710\nwithout entering their passwords again.\n\n201\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.990\nSo this is going to say look,\nsomebody else is gonna manage this.\n\n202\n00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:37.010\nIn other words,\nyou're gonna do federation services but\n\n203\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.870\nnot through the management of\nthe Azure AD connect over here.\n\n204\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.170\nSo don't worry about.\n\n205\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.730\nIf I want to also set up for\nthe single sign-on and\n\n206\n00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.020\nonce again I can go ahead and\nset that up too.\n\n207\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.750\nSo I don't have to do it at this point so\nI'm not gonna worry about it,\n\n208\n00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.680\nbut it says select this option to enable\nit for your corporate desktop users too.\n\n209\n00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.110\nSo for this point I'm just\ngonna leave it blank here.\n\n210\n00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.360\nAll right.\nSo choosing that option and\n\n211\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.710\nunderstanding what each\nof those options mean,\n\n212\n00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.500\nvery important to what you'll be facing,\nnot only in the exam, but\n\n213\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.310\nalso in scenario-like situations where you\nneed to present a proper solution, and\n\n214\n00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.750\nyou need to know how that\nsolution's going to be implemented.\n\n215\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.740\nIt's right here in choosing that to\nhelp you to understand the user sign-in\n\n216\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.449\nmethodology that will end up being used.\n\n217\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.190\nNow I need to connect to Azure AD and\n\n218\n00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.240\nthis is where it gets\na little bit tricky as well.\n\n219\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.980\nSo notice it says, enter your AD\nglobal administrator credentials.\n\n220\n00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.680\nAnd notice how it actually has it set up\nhere as far as the guideline and rule.\n\n221\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.260\nOkay.\n\n222\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.870\nSo it gives us an example\nthat we're supposed to\n\n223\n00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.870\nfollow which is using\nthe onmicrosoft.com name.\n\n224\n00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.370\nNow this can work, okay but in the last\ncouple of times I've tried this\n\n225\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.225\nit's not actually worked successfully.\n\n226\n00:12:55.225 --> 00:12:56.421\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So instead,\n\n227\n00:12:56.421 --> 00:13:00.384\nI'm gonna use what I know has\nactually worked in the past here.\n\n228\n00:13:03.688 --> 00:13:06.690\nAnd then enter in that\nsuper secret password.\n\n229\n00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.549\nAnd in a moment here,\nit'll either tell me,\n\n230\n00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:21.520\nI've actually not been able to\ntype that password in correctly.\n\n231\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.360\nSo it won't let me pass through.\n\n232\n00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.350\nSo now,\nit's just verifying the credentials and\n\n233\n00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.380\nit's making sure that I can go in and\nconnect to what I need to.\n\n234\n00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.240\nSo once it's done, okay, we now have\nthe proper credentials in place for\n\n235\n00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.550\nthe connectivity to go on.\n\n236\n00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.550\nRemember that the only setup that\nI've really done that's different so\n\n237\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.040\nfar, okay, that you don't see\nin most of the guides here\n\n238\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:52.420\nis because I had Cherokee's account in\nmy on-premises Active Directory and\n\n239\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.510\nI also had her as a global\nadministrator for Office365.\n\n240\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:01.060\nI changed her on-premises password to\nmatch what I've been using in Office365.\n\n241\n00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.867\nBecause if not, it's going to change\nfrom whatever's on-premises to\n\n242\n00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:10.130\nessentially override what I\nhave in the Cloud setting.\n\n243\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.460\nSo at this point, I wouldn't change\nthat so it should match up so\n\n244\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.160\nshouldn't have any issues, but who knows.\n\n245\n00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.220\nWe'll actually try this\nfrom this point here.\n\n246\n00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.620\nAll right.\n\n247\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.418\nSo connect your directories,\nenter the connection information for\n\n248\n00:14:22.418 --> 00:14:24.913\nyour on-premises directories or Forests.\n\n249\n00:14:24.913 --> 00:14:28.490\nOkay?\nThis is where you have this particular\n\n250\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.200\nopportunity, to be able to add in\nmultiple forests if you need to.\n\n251\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.670\nNow for us, we only have one,\nso I'm not so worried about it.\n\n252\n00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.500\nBut if I had, let's say itprotvdemo.org,\n\n253\n00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.755\nif I had itprotvdemo.net,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n254\n00:14:45.755 --> 00:14:48.426\nOkay?\nIf there was even another ITProTV,\n\n255\n00:14:48.426 --> 00:14:50.690\nITPro.TV here,\n\n256\n00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.730\nI could also add them in as well, if I\nhad different users that did that too.\n\n257\n00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.560\nNow, when we do this, right,\n\n258\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.670\nthe Azure AD connect tool is quite\namazing in the ability of what it does.\n\n259\n00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.700\nBefore we get into Azure AD,\n\n260\n00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:11.510\nAzure AD is expecting to be presented\nwith one set of credentials, but\n\n261\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.640\nI'm actually presenting two\ndifferent directories here.\n\n262\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.930\nThat means I could have a ronnie@itprotv,\nI could have a ronnie@itprotvdemo.com.\n\n263\n00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.990\nYou name it.\n\n264\n00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.490\nI could have all those actually be there\nand available as part of my UPN name.\n\n265\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.730\nWell, what is actually going to\nbe presented to Azure AD itself?\n\n266\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.560\nWell, the AD connect tool is what\ncan actually take both of those,\n\n267\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.070\nor three of those, whatever it wants to.\n\n268\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.630\nThen it can look for\nthe links, the tie ins, and\n\n269\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.880\nthe attributes that it needs to together.\n\n270\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.350\nAnd then present what should\ngo into Azure AD as one.\n\n271\n00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:54.152\nSo it can, I don't say merge is not the\nproper word, but the synchronization or\n\n272\n00:15:54.152 --> 00:15:57.808\nthe idea of aligning those to\nmake one set of credentials, or\n\n273\n00:15:57.808 --> 00:16:02.419\none user, one particular account,\nwhatever we wanna call it, all right.\n\n274\n00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:03.113\nIt can happen here.\n\n275\n00:16:03.113 --> 00:16:05.970\nAnd this is the tool that does it for us.\n\n276\n00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.078\nSo it is quite an amazing tool,\nif we actually want two.\n\n277\n00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:12.060\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; But I only have one for this point.\n\n278\n00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.690\nSo let's see here, select that.\n\n279\n00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.730\nAnd now there's actually\nsomething else I have to do,\n\n280\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.950\ncuz I forgot about the credentials.\n\n281\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.850\nAD forest account, add an AD account\nwith sufficient permissions required for\n\n282\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.770\nperiodic synchronization.\n\n283\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.550\nNow that's actually key here, okay?\n\n284\n00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.580\nThis idea of periodic synchronization.\n\n285\n00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:39.740\nThis is one of those accounts\nthat we ended up using inside of\n\n286\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.980\nthe AD admin sync or AD sync admins,\nI couldn't remember.\n\n287\n00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.370\nThat particular group is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n288\n00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.030\nSo if I select user an existing\naccount at this point and\n\n289\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:57.350\nthen, in theory,\nI could go ITProTVDemo\\ and\n\n290\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.255\nI'm going to use Cherokee's name,\n\n291\n00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:03.970\ncuz it's the easiest one for\nme to remember at this point.\n\n292\n00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.081\nI don't remember the password I made for\nZach, that's what it comes down to.\n\n293\n00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:08.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not super secret.\n\n294\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.889\n&gt;&gt; No, no, that is different.\n\n295\n00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:26.188\nOkay, this is what you should end up\nwith after you add your directory, and\n\n296\n00:17:26.188 --> 00:17:28.728\nthen you give it the proper\ncredentials to do so.\n\n297\n00:17:28.728 --> 00:17:31.520\nYou should end up with\na green check mark here.\n\n298\n00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.511\nAnd what you're looking for is where,\nlet me see if I can make it look.\n\n299\n00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:36.886\nCome on, you can do it.\n\n300\n00:17:36.886 --> 00:17:40.200\n[INAUDIBLE] All right, impossible.\n\n301\n00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.380\nYou're looking for\nwhere it says reachable.\n\n302\n00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.220\nI know it's fast, but if you hover\nover it, mine is just not doing it for\n\n303\n00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:49.936\nme anymore.\n\n304\n00:17:49.936 --> 00:17:52.655\nBut if you look at that, once you\nhover over that green mark it says,\n\n305\n00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:53.726\nit's reachable, okay?\n\n306\n00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:57.337\nThe green check mark should tell you that\nit's actually reachable at that point,\n\n307\n00:17:57.337 --> 00:17:58.490\nthen you are ready to go.\n\n308\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.450\nTrying to show it too much, it just\nsays Ronnie, I'm going to embarrass you\n\n309\n00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.090\nright now because I'm not gonna do\nexactly what you want me to do.\n\n310\n00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.420\nSo that's what we have at that point to,\nokay?\n\n311\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.820\nSo now we've got that connected,\nI can select Next.\n\n312\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.323\nAnd now it is beginning it's particular\nprocess here at the sign in and\n\n313\n00:18:17.323 --> 00:18:18.990\nconfiguration.\n\n314\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.520\nNow it's already seeing some other\nthings that I've added in to prepare for\n\n315\n00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.950\nthe federation services as well.\n\n316\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.170\nSo it's actually seeing two\ndifferent domains here, okay?\n\n317\n00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:35.362\nThus seeing the AD FS for the Azure\nActive Directory Federation, as well.\n\n318\n00:18:35.362 --> 00:18:37.929\nAnd then it's also seeing itprotvdemo.\n\n319\n00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:43.200\nSo to use on-premises credentials here,\nUPN suffixes and usernames should match.\n\n320\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.789\nOne of the verified custom\ndomains in Azure AD.\n\n321\n00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:53.750\nSo seeing two of these right here, but the\ngreat thing is I have one that's Verified.\n\n322\n00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.010\nIf I just recently added it in,\nI could refresh and\n\n323\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.080\nmake sure that it's actually added in.\n\n324\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.330\nI did not add this in on purpose.\n\n325\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.030\nAnd now, this is what we want to\npay attention to as well, okay?\n\n326\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.443\nSelect the on-prem,\nnow as I don't even hover near it,\n\n327\n00:19:07.443 --> 00:19:09.013\nit's starting to show up, why not?\n\n328\n00:19:09.013 --> 00:19:13.323\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Select the on-premises attribute and\n\n329\n00:19:13.323 --> 00:19:18.460\nthis is key, okay,\nto use as the Azure AD username.\n\n330\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.840\nIt is looking for what we call that UPN or\nthat userPrincipleName, but\n\n331\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.960\nnotice I can use any of these\nattributes that are listed here.\n\n332\n00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.420\nAnd there are a ton of them, okay?\n\n333\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.820\nBut just when you don't think\nthere's plenty of them,\n\n334\n00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:36.530\nthere are plenty of them even to the point\nwhere we can even do these cloud\n\n335\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.450\nextension attributes if you chose to.\n\n336\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.650\nBut I'm gonna use the one\nthat's probably the easiest,\n\n337\n00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.320\nwhich is the userPrincipleName.\n\n338\n00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.280\nThis is still the one that looks like the\nemail address essentially, for most of us\n\n339\n00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.450\nif we're not sure exactly what we're\ntalking about with userPrincipalName,\n\n340\n00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.810\nit looks like your email address.\n\n341\n00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.930\nThe majority of the time it is\nthe email address that we end up using.\n\n342\n00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.195\nUsers will not be able to sign\nin to Azure AD using their\n\n343\n00:19:59.195 --> 00:20:03.140\non-premises credentials at this point.\n\n344\n00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.585\nSo you gotta be careful here, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:05.585 --> 00:20:11.517\nUsers will not be able to sign in Azure AD\nusing their on-premises credentials.\n\n346\n00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.690\nThen, as I select next, notice it gives me\nthe ability to do OU and domain filter.\n\n347\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.380\nWe had a whole show up on\nbeing able to do this.\n\n348\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.270\nAt this point, If you want to now remove\nsome of the things you don't want to see\n\n349\n00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.430\ninside of Azure AD Cloud,\ninside of the Azure AD you can do so.\n\n350\n00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.350\nIn those,\nyou can select all domains and all OUs.\n\n351\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.990\nThat's probably the safest bet and\nwe're not exactly sure.\n\n352\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.140\nBut notice if I select,\nsync selected domains,\n\n353\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.150\nI expand out itprotvdemo, you'll see that\nthere is a couple of different things.\n\n354\n00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.640\nSo here LostAndFound was not synchronized.\n\n355\n00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.300\nIf I don't wanna use Managed Service\nAccounts, I don't have to do that either.\n\n356\n00:20:55.332 --> 00:20:59.971\nIdeally, right, the only thing that\nAzure really needs are active accounts,\n\n357\n00:20:59.971 --> 00:21:02.755\nokay, that we actually needed or\nthe Azure AD.\n\n358\n00:21:02.755 --> 00:21:03.898\nThat's all it really needs.\n\n359\n00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:08.369\nBut if I'm really not sure, leaving it\nalone is probably the best thing to do and\n\n360\n00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:10.731\nthen syncing everything up if we want to.\n\n361\n00:21:10.731 --> 00:21:14.035\nThat is also probably the easiest\nthing for us to do as well, okay?\n\n362\n00:21:14.035 --> 00:21:17.430\nAll right, so from that point,\nI'm gonna click next.\n\n363\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.580\nNow here's another way that\nwe can also identify users.\n\n364\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.510\nSo uniquely identifying your users.\n\n365\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.500\nSelect how users should be identified\nin your in-premises directories, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.010\nSo users are represented only\nonce across all directories here.\n\n367\n00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.720\nUsers exist across multiple directories.\n\n368\n00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.630\nHow are you gonna match them up?\n\n369\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.210\nSo this is where I tell you that\nthe Azure AD tool does a lot of stuff in\n\n370\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.810\nthe background, that you and\nI are not sure of.\n\n371\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.080\nIf we are now using multiple force, right?\n\n372\n00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.600\nWell, we now need to allow for\n\n373\n00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.950\nthe Azure AD connect tool to say\nhow they're gonna be identified.\n\n374\n00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.260\nSo if I know that my users here, that\nthere's only one account for everybody,\n\n375\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.940\neven though I'm actually going\nacross multiple force here,\n\n376\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.730\nI just select this first one, okay?\n\n377\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.920\nBut what if Zach actually has multiple\naccounts across some of those domains or\n\n378\n00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.500\nlinked email accounts,\nor whatever it might be?\n\n379\n00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.900\nNotice that you have some other\nobjects here that you can do.\n\n380\n00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.210\nYou can choose to mail attribute\nto try and match them up.\n\n381\n00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.460\nYou can do an ObjectSID,\n\n382\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.620\nand of course even the exchange\nmaster SID here and the OriginatorID.\n\n383\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.940\nYou can use the SAMAccountName and\nthe MailNicknames that are also there.\n\n384\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.700\nYou can even select your own\ncustomized attribute, if you chose to.\n\n385\n00:22:36.995 --> 00:22:39.360\nAnd now it's actually everything.\n\n386\n00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.810\nSo it just depends on what\nyou need to be able to do\n\n387\n00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.460\nis kind of the key here,\nkind of just use the default.\n\n388\n00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:54.420\nThe other one it says, how should users\nbe identified with Azure AD, okay?\n\n389\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.230\nNow they have were it actually says let\nAzure manage the source anchor for me, or\n\n390\n00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.310\nyou can name a specific attribute.\n\n391\n00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:05.850\nThe only reason for you to choose\nsomebody or to choose another one\n\n392\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:10.440\nis if you know exactly what you\nwant the anchor attribute to be,\n\n393\n00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.190\nthe source attribute here that you want.\n\n394\n00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.810\nSo let me hover over that and\nsee what it's gonna say.\n\n395\n00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.880\nAzure can manage the source\nanchor attribute for\n\n396\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.722\nyou or you can choose the specific one.\n\n397\n00:23:19.722 --> 00:23:23.630\nThe attribute must be unique and cannot\nchange over the lifetime of the user.\n\n398\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.490\nOnce selected,\nthe configuration cannot change.\n\n399\n00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.070\nSo it's saying, look, if you don't know\nwhich one to choose, choose this one.\n\n400\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:36.060\nLet Azure do it, because if you\nchoose the wrong one and now you go,\n\n401\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.810\nI need to change that, it says no,\nit's not gonna let you change it.\n\n402\n00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.690\nSo I would just leave this one alone at\nthis point, but if you want to, you can go\n\n403\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.655\nand choose whatever specific attribute,\nbut remember it has to be unique.\n\n404\n00:23:48.655 --> 00:23:53.032\nClick Next, so, yeah.\n\n405\n00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:56.321\nAll right,\nat this point other filtering, right,\n\n406\n00:23:56.321 --> 00:23:59.478\ndevices as long as user\nsynchronize select here.\n\n407\n00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:03.214\nWhatever we might want, I'm gonna\nleave this as the default once again.\n\n408\n00:24:03.214 --> 00:24:07.020\nSo for a pilot deployment,\nspecify a group containing your users and\n\n409\n00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.290\ndevices will be synchronized.\n\n410\n00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.320\nGroups are not supported and will be, or\n\n411\n00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.420\nnested groups are actually\ngoing to do that.\n\n412\n00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.890\nIf I wanted to, I could select this,\nand I could select a particular group.\n\n413\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.320\nNow you might be like what in the world\nis this about, later on if you add\n\n414\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.048\nan additional groups, and you only\nwant to synchronize what's change.\n\n415\n00:24:24.048 --> 00:24:27.660\nYou may choose to just\nsynchronize the selected,\n\n416\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:32.070\nadd in your particular group name right\nthere and you'll be often ready to go.\n\n417\n00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.100\nClick Next, and now this is where\nwe have to take a look at these\n\n418\n00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.800\nadditional features and\nnotice it says enhanced functionality.\n\n419\n00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.640\nNow, this is actually required.\n\n420\n00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.900\nSome of them are grayed out\nwhere I cannot select them.\n\n421\n00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.440\nAnd the reason why is because,\n\n422\n00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.430\nwell, at this point they're not setup and\nthat's probably why, okay?\n\n423\n00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.501\nBut I can,\nas soon as I don't even hover near them,\n\n424\n00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:04.024\nI can't get them out of\nthe way fast enough.\n\n425\n00:25:04.024 --> 00:25:07.030\nAnd I try to actually hover over one,\nthat's what I have to do, no, see.\n\n426\n00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.893\nNow it's staying like crazy so\nI don't know what to say so\n\n427\n00:25:09.893 --> 00:25:12.550\nI'm just gonna move it\nout of the way here.\n\n428\n00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.902\nSo at this point notice that\nwe have Azure AD app and\n\n429\n00:25:15.902 --> 00:25:19.210\nattribute filtering,\nPassword synchronization,\n\n430\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.560\nthat seems like a good feature that\nI want to be able to work with.\n\n431\n00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.120\nAnd, if I want to synchronize those\npasswords, I can also do that as well.\n\n432\n00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.702\nSo it just depends on how and\n\n433\n00:25:31.702 --> 00:25:35.250\nwhat do you want to be able to\ndo as you set this up here.\n\n434\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.980\nSo if you don't want the Password\nwriteback, in other words,\n\n435\n00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:43.310\nwhat you change online to get written back\nto your on-premises active directory,\n\n436\n00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.780\nleave that one unchecked.\n\n437\n00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.060\nBut make sure you talk\nto the organization,\n\n438\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.830\nor whoever it is that\nyou're actually gonna do.\n\n439\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.145\nBecause if not, you're gonna be managing\ntwo different groups of passwords, one for\n\n440\n00:25:53.145 --> 00:25:55.780\non-premises, and one for your Office 365.\n\n441\n00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.590\nTo me,\nthat sounds like a little bit of a hassle.\n\n442\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.910\nSo I'm gonna select this one as well,\nall right.\n\n443\n00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.387\nI click next, and now it is beginning\nto check and see whether or\n\n444\n00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:12.360\nnot everything is actually gonna be\ninstalled the way that we want to.\n\n445\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.280\nSo start the synchronization\nprocess when this is complete.\n\n446\n00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.190\nEnable staging, okay.\n\n447\n00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:21.830\nWhen selected, synchronization will\nnot export any data to AD or Azure.\n\n448\n00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.810\nI'm just gonna leave the default here,\nand not go for\n\n449\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:29.190\nthat kind of advanced weird stuff\nfrom our point of view for right now.\n\n450\n00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.470\nAnd now it's gonna start configuring\nall that information and\n\n451\n00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:35.420\nthe synchronization process.\n\n452\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.840\nSo as long as everything is connected we\nare now actually allowing the Azure AD and\n\n453\n00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.230\nthe on-premises Active Directory tool\n\n454\n00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:48.240\nto now begin that synchronization\nprocess that we need to, okay?\n\n455\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.550\nSo once everything is configured and\nbegins synchronization,\n\n456\n00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:56.170\ndepends on the size of the data\nthat has to be synchronized.\n\n457\n00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.080\nIt can take 10 seconds to 15 seconds.\n\n458\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.800\nIt could take a lot longer if you\nhave a lot more Active Directory\n\n459\n00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.110\nobjects that are actually\ngonna be synchronized as well.\n\n460\n00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.540\nSo just kinda realize it's never,\nI wish I could tell you.\n\n461\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.870\nIt should just take three seconds here and\nwe should be up and ready to go.\n\n462\n00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.670\nBut it does take a little bit of time\nbecause it's reaching out to the Cloud and\n\n463\n00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.020\nit's actually updating.\n\n464\n00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.420\nBut you can follow it and you can see\nright not inside of the configuration.\n\n465\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.630\nAnd now it's updating those\nsynchronization tools,\n\n466\n00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.860\npartition information,\npassword synchronization.\n\n467\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.170\nPassword write back is coming online.\n\n468\n00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.150\nSo it's following a script,\n\n469\n00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.010\nif you really want to take\na look at what's happening here.\n\n470\n00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.570\nGoing all the way down through each of\nthose components that we see over here on\n\n471\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.980\nthe left hand side.\n\n472\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:41.080\nGetting everything up and\nready to go, okay?\n\n473\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.445\nSo in the background of everything\nthat’s actually happening here,\n\n474\n00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:47.076\nas these synchronization\nsettings are coming about.\n\n475\n00:27:47.076 --> 00:27:51.157\nIt still means we need to,\nonce everything is synchronized,\n\n476\n00:27:51.157 --> 00:27:54.608\nwe would still need to configure,\nand to check and,\n\n477\n00:27:54.608 --> 00:27:58.700\nverify that things are working\nthe way we expect them to work.\n\n478\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:05.160\nSo at this particular point, it actually\nis gonna take a little bit of time there,\n\n479\n00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.060\nand it looks like it ran\nanother script here.\n\n480\n00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.440\nIt's configuring the health connection\nagent for the synchronization too.\n\n481\n00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.440\nBut once that's done, it means that\nwe do have to think about that and\n\n482\n00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.470\ntesting it out.\n\n483\n00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.790\nSo let's take a look at what\nwe've learned here, okay?\n\n484\n00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.250\nNow at this point it says,\nconfiguration is complete,\n\n485\n00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.020\nnow you can log in to the Azure AD and\n\n486\n00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.500\nverify that the accounts from your\nlocal directory have been created.\n\n487\n00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.830\nThen do a test sign in to the Azure\nportal and see what happens.\n\n488\n00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.970\nActive Directory Recycle Bin\nhas not been enabled no,\n\n489\n00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:37.460\nso that's strongly recommended.\n\n490\n00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.600\nThat might be something\nelse that I want to do.\n\n491\n00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.550\nSync your Windows 10 domain\njoined computers to Azure AD as\n\n492\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.790\nregistered devices,\nwhich we did not do here.\n\n493\n00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.160\nIf you want to, it says I'll have to run\nthis particular PowerShell script and\n\n494\n00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.480\nto do so or in the module the AD prep.\n\n495\n00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.652\nAnd then let's see, Azure Active Directory\nis configured to use AD attribute\n\n496\n00:28:59.652 --> 00:29:03.680\nmS-DS-ConsistencyGuid as\nthe source anchor.\n\n497\n00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.656\nThat's probably a good source anchor,\n\n498\n00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:09.672\nI probably would not ever picked that one\nout on my own if I thought about it, okay?\n\n499\n00:29:09.672 --> 00:29:13.366\nSo, it gives me some nice pointers at\nsome of the things I need to do and\n\n500\n00:29:13.366 --> 00:29:16.620\nthis idea of actually\ncompleting these things.\n\n501\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.690\nI definitely want to make\nsure that I do that and\n\n502\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.070\nget those last things configured\nout the way that we want to, okay?\n\n503\n00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.010\nSo once that's done,\n\n504\n00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:27.640\nthe only thing I'm gonna do right\nnow is at least check, okay?\n\n505\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.750\nBecause this is the point where\nwe have to begin to verify\n\n506\n00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.920\nthat we did get those\nthings synched up here.\n\n507\n00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.510\nAnd that the office portal,\nof course why would it change for\n\n508\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:43.050\nme, has actually changed here.\n\n509\n00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.080\nThere we go, I'll pick Cherokee's account.\n\n510\n00:29:53.243 --> 00:29:55.590\nUse that super secret password.\n\n511\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.860\nOops, so now, let's see.\nI can't get back in, let's see.\n\n512\n00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.720\nAll right, so Zach,\nit looks like is not working.\n\n513\n00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.570\nThis actually gives us\na great troubleshooting point\n\n514\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.390\nthat we can actually just talk about for\na moment.\n\n515\n00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:13.323\nWhat if I now have completely messed up,\nokay, in Azure Active Directory and now,\n\n516\n00:30:13.323 --> 00:30:16.791\nthe synchronization is not\nworking the way that I want to.\n\n517\n00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:20.862\nThe great thing is I still have\nmy global administrator account,\n\n518\n00:30:20.862 --> 00:30:22.730\nthe one that I created-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n519\n00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.450\n&gt;&gt; That we would be actually be\nable to contact whoever did it.\n\n520\n00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.980\nAnd then go back in and\nthen sign up and see what happens.\n\n521\n00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.750\nSo I'm gonna flip on over here, which I've\nalready done, now let me go ahead and\n\n522\n00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.420\nlog back out and do that.\n\n523\n00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.870\nSo if I do portal.office.com, there it is,\n\n524\n00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:48.298\nand it's logging me back in And\nwe can now see with the IT Pro TV demo,\n\n525\n00:30:48.298 --> 00:30:52.360\nmake sure I'm actually showing\nyou the right account here.\n\n526\n00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.850\nAnd it looks like that directory\nstatus has actually went ahead and\n\n527\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.510\nselected it here.\n\n528\n00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.160\nNow, domains not verified,\n\n529\n00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.290\ndomains verified,\nlooks like three domains verified.\n\n530\n00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.150\nThere we go.\n\n531\n00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.000\nNo where it said three.\n\n532\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.930\nSure it wanna.\n\n533\n00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.832\nGot out,\nlast synchronization was four minutes ago.\n\n534\n00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:17.580\nSo I know that some\nsynchronization has happened.\n\n535\n00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.940\nLet's check this out right now,\nand then we'll have to go in and\n\n536\n00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.710\ndo some trouble shooting with\nsome of the accounts here.\n\n537\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.450\nSo if I select users,\n\n538\n00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.710\nwe can now see all of these different\naccounts have been added in.\n\n539\n00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.910\nNow, we're not done completely yet.\n\n540\n00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.310\nWe still actually to take a look\nat that particular account.\n\n541\n00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.340\nBut the great thing is, if I am not sure.\n\n542\n00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:43.690\nLets say that for one reason or another\nI didn't change that particular user\n\n543\n00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:51.030\naccounts, Let's say Cherokee's account\nhere, and I wanted to reset the password.\n\n544\n00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:57.360\nSo if I do this, it is here that I can\nbegin to now create the password again.\n\n545\n00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.880\nSo it may actually be where the\nsynchronization just hasn't happened for\n\n546\n00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.440\nall the passwords yet.\n\n547\n00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.230\nSo it could be a timing element.\n\n548\n00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.720\nBut at this point in time,\nwe're at least able, okay,?\n\n549\n00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.720\nSo even though I can't do\nthis with the global account\n\n550\n00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.350\nthat's inside of the network itself,\nI can use the global administrator account\n\n551\n00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:21.080\nthat I used to setup, to at least verify\nthat the synchronization is happening.\n\n552\n00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.650\nAnd now has to begin that\ntroubleshooting aspect.\n\n553\n00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.790\nWhat did I do with this\nparticular user account and\n\n554\n00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.380\ndid it affect all the other user\naccounts that's right here.\n\n555\n00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.900\nSo that's what we still have\nto actually go through and do.\n\n556\n00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.340\nWe need to verify that and we might need\nto do a little bit more troubleshooting.\n\n557\n00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.840\nBut, Zach we are out of time, which\nmeans we'll do that for a part three, or\n\n558\n00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.260\nfour actually.\n\n559\n00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.638\nFor, of course, the connect tool as well.\n\n560\n00:32:44.638 --> 00:32:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Say that Azure AD connect to a part\nfour, make sure you watch parts one, two,\n\n561\n00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.480\nand three as well and\nsee everything in the Office 365 series.\n\n562\n00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.020\nRonnie's doing an amazing job,\nhe always does.\n\n563\n00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.380\nAnd check out all the other\nvideos in our course library,\n\n564\n00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.380\nthey're all designed to do one thing,\nhelp you go further.\n\n565\n00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.150\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nIT ProTV, they'll be glad you did.\n\n566\n00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:03.640\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n567\n00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.380\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.156\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n569\n00:33:05.156 --> 00:33:11.610\n[MUSIC]\n\n570\n00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.672\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPROTV.\n\n",

00:00:21.217\nSo this is an actually a part four.\n\n10\n00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:25.505\nWe're gonna be taking a look at our,\nRonnie, you might have to fill me in here,\n\n11\n00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:28.065\nsetup, Azure Active Directory Connect\ntool.\n\n12\n00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:31.005\nBut this is a part four, so\nif you missed the other episodes,\n\n13\n00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.610\nyou definitely wanna go back and\ncheck those out, and\n\n14\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.000\nof course, with us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong.\n\n15\n00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.110\nHow's it going today, Ronnie?\n\n16\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.119\n&gt;&gt; It is going well Cherokee.\n\n17\n00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:40.750\nThank you for having me on the show,\nglad you're here as well.\n\n18\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.670\nHow are you doing?\n\n19\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.430\n&gt;&gt; I'm good thank you for having me.\n\n20\n00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.615\nI might be out fo the loop a little bit.\n\n21\n00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:46.126\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n22\n00:00:46.126 --> 00:00:49.582\n&gt;&gt; So you'll have to keep me up to speed\nhere, but I think it's a great idea that\n\n23\n00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:53.000\nyou're doing this show, because this\nis such a popular implementation.\n\n24\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.761\nAs a matter of fact, you know we\nuse Office 365 here at ITProTV, so\n\n25\n00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:00.080\nI'm really ready to see what we're\ngonna be talking about here.\n\n26\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.623\n&gt;&gt; All right, well let's kind of do\na little bit of a review before we\n\n27\n00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:03.185\nget started.\n\n28\n00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:07.088\nWe've already been taken a look at setting\nup of course the Azure AD Connect tool,\n\n29\n00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:10.145\nand we've talked about the planning of it,\nand staging it, and\n\n30\n00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.790\ngetting everything ready.\n\n31\n00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.605\nWe've gone through,\n\n32\n00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.070\nwell at least three episodes since\nwe're actually in a part four.\n\n33\n00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.760\nWe finished the connection, and we showed\nthe synchronization happening, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.695\nSo when everything is actually over and\ndone with,\n\n35\n00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.367\nthere's a couple of things\nthat we need to do.\n\n36\n00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:29.600\nSo just saying, okay,\nI verify that everything is synced up,\n\n37\n00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.700\nthat's not enough.\n\n38\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Not enough.\n\n39\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.666\n&gt;&gt; At times so we need to begin to take\na look a little bit more, and start to see\n\n40\n00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.462\nif somebody can log back in, and\ndo some of the things that we need to do.\n\n41\n00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:40.644\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat sounds pretty important, right?\n\n42\n00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:43.913\n&gt;&gt; And that's what happened.\n\n43\n00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:47.478\nIt does, and at the end of the last show\nthat I had with Zach I wasn't actually\n\n44\n00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:50.240\nable to log back in after\nthe synchronization took place.\n\n45\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.901\nSo I needed to do a little\nbit of troubleshooting, but\n\n46\n00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:54.650\nwe were running out of time.\n\n47\n00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.255\nBut this actually gives us a good chance\nto go back and start saying, All right,\n\n48\n00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:02.486\nnow can this really happen,\nthat I sync up everything,\n\n49\n00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:06.830\nand now things are not working\nthe way that they're not working?\n\n50\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.083\nWell, the great thing about this,\nis if everything else is working, and\n\n51\n00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:14.653\nif you're actually the person\nthat's been contracted, and\n\n52\n00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:19.150\nlet me make sure I emphasize,\ncontracted to set this backup.\n\n53\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.345\nNormally, that means that you have an\naccount that is the global administrator\n\n54\n00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:29.382\naccount, that will at least let you get\nback into the Office 365 account so\n\n55\n00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:34.032\nthat you can verify that,\nnot only the synchronization happened, but\n\n56\n00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:38.324\nthen you can begin troubleshooting and\nhelping out a little bit.\n\n57\n00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:42.020\nSo at the end of that last episode,\nthat's what we were doing, and\n\n58\n00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.640\nhere is pretty much the screen\nthat we left it on right here.\n\n59\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.200\nSo let's take a look\nat my computer screen.\n\n60\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.640\nSo, I logged in as a global administrator,\nand you can see there's my name right\n\n61\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.330\nhere, and remember whether you're\nactually a part of the domain or not,\n\n62\n00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.400\nbut my particular account,\nthe only thing I use this for\n\n63\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.550\nis just setting up the tenant itself,\ninside of the Office 365 cloud.\n\n64\n00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.952\nIt has not been used in any of the other\nconfigurations that we were doing,\n\n65\n00:03:08.952 --> 00:03:12.720\nnone of it at all, and\nI want to make sure that I emphasize this.\n\n66\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.651\nEven if I get to this point, and I can log\nin, I should not make changes as myself,\n\n67\n00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:23.497\nas the global administrator that's\njust setting up the tenant.\n\n68\n00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:27.670\nThe reason why is that, if I tie\nsomething like that back to me, and\n\n69\n00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.920\nnow something breaks,\nit means they always have to call me back,\n\n70\n00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.620\nif something like that breaks and requires\nmy particular credentials to log back in.\n\n71\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.920\nIt's not really a gigantic deal, but\n\n72\n00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.170\nit's something that if you don't remember\nwhat you set up and what you didn't do,\n\n73\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.400\nand you don't document it,\nit's gonna become a little bit harder.\n\n74\n00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.067\nBut at least now,\nI can verify a couple of things for\n\n75\n00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:52.068\nmy company that I'm setting this up for.\n\n76\n00:03:52.068 --> 00:03:54.982\n&gt;&gt; And it's interesting that you did\npreface the fact that if you were\n\n77\n00:03:54.982 --> 00:03:57.690\na contractor because, yeah,\nif you have multiple clients,\n\n78\n00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.917\nyou're out on the road at a different\nclient site, you might not even have\n\n79\n00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:03.910\nthat documentation with you, or\nthose passwords and everything.\n\n80\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.570\nSo yeah, I could see that as not being\na viable option for your client.\n\n81\n00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.377\n&gt;&gt; It's true,\nit's not exactly the best thing, but\n\n82\n00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:12.336\nlet's say that we did get locked, and\nthat's exactly what happened here, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:12.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n84\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.317\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee,\neven though I've setup your account, and\n\n85\n00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:19.857\nyou're the global administrator for\nthe ITProTV domain,\n\n86\n00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:22.777\nI wasn't able to log back in as you again,\nokay?\n\n87\n00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:26.053\nSo the user account that we'd been\nusing was cherokee@ITProTVdemo,\n\n88\n00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:29.328\nand I've been pretty much setting\nup everything underneath that, and\n\n89\n00:04:29.328 --> 00:04:31.730\nthat's because you're\npart of the organization,\n\n90\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.410\nso whatever's tied to you is fine,\nbecause you're part of the organization.\n\n91\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.780\nThat's the big thing.\n\n92\n00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.510\nI'm not so much a part of\nthe organization if I'm a contractor, but\n\n93\n00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.330\nit gives me the stability to go in and\nthen Cherokee could have called and said,\n\n94\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.830\nhey, I need you to verify, cuz I'm locked\nout, I can't figure out what's going on.\n\n95\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.890\nI log back in, and\nnow I can begin to take a look, and\n\n96\n00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.790\nlet's just use Adam's as an example.\n\n97\n00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.528\nAdam was only existing in my\nOn-premises Active Directory.\n\n98\n00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:59.120\nSo I know it got pulled over.\n\n99\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.060\nWell how can I verify that?\n\n100\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.560\nIt's over here at the very end,\n\n101\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.410\nif I hover over this, you'll see where\nit says sync with active directory, and\n\n102\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.960\nthat means the On-premises Active\nDirectory is what we have.\n\n103\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.899\nSo this has actually done\nthe synchronization that it needs to.\n\n104\n00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:16.190\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n105\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.096\nThat means that whatever I set up as\nCherokee at that point using the Azure AD\n\n106\n00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:22.643\ntool, it did actually\ndo the synchronization.\n\n107\n00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:28.525\nIf I click back on Home for just a moment,\nI can also take a look at the Dir,\n\n108\n00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:34.312\ntry it again, at the DirSync Status,\nwhich is Directory Sync Status,\n\n109\n00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:40.580\nand I can see that the last time that\nthis synced up was about 24 minutes ago,\n\n110\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.460\nand password sync, recent synchronization.\n\n111\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.470\nSo this was probably just even last\nfew minutes, burn that by default.\n\n112\n00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.484\nThe synchronization happens\nevery 30 minutes here.\n\n113\n00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:53.960\nSo when you start doing that,\nyou can see that.\n\n114\n00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.740\nIf I come up here, and\nI click on DirSync Status,\n\n115\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.520\nit leads me now to this kind of\nnew little colorful status page.\n\n116\n00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.926\nThen I can see the Integration\nwith the local Active Directory.\n\n117\n00:06:07.926 --> 00:06:12.390\nSo it tells me, and\nthis is where it is handy to have this.\n\n118\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.460\nNow if Cherokee was able to log\nback in herself at this point,\n\n119\n00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.580\nI wouldn't be doing this as the tenant\nadministrator, the one that just set this\n\n120\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.970\nup as a contractor, or\na company helping somebody out.\n\n121\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.100\nBut let's just say right now I'm gonna\nmake sure that this is working in\n\n122\n00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.670\nthe background since I'm already accessing\nthis and trying to help out here, right?\n\n123\n00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.177\nSo I do verify the proper company,\n\n124\n00:06:36.177 --> 00:06:41.370\nI don't know why I couldn't remember,\nproper company name is there.\n\n125\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.520\nDomain's verified.\n\n126\n00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.530\nThis one says three, and so\nif I wanted to find out more information,\n\n127\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.560\nnotice I can hover over that three, and\n\n128\n00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.930\nthis is where it's gonna get\na little bit strange on this one.\n\n129\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.920\nSo even that,\nlet me see if I can show you.\n\n130\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.020\nEverybody, hopefully you can see that that\nactually does have the number three in it.\n\n131\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.290\nBut if I click on that one right there,\nto see those three domains,\n\n132\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.950\nyou're gonna see something\nwhich is a little bit weirder.\n\n133\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.466\nThere's only two listed.\n\n134\n00:07:06.466 --> 00:07:08.084\nSo even though it says three,\n\n135\n00:07:08.084 --> 00:07:11.329\nnotice that only two have\nactually been listed here so far.\n\n136\n00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:15.500\nSo, I don't know what's actually\ncausing that three then.\n\n137\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.161\nSo, I'm not so worried about that.\n\n138\n00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:19.240\nNumbers of domains not verified.\n\n139\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.950\nI didn't actually have\nany that I didn't want.\n\n140\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.197\nDirectory sync status enabled is true,\nand that's a good thing.\n\n141\n00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:28.250\nThis could also help me out in this sense.\n\n142\n00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.020\nWhat if I had actually done\nthe entire directory sync, and\n\n143\n00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.400\nat the end it told me\nsomething is not syncing?\n\n144\n00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.513\nSo even though the connect tool is\nactually working at the end when we\n\n145\n00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:37.388\nfinish running and\n\n146\n00:07:37.388 --> 00:07:40.824\nit kind of gave me at a list of some of\nthe things I might need to check out, but\n\n147\n00:07:40.824 --> 00:07:44.620\nwhat if I don't know, what if I check out\neverything on my side and it looks great?\n\n148\n00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:49.599\nWell remember we also ran that one\nparticular command line tool that allowed\n\n149\n00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:54.498\nus to do the directory sync enabled,\nand then -dirsync enable again, and\n\n150\n00:07:54.498 --> 00:08:00.670\nwith the true, well this is what allows us\nto actually set up the Office 365 side.\n\n151\n00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.440\nLast time it synced up,\neverything looks good here.\n\n152\n00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.660\nAnd look at this.\n\n153\n00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.670\nYou can even see here is this\ndirectory sync service account.\n\n154\n00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.860\nAnd notice the service account\nalso has this onmicrosoft.com.\n\n155\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.270\nSo this is really going\noutside of the organization.\n\n156\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:22.030\nThat means inside of Azure AD\nit is using this account for\n\n157\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.710\nthat sync services here,\nas a managed type of service account or\n\n158\n00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.420\nservice account in the background\nto ensure that this happens.\n\n159\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.280\nSo at least the synchronization\nlooks right.\n\n160\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.240\nBut I'm still having that issue in\nterms of a log on issue that we have.\n\n161\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.590\nSo let me see if I can try this again.\n\n162\n00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.990\nNow I'm actually right here.\n\n163\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.400\nLet me go back inside of my machine\nthat I've been using for testing here.\n\n164\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.810\nAnd now if I try it again,\nlet's say portal, which I can't spell,\n\n165\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.212\napparently, portal.office.com.\n\n166\n00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.527\nAnd now I'm gonna choose another\naccount for right now and\n\n167\n00:09:01.527 --> 00:09:06.880\njust choose Cherokee@itprotvdemo.com\nclick next.\n\n168\n00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.182\nI'm gonna use that super secret password.\n\n169\n00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.771\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n170\n00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.210\nCherokee's laughing at me because\nshe's actually seen me type before.\n\n171\n00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.650\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm laughing at you because our\nconversation that we had about getting our\n\n172\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.036\npasswords tattooed on us.\n\n173\n00:09:21.036 --> 00:09:21.724\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:21.724 --> 00:09:22.412\nSure.\n\n175\n00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:25.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I told you make sure you tattoo it\n\n176\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.280\non backward on your forehead so that you\ncan see it when you look in the mirror.\n\n177\n00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.480\nBecause it wouldn't be helpful if you\nforgot it at that point you couldn't even\n\n178\n00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.190\nlook in the mirror and see it anymore.\n\n179\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.080\nBut here notice.\n\n180\n00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.000\nI'm still having an issue Cherokee.\n\n181\n00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.350\nSo it is still not working.\n\n182\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.680\nBut everything else looks\nlike it's synced up.\n\n183\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.613\nIf I come back over here on\nmy administrator machine.\n\n184\n00:09:48.613 --> 00:09:52.123\nLet's say again, now here I am,\nI come back and I start looking and\n\n185\n00:09:52.123 --> 00:09:55.715\nI take a look at Cherokee Account,\nthere's Cherokee's account.\n\n186\n00:09:55.715 --> 00:09:59.750\nBut I do notice something though Cherokee.\n\n187\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:06.540\nIf I take a look at the username, notice\nit looks like the username changed here.\n\n188\n00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.290\nSo when I set it up as a global\nadministrator when you and\n\n189\n00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.950\nI first did the initial shows,\nI put it in as Cherokee, right?\n\n190\n00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.515\nWell, somewhere when I created\nthis active directory,\n\n191\n00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:21.276\nsomething ended up happening apparently.\n\n192\n00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:25.100\nAnd so I had to take a look\ncuz that doesn't match up.\n\n193\n00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.950\nSo I then came back into my\non premises Active Directory.\n\n194\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.495\nI selected this, and then I went to,\nwell, your name, right here.\n\n195\n00:10:32.495 --> 00:10:33.310\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n196\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.410\n&gt;&gt; And then I selected account and\n\n197\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.670\nI realize something, apparently I did\nnot spell out the rest of your name.\n\n198\n00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just didn't do it.\n\n199\n00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.505\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Now notice I did it right here\n\n200\n00:10:43.505 --> 00:10:45.237\nin the pre 2000 name.\n\n201\n00:10:45.237 --> 00:10:46.734\nSo it was just a mistake.\n\n202\n00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:47.366\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n203\n00:10:47.366 --> 00:10:48.834\n&gt;&gt; Is what ended up happening.\n\n204\n00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:53.433\nNow, normally when something like this\nhappens during the synchronization,\n\n205\n00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:55.639\nIt sees it as two different accounts.\n\n206\n00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.280\nCuz it doesn't know what to match up on.\n\n207\n00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.220\n&gt;&gt; So it wouldn't really yield an error,\nbecause it just says, hey,\n\n208\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.170\nboth of those have separate\naccounts synced up?\n\n209\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.920\n&gt;&gt; Well no, it would actually say,\nthese are two separate accounts,\n\n210\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.730\nthey're not supposed to sync up.\n\n211\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.080\n&gt;&gt; Or I mean,\nsynced up from the cloud to your local.\n\n212\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n213\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.620\nSo it's not gonna do that.\n\n214\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.738\nSo at this point,\nwhat in my mind should have happened\n\n215\n00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:22.628\nis that when it went over\nto Office 365 and said,\n\n216\n00:11:22.628 --> 00:11:25.500\nshare at itprotvdemo.com.\n\n217\n00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.570\nInstead of overriding\ncherokee@itprotvdemo.com,\n\n218\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.460\nwhat should have happened is it should've\njust created another one that said,\n\n219\n00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.120\nCherokee Boose as the display name.\n\n220\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.020\nBut then, the user name should've\nbeen Cher, C-H-E-R@itprotv.com.\n\n221\n00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:50.820\nBut somewhere during my selection,\nwhen I did the Azure AD connect\n\n222\n00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.308\ntool It said how do you want this to try,\nand match up on this synchronization?\n\n223\n00:11:56.308 --> 00:11:59.750\nSo I could've selected any other fields\nthat I wanted to, but it's forming\n\n224\n00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.940\na unique attribute, the unique attribute,\nand pretty much for all of Office 365,\n\n225\n00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.870\nor at least the one that stands out the\nmost is gonna be based on the user name.\n\n226\n00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.980\nThis is normally what\nwe call our UPN name.\n\n227\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.230\nSo that shouldn't have matched up.\n\n228\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.010\nBut somewhere,\n\n229\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.630\nwhen I actually said, I'm gonna let\nAzure AD connect decide on its own.\n\n230\n00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.510\nIt pulled in some other\nobject identifier that said,\n\n231\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.565\nthis particular account that\nwas up there in Office 365 as\n\n232\n00:12:30.565 --> 00:12:37.820\ncherokee@itvprotvdemo it matched up to the\none that was on the on-premises as well.\n\n233\n00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.720\nAnd it overrode what I\nhad originally set up.\n\n234\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.820\nNow I do not think that is natural or\nnormal.\n\n235\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.970\nBut this is at least a troubleshooting\nstep that I can use to verify.\n\n236\n00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.570\n&gt;&gt; A potential scenario,\ntoo bad that it happened.\n\n237\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.740\n&gt;&gt; So let's see if that's what happened.\n\n238\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.808\nSo if I come back over here.\n\n239\n00:12:57.808 --> 00:13:01.998\nLet me close out of this again, and here.\n\n240\n00:13:01.998 --> 00:13:03.970\nJust to kind of do this.\n\n241\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:04.860\nIt is a test.\n\n242\n00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.530\nThat's all we're doing,\nis we're testing to see if this happens.\n\n243\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.110\nAnd I do the portal at Office.\n\n244\n00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.520\nAgain, and\nyou'll see I've already tried this.\n\n245\n00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.230\nAnd that's why, I've tried to\noverlook it as we went through.\n\n246\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.860\nBut you'll see I already tried this\ncuz I was like could that actually be\n\n247\n00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.820\nthe case that happened here?\n\n248\n00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.450\nSo, if I now click there and\nthen I type in that\n\n249\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:32.600\nsuper secret password which I always\nhave to look at cuz it's extremely long.\n\n250\n00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.920\nOops.\n\n251\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.710\nLet me try it again.\n\n252\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.430\nMaybe I just mistyped it.\n\n253\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.440\nIf not, I have another issue on hand.\n\n254\n00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.871\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're going to have\nto go to the tattoo parlor.\n\n255\n00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:45.619\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n256\n00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:52.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And now, notice.\n\n257\n00:13:54.568 --> 00:13:56.100\nThere it goes.\n\n258\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:02.040\nSo I actually confirmed a theory\nthat I said this should not happen.\n\n259\n00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.330\nAnd it was so strange, Cherokee,\nthat I even asked Adam Gordon.\n\n260\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.850\nAnd I said,\nhave you ever seen this happen?\n\n261\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.950\nHe goes, no.\n\n262\n00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.258\nIn the background, you probably selected\nsomething and you didn't realize it.\n\n263\n00:14:13.258 --> 00:14:18.300\nAnd I said, I believe that it normally\nby default selects the UPN name.\n\n264\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.180\nSo that's all I chose.\n\n265\n00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.210\nBut I did remember that during those\nselections where I can choose what\n\n266\n00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.495\nto go in on, it did give me\nan object unique identifier,\n\n267\n00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:31.510\nother type of attribute that's there.\n\n268\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.540\nSo somehow it was able to link something\nelse up in the background that made\n\n269\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.700\nthat happen.\n\n270\n00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.240\nNow is that always gonna happen?\n\n271\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.050\nI do not believe so.\n\n272\n00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.430\nI think in this case though,\nwhy it actually ended up doing that.\n\n273\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.250\nThere is something else that did\nget linked up in the background to\n\n274\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.500\nthose accounts.\n\n275\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.800\nEven though normally\nthat shouldn't happen.\n\n276\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.900\nSo you may have to do a little\nbit more troubleshooting now.\n\n277\n00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.000\nSomething like that is not\ngonna show up on the exam.\n\n278\n00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.650\nIf they put stuff like that on the exam,\nthey expect you to not only\n\n279\n00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.940\nfigure all that out within a particular\ntime period, they expect you to be like\n\n280\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.900\na wizard knowing every single attribute\nthat you can possibly link up on.\n\n281\n00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.130\nI just happened to notice the difference,\nand I said let me try this and\n\n282\n00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.940\nsee, if that's what happened.\n\n283\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.870\nSo this also is actually\na good demonstration and\n\n284\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.960\na good reminder of the way that\nthe synchronization happens.\n\n285\n00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.760\nRemember that the Azure AD\nsynchronization that ends up happening\n\n286\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.312\nbetween on premises as well as\nthe cloud is not bidirectional.\n\n287\n00:15:31.312 --> 00:15:35.325\nIt doesn't sync from here to here and\nthen from here back over to here.\n\n288\n00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:38.560\nIt is unidirectional synchronization.\n\n289\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.830\nSo what do I mean by that?\n\n290\n00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.390\nIn these example that I just showed you.\n\n291\n00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.860\nIt showed you that when\nthe synchronization happened,\n\n292\n00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.860\nit took what was only on premises for\nCherokees account and then what?\n\n293\n00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.460\nWhen they say,\nhey these two may possibly match here.\n\n294\n00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.540\nIt said where is the source of authority?\n\n295\n00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:02.084\nOn Premises and\nit took the UPN name from the on premises.\n\n296\n00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:06.432\nAnd then over road,\nwhat was in the Azure Active Directory or\n\n297\n00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:10.900\nin the Office 365 Cloud as\nfar as the users go, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.670\nSo that actually proved that\nsynchronization that way, okay?\n\n299\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.540\nNow, the other thing, though, that we need\nto do, so now that I verified that, I know\n\n300\n00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.800\nthat the synchronization is working, and\nit is working the way it's supposed to.\n\n301\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.471\nLet's try to do a couple of other things\nnow that I'm logged in here as Cherokee.\n\n302\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.690\nSo, now that we've got that, what are some\nof the other things we may have to do.\n\n303\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.630\nLet's take for\nexample the idea of removing a user.\n\n304\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.740\nSo this does end up happening sometimes.\n\n305\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:46.200\nWhere what might end up being is that\nwe take someone and so let's see.\n\n306\n00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.690\nWe'll take, I'm trying to pick people,\n\n307\n00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.310\nI know we'll just take Brandon's\naccount at this point.\n\n308\n00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.410\nSo, let's do this, okay?\n\n309\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.920\nSo remember this particular\nportal that I'm in, right?\n\n310\n00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.710\nI'm in Office 365, okay?\n\n311\n00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.510\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n312\n00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.755\nIf I wanted to delete Brandon,\n\n313\n00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:11.280\nit says, hey are you sure\nyou want to delete Brandon?\n\n314\n00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.090\nThis is gonna be what\nwe call a soft delete.\n\n315\n00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:19.490\nA soft delete is when it actually\nstores it in the Azure AD recycle bin.\n\n316\n00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.710\nAnd that way up until 30 days\nI can retrieve them again.\n\n317\n00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.720\nAnd nothing is really\nlost in the background.\n\n318\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.330\nScroll down here at the bottom and\nselect Delete.\n\n319\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.400\nSo, at the end of this, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.237\nNotice that it actually says,\nsomething a little bit more unusual.\n\n321\n00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.514\nCouldn't delete this user because\nthe account is synchronized with your\n\n322\n00:17:43.514 --> 00:17:45.810\non-premises servers here.\n\n323\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.650\nYou cannot delete the user from,\nexcuse me.\n\n324\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.280\nYou can delete the user from\nyour on-premises server.\n\n325\n00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.240\nSo this is something else that\nmay actually be a scenario for\n\n326\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.260\nus to think about.\n\n327\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.900\n&gt;&gt; And just looking at that,\nRonnie, is that what?\n\n328\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.450\nSo we don't see different kinds of\nconflicts with the synchronization, so\n\n329\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:08.210\nthat it's like centralized and\nthere's one over ruling or presiding.\n\n330\n00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah what we call\nthe source of authority.\n\n331\n00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.530\n&gt;&gt; There you go. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; That is it.\n\n332\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.270\nOkay.\n\n333\n00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.640\nSo that source of authority exactly what\nyou're actually gonna be able to do.\n\n334\n00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.670\nIs find that information to kind of\nhelp us out to be able to do this.\n\n335\n00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.150\nSo at this point though, okay?\n\n336\n00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.955\nThis is at least showing you hopefully\nas you are going through this and\n\n337\n00:18:27.955 --> 00:18:29.360\nyou're working on your own.\n\n338\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.280\nNotice that on,\nfrom the online here, okay?\n\n339\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.070\nI can't do that.\n\n340\n00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.420\nNow, what if we ask you to strike,\n\n341\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.280\nlet's not go to that point\nof deleting the user here.\n\n342\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.840\nLet me select somebody else,\n\n343\n00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.340\nhere and we'll select Cameron\nright underneath there.\n\n344\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.850\nWhat if I select reset the password here?\n\n345\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.340\nAnd I'm gonna try and create a new\npassword and make him change it too.\n\n346\n00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:04.310\nNow, notice this.\n\n347\n00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:10.970\nIt actually did change this one,\nokay so, what happened there?\n\n348\n00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.490\nThat doesn't make sense, right?\n\n349\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.861\nWe just showed you that if I tried\nto delete a user, right, Cherokee.\n\n350\n00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:18.769\nI can't do it from the Office 365 site,\nokay?\n\n351\n00:19:18.769 --> 00:19:19.450\nBecause why?\n\n352\n00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.600\nThe source of authority resides where,\non the on-premises.\n\n353\n00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:23.165\nMake sense?\n\n354\n00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:24.640\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n355\n00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.040\nI just reset his password.\n\n356\n00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.417\nIsn't the source of authority\nstill over on the on-premises.\n\n357\n00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:31.160\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it still have some\nkind of conflict there.\n\n358\n00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah wouldn't that actually be true.\n\n359\n00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:37.820\nYes, it normally would except for\nthe fact that one of the options we\n\n360\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.730\nchose when we did the synchronization\nis the password right back feature.\n\n361\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.130\nSo when we selected that we said,\n\n362\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.440\nhey the synchronization only really\nworks when source of authority\n\n363\n00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.490\nto the Cloud here which is gonna\nbe on-premises to the Cloud.\n\n364\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.960\nBut when I selected that\npassword ride back instead,\n\n365\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:02.350\nit says we'll let that actually go\non to be true except for passwords.\n\n366\n00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.690\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's an exception.\n\n367\n00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.060\n&gt;&gt; So that is an exception to the rule.\n\n368\n00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.080\nSo this is something else that\nalso proves that point too.\n\n369\n00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.005\nSo I was able to go from the,\nnot source of authority.\n\n370\n00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:19.240\nWriteback the password over to\nthe source of authority again.\n\n371\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.400\nBecause that feature is actually\nallowed for us to do this, okay.\n\n372\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:29.250\nSo we are actually starting to see where\nthis allows us to do that as well, okay.\n\n373\n00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.351\nNow once that's done right,\nI'm at least and\n\n374\n00:20:32.351 --> 00:20:35.810\nhopefully if doing this\non your own as well.\n\n375\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.590\nYou are starting to get in your mind\nabout how some of this work works.\n\n376\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.930\nIf I delete a user from the Cloud,\nwhat happens?\n\n377\n00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.330\nIf everything is actually synced up.\n\n378\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.130\nWhere should I delete the user from?\n\n379\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.290\nOf course it's the on-premises\nit gives you that.\n\n380\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.700\nBut on the exam are you gonna see that?\n\n381\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.440\nNo, it's not gonna spell it out for you.\n\n382\n00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.530\nYou're just gonna have\nto know that feature.\n\n383\n00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:56.850\nIf you've enabled password writeback,\n\n384\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.640\nmake sure you understand that\nparticular procedure as well.\n\n385\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.030\nThose are things that you\nhave to be worried about.\n\n386\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.160\nNow, on this side, though,\n\n387\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:11.200\nthe great thing is this side it does\nhave that Recycle Bin turned on, okay?\n\n388\n00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.370\nBut I already got a warning\nduring my Azure AD Connect\n\n389\n00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.670\nthat it wasn't actually working, okay?\n\n390\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.890\nOn this side cuz I did\nnot turn that feature on.\n\n391\n00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.190\nSo, if I select that dev team\nthat we are actually on here.\n\n392\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.130\nSo Cameron, and\nthen I right click and I Delete him.\n\n393\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.530\nAnd I click Yes.\n\n394\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.930\nIt deleted him right out of there, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:45.200\nBut if we go back here, and let's see\nif I can refresh this for a moment.\n\n396\n00:21:47.916 --> 00:21:50.700\nNotice that Cameron is still here.\n\n397\n00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.730\nNow the reason why it's still here is\nbecause the synchronization hasn't yet\n\n398\n00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.300\ntaken place.\n\n399\n00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.080\nSo we're still waiting\non that synchronization.\n\n400\n00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.700\nSo what can I actually do if I wanted to?\n\n401\n00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.810\nI could force the synchronization\nif I actually wanted to do this.\n\n402\n00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.230\nBut I'm not gonna do that for\nright now, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.980\nSo at this point there is a little bit\nmore for us to actually be able to do.\n\n404\n00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.680\nBut just kinda realize that it's not gonna\ncarry through until the synchronization\n\n405\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.040\nhappens again.\n\n406\n00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.200\n&gt;&gt; Now earlier at the beginning of the\nshow you had shown us on the Admin Center\n\n407\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.660\npage where it actually showed\nthe time of that last sync.\n\n408\n00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.990\nSo if we were kind of curious as to,\n\n409\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:30.030\nhey am I not seeing this change in effect\nbecause of that lack of synchronization.\n\n410\n00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.570\nI can verify it there.\n\n411\n00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n412\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.970\n&gt;&gt; So you will actually see\nwhen that ends up happening.\n\n413\n00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.070\nWe actually got a good\nquestion on it here.\n\n414\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.510\nAbout will it not just populate back\nif I try and delete it out from here or\n\n415\n00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.680\nchange the password.\n\n416\n00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.170\nNo because the password writeback\nfeature was actually enabled,\n\n417\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.460\nyou should keep it and\n\n418\n00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.500\nactually allow that to happen, so, at this\npoint, that's all that we're waiting for.\n\n419\n00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.950\nAnd this is actually another\nkind of exception to the rule,\n\n420\n00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.700\ntoo, is that when you use that\npassword writeback feature,\n\n421\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.580\nit doesn't follow that 30-minute\nsynchronization pattern.\n\n422\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.720\nIt immediately changes so that way you\ncan actually log back in as well, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.610\nSo here by doing this, just using\nthe soft delete, we can do that as well.\n\n424\n00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:14.260\nNow, what if there comes a point that\nwhen you need to remove the user, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.280\nLet's say you choose not to\ndo anything else here and\n\n426\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.800\nyou need to actually go a little bit\nfurther and do a little bit more.\n\n427\n00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.530\nWell if you now decide that you don't\nwanna do this directory synchronization,\n\n428\n00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:27.140\nthere is a lot more process involved.\n\n429\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.632\nEven after getting\nthe everything else setup and\n\n430\n00:23:30.632 --> 00:23:33.358\nthen stopping the synchronization,\n\n431\n00:23:33.358 --> 00:23:38.393\nremoving the Azure AD Connect tool,\ngetting all that stuff removed.\n\n432\n00:23:38.393 --> 00:23:42.192\nThese accounts that you said, hey I\ndidn't want all these accounts up here,\n\n433\n00:23:42.192 --> 00:23:45.522\nyou start to try and delete them\nout after you close everything out,\n\n434\n00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:48.280\nis still gonna tell you, you can't do it.\n\n435\n00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.364\nWhy?\nBecause it's still saying even though all\n\n436\n00:23:51.364 --> 00:23:55.611\nthis is gone, I'm still holding\nonto these in the background.\n\n437\n00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:59.723\nThe only way for you to remove\nthis is to make sure you're logged\n\n438\n00:23:59.723 --> 00:24:02.292\nin as the Global administrator again.\n\n439\n00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:05.596\nAnd then you'll have to\ngo into PowerShell and\n\n440\n00:24:05.596 --> 00:24:09.576\nthen use one of the remove MSO\nuser commands or group, or\n\n441\n00:24:09.576 --> 00:24:15.523\nMSOL contact commands to make sure that\nfinally gets everything out of the system.\n\n442\n00:24:15.523 --> 00:24:16.803\nBut up in that point,\n\n443\n00:24:16.803 --> 00:24:21.510\nyou really just have to kind of pay\nattention to what you're doing too, okay?\n\n444\n00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.290\nNow the other thing,\nof course, that we want to\n\n445\n00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.042\ntalk about just briefly cuz we only\ngot a few minutes left here for\n\n446\n00:24:28.042 --> 00:24:31.262\nthis episode is notice\nthe unlicensing part here too.\n\n447\n00:24:31.262 --> 00:24:35.184\nSo the synchronization is actually\nnot a full turnkey solution.\n\n448\n00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:38.218\nIt doesn't create\nan account in Office 365,\n\n449\n00:24:38.218 --> 00:24:43.182\nautomatically assign licensing to\nthose accounts, it just doesn't, okay?\n\n450\n00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:47.388\nSo if you do this, you can end up with\na bunch of unlicensed accounts just like I\n\n451\n00:24:47.388 --> 00:24:48.770\nhave right here, okay?\n\n452\n00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.252\nNow, that means that there has to be\na step two which of course licensing,\n\n453\n00:24:53.252 --> 00:24:57.975\nwhich I can't say, licensing those\naccounts that need this as well, okay?\n\n454\n00:24:57.975 --> 00:25:01.925\nNow I believe I actually\nimported about 37 or somewhere,\n\n455\n00:25:01.925 --> 00:25:05.563\nlet's say it's 32,\n35 users actually in there.\n\n456\n00:25:05.563 --> 00:25:08.608\nI didn't count them all up, I don't\nremember how many I actually imported in.\n\n457\n00:25:08.608 --> 00:25:10.964\nBut let's say that I do this, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:10.964 --> 00:25:12.549\nAnd I want to populate them.\n\n459\n00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:14.911\nI can go into each one here.\n\n460\n00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:19.493\nI can actually select even bulk users and\n\n461\n00:25:19.493 --> 00:25:24.220\nthen select edit product licenses here.\n\n462\n00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:29.425\nAnd then of course, add existing\nproduct license agreements to them.\n\n463\n00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:32.430\nSo you can do that on your own,\nthat's no big deal.\n\n464\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.118\nBut on the exam, you do want to\npay attention to a little bit of,\n\n465\n00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:37.755\nof course the PowerShell.\n\n466\n00:25:37.755 --> 00:25:43.270\nSo depending on what's actually run here,\nI selected the run\n\n467\n00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.540\nas the administrator here, and normally I\nam because that's who I am logged in as.\n\n468\n00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:51.244\nBut at this point,\nlet's do a get MSOL user,\n\n469\n00:25:51.244 --> 00:25:54.861\nand let's limit it to the unlicensed user.\n\n470\n00:25:57.249 --> 00:26:01.596\nMaybe unlicensed MSOL user.\n\n471\n00:26:01.596 --> 00:26:04.370\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I was gonna ask, because does\nit just know from the commandlet?\n\n472\n00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.333\n&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with this commandlet.\n\n473\n00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:06.155\n&gt;&gt; No, no.\n\n474\n00:26:06.155 --> 00:26:08.753\nIt's just me not being able to type here.\n\n475\n00:26:08.753 --> 00:26:11.204\nUnlicensed users only.\n\n476\n00:26:11.204 --> 00:26:12.731\nYou know what else I forgot to do?\n\n477\n00:26:12.731 --> 00:26:14.996\nConnect, how's that?\n\n478\n00:26:14.996 --> 00:26:16.451\nLet me do this.\n\n479\n00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:29.472\nAnd ProTV demo and\n\n480\n00:26:29.472 --> 00:26:35.102\nthen the super secret password.\n\n481\n00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:49.649\nAnd hopefully I typed that in correctly,\n\n482\n00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:54.648\nremember that variable\nwon't actually do anything.\n\n483\n00:26:54.648 --> 00:26:59.796\nMSOL Service,\ncredentials MSOL Service, credentials\n\n484\n00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:05.010\nIf I show up red its because\nI mistyped the password.\n\n485\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.417\nIt looks like I actually typed\nit in correctly so that's fine.\n\n486\n00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:11.100\nSo at this point I need to\njust simply run this, and\n\n487\n00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.366\nhere's all of my unlicensed users, okay?\n\n488\n00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:18.070\nNow there's actually at least one\nservice account in here, right?\n\n489\n00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.340\nSo we actually see that there's actually\ntwo service accounts, the ADFS.\n\n490\n00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.086\nAnd that's also another service account.\n\n491\n00:27:23.086 --> 00:27:25.796\nI don't need those assigned,\nbut at this point,\n\n492\n00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:29.226\nwe just want you to see how we can\nassign the licenses from here.\n\n493\n00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:33.533\nSo if I now have the unlicensed users,\n\n494\n00:27:33.533 --> 00:27:38.791\nI can now pipe that into\nset-msoluserlicense\n\n495\n00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:45.754\nAnd then from that point,\nactually I need to,\n\n496\n00:27:45.754 --> 00:27:49.496\nall right I need to actually\ncreate another variable.\n\n497\n00:27:49.496 --> 00:27:52.230\nBecause if not,\nit's not gonna work out for me.\n\n498\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.300\nSo let me go ahead and do that.\n\n499\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.662\nSo let me do a license here.\n\n500\n00:27:59.662 --> 00:28:03.987\nAnd this is where I tell it\nto get-msolaccountsku for\n\n501\n00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:07.744\nthe type of licenses\nthat are available to me.\n\n502\n00:28:07.744 --> 00:28:12.538\nSo that tells me to get all of\nthem That I have available.\n\n503\n00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:18.789\nAnd now once I do that, I can do a get.\n\n504\n00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:22.705\nLet me see if I can reuse some of this\nto help me speed some things up here.\n\n505\n00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:26.423\nGet the unused ones and\n\n506\n00:28:26.423 --> 00:28:32.300\nthen set-msoluser license here.\n\n507\n00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:37.300\nDo a -Add licenses and\n\n508\n00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:44.890\nthen use the variable dot account sku,\nif I can spell it.\n\n509\n00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.610\nSku id and press Enter.\n\n510\n00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.720\nNow, I should see some red,\n\n511\n00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:55.730\nand that's because I only had 25\nlicenses that were assigned to me.\n\n512\n00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.570\nBut I had 30-something\naccounts that are here.\n\n513\n00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.736\nSo, it's going to try to fill in\neverything else, but then give me that So\n\n514\n00:29:01.736 --> 00:29:03.283\nI'm expecting to see some of this.\n\n515\n00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.969\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we could just scroll up.\n\n516\n00:29:04.969 --> 00:29:06.958\nI want to break down exactly\nwhat we did here, Ronnie.\n\n517\n00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:12.570\nYou were taking those\nexisting unlicensed users.\n\n518\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.810\nYou were typing that in to go ahead and\nset them, adding the licenses for\n\n519\n00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.086\nwhomever you didn't have\na license from before.\n\n520\n00:29:18.086 --> 00:29:19.934\n&gt;&gt; Correct\n&gt;&gt; Got it.\n\n521\n00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:20.897\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n522\n00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:25.722\nSo once we did that,\nnow we just need to verify who\n\n523\n00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:29.151\nactually now has the no licenses.\n\n524\n00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:32.742\n&gt;&gt; So I'm assuming you would already have\nto have these licenses purchased and\n\n525\n00:29:32.742 --> 00:29:33.368\navailable.\n\n526\n00:29:33.368 --> 00:29:36.036\nYou can't just haphazardly say,\nyeah you're all licensed now.\n\n527\n00:29:36.036 --> 00:29:40.462\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah so here at the end of this\nlist, this is who did not get licensed.\n\n528\n00:29:40.462 --> 00:29:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's fairly simple for\nus to begin to do this and\n\n529\n00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.410\nto get those things\nlicensed as we need to.\n\n530\n00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:51.520\nSo we can actually set that up as well,\nokay?\n\n531\n00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.180\nNow when we start to take a look at this,\nright?\n\n532\n00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.083\nThat's the kind of\nPowerShell way to do it.\n\n533\n00:29:57.083 --> 00:30:00.058\nMost of us that feel comfortable with the\nGUI we're probably gonna end up doing it\n\n534\n00:30:00.058 --> 00:30:01.260\nin the GUI, okay?\n\n535\n00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I was going to ask,\nin the GUI,\n\n536\n00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:06.240\nyou probably have the option to select and\nchoose which user you want.\n\n537\n00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.150\nBut let's say you had 20 licenses and\n25 users.\n\n538\n00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.232\nHow do you pick,\nhow does PowerShell pick and choose,\n\n539\n00:30:12.232 --> 00:30:13.643\nif you don't add those parameters?\n\n540\n00:30:13.643 --> 00:30:17.292\nIs it just gonna be enumerating and-\n&gt;&gt; Yep, this is pretty much,\n\n541\n00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:21.590\nwhatever was left in the way that it chose\nto go through the entire list there.\n\n542\n00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:26.470\nSo yeah, it doesn't seem like it actually\nbases it on a particular order here it's\n\n543\n00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:29.177\njust however I actually chose to sign them\n&gt;&gt; Got it\n\n544\n00:30:29.177 --> 00:30:31.091\n&gt;&gt; As far as I can see.\n\n545\n00:30:31.091 --> 00:30:35.347\nNow one last thing that I want to kind\nof do here is to make sure that we\n\n546\n00:30:35.347 --> 00:30:40.020\nunderstand that we can force\nthe synchronization as well, okay?\n\n547\n00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.590\nSo if I do a get dash AD sync\n\n548\n00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:48.760\nscheduler which I can 't\nspell Synch scheduler.\n\n549\n00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.320\nWe'll take a look at it just briefly.\n\n550\n00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.130\nWe can see that the schedule is\nhappening every 30 minutes here and\n\n551\n00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.130\nnotice that the synch cycle\ntype is what we call a delta.\n\n552\n00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:05.450\nDelta means that the changes are gone,\nnot necessarily everything that's full.\n\n553\n00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:09.320\nSo don't do a full synchronization by\nonly synch up based on the changes.\n\n554\n00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.020\nAnd we can also take a look at the\nprogress and the synchronization cycle.\n\n555\n00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.620\nWe want to make sure, of course,\n\n556\n00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.930\nif things are not syncing,\nthen we have it enabled right here.\n\n557\n00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.710\nTrue is another one.\n\n558\n00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.812\nBut if I wanted to force this,\n\n559\n00:31:24.812 --> 00:31:28.916\nI issue a start-ad sync cycle\n\n560\n00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:34.013\nactually ADSyncSyncCycle, okay?\n\n561\n00:31:34.013 --> 00:31:36.477\nThis is actually kind\nof a little bit weird.\n\n562\n00:31:36.477 --> 00:31:40.447\nNotice how it actually\nhas ADSyncSyncCycle.\n\n563\n00:31:40.447 --> 00:31:44.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If there is a particular exam\n\n564\n00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:50.009\nquestion writer that thinks that those.\n\n565\n00:31:50.009 --> 00:31:52.053\nThis something that\nRonnie Wong will not get.\n\n566\n00:31:52.053 --> 00:31:53.710\nHe is absolutely true.\n\n567\n00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.070\nI would go yeah that's wrong it's\ngot to be ADSyncSyncCycle and\n\n568\n00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.340\nthat's all we have to do.\n\n569\n00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:05.206\nBut notice this it actually is start\nADSyncSyncCycle is what we'd have here.\n\n570\n00:32:05.206 --> 00:32:06.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that just sounds wrong.\n\n571\n00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.410\n&gt;&gt; I know and then we need\na policy type is what we need.\n\n572\n00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:16.600\nPolicy type and once we do that,\nI actually can chose between Delta,\n\n573\n00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:22.045\nor, I can do what's called initial, okay?\n\n574\n00:32:22.045 --> 00:32:25.270\nOops, I can't spell initial how's that,\nokay?\n\n575\n00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.620\nInitial means full synchronization, and\n\n576\n00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.170\nthen of course, Delta need only\nsync up what is actually different.\n\n577\n00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.970\nSo, I've selected delta here and\npressed enter, and\n\n578\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.650\nit gives me the result\nhere as being a success.\n\n579\n00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:40.910\nDid everything sync up\nthe way that we wanted it to?\n\n580\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.790\nAs far as the changes go, yes.\n\n581\n00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.360\nOkay?\n\n582\n00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.510\nYou don't always have to wait for\n\n583\n00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.660\nthe 30 minutes, but here is\nthe actual information that we have.\n\n584\n00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.750\nSo in this episode we've talked about\nsome of the troubleshooting and\n\n585\n00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.300\nsome of the things that can happen.\n\n586\n00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.220\nNormally that's not gonna be the case.\n\n587\n00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.490\nBut at least I've shown you how I\nwalk through that in my process.\n\n588\n00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:02.080\nThen we showed you how to go through and\ncheck out some of the other things,\n\n589\n00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.370\nverify and understand the way that the\nsource of authority ends up working for\n\n590\n00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:12.670\nus a little bit as well as being able\nto create and modify users, of course.\n\n591\n00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.630\nRemember if you're doing this,\n\n592\n00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:17.640\nit's gonna always be from the on\npremises side as you add users in.\n\n593\n00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.570\nDon't try and add the in here\nonce you do the synchronization.\n\n594\n00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.940\nIt's not gonna really want you to do that.\n\n595\n00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:25.240\nYou're gonna always have to go to on\npremises, and then from that point,\n\n596\n00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.800\nwe even showed you how to\nforce the synchronization.\n\n597\n00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.670\nSo it gives us a lot of material\nto work with but that should,\n\n598\n00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.920\nat least get you started and\nget it set up.\n\n599\n00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.540\nAnd that means that the rest of this is\npretty much on you to try and figure out\n\n600\n00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.640\nall the ins and outs of the details, that\nyou'll need to do for every organization.\n\n601\n00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.018\n&gt;&gt; At least we have your\nhelp a little bit here.\n\n602\n00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:47.130\nYou walked us through some of those\ntroubleshooting steps, excuse me.\n\n603\n00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.170\nSo I know a lot of people\nwill appreciate that.\n\n604\n00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:49.987\nI know I sure do.\n\n605\n00:33:49.987 --> 00:33:50.979\nSo thank you, Ronny.\n\n606\n00:33:50.979 --> 00:33:54.096\nAnd thank you guys for joining us as well,\nbut I don't think we're quite finished.\n\n607\n00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:54.633\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n608\n00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:55.521\n&gt;&gt; No, all right, so\n\n609\n00:33:55.521 --> 00:33:58.582\nyou don't wanna miss what we have\nheaded your way coming up next.\n\n610\n00:33:58.582 --> 00:33:59.899\nI've been your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n611\n00:33:59.899 --> 00:34:00.856\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n612\n00:34:00.856 --> 00:34:03.552\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n613\n00:34:03.552 --> 00:34:09.062\n[MUSIC]\n\n614\n00:34:09.062 --> 00:34:12.670\nThank you for watching

00:00:08.326\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:11.751\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:17.970\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Managing Office365\nRequirements and IDs, identifications?\n\n6\n00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.870\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Alright, sounds good.\n\n7\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.965\nWe are back in studios today\nwith a very important topic and\n\n8\n00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:27.401\nthe topic is to plan for\nour ADF as a requirement.\n\n9\n00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.897\nSo how are we gonna get that set up.\n\n10\n00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:33.170\nAnd of course, we have Microsoft\nexpert with us today, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.200\nHow is it going today, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.970\n&gt;&gt; It is going well, Cherokee.\n\n13\n00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.660\nThank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on taking what.\n\n14\n00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.370\nand some of the next steps that\nwe have to begin planning for.\n\n15\n00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.290\nAnd the reason why we're now moving\ntowards this idea of planning for\n\n16\n00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.220\nthe federation services,\nthe active directory federation services,\n\n17\n00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.010\nis this is where companies\nare beginning to head and\n\n18\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.600\nwe're starting to see this is\nbecoming more popularized.\n\n19\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.560\nJust a couple years ago, even the active\ndirectory synchronization was\n\n20\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.130\nnot as popular as it is today, and that\nwas because it was a bit more complex.\n\n21\n00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.040\nThe tools that were in place to help\neverything work, they weren't fully baked.\n\n22\n00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040\nI don't know how else to describe it.\n\n23\n00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760\nThey could work, but\nthey weren't actually being updated.\n\n24\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.090\nThey worked sometimes,\nthey didn't work in certain situations.\n\n25\n00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.800\nThey're really designed to work around the\nidea of single domain and single force.\n\n26\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.230\nBut most companies ended up having well,\nmore than that.\n\n27\n00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.380\nAnd they needed other\nthings to come along.\n\n28\n00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.170\nSo when we start to take a look, that\nmeans there's more complexity involved in\n\n29\n00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.100\nthose organizations than just the way\nthat Microsoft started to set us up.\n\n30\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.850\nAnd that not only includes,\nof course, just that\n\n31\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.060\ndirectory synchronization information but\nalso the way that we sign in.\n\n32\n00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.310\nIn other words,\nauthentication is also changing because of\n\n33\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.340\nthe progress of the world and\nhow much we started to realize something.\n\n34\n00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.600\nUsername and passwords,\neven though we use them,\n\n35\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.400\nthey're probably still not the strongest\nform of authentication that we can use.\n\n36\n00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.620\nSo then the movement towards\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n37\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.330\nThe movement towards companies actually\nstarting to share the information, and\n\n38\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.740\nneeding to access certain\nof the same resources?\n\n39\n00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.270\nThat's where things started\ngetting more complicated, and\n\n40\n00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.510\nfederation services is designed to\nhelp us, okay, to make sure that\n\n41\n00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.200\nall that complexity that we're wanting\nto work here Is gonna become more and\n\n42\n00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.530\nmore standardized and easier and seamless\nto the end user is what we're saying.\n\n43\n00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, and I'm hoping you can help\nexplain how federation services is\n\n44\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.610\nactually able to tackle those additional\ncomplexities that you spoke about.\n\n45\n00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna take a little bit\nof time especially in talking about\n\n46\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.580\nthe planning out of these things.\n\n47\n00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580\nAnd that is because most\norganizations are probably saying,\n\n48\n00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.850\ndo I really need to use this one?\n\n49\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.550\nWell, it depends on your organization,\nright?\n\n50\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.180\nOf what they're actually doing and\nwhat is going on.\n\n51\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.930\nAnd how this is starting to happen.\n\n52\n00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.680\nSo, let me just give you kind of\na realistic real world example.\n\n53\n00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.870\nSome of the things that we\ndo right here at ITProTV.\n\n54\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.800\nThe very fact is that a lot of\norganizations that might sign up for\n\n55\n00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.850\na subscription or even for their company.\n\n56\n00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.680\nAnd say hey, we want ITProTV to\nbe our training provider, but\n\n57\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.870\nwe want this type of portal\nto be able to integrate in.\n\n58\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.310\nSo our users aren't having\nto go out to the website and\n\n59\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.600\nhaving to actually access\nthrough what we want instead.\n\n60\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.050\nWell, we don't want them\nto have to worry about\n\n61\n00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.230\nsigning in with a different\nauthentication method.\n\n62\n00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.430\nWe want them to present one idea and\nget that all done.\n\n63\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.060\nWell there are not a part\nof our ITPro.TV network but\n\n64\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.090\nthey still need access into us\nas a resource at the same time.\n\n65\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.770\nSo we need to have a way that allows them\nto use whatever their resources are.\n\n66\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.090\nAnd their own authentication method\nto get access to who we are as well.\n\n67\n00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.780\nSo we've got to set all that stuff up, and\neven though you might hear the term SAML\n\n68\n00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.560\nand OAuth, and all those different\nthings that are out there, well,\n\n69\n00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.080\nthis is similar in that sense, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.900\nI'm not gonna say it's exactly the same.\n\n71\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.460\nBut federation services really\nhelps us out in that sense, okay?\n\n72\n00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.450\nSo that if you have an organization\nthat says, look, here's my network.\n\n73\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.600\nI definitely want them\nto get access there.\n\n74\n00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.220\nI'm also using Office 365.\n\n75\n00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.150\nI want them to get access there, but\n\n76\n00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.990\nI don't want them to have to\nreally manage multiple passwords.\n\n77\n00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.320\nThat's kind of the easiest thing\nto think about, at least for\n\n78\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.200\nusers for the sake of computer users,\nthat's probably the primary aspect.\n\n79\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.120\nIs that the resources that they\nhave access to is actually gonna be\n\n80\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.370\navailable without actually adding\nto the complexity of their login or\n\n81\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.820\ntheir sign-ins in what\nwe're talking about, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.030\nSo that's where it actually comes out,\nokay.\n\n83\n00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.440\nSo that's what we're gonna focus\nin on right here at the beginning.\n\n84\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.980\nFor the federation services which,\nof course,\n\n85\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.700\nis just basic authentication or\nbasically, I shouldn't say.\n\n86\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.070\nDon't say basic authentication\ncuz that's technical.\n\n87\n00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.740\nBasically, the authentication\nside of accessing resources.\n\n88\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.130\n&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, it only makes sense\nbecause end users were kind of getting,\n\n89\n00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.190\nI don't wanna say spoiled but we're almost\nto that point where we do see those other\n\n90\n00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.470\ntechnologies that you mentioned,\nlike SAML and those OAUTH,\n\n91\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.180\nand it's more user centric.\n\n92\n00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.590\nSo they're not having to\ntake those extra steps.\n\n93\n00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.240\nSo if they're seeing this in\ntheir personal life, maybe for\n\n94\n00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.120\nsocial media and things like that,\nthey're like, why can't that\n\n95\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.950\nbe carried over here into our workplace\nand have that simplicity there as well?\n\n96\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.810\n&gt;&gt; And it does, it makes sense and that\nway the user is not having a task with\n\n97\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.390\nmore time and stoppage of,\nhow do I get access to that again?\n\n98\n00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.620\nThey simply do what they need to do and\nthey are ready to go.\n\n99\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.590\nSo let's kind of make sure\nthat we understand once again\n\n100\n00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.630\nsome of these scenarios that we normally\nare put up with as far as signing in goes.\n\n101\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.920\nNow, I've used this particular diagram,\nand\n\n102\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.160\nactually the next couple of them, over and\nover again just to drive home the point.\n\n103\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.600\nBecause if I don't drive home the point,\nyou're not gonna get the point.\n\n104\n00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So what's the point Ronnie?\n\n105\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.200\n&gt;&gt; So\nlet me just keep driving that point in.\n\n106\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.270\nSo remember that if we don't setup\nanything at all, currently right now\n\n107\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.290\nthe way that your organization\nis setup and most organizations\n\n108\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:57.060\nIf they start onboarding with Office 365,\nthe very basics is simple, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.300\nThey might have everything done\nin the on-premises emails, and\n\n110\n00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.420\neverything else, even their own storage,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n111\n00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.610\nWhen you sign in,\nyou actually do sign on and\n\n112\n00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.070\nthey check the source of authority\nright here within their own network.\n\n113\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.580\nIt make sense, everything is good.\n\n114\n00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.020\nThat's exactly what we want.\n\n115\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.720\nWe add in the Office 365 side to it,\n\n116\n00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.100\nit means actually more of a challenge for\nthe end user itself, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.860\nThen for anybody else actually\nhaving to use the information.\n\n118\n00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.470\nEstablishing and getting all this setup,\nwe've gone through all that making sure\n\n119\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.740\nthat you understand the ins and\nouts of basic installation and of course,\n\n120\n00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.400\nmaking sure identities and\nthe requirements are there, ready to go.\n\n121\n00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.840\nSo Office 365 itself, not exactly\ndifficult to get up and running.\n\n122\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.890\nOnce you start adding in\nthe email components and\n\n123\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.020\nthe SharePoint components and all that,\n\n124\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.680\nit gets a little more challenging when\nyou start enabling all those services.\n\n125\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.410\nBut at the end of it though,\nright, the user that signs on,\n\n126\n00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.240\nhe normally is also issued another set\nof credentials right here, okay, and\n\n127\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.760\nif you also have the exchange online,\nthat means another email.\n\n128\n00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.360\nEmail address is also right here as well.\n\n129\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.010\nSo in this sense everything is\nreally separated out, okay.\n\n130\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.830\nTwo separate accounts, okay.\n\n131\n00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.460\nEmail and identities and\npasswords, they are also separate.\n\n132\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.190\nThey can be totally different, but\nthat one user has access to both.\n\n133\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.840\nAs long as they can keep that straight\nyou don't really need to do anything.\n\n134\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.010\nBut once there becomes an added\ncomplexly of different things,\n\n135\n00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.980\nthat's when we have to start\nconsidering other options.\n\n136\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.810\nSo for example, what else can we do here?\n\n137\n00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.710\nI can actually start the azure\nactive directory synchronization,\n\n138\n00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.510\nusing the Azure AD connect tool.\n\n139\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.250\nAnd once I do that connection tool here,\nokay.\n\n140\n00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.049\nThis is not exactly saying everybody\nis actually going to be signing\n\n141\n00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:53.912\non over here or over here.\n\n142\n00:07:53.912 --> 00:07:56.850\nIt is now saying if you\ncan account over here, but\n\n143\n00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.442\nyou don't have an account over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n144\n00:08:00.442 --> 00:08:04.678\nLet me make sure that we do have\nthose two separate accounts and\n\n145\n00:08:04.678 --> 00:08:06.320\nthat it synchronizes.\n\n146\n00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.890\nIf you're missing the account over here,\n\n147\n00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.320\nI'm gonna make that account over here,\nokay?\n\n148\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.680\nMake sure that's up and going,\nand that's what we have.\n\n149\n00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.625\nThen the user changes here too, okay,\n\n150\n00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:20.740\nbecause it's actually\nan identical account, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.800\nAnd that's what we're focusing on.\n\n152\n00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.950\nThey really, at the end user side,\nseems like they're signing on over here.\n\n153\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.870\nThey're using the same username,\n\n154\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.410\nsame password as they would\nuse signing on over here.\n\n155\n00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:36.203\nTo the end user, it looks identical, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:36.203 --> 00:08:39.407\nSo they assume that they're really\nonly signing on in one place.\n\n157\n00:08:39.407 --> 00:08:43.300\nIn other words, the source of\nauthority resides only in one place.\n\n158\n00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.310\nDo they care,\ndo they know who that actually is?\n\n159\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.005\nNot really, for them,\nit's just that same way, okay?\n\n160\n00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:54.500\nThey are identical, okay, but\nthey are different accounts to do so.\n\n161\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.755\nSo we can go along with\nthat if we choose to.\n\n162\n00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:01.061\nIn this window, there are still some\ncomplexity requirements that we\n\n163\n00:09:01.061 --> 00:09:02.930\nhave to think about here.\n\n164\n00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.860\nFor example, if a user changes\ntheir particular username and\n\n165\n00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.920\nit has to follow our requirement.\n\n166\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.662\nWell what do we do at that point?\n\n167\n00:09:11.662 --> 00:09:15.926\nSo if someone let's say, for\nan organization, someone gets married and\n\n168\n00:09:15.926 --> 00:09:19.087\nthey change their name,\nwell if I change it over here,\n\n169\n00:09:19.087 --> 00:09:23.322\nit doesn't automatically necessarily\nsynchronize over here, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:24.385\nIt means at this point,\n\n171\n00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:28.080\nI have to actually figure out which\nside actually synchronizes to where.\n\n172\n00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.400\nSo this arrow that I've actually\ndrawn in the wrong direction here,\n\n173\n00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.490\nshould actually be only\none directional and\n\n174\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.260\nnot bidirectional here,\nis what I have to take care of.\n\n175\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.440\n&gt;&gt; We see one more typo,\nI think Greg is pointing out here.\n\n176\n00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.183\nFor your actual domain there,\n\n177\n00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:48.600\nxyz.omnimicroscoft.com, not\nomnimicrosoft.xyz.\n\n178\n00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.228\nIf that's what you've been\nusing throughout your show, but\n\n179\n00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:53.615\nI'm not sure because I'm kind\nof late in the game here.\n\n180\n00:09:53.615 --> 00:09:55.148\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n181\n00:09:55.148 --> 00:09:57.160\nthat's me more than likely there, yeah.\n\n182\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.870\nSo yeah, I do have that backward for\nright now.\n\n183\n00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.509\nSo if I were just to change that around,\nso here's what it\n\n184\n00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:07.767\nactually would be inside of the-\n&gt;&gt; And thanks, Greg.\n\n185\n00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:10.810\nI would have never known\nthe difference there, so yeah.\n\n186\n00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.089\n&gt;&gt; Micro, if I can spell Microsoft.\n\n187\n00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:16.267\nMicrosoft, there we go,\noops, almost close.\n\n188\n00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.010\nThere we go, okay.\n\n189\n00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.154\nSo yeah, I just had them kind of changed\naround there for a moment as well.\n\n190\n00:10:23.154 --> 00:10:26.820\nSo just kind of realize that this is\nwhat's gonna end up happening, right?\n\n191\n00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.964\nSo when we had that synchronization,\n\n192\n00:10:28.964 --> 00:10:32.180\nchanges up here do not\nnecessarily propagate over here.\n\n193\n00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.723\nSo it's not gonna end up working\nthe way that we want to.\n\n194\n00:10:34.723 --> 00:10:38.470\nWe gotta realize where our change will be\nand that could cause some issues, too.\n\n195\n00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.641\nSo that is what is\nconsidered same sign on.\n\n196\n00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:44.401\nThey're going to be identical because we\nknow where our source authority is gonna\n\n197\n00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:46.650\nbe, which is normally this, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.574\nNow, we can choose though to say look,\n\n199\n00:10:49.574 --> 00:10:53.304\nthis synchronization that\nworks is what we want.\n\n200\n00:10:53.304 --> 00:10:58.610\nBut the real result the,\nthe real thing that we want in the end,\n\n201\n00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.530\nif I can click on it here, is this.\n\n202\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.850\nAnd once my arrow,\n\n203\n00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.040\napparently I did this on an older\ncopy of what I thought here, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:14.600\nI want to make sure that a single\nidentity actually resides here, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.180\nInstead, now, even though the Active\nDirectory is actually synchronized here,\n\n206\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:26.320\nwhat we're really saying that if\nthe user accesses the Office365 here,\n\n207\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.460\nit's not really checking\nagainst an authority over here.\n\n208\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:36.590\nIt is actually kind of being redirected\nback over here to say hey, single sign-on,\n\n209\n00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.550\nor pass through authentication,\nis what we're talking about.\n\n210\n00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.331\nIt allows us to say, verify, authenticate,\nand make sure that everything is actually\n\n211\n00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:47.926\nright before I can get access over here,\nokay?\n\n212\n00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:51.652\nSo that's normally what ends up happening,\nokay?\n\n213\n00:11:51.652 --> 00:11:56.434\nSo in all of those instances, when we talk\nabout same sign-on or single sign-on, it's\n\n214\n00:11:56.434 --> 00:12:01.280\na decision of whether or not we actually\nneed something to help us out to do this.\n\n215\n00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.587\nIf we choose to go with this\nidea of a single sign-on,\n\n216\n00:12:04.587 --> 00:12:09.582\nin which it's gonna check with a single\nsource of authority to make sure that that\n\n217\n00:12:09.582 --> 00:12:12.594\nhappens, that means we\nhave to actually plan for\n\n218\n00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:17.531\nsetting up Active Directory Federation\nServices for single sign-on, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.900\nThat's what it actually comes down to.\n\n220\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.169\nNow in theory,\nhere's what the end result should be.\n\n221\n00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:28.784\nAnd I wish I actually had a little bit\nmore screen real estate at this point,\n\n222\n00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:31.137\nthere we go, okay\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you got a lot going on there.\n\n223\n00:12:31.137 --> 00:12:32.577\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot going on.\n\n224\n00:12:32.577 --> 00:12:35.940\nSo, let's make sure that we understanding\nwhat is happening here, okay?\n\n225\n00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.258\nThe same two principles\nare still in place.\n\n226\n00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:43.044\nWe still have the Azure AD and\nthe Azure Active Directory Connect tool\n\n227\n00:12:43.044 --> 00:12:46.960\nrunning inside of itprotvdemo over here,\nokay?\n\n228\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.739\nWe still have, of course,\nOffice365 set up.\n\n229\n00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:53.879\nWe still have\nthe Azure Synchronization going on.\n\n230\n00:12:53.879 --> 00:13:00.494\nBut now, if I go I want to\nimplement single sign-on, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:00.494 --> 00:13:05.310\nUsers will now have a single identity so\nthat they can access both.\n\n232\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.059\nIn this way,\nwe actually set up what we call,\n\n233\n00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:13.820\nof course,\nan Active Directory Federation Server.\n\n234\n00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.440\nThat's gonna be part of what we\ncall a federation server farm,\n\n235\n00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.060\nis what's gonna also happen here,\nso that when a user inside of\n\n236\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.781\nthis particular network itself,\nsays I need to access, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:31.797\nSo this kind of dotted line over here,\nI need to access Office365.\n\n238\n00:13:31.797 --> 00:13:38.430\nThe logon is not gonna let him\ndirectly logon to Office365.\n\n239\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:45.110\nInstead he or she, okay,\nis going to request\n\n240\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:50.640\nauthentication and\nbe redirected to the federation server.\n\n241\n00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.210\nThe federation server is not\nthe source of authority either.\n\n242\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.417\nThe federation server says,\nyou wanna access Office365?\n\n243\n00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:06.829\nPerfectly fine with me, but\nlet me go ahead and check your credentials\n\n244\n00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:11.620\nagainst my Active Directory\non-premises over here, okay?\n\n245\n00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:17.070\nAnd if the Active Directory on-premises\nsays yes, that is your particular account,\n\n246\n00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.920\nit will then issue and authorize\nthe Active Directory Federation Services.\n\n247\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.210\nWhich then, of course, authorizes you.\n\n248\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.820\nWhen it does that, it issues what we\ncall a service token at that point.\n\n249\n00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.880\nSo that now when you choose to connect\nto Office365, you're not sending any\n\n250\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.940\ntype of authentication\nprotocol to Office365.\n\n251\n00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:47.290\nYou're sending a token that\nOffice365 already trusts.\n\n252\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.168\nAnd it says as long as you have that\ntoken, I'm perfectly fine with that.\n\n253\n00:14:51.168 --> 00:14:55.939\nBut notice that everything that actually\ngives a user the ability to access out of\n\n254\n00:14:55.939 --> 00:14:59.588\nhere directly to Office365,\nand we're setting this up,\n\n255\n00:14:59.588 --> 00:15:02.750\nthey're not really authenticating up here.\n\n256\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.846\nNotice that they are using\ntheir own Active Directory.\n\n257\n00:15:06.846 --> 00:15:13.100\nSo Office365 is not saying I have my\nown database of users and computers.\n\n258\n00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.624\nI actually am going to accept,\nokay, this as being the proper\n\n259\n00:15:17.624 --> 00:15:22.323\nauthentication if everything\nelse is set up correctly, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:22.323 --> 00:15:27.930\nSo we have to actually be able to plan for\nthat idea if we are gonna be doing that.\n\n261\n00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.580\nSo we're actually gonna\nhave some shows coming up\n\n262\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.560\nwhere we're really setting this up.\n\n263\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.870\nNow we're gonna make some different\nassumptions when we first start\n\n264\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.150\ndoing this, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.190\nBut this is what we're actually doing, in\nthis diagram just to kind of let you know,\n\n266\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.810\nthere's actually another\ncomponent in this, okay?\n\n267\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:50.113\nIn this diagram, this is only for people\nthat are part of the itprotvdemo.com.\n\n268\n00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:53.972\nBut what if I have users that\nare traveling, Cherokee?\n\n269\n00:15:53.972 --> 00:15:58.207\nWhat if I have users that like\nto go out to the Starbucks and\n\n270\n00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:01.385\nbuy an insanely expensive\ncup of coffee and\n\n271\n00:16:01.385 --> 00:16:06.167\nsit there for Two hours listening\nto somebody play banjo music.\n\n272\n00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:07.710\nI'm joking,\nI don't know about the banjo music.\n\n273\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.682\nListening to whatever\nthe argument is of the day, okay?\n\n274\n00:16:11.682 --> 00:16:14.450\nBut they like to sit there\nat the coffee shop to do so.\n\n275\n00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:17.320\nWell, if this is gonna happen in that way,\n\n276\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.830\nthen the other part of this is\nwhat we call a web access proxy.\n\n277\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.360\nSo there's also going to be a proxy server\nthat sits out here on the edge that\n\n278\n00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.620\nnow allows for users outside of\nmy organization to still do this\n\n279\n00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.820\nidea and still authenticate against\nmy own Active Directory instead.\n\n280\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.570\nAnd still issue out the tokens\nthat need to be done.\n\n281\n00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.160\nSo that is the end result\nof what we want here, okay?\n\n282\n00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.580\nSo at that point, remember that here it\nis on this little box that I'm trying to,\n\n283\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.870\ntoo much to move around.\n\n284\n00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.579\nUsers have a single identity\nto access both, okay,\n\n285\n00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:56.225\nbut they're not really presenting\nany real authentication up here.\n\n286\n00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:59.429\nThey're only actually presenting\na token that they were issued through\n\n287\n00:16:59.429 --> 00:17:01.470\nthe Federation Server.\n\n288\n00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.820\nThe Active Directories\nare gonna be synchronized so\n\n289\n00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.590\nthat they can verify everything.\n\n290\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:09.430\nUsers sign on really only at one location,\nokay?\n\n291\n00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.970\nSo regardless of whether they think\nthey're signing on here, they're really\n\n292\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.300\ngetting redirected over here to say,\nverify to me, issue out the token.\n\n293\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.420\nIf I get the token, present that to me and\nthen I can get access in.\n\n294\n00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:26.820\nSo this is more of a control, but\nit allows us to be fairly flexible, okay?\n\n295\n00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.440\nIt means we don't have to set up\nthings in two different locations.\n\n296\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.450\nWe actually set it up inside of\nour own current active directory,\n\n297\n00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.740\nuse Federation Services to\nreally issue that token out, and\n\n298\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.080\nto make sure that we have\naccess to what we need.\n\n299\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.960\nSo of course that means that there has to\nbe some planning consideration in place\n\n300\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.880\nto be able to do so\nwhen we actually want to to do this, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.660\nNow some of these things we're just\ngonna make a short list of them and\n\n302\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.060\nthe reason why is this, Cherokee, okay?\n\n303\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.800\nIf you go to the Server 2012 and\nthe Server 2016 shows,\n\n304\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.220\nyou can see all of us here at\nITProTV going through those shows.\n\n305\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.389\nAnd there's a big portion of it\non Federation Services, okay?\n\n306\n00:18:11.389 --> 00:18:14.032\nAnd when I say big,\nI mean lots of episodes,\n\n307\n00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:16.400\nlots of shows on Federation Services.\n\n308\n00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:23.270\nThe best thing that I can do is say, if\nyou don't understand federation services,\n\n309\n00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.082\nmake sure you go back and\nwatch those shows on the inside of whether\n\n310\n00:18:28.082 --> 00:18:31.217\nit's Server 2012 or Server 2016,\nwhichever version that you're on.\n\n311\n00:18:31.217 --> 00:18:34.970\nGet a solid and better understanding\nof how the Federation Services\n\n312\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.950\nare actually working and\nhow they end up running, okay.\n\n313\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:43.690\nSo in other words, there's a prerequisite\nand a pre-assumption here of knowledge,\n\n314\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.520\neven before you take the exam itself.\n\n315\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.030\n&gt;&gt; Really, okay?\n\n316\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that you understand\nhow Federation Services work.\n\n317\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.020\nSo if you're going in this,\ngo Ronnie taught me all I need to know\n\n318\n00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.010\nabout Federation Services,\nyou are fooling yourself, okay?\n\n319\n00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.340\nWe're really only talking\nabout a relatively small part.\n\n320\n00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.580\nAnd but the planning considerations\nthat go into place, of course,\n\n321\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.770\nis do you actually have all of\nyour DNS stuff ready to go, okay?\n\n322\n00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.570\nDo you know what is setup?\n\n323\n00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.420\nDo you have everything ready for\nyour Federation Services setup and\n\n324\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.300\nready to go internally as well as\nexternally on your registrar if you're\n\n325\n00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.720\nactually going to do this.\n\n326\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.060\nYou also are gonna need\na third party certificate.\n\n327\n00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.360\nMost of us, it's no big deal.\n\n328\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.290\nBut if you don't know how to get one,\nit means you gotta get one.\n\n329\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.140\nSo if you're actually saying, well, what\nif I wanna practice this on my own lab,\n\n330\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.640\nand I wanna do that?\n\n331\n00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.520\nPerfectly fine, take advantage of\nthe free resources that are out there.\n\n332\n00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.989\nNow for example, on the one that we'll\nbe setting up, Cherokee, I went in and\n\n333\n00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:47.490\nI got a free, I think, 30-day or 90-day\ncert that would allow me to do this, okay?\n\n334\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:53.781\nNow when you do that, it might sound,\nI'm kind of oversimplifying this.\n\n335\n00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:58.570\nYou do have to have\na registered DNS domain, okay?\n\n336\n00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.300\nSo if you're going, I don't have\nregistered DNS domain, go ahead and\n\n337\n00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.817\nfind one of those registrars.\n\n338\n00:20:02.817 --> 00:20:06.724\nI'm using Hover.com, GoDaddy, you name it.\n\n339\n00:20:06.724 --> 00:20:08.043\nActually in previous episodes,\n\n340\n00:20:08.043 --> 00:20:10.218\nwe've talked about this with\npeople in our chatroom.\n\n341\n00:20:10.218 --> 00:20:14.190\nIt's about 12, 13, $14 US per year.\n\n342\n00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.310\nI'm not talking about anything expensive.\n\n343\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.750\nNow if you try and register like Nike.com,\nthat's a little different.\n\n344\n00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.040\nThat's gonna kinda get you.\n\n345\n00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.170\nBut you're not gonna be\nable to do that anyways.\n\n346\n00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.260\nBut you could actually register\nprobably your own name, right?\n\n347\n00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.572\nSo for mine, RonnieWong.com,\nI could probably do that.\n\n348\n00:20:30.572 --> 00:20:32.435\nIt would probably cost me 15 bucks a year.\n\n349\n00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:33.909\nKnowing my luck,\nsomebody's already taken it.\n\n350\n00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:35.328\n&gt;&gt; I know,\nI was like I gotta check this out now.\n\n351\n00:20:35.328 --> 00:20:38.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But getting that done, right?\n\n352\n00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.690\nBecause when you get that certificate,\nthey're gonna say all right,\n\n353\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:42.910\nfill out all this information.\n\n354\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.270\nCool, cool, cool, and then it's gonna ask\nyou to generate a certificate request.\n\n355\n00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.159\nDo you know how to do that?\n\n356\n00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:50.520\nYou gotta know how to do that.\n\n357\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.040\nAnd if you're saying,\nwell, are we doing it?\n\n358\n00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.680\nWe're not, because we're assuming that\nyou had that knowledge to do that.\n\n359\n00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.540\nIn generating that request,\npop it over to whoever you're\n\n360\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.210\ngetting that certificate from and\nthen it's going to ask you to validate.\n\n361\n00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:08.960\nAnd what it actually asks you for\nof course is, well, where is your domain?\n\n362\n00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.710\nAnd from that point it's going\nto ask to send you something.\n\n363\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.165\nWell, did you have your\ndomain name mail enabled?\n\n364\n00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:16.802\nIf you do, then good.\n\n365\n00:21:16.802 --> 00:21:21.300\nThat's gonna cost you another 5 bucks a\nmonth or something, but you name it, okay?\n\n366\n00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.270\nThere's a lot of setup to\nactually getting this done.\n\n367\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:29.890\nOr if you don't know how to actually add\nin DNS records to your registrar, okay, to\n\n368\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.220\nget this thing confirmed, then yeah, it's\ngonna be a little bit more challenging.\n\n369\n00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.180\nSo I don't wanna downplay this.\n\n370\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.570\nAt the same time I'm trying not\nto make it overly complicated.\n\n371\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.282\nBut just realize it's beyond what we're\nnormally gonna cover inside of our show.\n\n372\n00:21:46.282 --> 00:21:51.581\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I was working with Adam for\nsome of those Federation Services in 2012.\n\n373\n00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:54.261\nI can't remember if we did 2016 or\nnot, guys, but\n\n374\n00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:56.310\nit's definitely worth taking a look at.\n\n375\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.360\nAnd you already have access to it if\nyou're watching these shows hopefully,\n\n376\n00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.810\nso please, yeah.\n\n377\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.090\n&gt;&gt; And\nit really is gonna help you if you don't,\n\n378\n00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.530\nI'm not saying you have\nto be a master at it.\n\n379\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.500\nDon't get me wrong, it'll probably\nactually save you from listening to my\n\n380\n00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.880\nfumbling and being, let me do it\nthe way that I know how to do it.\n\n381\n00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.130\nRonnie's just kind of\nfumbling through this here.\n\n382\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.330\nBut just kind of realize that\nyou have to think about it.\n\n383\n00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.990\nAlso, of course, topologies, and\ndependencies that you have to worry about.\n\n384\n00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.890\nThis is all about your infrastructure\nplanning and what you have to set up.\n\n385\n00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:28.652\nAs far as the proxy topologies, right?\n\n386\n00:22:28.652 --> 00:22:32.370\nIf you're not going to set up for\noutside users connecting in or for\n\n387\n00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.740\npartner companies connecting in,\nyou drop that part.\n\n388\n00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.190\nBut if you are, you need to plan for\nyour proxy servers and\n\n389\n00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.290\nmake sure you know what\nthose are out there.\n\n390\n00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.610\nAnd available and getting them ready to\ngo and do what we need to as well, okay?\n\n391\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.230\nSo there is a lot more consideration\nin the planning than what we're really\n\n392\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.380\ncovering in terms of all the details,\nokay?\n\n393\n00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.800\nAnd this is where those\nother shows inside of,\n\n394\n00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.330\nif you take a look at the MCSA,\nwhether it's for Server 2012 or 2016, and\n\n395\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.920\nthey've gone through those\non the Federation Services.\n\n396\n00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.990\nMake sure you take a look at those.\n\n397\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:10.410\nIf you're totally blind to this,\ngo back and see the implementation of it.\n\n398\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.415\nBecause even though we're going to talk\nabout the post-installation a little bit,\n\n399\n00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:18.010\nand we'll sort of walk through\nthe installation to a point\n\n400\n00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:19.730\nwe're not spending a lot of time and\n\n401\n00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.010\ndepth in saying, here's all the stuff\nyou've gotta make sure are set up.\n\n402\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.150\nBecause we're assuming that you\nalready have some of that knowledge.\n\n403\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.900\nIf you're gonna be using\nmulti-factor authentication, and\n\n404\n00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.870\nthis is something else too, okay?\n\n405\n00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:38.210\nGet this kind of stuck in your head,\ncuz I can't tell you what's on the exam.\n\n406\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.418\nI wish I could just tell you, this is\nwhat's on the exam, but I can't, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:42.418 --> 00:23:45.780\nThink about this in terms of\nsetting something up, okay?\n\n408\n00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.900\nIf there's a scenario of where they said,\n\n409\n00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.870\nwhich of the following would\nhelp you to set this up, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.280\nAnd you hear the term multi-factor\nauthentication, okay, say, well,\n\n411\n00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.051\nguess what?\n\n412\n00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:59.020\nYou better have Federation Services, okay?\n\n413\n00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.541\nThat's as close as I can talk, okay?\n\n414\n00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:04.448\nSo you're not gonna be able to do\nmulti-factor authentication and\n\n415\n00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:06.920\njust using the same sign on,\njust doing that.\n\n416\n00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.260\nYou're gonna have to do this.\n\n417\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.120\nNow, do you have to set this up on your\nown inside of your own internal stuff?\n\n418\n00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.277\nNo, you can go to Microsoft and\nthey can actually kind of say,\n\n419\n00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:17.332\nhere's how you can setup\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n420\n00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:20.370\nThey're still using a federation service,\nyou'll just pay a subscription for\n\n421\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:21.675\nit instead of doing it on your own.\n\n422\n00:24:21.675 --> 00:24:24.227\nBut just realize it's out there,\nit is available,\n\n423\n00:24:24.227 --> 00:24:26.084\nall that stuff is right there for you.\n\n424\n00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:28.386\nBut if you're using\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n425\n00:24:28.386 --> 00:24:31.770\npart of that plan includes setting up\nFederation Services, of course, okay?\n\n426\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.498\nThe last one here of course,\nis access filtering using claims.\n\n427\n00:24:36.498 --> 00:24:38.938\nOkay, that was just my mouse-\n&gt;&gt; Cursor.\n\n428\n00:24:38.938 --> 00:24:41.020\n&gt;&gt; In the way,\nI thought ooh that's not right.\n\n429\n00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.909\nClaims rules,\nnow what the heck is that about, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:49.026\nYou have to understand this idea of\nhow Federation Services can work,\n\n431\n00:24:49.026 --> 00:24:51.490\nwhich is great, okay, overall, okay?\n\n432\n00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.690\nAnd in this way, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:58.720\nSo Cherokee, let's say this in terms of\nunderstanding access filtering, okay?\n\n434\n00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.410\nAccess filtering means what?\n\n435\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.692\nWho do I want to get access, okay?\n\n436\n00:25:01.692 --> 00:25:04.580\nI'm gonna filter who I\nwant to allow access in.\n\n437\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.800\nBy default, everyone's allow to access it.\n\n438\n00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.840\nThat's what it comes down to, okay?\n\n439\n00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.875\nBut using claims rules,\nwhat the heck is that about?\n\n440\n00:25:11.875 --> 00:25:16.600\nWell this is saying Ronnie, you don't have\nto set this up in terms of doing this, but\n\n441\n00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.020\nit's based on where,\n\n442\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:23.520\nwhen a user connects in,\nwhere they are claiming that the rule is.\n\n443\n00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.231\nSo for example, if Cherokee was\ntravelling to Nevada, okay?\n\n444\n00:25:28.231 --> 00:25:29.912\nAt some point.\nAnd we're here in Florida, okay?\n\n445\n00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:31.731\nShe's travelling to Nevada.\n\n446\n00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:35.821\nI can actually say, when somebody\nmakes a claim that, in other words,\n\n447\n00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:40.251\nas they connect in, that we're locating\nthem, as far as the location goes,\n\n448\n00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:43.607\nin Nevada, I don't know if I\ncould do that, I could do US.\n\n449\n00:25:43.607 --> 00:25:45.950\nBut let's use Nevada as an example here.\n\n450\n00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.056\nIf they're located in Nevada,\nI can say nope,\n\n451\n00:25:49.056 --> 00:25:51.460\nI'm not gonna let them connect in, okay?\n\n452\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.540\nWe can do this for certain locations.\n\n453\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.910\nAnd it's not just for locations, it's for\n\n454\n00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:59.142\nany detail that you want to, that\nfalls underneath this idea of a claim.\n\n455\n00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:04.529\nSo location-based is kind of an easy\none for us to use an example of.\n\n456\n00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:09.910\nBut yes, do you know what you can actually\nkind of do the access filtering based on?\n\n457\n00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.690\nAnd where you need to do this?\n\n458\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.130\nThey're saying think about all this\nbefore you go ahead and set this up.\n\n459\n00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.482\nCuz if not, and then you're now starting\nto set it up after you get it all done?\n\n460\n00:26:18.482 --> 00:26:20.460\nIt's gonna take you longer.\n\n461\n00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.105\nIf you haven't went ahead and\nplanned all this stuff out,\n\n462\n00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:26.620\nto make sure that you know\nwhat is gonna happen.\n\n463\n00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.559\nNow in our setup, right,\n\n464\n00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:30.610\nin the lab setup, we're not gonna worry\nabout doing all of these different claims.\n\n465\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.910\nWe're not even gonna do the multi-factor\nauthentication setup, okay?\n\n466\n00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.321\nBut what we are going to end up doing,\nright?\n\n467\n00:26:37.321 --> 00:26:41.692\nIs we're gonna show you, of course,\nhow this setup actually does work.\n\n468\n00:26:41.692 --> 00:26:44.143\nWe're gonna walk you\nthrough the basic steps and\n\n469\n00:26:44.143 --> 00:26:47.908\nmake sure that you understand what is\nactually available to get it set up and\n\n470\n00:26:47.908 --> 00:26:50.209\nto at least get it basically working,\nokay?\n\n471\n00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:55.363\nFrom that point, later on in our series\nwe're also gonna add in that web access\n\n472\n00:26:55.363 --> 00:27:00.302\nproxy that will allow us to then test\nsomebody not connected to my network.\n\n473\n00:27:00.302 --> 00:27:04.320\nIs now gonna be able to test and verify\nthat it works the way that we showed you.\n\n474\n00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.580\nWe'll update and modify that\ndiagram a little bit to try and\n\n475\n00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.800\nadd that in to help us out as well.\n\n476\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.620\nBut these are some of the planning\nconsiderations that we\n\n477\n00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.740\ncannot overlook, okay?\n\n478\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.655\nSo when you think that\nyou've got everything setup,\n\n479\n00:27:17.655 --> 00:27:20.914\nyou're probably still missing\nabout 25 to 30% of it.\n\n480\n00:27:20.914 --> 00:27:24.518\nBecause you can't think of everything\nunless you actually have tried to think of\n\n481\n00:27:24.518 --> 00:27:25.950\neverything, okay?\n\n482\n00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:32.030\nSo do not walk into the exam blind saying,\nthat's easy, I'll just follow this guide.\n\n483\n00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.516\nAnd that can work until\nyou follow the guide and\n\n484\n00:27:34.516 --> 00:27:36.691\nyou get spit out 16 different errors.\n\n485\n00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:39.142\nAnd it says you're still\nmissing stuff,okay?\n\n486\n00:27:39.142 --> 00:27:40.690\nYou're still doing this.\n\n487\n00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.745\nAnd we'll even show you some of the issues\nthat you'll run into, at least at\n\n488\n00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:47.352\nthe beginning when you're trying to test\nit, when you're also using Server 2016.\n\n489\n00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:50.170\nSo there's a lot more\nto this than we think.\n\n490\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.120\nBut at the same time,\nit's something that you've gotta plan for.\n\n491\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.780\nIt's not something you just go,\nlet me just install the role and\n\n492\n00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.120\nlet's see what happens.\n\n493\n00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.280\nIt's not that particular way of\nsetting up and making it work, okay?\n\n494\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.490\nSo get that in your mind, go through some\nof the elements in the requirements here\n\n495\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.910\nthat we're talking about.\n\n496\n00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:07.830\nAnd then once that's done,\n\n497\n00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.970\nthat means we are gonna be ready\nthen to move on to the installing\n\n498\n00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.946\nof Federation Services, and getting it\nready for setting up for single sign on.\n\n499\n00:28:15.946 --> 00:28:19.390\n&gt;&gt; Pretty cool Ronnie and\nthank you for at least helping and\n\n500\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.100\nassist us with understanding\nthat each topology\n\n501\n00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.960\nis gonna require different\nconfigurations and set up there, so\n\n502\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.130\nyou guys can be prepared for how to\ngo ahead and set up ADFS, thank you.\n\n503\n00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.985\nAnd thank you for joining us as

California.\n\n3\n00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.269\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:08.416\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:11.803\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:16.750\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Microsoft Office 365,\nIdentities and Requirements Series.\n\n7\n00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.900\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.990\nIn this episode, we'll be taking\na look at, well how to install and\n\n9\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.250\nmanage our ADFS server.\n\n10\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.980\nAnd with us today, back in studios,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n11\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.060\nHow is it going, Ronnie?\n\n12\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.737\n&gt;&gt; It's going well, Cherokee, thank you\nfor having me back on the show, as we\n\n13\n00:00:32.737 --> 00:00:37.710\ncontinue to take a look here at installing\nan Active Directory Federation Server\n\n14\n00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.119\nto get us ready for the single\nsign-on that we have with Office 365.\n\n15\n00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:44.127\nSo the great thing about this is,\n\n16\n00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.713\nwe don't really have to add in\na bunch of additional tools,\n\n17\n00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:52.060\nbut there are a few pre-requisites\nthat we want to make sure of, okay?\n\n18\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.070\nWhen we first set up an Active\nDirectory Federation Server, okay,\n\n19\n00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.050\none of the things, of course, that you\nhave to get is going to be a third party\n\n20\n00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.600\ncertificate, okay, when things go out now.\n\n21\n00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.480\nCan you do this with\nan internal certificate, yes.\n\n22\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.280\nYou can as long as you can get the other\nside to trust your certificate,\n\n23\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.250\nyou are off and ready to go.\n\n24\n00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.190\nSo generally, what you do, is you obtain\na third party certificate for your\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.370\nFederation Server, so you can go out to,\nand find on your favorite search engine.\n\n26\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.170\nDo what I did.\n\n27\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.500\nDo a trial certificate.\n\n28\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.150\nA trial SSL certificate.\n\n29\n00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.690\nAnd that way, you fill it out,\nyou're off and ready to go.\n\n30\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.298\nOnce you get to that point where you're\nready to make the request, they'll have\n\n31\n00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:41.594\nyou verify that you own that domain name,\nand that's actually gonna key.\n\n32\n00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:44.725\nCuz in the end when you do this,\nlet me show you here on my side,\n\n33\n00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:47.390\nlet's see if I can actually sign in here.\n\n34\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.656\nSo once I sign in, they're gonna ask you,\nokay, to verify your ownership.\n\n35\n00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:58.570\nAnd one of the ways that they ask\nyou to verify your ownership,\n\n36\n00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.420\nmaybe doing what we call a CNAME\nhash is what it will give you.\n\n37\n00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.463\nIt's this big long number and\n\n38\n00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:08.475\nyou'll have to enter that\nthing into your DNS registrar.\n\n39\n00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:12.135\nAnd once you do that, and there's actually\nexactly the way that they want it,\n\n40\n00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:15.629\nthey'll verify that your ownership is\nthere and that you are ready to go for\n\n41\n00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.150\neverything else that you'll have to do,\nokay?\n\n42\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.890\nAt that point, you'll be able, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.280\nthen to get access to what they send\nyou which is going to be a copy\n\n44\n00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.530\nof your certificate after you generate\nthat certificate request as well, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.620\nNow, generating certificate\nrequest inside of Server 2016.\n\n46\n00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.991\nYou can actually do that by installing, of\ncourse, the web server if you choose to,\n\n47\n00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:47.558\nor by running a particular program\ncalled DigiCert, that's out there,\n\n48\n00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:52.443\nand I don't know if I still have\nit on my computer or not, there.\n\n49\n00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:57.434\nSo let me see if I can show you\nthe DigiCert here, I still may have it,\n\n50\n00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:58.756\nhere there it is.\n\n51\n00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:06.312\nThe DigiCert utility So\n\n52\n00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.669\nhere's the DigiCert utility, and\nyou can see where it actually did get\n\n53\n00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.500\nissued a certificate,\nfrom Comodo here, to do so.\n\n54\n00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.460\nYou can run something like this to\nhelp you to create that request, make\n\n55\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.900\nsure you choose the SSL type, and that you\nenter in all of the available information.\n\n56\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.615\nThe more information that you can\nenter in, the better it's gonna be.\n\n57\n00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.842\nIt's gonna generate for you that\ncertificate in the end, and of course,\n\n58\n00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.497\nwherever you actually go for\nthat third party certificate,\n\n59\n00:03:32.497 --> 00:03:36.214\nyou'll have to enter that information in\nand you'll get your certificate, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:40.096\nSo this has been around for\na while, that's out there.\n\n61\n00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:44.220\nSo I just found it then, I said,\nthat's the one that's used for ADFS a lot.\n\n62\n00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.240\nSo I just did that,\ngenerate that certificate.\n\n63\n00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.200\nAnd once you have that right,\nyou've got kinda the important\n\n64\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.980\npieces of information that you need,\nif you're gonna run ADFS to get that done.\n\n65\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.902\nThe other thing that you may need, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.470\nCertificate is definitely\nan important part, but\n\n67\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.000\nif you are also going to be doing.\n\n68\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.520\nOkay?\n\n69\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.250\nThe idea here of running\nthat web access proxy.\n\n70\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.450\nYou're gonna also need\na public IP address.\n\n71\n00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.100\nOkay?\n\n72\n00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.767\nSo check out your organization, and\n\n73\n00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:19.510\nverify that your ADFS machine can get\na public IP address assigned to it.\n\n74\n00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.470\nAnd make sure that that's yours to use,\nand then you're off and ready to go.\n\n75\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.910\nIt may take you a little bit\nof time to request that, but\n\n76\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.850\nonce everything is done,\nyou'll need that as well.\n\n77\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.680\nIf you're not going to be\ndoing the web access proxy,\n\n78\n00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.140\nyou don't have to worry about\nusing the public IP address.\n\n79\n00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.950\nBut if you are gonna do that,\nmake sure you get a public IP address.\n\n80\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.650\nNot a private one, that's not gonna\nhelp you out as well, all right?\n\n81\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.050\nSo two basic requirements there for\nthe install and\n\n82\n00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.790\ngetting everything to work, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; So once we get that done,\n\n84\n00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.150\nthe next step is really kind\nof just following along some\n\n85\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.480\nof the things we would normally\ndo in setting up a server.\n\n86\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.617\nI just clicked on the start menu, and I'm\ngonna bring up the server manager because\n\n87\n00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:04.540\nthe the Active Directory Federation\nServices is really just a role.\n\n88\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.510\nNow, you'll see I've already\ninstalled this right here,\n\n89\n00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.410\nbut it'll give us a chance to a walk\nthrough a portion of what we need to,\n\n90\n00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.850\nto get some of the things set up here.\n\n91\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.149\nSo this is where you go through the add,\nroles and feature wizard.\n\n92\n00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.730\nAnd of course, you select the server\nthat you're gonna install this on.\n\n93\n00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.590\nVerify that you've got this one checked.\n\n94\n00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.097\nAnd you'll see where it\nactually says install.\n\n95\n00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:28.860\nAnd yours may not say\ninstalled at that point.\n\n96\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.350\nAnd then you continue to proceed.\n\n97\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.600\nUsually, the kind of requirement\nthat's for everything,\n\n98\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.990\nis going to be at least dot net framework,\nfour something, at this point.\n\n99\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.160\nSo I just continue to proceed on and\nlet it finish its install.\n\n100\n00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.224\nAt the end,\nit's gonna generate, of course,\n\n101\n00:05:45.224 --> 00:05:49.450\ntelling you that it's fully installed,\nbut it needs additional configuration.\n\n102\n00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.970\nYou'll end up seeing in 2016,\nwhere it'll tell you click here, and\n\n103\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.090\ngo to the configuration sock,\nokay, which is fine.\n\n104\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.330\nYou'll answer a lot of questions\nincluding, how, of course,\n\n105\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.630\nto get access to that certificate\nto get that installed.\n\n106\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.280\nAnd you'll need two accounts here, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.240\nAnd you'll just have to kind of follow\nalong in where they ask you for it.\n\n108\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.593\nMore than likely,\n\n109\n00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:19.437\nyou'll actually need to make sure that you\nare logged in as a domain admin, okay?\n\n110\n00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:22.067\nSo they actually need to make sure\nthat you actually get logged in\n\n111\n00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:23.820\nas a domain administrator.\n\n112\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.900\nSecondly, you may also need\nthe enterprise administrator account.\n\n113\n00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.860\nUsually, you don't have to\nworry about that one too much,\n\n114\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.420\nunless it asks you for it.\n\n115\n00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.260\nBut if you're gonna be doing something\nthat's gonna ask you for the enterprise\n\n116\n00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.310\nadministrator, make sure you also\nhave access to that account as well.\n\n117\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.290\nSo I am going to select tools in\nthe upper right hand corner, and\n\n118\n00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.910\nthen click on ADFS management.\n\n119\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.980\nOkay, so\nonce you run through that install, it is,\n\n120\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.560\nyou are gonna have to kinda\nfill out the information.\n\n121\n00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.770\nAnd this is simple, okay.\n\n122\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.580\nA lot of it is the idea of\nproviding the right credentials.\n\n123\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.860\nThe other thing that you\nmay also want to create,\n\n124\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.210\nis going to be a group\nmanaged service account.\n\n125\n00:07:07.898 --> 00:07:11.030\nLet me make sure I can show you\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n126\n00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.970\nWait, it's not on this computer.\n\n127\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou were on the Windows 10 machine.\n\n128\n00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was on the other one.\n\n129\n00:07:27.672 --> 00:07:28.789\n&gt;&gt; Think that's it?\n\n130\n00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.559\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n131\n00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:36.125\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I do think that's it.\n\n132\n00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:37.742\nI was like,\nwhere did my active directory search?\n\n133\n00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:38.540\nThere we go.\n\n134\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.040\nOkay.\n\n135\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.780\nSo if I go under Manage Service accounts,\nyou'll see.\n\n136\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.489\nI also created this, which was\na group managed service account, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:48.980\nI put both of them up here.\n\n138\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.954\nThis is for your sake,\ndepending on what you wanna do, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:55.455\nRemember that a managed service account\nit sent you, the password doesn't expire.\n\n140\n00:07:55.455 --> 00:08:00.272\nBut in security safe, we normally want our\npasswords to change anyway after a while.\n\n141\n00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:03.653\nSo creating a group managed\nservice account instead will\n\n142\n00:08:03.653 --> 00:08:08.740\nallow us to actually have the passwords\nrotated on a periodic basis instead.\n\n143\n00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.010\nAnd you'll also need to install and\nverify that your key, your KDC,\n\n144\n00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.790\nyour key management server is also up and\nrunning to ensure that\n\n145\n00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.730\nthat will actually generate and\nrotate your passwords as well.\n\n146\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.360\nSo either way, right, you actually\nhave that created and ready to go.\n\n147\n00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.330\nThis is the recommended method with 2016,\nis to use that.\n\n148\n00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.150\nAnd I always put a g in front of it for\nthe group managed service instead and\n\n149\n00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.518\nyou can even see the type here.\n\n150\n00:08:35.518 --> 00:08:38.430\nThe MSA Group Managed Service Account.\n\n151\n00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.990\nSo, those are some of\nthe things that you wanna\n\n152\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.060\nmake sure that you have\nready to go if you need to.\n\n153\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.200\nAnd during the walk through on the wizard\nas you start it, it will tell you,\n\n154\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.030\nhey, which particular account is\ngonna be used as a service account.\n\n155\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.700\nThen you select that service account and\nthen you're off and ready to go.\n\n156\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.670\nOnce you are done and the configuration\nis set up at the end here, okay, and\n\n157\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.280\neverything is going through,\n\n158\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.920\nthis is where you want to check\nwhich is underneath services, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.650\nSo at this point, you can of course\ngo through each one of these,\n\n160\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.550\nbut I wanna point out the idea\nof the authentication methods.\n\n161\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.600\nAnd now you can see under Intranet,\ninternally, Windows Authentication,\n\n162\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.230\nPassport authentication,\nForms authentication, Extranet.\n\n163\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.100\nYou see all this stuff as well.\n\n164\n00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.270\nAnd of course, even Multi-factor as well,\nif you want to.\n\n165\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.370\nAll of this is still configurable,\nas long as you know how to configure it.\n\n166\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.090\nWe're not getting into that in\nthis shelf right now, okay.\n\n167\n00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.090\nThe other one that should\nshow up automatically,\n\n168\n00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.660\nof course,\nis going to be your certificate.\n\n169\n00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.650\nSo, here you can see\nmy entire certificate.\n\n170\n00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:50.140\nAnd I added it in, and there is\nan alias attached to this too, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.590\nSo I made a ADFS,\nthe name of my server is actually\n\n172\n00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.850\nFS01 for the Federation Service 01.\n\n173\n00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.910\nThe reason is if I know that in\nthe future my network continues to grow,\n\n174\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.620\nI may add in another federation server and\nI continue to go on and\n\n175\n00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.010\nI create what we call\na federation server farm, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.450\nSo if you set that up you also do that\nduring the installation process as well.\n\n177\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.540\nNow the only thing that I wanna make\nsure of before we move further in,\n\n178\n00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.150\nin term of this, is at that point,\nit's gonna ask you one of two things.\n\n179\n00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.310\nWhen it says, hey,\nwhat do you want to do here,\n\n180\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.850\nat the very beginning when\nyou start the installation.\n\n181\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.502\nYou wanna create a stand alone,\nfederation server or\n\n182\n00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:38.500\ndo you want this to be a farm,\nthey are the first one in the farm.\n\n183\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.590\nIf you do a standalone,\nit means that you will not be able to add\n\n184\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:47.630\nin an additional federation server\nif your network continues to grow.\n\n185\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.750\nSo, that's not a good thing.\n\n186\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.124\nNormally, the best practice,\nof course, is to just say,\n\n187\n00:10:53.124 --> 00:10:55.697\nI'm gonna create a federation server farm.\n\n188\n00:10:55.697 --> 00:11:01.526\nAnd that way, when you create this name\nto give to that farm that means all\n\n189\n00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:07.190\nof those different servers,\nmy FS01, 02, 010, or FS10.\n\n190\n00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.560\nAll those can now be listed\nunderneath that one name and\n\n191\n00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.880\nI can hit any of those to allow me to\ndo my federation services if I need to.\n\n192\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.090\nSo you'll actually see the ones for\nof course decrypting,\n\n193\n00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.080\nservice communications and\nnotice everything is actually encrypted.\n\n194\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.240\nAnd there's that token sign in that\nwe were talking about in the previous\n\n195\n00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.410\nepisode.\n\n196\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:32.400\nWhere remember when we get authenticated\nthrough our on premises active directory\n\n197\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.420\nor single sign on at that point.\n\n198\n00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.070\nOur federation services gonna issue\nus a token, which I can't say.\n\n199\n00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.200\nAnd then that's what we'll\npresent up to Office 365.\n\n200\n00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.450\nSo it's actually available for us there.\n\n201\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.650\nClaims, not so worried about.\n\n202\n00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:54.030\nThis is the key one right here\nwhich is under device registration.\n\n203\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.644\nNow I wanted to point this one out to you,\nokay, right here,\n\n204\n00:11:58.644 --> 00:12:03.713\nbecause when you go through\nthe installation it's gonna ask you,\n\n205\n00:12:03.713 --> 00:12:09.434\nare you setting this up already,\nokay, for connecting to Office 365.\n\n206\n00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:14.121\nNow when you do this, notice it says\nthat the Active Directory force is not\n\n207\n00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:18.570\nconfigured for\ndevice registration with this ADFS Farm.\n\n208\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.730\nYou must provide an account with\nan Enterprise Administrator.\n\n209\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.220\nSo there's a particular requirement,\n\n210\n00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.420\nthose rights to configure\nActive Directory for device registration.\n\n211\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.660\nSo that's gonna be key for\n\n212\n00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.890\nany device that's gonna connect here,\nto make sure that that works.\n\n213\n00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.650\nNotice the link here,\nthat says Configure device registration.\n\n214\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.000\nIf I select that link,\nhere is where you want to get to.\n\n215\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.540\nSo you're not gonna manually\nset this up on your own,\n\n216\n00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.830\nwhich is actually good,\nbecause at one point you would've.\n\n217\n00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:59.500\nIf your company's using Office365,\nAzure AD, or other online services cancel.\n\n218\n00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:06.370\nAnd then use the Azure AD Connect to\nconfigure Azure device registration.\n\n219\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.530\nYou select OK, it's gonna be configured\nfor on-premises registration.\n\n220\n00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:15.880\nSo at that point,\nI'm just gonna cancel here.\n\n221\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.100\nYeah, click Cancel because\nthat's what I want to do.\n\n222\n00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.430\nSo that's pretty much all we\nhave to do for this side, okay.\n\n223\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.990\nOnce everything is actually\ndone on this end over here,\n\n224\n00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:33.450\nokay, then we can walk through\nthe other portion of it\n\n225\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.438\nwhich is going through the AD Connect\ntool to make this work.\n\n226\n00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:40.830\nNow, you wanna verify that\neverything is actually set up and\n\n227\n00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.050\nready to go right here from this point.\n\n228\n00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:51.560\nSo if I go back over to this machine, the\nDCO1, and see if I can bring up a browser.\n\n229\n00:13:57.163 --> 00:14:03.020\nAnd, bring up over here.\n\n230\n00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.710\nThis is what should show up, okay?\n\n231\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.956\nSomething similar to your particular, so\n\n232\n00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:13.270\nit should tell you itprotvdemo,\nyou're not signed in, sign in to the site.\n\n233\n00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.375\n&gt;&gt; This would be the first time maybe\nI got a new laptop or something.\n\n234\n00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:17.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And like the first time trying to\n\n235\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.390\naccess my Office 365\n&gt;&gt; So actually, we're not even doing that.\n\n236\n00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.300\nWere just verifying that\nthe federation server is working.\n\n237\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:26.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n238\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.690\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's all we're doing at this point.\n\n239\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.070\nIs that it should actually work,\n\n240\n00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.340\nbecause we haven't set up\nthe connection to do anything yet.\n\n241\n00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.860\nSo we don't have anything registered but\n\n242\n00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.070\nI just wanna verify that it\nis working initially here.\n\n243\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.640\nIf I do not get this, okay, then,\nthat means something else is happening.\n\n244\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.340\nWhich is something that\nyou've got to worry about.\n\n245\n00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.970\nNormally, if you're running Server 2008,\nwhich I hope you are.\n\n246\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.530\nBut if you are, you are.\n\n247\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.950\nIf you're running Server 2012,\n2012 R2, 2008 R2.\n\n248\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.400\nThis is what you should\nend up seeing by default.\n\n249\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.510\nIt is on, it is ready to go.\n\n250\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.290\nThis is absolutely,\n100% what you should end up seeing.\n\n251\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.260\nIn Server 2016 it is off by default.\n\n252\n00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.270\nSo even if you type in this particular\nline of information right here.\n\n253\n00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.520\nLet me kind of give you an example.\n\n254\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.590\nLet me zoom in on that so\nthat you can see this.\n\n255\n00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.090\nOkay.\n\n256\n00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:28.150\nAnd this will also be in the show notes so\nthat you can see a little bit better.\n\n257\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.620\nThis is where it gets tricky.\n\n258\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.200\nI actually make sure that I.\n\n259\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.210\nWell now that I say this of\ncourse I can't, okay there it is.\n\n260\n00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.616\nNotice where it says, let me see if I'm\ntelling you right here, where is my-\n\n261\n00:15:41.616 --> 00:15:44.456\n&gt;&gt; Enable Id?\n\n262\n00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:48.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nit's these letters right here, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.240\nSo notice how it says this I.\n\n264\n00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.027\nIs that first one actually an Id,\nor is it an l, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:57.027 --> 00:16:00.590\nSo I got a little bit confused\nthe first time I tried to type it in.\n\n266\n00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.407\nIs that an ls or is it an Is there, okay?\n\n267\n00:16:04.407 --> 00:16:07.116\nSo I've got this inside of our show notes,\nif not,\n\n268\n00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:10.401\nI'll kind of make sure I put it in there,\nI thought I did here.\n\n269\n00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:15.277\nEnable idp, so this is actually\nsupposed to be an Idp here,\n\n270\n00:16:15.277 --> 00:16:17.800\nand of course Initiated.\n\n271\n00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.029\nSo the spelling,\nI wish I could change the font there, but\n\n272\n00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:22.806\nI'm not gonna worry about it right now,\nbut I'm leaving that up there so\n\n273\n00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:24.620\nthat you can get a screenshot of this.\n\n274\n00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.735\nYou just change this with\nyour domain name, right here.\n\n275\n00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:30.220\nThe rest of it should be the same.\n\n276\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:35.030\nIf you type that in and you get where it\ntells you, hey something isn't set up,\n\n277\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.980\nyou're getting an error from this, and\nthen it says you need to contact your\n\n278\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.000\nadministrator, check and\nverify if you're on Server 2016, okay?\n\n279\n00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:47.300\nIf you're on Server 2016, you need\n\n280\n00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:52.210\nto go back to your federation server,\nbring up your.\n\n281\n00:16:59.464 --> 00:17:03.307\nPowerShell, and let me see if I can\nmake that a little bit bigger, okay?\n\n282\n00:17:03.307 --> 00:17:06.078\nAnd here is the command\nthat you want to run, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:14.432\nGet-AdfsProperties, I’m gonna pipe\nthat into this select-object,\n\n284\n00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:19.430\nwhich is enableidpinitiatedsignonpage.\n\n285\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.655\nNotice it actually says,\n\n286\n00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:24.150\nEnableIDPInitiatedSignonPage as\nbeing True.\n\n287\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.689\nIt's default is False, okay?\n\n288\n00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:30.081\nSo in 2016,\nthat is what it's default actually is.\n\n289\n00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:33.150\n&gt;&gt; I have a feeling you're\ngoing to show us a cmdlet\n\n290\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.950\nto help us change that order the case,\nright, Ryan.\n\n291\n00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so this is actually easy\nenough for us to be able to do here.\n\n292\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.480\nSo let me see.\n\n293\n00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.121\nHold on, let me zoom out for a moment.\n\n294\n00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:49.750\nLet me change the font size cuz that's\ngetting a little bit annoying on me.\n\n295\n00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.622\nSo that that way I don't have to keep\nzooming in and out and causing people\n\n296\n00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:56.239\nheartache as they're trying to read my-\n&gt;&gt; Seasickness.\n\n297\n00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:58.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Motion sickness.\n\n298\n00:17:58.298 --> 00:17:59.207\n&gt;&gt; Screen, yeah motion sickness.\n\n299\n00:17:59.207 --> 00:17:59.792\n&gt;&gt; Screen sickness.\n\n300\n00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:04.309\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if we needed to set that\n\n301\n00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:10.399\nbecause it normally is False,\nwe would a set-adfsproperties.\n\n302\n00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:13.396\nThen do a -enable.\n\n303\n00:18:16.453 --> 00:18:16.963\nId.\n\n304\n00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:26.650\nPinitiatedsignonPage and\nthen we would do a $true, okay?\n\n305\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.350\nSo that is what you would\nactually set to turn it on.\n\n306\n00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.510\nThis is only if you're in 2016.\n\n307\n00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.786\nAll the other ones,\nby default, are actually on.\n\n308\n00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:38.543\nBut this is a command you can even\nrun in Server 2008, Server 2012, and\n\n309\n00:18:38.543 --> 00:18:40.940\nit'll let you know if\nyou're not getting that.\n\n310\n00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.172\nBut if you come up with\nan error right away,\n\n311\n00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:46.334\nit's more than likely you're\nrunning Server 2016, so\n\n312\n00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.873\nI just want to make sure that you\nended up seeing that as well, okay?\n\n313\n00:18:49.873 --> 00:18:55.830\nSo once that's on, that is when you\nshould end up with, well, this, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.971\nSo at the end here, if I select Sign in,\nthen it's gonna ask me for\n\n315\n00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.219\ncredentials, and we're ready to go, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:01.219 --> 00:19:05.818\nNow I'm not connecting anything,\nso it doesn't really make sense.\n\n317\n00:19:05.818 --> 00:19:09.913\nI could try and\ntype in something here ITProTVDemo and\n\n318\n00:19:09.913 --> 00:19:13.553\nwe'll do Don here cuz I\nremember his password.\n\n319\n00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:15.505\nAnd now it's going to say hey,\nare you sure?\n\n320\n00:19:15.505 --> 00:19:17.710\nSure let's do that again.\n\n321\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.533\nAnd it's not connecting here because,\n\n322\n00:19:19.533 --> 00:19:23.180\nwell, I haven't actually directed\nit anywhere to connect to.\n\n323\n00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:29.250\nSo it's fine because nothing is actually\ndoing that cuz I wasn't expecting it to.\n\n324\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.889\nBut this is one way that we can\ntest out and verify whether or\n\n325\n00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:35.941\nnot this is set up correctly\nup until this point.\n\n326\n00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:41.436\nSo this is where those other shows inside\nof our course library with Server 2012,\n\n327\n00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:45.787\n2016, are really gonna be helpful\nin getting everything set up\n\n328\n00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:47.948\ncorrectly to that point, okay?\n\n329\n00:19:47.948 --> 00:19:52.463\nNow, once that's done, okay,\nbecause I was giving that\n\n330\n00:19:52.463 --> 00:19:57.439\ndirection to where I need to go\nback into my Azure AD Connect one,\n\n331\n00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:01.790\nswitching back over to where\nthat server is going to be.\n\n332\n00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.070\nAnd now it's gonna stop\nthe synchronization and\n\n333\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.150\nsuspended it a little bit.\n\n334\n00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.984\nIt's right here under Additional tasks,\nright,\n\n335\n00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:17.679\nthat you're gonna see these different\noptions that are available.\n\n336\n00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:21.450\nAnd notice that we've got a couple of\noptions that we are gonna need to change.\n\n337\n00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.794\nOne, of course,\nwould be the change to sign-in and\n\n338\n00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:27.890\nalso to update the AD FS certificate.\n\n339\n00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.340\nSo if I select Change user sign-in.\n\n340\n00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:36.260\nAnd now I do the.\n\n341\n00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:46.550\nPassword here, at least I hope\nI'm doing the right password.\n\n342\n00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:56.785\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty long there, Ronnie.\n\n343\n00:20:56.785 --> 00:20:58.910\n&gt;&gt; It is quite the long password.\n\n344\n00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:05.246\nI didn't want one of those amazing people\nthat could actually listen to the clicks\n\n345\n00:21:05.246 --> 00:21:06.655\nand try and figure it out.\n\n346\n00:21:06.655 --> 00:21:07.800\nSo, there we go.\n&gt;&gt; The keyboard whisperer.\n\n347\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the keyboard whisperer.\n\n348\n00:21:08.814 --> 00:21:13.103\nLet me zoom in on that and I can hear\nthe clicks that Ronnie is doing, and\n\n349\n00:21:13.103 --> 00:21:16.250\nthat will give me the combination here.\n\n350\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.530\nSo notice, there it is, there's the\ndifferent methodologies that we previously\n\n351\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.235\ntalked about, and\nwe've talked about all of them.\n\n352\n00:21:21.235 --> 00:21:24.550\nI selected the Do not configure because\nI knew we were going to be back here.\n\n353\n00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.037\nSo at this point I can select\nFederation with AD FS.\n\n354\n00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:32.457\nAnd if I wanted to do, no, it's not\nletting me do that for right now, so\n\n355\n00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:33.200\nthat's fine.\n\n356\n00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.572\nSo now it says we'll install the following\nor use an existing AD FS form.\n\n357\n00:21:39.572 --> 00:21:41.760\nLet me see if I can get\nthat above my head.\n\n358\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.900\nYou must have the following.\n\n359\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.360\nSo here it's actually saying,\nhey, here is what you have to do.\n\n360\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.120\nIf you do not already have this SN, let's\ngo ahead and get that installed here and\n\n361\n00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.360\nit'll walk you through the process.\n\n362\n00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.850\nBut I wanted to show you manually\nhow you could do it as well.\n\n363\n00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.370\nAt this point, I'm gonna click Next,\nand now it's gonna ask for\n\n364\n00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.659\nthe credentials here.\n\n365\n00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:04.140\nAnd notice Domain Administrator\ncredentials.\n\n366\n00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:10.451\nOnce again, I think Cherokee is actually\n\n367\n00:22:10.451 --> 00:22:15.510\na Domain Administrator as well.\n\n368\n00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.311\nI did it wrong that time, oops.\n\n369\n00:22:17.493 --> 00:22:22.518\nIt says hey Ronnie,\n\n370\n00:22:22.518 --> 00:22:27.543\nyou did not do this in\n\n371\n00:22:27.543 --> 00:22:32.305\nthe right format.\n\n372\n00:22:32.305 --> 00:22:37.443\nITPROTVDEMO\\, I think this one is\n\n373\n00:22:37.443 --> 00:22:43.960\nactually Cherokee if I remember correctly.\n\n374\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.618\nThere we go, see?\n\n375\n00:22:44.618 --> 00:22:48.930\nSo now, it's saying hey, which of the\nfollowing are we actually going to use?\n\n376\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.838\nSo if I select Use an existing\nserver farm or create a new one,\n\n377\n00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:58.141\nwell I've already gone ahead and now I'm\nusing an existing server farm instead.\n\n378\n00:22:58.141 --> 00:23:03.440\nFrom this point, we are simply following\nthis, and now it's asking me for the name.\n\n379\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.111\nSo the primary server farm,\nI can click on browse and do FS01.\n\n380\n00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.814\nAnd notice it found it so\nit looks like DNS is set up okay.\n\n381\n00:23:16.814 --> 00:23:19.370\nClick OK and click Next.\n\n382\n00:23:22.396 --> 00:23:26.128\nAnd now its actually waiting to validate\nand see what else is happening here.\n\n383\n00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:32.179\nGonna say hey, what is the domain,\nthe Azure AD Domain?\n\n384\n00:23:32.179 --> 00:23:34.325\nDid I not select a valid one?\n\n385\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.581\n&gt;&gt; We cannot federate\nAzure AD while signed on\n\n386\n00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:45.870\nto Azure AD has a user\nwith the same domain.\n\n387\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.310\nPlease choose a different domain to\nfederate or restart this wizard and\n\n388\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:54.450\nprovide a different Azure global\nadministrator credentials, all right.\n\n389\n00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.205\nSo that actually means that I\nneed to kind of log off and\n\n390\n00:23:58.205 --> 00:24:01.878\nlog back in with the global\nadministrator account,\n\n391\n00:24:01.878 --> 00:24:06.732\nwhich It's strange, since I thought\nI did log in with that instead.\n\n392\n00:24:06.732 --> 00:24:09.740\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, it looks like Greg mentions\nin the chat that we should try to log in\n\n393\n00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.760\nwith our tenant account here, so\nI don't know if we remembered that.\n\n394\n00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.660\n&gt;&gt; Cherokee, that's a really good thought,\nto actually go back and sign in as\n\n395\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.960\na global administrator instead cuz it's\nnot actually letting me use your account.\n\n396\n00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.190\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n397\n00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.370\nSo here it is on my machine.\n\n398\n00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.250\nI went ahead and\n\n399\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.060\ntyped in the global administrator\naccount along with the password itself.\n\n400\n00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:33.957\nSo once we've got that,\nI'm gonna click on Next and\n\n401\n00:24:33.957 --> 00:24:38.487\nlet it actually connect and\nsee what ends up happening here.\n\n402\n00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:43.293\nSo this is where we get to at this point,\nand you see where it's already selected\n\n403\n00:24:43.293 --> 00:24:47.961\nthe federation services because we had\ngotten there to that particular point\n\n404\n00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:52.760\npreviously when we had actually typed\nin using Cherokee's account instead.\n\n405\n00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.834\nNow there is an issue that I am seeing\nwhich is unusual because even though\n\n406\n00:24:57.834 --> 00:25:02.424\nwe got to that point where we were\nable to go a little bit beyond us.\n\n407\n00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:04.990\nWe did not configure or setup anything.\n\n408\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.520\nAnd Cherokee, right here at\nthe bottom of the screen, okay?\n\n409\n00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.890\nIt says the selected user sign in\noption is already configured and\n\n410\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.370\nif I take a look at that\nover here on the left or\n\n411\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:21.410\nthe lower right hand side, notice it\ndoesn't give me the ability to proceed on.\n\n412\n00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.540\nWell, we really haven't configured\nanything and here it is,\n\n413\n00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.210\nit's telling me it's already configured.\n\n414\n00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.469\nSo that is an issue that we need\nto be able to deal with here and\n\n415\n00:25:31.469 --> 00:25:35.562\nthis is actually a repeatable\nglitch that does happen and\n\n416\n00:25:35.562 --> 00:25:40.355\nwe can actually verify that this\ndoes happen and it's a weird one.\n\n417\n00:25:40.355 --> 00:25:45.761\nIf this happens the best thing for\nyou to do is simply close out of\n\n418\n00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:51.780\nthe Azure Active Directory connect tool,\nand then launch it back up.\n\n419\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.650\nAnd that will clear out\nwhatever's been cached there.\n\n420\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.180\nBut let me show you how this\nactually can work as well, okay?\n\n421\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.540\nSo here under user sign-in,\nif I simply select let's say,\n\n422\n00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.430\nanother option, and that way,\nit's actually good because it gives me\n\n423\n00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.250\na time to kind of go back through and\nmaybe see some of these other options.\n\n424\n00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.222\nCuz I'm not going to do anything else\nthat's actually going to change this, but\n\n425\n00:26:11.222 --> 00:26:13.310\nI just want to select another option.\n\n426\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:18.140\nThen I can click back on\nthe federation with AD.\n\n427\n00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.630\nAnd now it still says look,\nit's already configured, but\n\n428\n00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:27.960\nnotice now that this is\nallowing me to hover over this.\n\n429\n00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.640\nSo look at that.\n\n430\n00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.920\nNow it actually is not grayed out anymore.\n\n431\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.310\nIf I click on that,\nnotice that it doesn't select it, though.\n\n432\n00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.540\nSo it's not selecting it, but simply\nclicking on it now allows me to go back\n\n433\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.030\nthrough the same options\nthat I had before.\n\n434\n00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.150\nWhere this is exactly\nwhat we are looking for.\n\n435\n00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:45.300\nAnd it's saying hey,\n\n436\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.950\nare you sure, if you don't have\nthe federation server farm set up?\n\n437\n00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.970\nLet's go ahead and do that.\n\n438\n00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.850\nAnd it will begin installing the role for\nyou and\n\n439\n00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.930\nmaking sure that everything\nis actually gone.\n\n440\n00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.140\nAnd I told you if you're doing this\nmake sure it's 2012 R2 or later for\n\n441\n00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.080\nthe server itself.\n\n442\n00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.180\nAnd then if you're gonna set up\nthat web application proxy server,\n\n443\n00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.810\nfor those outside of your own network,\nit's gonna do that as well.\n\n444\n00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.710\nAnd then of course making\nsure that the SSL certificate\n\n445\n00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.502\nis actually gonna be aptly named\nnow the way that we want to, too.\n\n446\n00:27:13.502 --> 00:27:15.920\nOkay, but even more importantly,\n\n447\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.980\nI know it's kinda weird, the green button\nis actually what we're looking for.\n\n448\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.290\nWhich is Next.\n\n449\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.527\nSo at this point then I can come back in.\n\n450\n00:27:24.527 --> 00:27:30.036\nAnd now I have to follow\nthat actual name here,\n\n451\n00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:33.849\nthe format, IT Pro TV demo, and\n\n452\n00:27:33.849 --> 00:27:37.816\nthis time I can type in Cherokee.\n\n453\n00:27:37.816 --> 00:27:42.702\nAnd now using hopefully that\nsuper secret long password that\n\n454\n00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:45.301\nI'm not trying to mess up here.\n\n455\n00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:50.390\nAnd let's see what happens, okay.\n\n456\n00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.850\nSo here it is.\n\n457\n00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.330\nOops, my mouse has just locked up for\na brief second, okay?\n\n458\n00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.000\nSo at this point notice it is carrying\nfurther than what we actually went before.\n\n459\n00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.180\nSo am I configuring\na new AD FS server form?\n\n460\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.790\nOr am I using an existing one?\n\n461\n00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.800\nWell I'd gotten to that point where\nwe already showed you how to get\n\n462\n00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.744\nto installing the AD FS server.\n\n463\n00:28:11.744 --> 00:28:15.060\nSo I'm gonna select\nthe second option instead.\n\n464\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.269\nIf I hadn't set up any of this,\nI would select the first option,\n\n465\n00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:21.432\nallow it to actually run through\neverything that we need to do.\n\n466\n00:28:21.432 --> 00:28:23.221\nIf this is your first time doing it,\n\n467\n00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.700\nI would recommend that you probably\nfollow its directions instead.\n\n468\n00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.031\nCuz this is actually how Office 365\nwill integrate right in to getting\n\n469\n00:28:31.031 --> 00:28:36.300\neverything working as well as of course\nyour on-premises active directory.\n\n470\n00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.260\nOn the server name I'm gonna click Browse.\n\n471\n00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:45.196\nAnd then from here if I do 0365fs01.\n\n472\n00:28:45.196 --> 00:28:49.447\nAnd there it is,\nI have now found my server, sure.\n\n473\n00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:57.050\nSo I'm gonna select that server,\nclick OK, and then select Next here.\n\n474\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.030\nSo this will now begin to validate\nthe actual existing server farm that\n\n475\n00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.670\nis available and will tell us whether or\nnot everything is ready to go.\n\n476\n00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:06.470\nSo, it's going to say,\n\n477\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:10.190\nwhich of the following are you\nactually better federating here?\n\n478\n00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.592\nI'm going to select my own IT Pro TV\ndemo.com, and notice that it gives me\n\n479\n00:29:14.592 --> 00:29:19.355\na nice little warning at the bottom here,\nor what looks like a warning, right?\n\n480\n00:29:19.355 --> 00:29:26.040\nITProTVDemo.com is a managed domain,\nwill be converted to a federated domain.\n\n481\n00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.152\nThat is Is actually what you want\nto see here, you could do that.\n\n482\n00:29:28.152 --> 00:29:31.305\n&gt;&gt; It is so small for such a big,\nyou know, shift there.\n\n483\n00:29:31.305 --> 00:29:33.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit really is handling a lot, right.\n\n484\n00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.190\nSo essentially all the authentication\n\n485\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.970\nis going to go through\nthe federated server at this point.\n\n486\n00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:45.240\nAnd then your active directory domain,\nis just saying sure, let them in.\n\n487\n00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.520\nAnd from that point the way\nthe you will let them in is,\n\n488\n00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.470\nwhen I tell you to do this, give them\nthat service token that they need and\n\n489\n00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.560\nthen they can go, and\ndo what they want to.\n\n490\n00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.850\nSo it is kinda neat.\n\n491\n00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.470\nIt is a big change in the way\nthat things are handled.\n\n492\n00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.341\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little, tiny notification.\n\n493\n00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:03.248\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, a little tiny notification here.\n\n494\n00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:06.447\nUser logins will be disrupted\nduring this operation.\n\n495\n00:30:06.447 --> 00:30:08.280\nKey point, right.\n\n496\n00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.390\nIf you're gonna be doing this,\nprobably during the middle of the day,\n\n497\n00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.370\nthe business day,\nnot a good time to do it, okay?\n\n498\n00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:19.270\nSo, not saying you can't, but just realize\nthat during this particular point in time,\n\n499\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.440\nthey are going to be disrupted.\n\n500\n00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.340\nProbably be better to have\nthis done after hours, okay?\n\n501\n00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.220\n&gt;&gt; Just thinking about the logic of that,\nwhat are we looking at maybe for\n\n502\n00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:28.750\na time window?\n\n503\n00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.010\nOr what is that reliant upon?\n\n504\n00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that is reliant upon\nyour business day, right?\n\n505\n00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.910\nYour particular time in which\nthe business traffic is gonna be heaviest\n\n506\n00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.210\nis probably not the best\ntime of day to set this up.\n\n507\n00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.385\n&gt;&gt; For the synchronization?\n\n508\n00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:42.040\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not for\nthe synchronization, right?\n\n509\n00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.729\nIf users are not gonna be able to log on\nduring the middle of the business day,\n\n510\n00:30:45.729 --> 00:30:49.550\nthat's actually pretty hefty where they\ncan't get access to any resources.\n\n511\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:51.900\n&gt;&gt; So it's more than just\na fleeting moment, here.\n\n512\n00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.470\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; It's something you want to prepare for.\n\n513\n00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.800\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, because remember that\nthe number of users you have will also\n\n514\n00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.950\ndepend, right?\n\n515\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.805\nIf you have 50,000 users and\nthere's a possibility of 15,000 to 20,000\n\n516\n00:31:01.805 --> 00:31:05.670\nusers logging in at any point in time,\nyou're saying disrupt 15 to 20,000 users?\n\n517\n00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's what I was wondering.\n\n518\n00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.590\n&gt;&gt; That's why you got to be careful and so\n\n519\n00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:13.270\nyou, depending on where you\nare in the world here, you're\n\n520\n00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.722\ngonna actually pick whatever your busiest\ntime of the day is and not do this.\n\n521\n00:31:16.722 --> 00:31:17.791\n&gt;&gt; Avoid it [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; And not do this,\n\n522\n00:31:17.791 --> 00:31:19.410\nis what you're gonna do.\n\n523\n00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:20.110\nYou're gonna try and\n\n524\n00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:24.880\nmake sure that this is done during a time\nof a day when it's less busy, okay.\n\n525\n00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.260\nNow if you can't, you of course then send\nout an email and say, hey, it's gonna be\n\n526\n00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.980\ndisrupted for whatever amount of time\nyou guess it's gonna be disrupted for.\n\n527\n00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.000\nSo the only way for\nyou to verify that, right,\n\n528\n00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.170\nis to tell them that between\nthis particular time and\n\n529\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:42.240\nthis time that you get, expect\npossible disruptions to your log on.\n\n530\n00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.510\nSo you tell them either go ahead and\nlogin, and stay logged in, but\n\n531\n00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.220\ndon't log out again.\n\n532\n00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.310\nAnd that will cache their session for\nthem, which will help them out.\n\n533\n00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.040\nBut do not expect to log out and\nlog back in, and\n\n534\n00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.640\ndo all that other stuff as well, okay?\n\n535\n00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.165\nSo this is actually something that we\nwant to make sure that we understand.\n\n536\n00:31:58.165 --> 00:31:59.500\nGonna click next.\n\n537\n00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.171\nAnd now it will continue to check and\n\n538\n00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:07.344\nverify if the proper components have\nbeen installed and ready to go.\n\n539\n00:32:07.344 --> 00:32:10.730\nSo once we get that,\nit is now ready to configure, and\n\n540\n00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.760\nit's gonna configure\nthat source attribute.\n\n541\n00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.190\nSo just like we did at the very beginning\nwhen we first run the Azure AD Connect\n\n542\n00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.850\ntool, it's gonna look for\nthat source anchor attribute,\n\n543\n00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:26.890\nthat essentially ties everything together\nto that one tenant, is what it does.\n\n544\n00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.710\nConfigure existing federation service, and\n\n545\n00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:35.720\nthere's the name that I tied the\ncertificate to, which is adfsitprotvdemo,\n\n546\n00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.830\nand then configured the Azure trust for\nitprotvdemo as well, and\n\n547\n00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.000\nthen am I ready to start the\nsynchronization process when it completes?\n\n548\n00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.330\nSo this is not really a lot\ndifferent than what we saw,\n\n549\n00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.990\njust some different attributes here\nthat have actually been added in.\n\n550\n00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.967\nSo this is now going to change in\nthe end after I select configure,\n\n551\n00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:58.316\nand now it's gonna create the federation,\n\n552\n00:32:58.316 --> 00:33:02.570\nand the trust, and\neverything else that needs to go on,\n\n553\n00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.853\nand this may take a bit of time\nto actually finish and do.\n\n554\n00:33:06.853 --> 00:33:09.596\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, you had already set\nup a few things ahead of time.\n\n555\n00:33:09.596 --> 00:33:13.002\nNot that you would have shown on the show,\nbecause like we'd spoken about before,\n\n556\n00:33:13.002 --> 00:33:14.764\neach environment's gonna be different.\n\n557\n00:33:14.764 --> 00:33:18.140\nSo that's really where,\nif you haven't seen the previous show,\n\n558\n00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.001\nwhere we were talking about those\nprerequisites then definitely go back and\n\n559\n00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:25.979\ncheck that out, because you pointed out\nsome really good things that we need to\n\n560\n00:33:25.979 --> 00:33:27.930\nknow before we get to this step.\n\n561\n00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.660\n&gt;&gt; Right, and that's why it's important\nthat we understand at least the setup of\n\n562\n00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.440\nthat federation service, and make sure\nthat we get to understand that as well.\n\n563\n00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.570\nNow, here it is and it actually says,\nhey verify the federation configuration.\n\n564\n00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.527\nFederation service configuration\nsucceeded, ready to verify.\n\n565\n00:33:42.527 --> 00:33:46.260\nYou must configure DNS resolution for\nthis service.\n\n566\n00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.810\nI have configured DNS records that allow\nclients to resolve my federation service\n\n567\n00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.540\nfrom both intranet and extranet.\n\n568\n00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.860\nSo this is assuming that you\nare actually gonna allow for\n\n569\n00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.810\nthe connection from both outside\nworld as well as inside world.\n\n570\n00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:04.254\nThe extranet is actually just between you\nand whatever partner organization that you\n\n571\n00:34:04.254 --> 00:34:08.337\nmay actually allow to come in and do this,\nand of course, from inside as well.\n\n572\n00:34:08.337 --> 00:34:11.383\nSo if you've actually configured that,\nyou put a check there, and\n\n573\n00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:12.660\nthen you tell it to verify.\n\n574\n00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:15.938\nNow, I don't know if I actually\nconfigured the outside yet.\n\n575\n00:34:15.938 --> 00:34:18.940\nSo we'll see what's happened on this one.\n\n576\n00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:24.228\nSo after your directory has\nfinished synchronizing to Azure,\n\n577\n00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:30.914\nlaunch the Azure AD Connect and verify\nthe Active Directory Federation Service\n\n578\n00:34:30.914 --> 00:34:34.920\nlogin to confirm that\nit's working properly.\n\n579\n00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.810\nSo that's what it's allowing us to do.\n\n580\n00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.520\nLet's select Verify, and\n\n581\n00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.210\nin a moment this is what we are hoping\nto see, which is right here.\n\n582\n00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.237\nInternet configuration was\nsuccessfully verified.\n\n583\n00:34:46.237 --> 00:34:49.560\nSo it found that name on my internal DNS.\n\n584\n00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.820\nThe extranet configuration was also\nverified, and this is actually\n\n585\n00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:01.910\nthe name server, public IP address\nof my DNS server out on hover.com.\n\n586\n00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.302\nSo everything was actually configured\nthe way that we needed to.\n\n587\n00:35:05.302 --> 00:35:08.799\nSo after you're directory has\nfinished synchronization,\n\n588\n00:35:08.799 --> 00:35:11.617\nlaunch the AD Connect,\nand verify the FS login.\n\n589\n00:35:11.617 --> 00:35:16.511\nSo, let's go ahead and click Exit, and\nthen it says to launch the AD Connect\n\n590\n00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:21.064\ntool again, And\n\n591\n00:35:21.064 --> 00:35:26.090\nthen select configure,\nand now it says to verify.\n\n592\n00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.537\nSo look at all these extra\noptions that have come in.\n\n593\n00:35:28.537 --> 00:35:31.610\nI can reset the Azure AD and the FS Trust.\n\n594\n00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.531\nI can add an additional\nAzure AD domain if I want to.\n\n595\n00:35:35.531 --> 00:35:39.173\nI can update a certificate, this is\nactually really good if my certificate is\n\n596\n00:35:39.173 --> 00:35:41.960\nat the end of it's lifecycle,\nI need to update it.\n\n597\n00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.430\nI need to be able to do that.\n\n598\n00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.576\nBut what it asks me to do is verify.\n\n599\n00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:50.389\nSo if I select the ADFS login, and\nclick Next here, Nnow it's gonna say,\n\n600\n00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:55.205\nhey enter in your Azure credentials and\nwe'll continue to use Cherokee,\n\n601\n00:35:55.205 --> 00:35:59.323\ncuz hers is the only one I actually\nremember what password, and\n\n602\n00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:04.317\nthere's actually only three that I've\nbeen using during this whole show.\n\n603\n00:36:04.317 --> 00:36:08.342\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee that's what's gonna happen\n\n604\n00:36:08.342 --> 00:36:08.990\nhere.\n\n605\n00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.920\nSo here it is once again.\n\n606\n00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.100\nAm I going to be able\n\n607\n00:36:22.855 --> 00:36:24.800\nTo type in this password.\n\n608\n00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.682\n&gt;&gt; You will get there.\n\n609\n00:36:28.682 --> 00:36:31.060\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if it actually connects and\nverifies here.\n\n610\n00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.720\nSo if it doesn't it will let me know.\n\n611\n00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.747\nBut if it does,\n\n612\n00:36:35.747 --> 00:36:40.498\nit did say, let's see, enter a federated\nuser account to log in here.\n\n613\n00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.960\nIt must be fully synchronized\nwith Azure Active Directory.\n\n614\n00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.540\nThis will validate\nthe federated user trust.\n\n615\n00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.040\nSo at this point let's pick Zach since we,\nactually I don't know Zach's password, so\n\n616\n00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.030\nI can't actually even\npick Zach's password.\n\n617\n00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.094\nSo once again,\nwe'll try this with Cherokee's account,\n\n618\n00:36:57.094 --> 00:36:58.710\nagain cuz that's the only one I know.\n\n619\n00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:03.630\nSo her account should actually\nbe synchronized up anyways.\n\n620\n00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.860\nLet's verify, and there we go.\n\n621\n00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:24.140\nSuccessfully logged on to Microsoft Online\nusing a security token from\n\n622\n00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:30.270\nthe Active Directory Federation Services\nprovided with the users credentials.\n\n623\n00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.980\nSo, this is actually a good\nresult that we were looking for\n\n624\n00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.340\nin the setup of our Federation Services,\n\n625\n00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:41.790\nto tie into single sign-on at this\nparticular point in time, and Cherokee,\n\n626\n00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:44.840\nthat's what we needed to do, is to make\nsure that we can get this up and running.\n\n627\n00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.418\nNow, even though all this is\nreally all we needed to do, right,\n\n628\n00:37:49.418 --> 00:37:52.982\nit doesn't mean that we're\ncompletely done with everything.\n\n629\n00:37:52.982 --> 00:37:57.791\nWe still need to talk about the web access\nproxy, which we'll do in a later show,\n\n630\n00:37:57.791 --> 00:38:00.692\nbut overall though this is\nwhat we were hoping for\n\n631\n00:38:00.692 --> 00:38:05.359\nat the very end is to be able to verify\nthat everything did end up working for us,\n\n632\n00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:07.974\nmake sure you go back and\nyou take a look, and\n\n633\n00:38:07.974 --> 00:38:12.870\nthis is one of those times where I\nhave to rely on the mastery of others.\n\n634\n00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.930\nWhen we start talking about how\nthe federation services work,\n\n635\n00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:19.810\nif there's details that I ended up\nskipping over at times, you wanna make\n\n636\n00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.930\nsure that you check out those other shows\nthat will allow you to get all that set up\n\n637\n00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:29.060\ncorrectly the way that it needs to be,\nto work in what we need to be able to do.\n\n638\n00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:33.280\nBut, Cherokee, at this point, this means\nthat we have successfully set it up for\n\n639\n00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.442\nsingle sign-on, and\n\n640\n00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:38.626\nthat means we're ready to proceed on to\nother things that we need to learn about.\n\n641\n00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:39.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's great.\n\n642\n00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.332\nThank you for that knowledge here today,\nRonnie, and thank you for\n\n643\n00:38:42.332 --> 00:38:45.277\njoining us as well, but you don't want\nto miss what we have headed your way.\n\n644\n00:38:45.277 --> 00:38:47.440\nBut for this show we'll go ahead and\nsign out.\n\n645\n00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.832\nI've been your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n646\n00:38:48.832 --> 00:38:49.730\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n647\n00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.355\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n648\n00:38:54.355 --> 00:38:58.410\n[MUSIC]\n\n649\n00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.460\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPro.TV.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.652\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:16.620\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.030\nI'm your host, Zach Memos and this is\nOffice 365 and in this episode we're gonna\n\n6\n00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.120\ninstall web access proxy with the one and\nonly Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.360\nRonnie, great to have you here.\n\n8\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.136\nThanks so much.\n\n9\n00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:28.266\nEnlighten us!\n\n10\n00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.010\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, thank you for being here and\n\n11\n00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.910\nthank you for having me back on the show\nas we continue now to install kind of\n\n12\n00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.500\nthe second part of getting our\nActive Directory Federation Services for\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.200\nsingle sign on and established right?\n\n14\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.120\nSo in a previous episode, we set up the\nActive Directory Federation Services and\n\n15\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.720\nverified that it was working properly\nthrough that Azure AD Connect tool and\n\n16\n00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.670\nthat way we kind of knew\neverything was set up.\n\n17\n00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.390\nThat even though that federation service\nis now set up and what we actually need to\n\n18\n00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.830\ndo, okay is we need to begin to prepare\nfor what people connecting and using it.\n\n19\n00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.770\nNow, let me go back to my diagram here for\njust a moment.\n\n20\n00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280\nAnd that way we will do\na little bit of reminder and\n\n21\n00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.270\na little bit of breather here for\nwhat we're actually trying to do, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.760\nSo at this particular point and\ntime, this is established.\n\n23\n00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.450\nI know it seems like a lot of you haven't\nbeen watching the previous episodes here,\n\n24\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.880\ndon't worry about what's behind my head\nright now, but as you're actually taking\n\n25\n00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.570\na look at it, let me see if I\ncan click on it, there we go.\n\n26\n00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.640\nThat will make it easier and\nnot get that thing out there, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.020\nSo the Active Directory Federation\nServices right here in the center,\n\n28\n00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.710\nthat's actually established for us.\n\n29\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.441\nWe can run through that\nAzure AD Connect tool and\n\n30\n00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:50.677\nit now is simulating us as a client\nhere within the ITProTV domain.\n\n31\n00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:55.252\nWhen I present credentials over to\nOffice 365, it says hey I'm gonna\n\n32\n00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:59.752\nredirect you over here to the Active\nDirectory Federation Services for\n\n33\n00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.252\nyour authentication.\n\n34\n00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:06.098\nAnd it is the Active Directory Federation\nServices that will essentially relay\n\n35\n00:02:06.098 --> 00:02:11.158\nthat at this point, right, over to where\nour on-premises Active Directory is and\n\n36\n00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:15.320\nwhere we're normally running\nour Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n37\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.630\nThen it is there,\nthat will validate my credentials.\n\n38\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.950\nOnce the credentials are validated,\ntwo things will happen.\n\n39\n00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.860\nIt will of course validate those\ncredentials, and it will send back a token\n\n40\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.190\nis what it will do, so\nthe authentication will say hey look.\n\n41\n00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.360\nThis guy's good.\n\n42\n00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.540\nNow we need to actually\nget an authorization token\n\n43\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.660\nto get access to Office 365.\n\n44\n00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.781\nSo the authentication that is presented\nhere as it comes back to the user,\n\n45\n00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.756\neven though they're now authenticated,\n\n46\n00:02:45.756 --> 00:02:50.071\nwhat really gives them access\nto Office 365 is that token.\n\n47\n00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:54.687\nAnd so now, it actually does get\naccess in and they have that token and\n\n48\n00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:56.830\nwe are ready to go.\n\n49\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.030\nThe issue that we have though\nis that if we think about it,\n\n50\n00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.780\nthis works fine as long as\nyou're within the organization.\n\n51\n00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.270\nBut once we start to deal with the very\nfact that you're gonna have users not only\n\n52\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.060\nInside of the boundaries of your domain,\nyou may also have users that are outside.\n\n53\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.936\nTelecommuters right, the people that\nare logging in from the outside that still\n\n54\n00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:21.423\nneed access to Office 365.\n\n55\n00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:27.020\nWell now what happens is that it's\nthe same thing but it's from the outside.\n\n56\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.940\nThe problem right now If I get\nsomebody from the outside, so\n\n57\n00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.720\nlet me try to, of course I'm talking,\nlet me just select one.\n\n58\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.930\nSo let me do this here, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.620\nSo let me just kinda simulate, that from\nthe outside of the domain, if they wanted\n\n60\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.190\nto do the same thing, it's going to\nredirect them the same way, back to ADFS.\n\n61\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.200\nBut the problem is that now means\nI'm gonna have to get access\n\n62\n00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.500\ninside of my domain,\nwhich is already secure.\n\n63\n00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.710\nOutside access inbound is not something\nI really want to allow very easily,\n\n64\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.210\nand especially without any\nsecurity boundary that's there.\n\n65\n00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.400\nSo we want to actually switch\nthat up by providing another\n\n66\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.960\nserver that will sit at the edge of my\nnetwork is what it will actually do.\n\n67\n00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.070\nAnd when somebody on the outside\nnow tries to connect in,\n\n68\n00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.950\nit will hit what we call a web\naccess proxy instead and\n\n69\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.510\nas web access proxy that will proxy\nthat request internally for us.\n\n70\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.390\nSo that way we're not allowing for\nmultiple connections on the outside\n\n71\n00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.010\nthat we don't know where they\ncome from to all just hit\n\n72\n00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.850\nthe Active Directory Federation Services,\nit's gonna hit that web access proxy.\n\n73\n00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.170\nThe web access proxy will actually decide\nwhat gets kind of sent over and whether or\n\n74\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.530\nnot we'll get that access.\n\n75\n00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.330\n&gt;&gt; So once again, for\n\n76\n00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.710\npeople with limited mind like me,\nthis is sort of a limited access.\n\n77\n00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.300\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n78\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.690\n&gt;&gt; Is what the web access\nproxy is all about.\n\n79\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Right, it's about protecting\nour internal resources that we\n\n80\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.420\nneed to definitely protect,\nthat also gives, of course,\n\n81\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.500\nusers that are on the outside,\nthat need the same access and\n\n82\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.850\nthe same protections,\nto be able to do the same thing.\n\n83\n00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.860\nSo that's what we're actually\ngonna end up seeing, okay.\n\n84\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.410\nEventually this is what\nit's gonna take a look at,\n\n85\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.670\nokay, or look like in the end\nin terms of the topology.\n\n86\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n87\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.840\n&gt;&gt; So usually, for us, our proxy server,\nI've renamed ours as ADFS here, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.394\nSo what will actually kind of do that and\nthe reason why is that, from the outside,\n\n89\n00:05:26.394 --> 00:05:30.760\nI don't want them hitting\nsomething like FS02.itpro.tv.\n\n90\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.070\nI want them hitting a service that they're\ngonna actually kind of have a generic idea\n\n91\n00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.527\nabout from the outside, but\n\n92\n00:05:36.527 --> 00:05:40.200\nnot anything that seems to\nindicate an internal name at all.\n\n93\n00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.250\nSo normally, here's what we have.\n\n94\n00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.550\nOf course, out on the Internet,\nwe have Office 365 out here,\n\n95\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.080\nhere's my DNS registrar,\nthat's out there on the Internet as well.\n\n96\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.820\nI could have a partner\ncompany that's also out here.\n\n97\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.730\nLet's say that there's another public\nnetwork that I'm also a part of as well\n\n98\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.350\nand here's of course, my network.\n\n99\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.430\nAnd then, often its own central\nport on the firewall or\n\n100\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.350\ninside of some area here, we normally\ncall it a DMZ, a demilitarized zone.\n\n101\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.800\nAnd that's where we're gonna\nset up our particular proxy.\n\n102\n00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.790\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So that way when people connect in\n\n103\n00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.240\nfrom the outside or\nfrom the public network and\n\n104\n00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.400\nnow once we actually get that,\nthey hit this.\n\n105\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.259\nAnd this is what allows them access\ninside to be authenticated and\n\n106\n00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.723\nthen they get that secured token, okay.\n\n107\n00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:28.450\nSo that's really the kind of set up\nthat we're actually talking about at\n\n108\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.880\nthis point.\n\n109\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.490\nSo there's only a couple of other\nprerequisites and I made just a small and\n\n110\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.720\nshort list here.\n\n111\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.300\nI didn't wanna overwhelm us,\nbut let's take a look.\n\n112\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.300\nIt's not really in any one\nparticular order of importance,\n\n113\n00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.380\nbut all the user are actually\nimportant at some point.\n\n114\n00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.260\n&gt;&gt; And this important maybe to\nmemorize for the exam, right?\n\n115\n00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.670\n&gt;&gt; Well it's important at\nleast to get it working.\n\n116\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.940\nYeah, don't get me wrong.\n\n117\n00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.630\nIt can be exam basis where they talk\nabout what's missing here in this list.\n\n118\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.080\nBut probably on the Office365,\nif anything, right,\n\n119\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.840\nIt's gonna be do you understand the idea\nof what the ADFS server does for\n\n120\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.000\nus and why the web access proxy\nis important in what we're doing?\n\n121\n00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.600\nBut to get it operational, especially\nif you're doing a web access proxy,\n\n122\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.260\nwell one of those things that you might\nhave to get is a public IP address.\n\n123\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.263\nNow, this is an IP address\nthat is valid on the Internet.\n\n124\n00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:22.930\nSo it's not one that begins\nwith 192.168.whatever.\n\n125\n00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.242\nIt's usually not one that begins with\n172.16 all the way through 172.31,\n\n126\n00:07:28.242 --> 00:07:32.834\nanything like that, those are actually\nconsidered private IP addresses,\n\n127\n00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:35.660\nalong with the 10.whatever, okay?\n\n128\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.270\nThose all private, they're only meant for\ninside of your local area network,\n\n129\n00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.830\nnot out on the Internet.\n\n130\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.540\nSo anything besides that,\nokay, you can put out there.\n\n131\n00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.850\nSo what if you go, all right,\nso I'm gonna set this up.\n\n132\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.940\nWhere the heck do I get\na public IP address?\n\n133\n00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.594\nWell, it depends on where you are and\nwho you're working for, right.\n\n134\n00:07:52.594 --> 00:07:56.355\nSo if you're working for\na particular company, you say,\n\n135\n00:07:56.355 --> 00:07:58.751\nI'm gonna need a public IP address.\n\n136\n00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:01.590\nAnd whoever is in charge\nwith that should be able to\n\n137\n00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.940\nassigned you a public IP\naddress to be able to use.\n\n138\n00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.480\nNow if networking is not your strong suit,\n\n139\n00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.250\nthis particular exam is not focus in on\nyour networking skills but at the same\n\n140\n00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.630\ntime understanding at least the basics\nof networking that's gonna help.\n\n141\n00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.320\nSo get your public IP address, make sure\nyou also get your subnet mask along with\n\n142\n00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.640\nthat so that you know what you'll have\nto configure on that particular server.\n\n143\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.490\nSo you can figure that right\non the network interface.\n\n144\n00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.650\nSo make sure you actually\nget that public IP address.\n\n145\n00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.384\nThe other thing that you will also\nhave to get configured, of course,\n\n146\n00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:38.085\nis gonna be your DNS record\nin the public DNS register.\n\n147\n00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.822\nSo if you are doing this for\nyour own company,\n\n148\n00:08:40.822 --> 00:08:44.218\nyou should figure out who\nyour public DNS registrar is.\n\n149\n00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:48.338\nAWS, GoDaddy, for me it's Hover.com.\n\n150\n00:08:48.338 --> 00:08:52.090\nThere's plenty of them out there\nthat are available to you.\n\n151\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.670\nYou just have to figure\nout which one it is and\n\n152\n00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.760\nthen assign that public IP\naddress that you get along with\n\n153\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.060\nthe name that you're actually gonna\nprovide for your proxy server, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.290\nSo we want that also\nimplemented in as well.\n\n155\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:12.330\nThe other thing that you'll need\non your proxy server itself is to\n\n156\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:19.430\nreconfigure the host file to point\nto your internal ADFS server.\n\n157\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.100\nOkay?\nSo, it's a little bit strange,\n\n158\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.630\nbut I'll show you,\n\n159\n00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.770\nas we go along here, what we need to be\nable to do to get this up and running.\n\n160\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.420\nOkay?\n\n161\n00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.460\nOf course, also,\nyou'll need that proxy server certificate.\n\n162\n00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.860\nSo if you ended up getting a third\nparty certificate you're again going\n\n163\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.510\nto install that on the machines that's\ngoing to become your proxy server and\n\n164\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.970\nyou'll be able to do that.\n\n165\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.638\nNow, if this is your point and\nyou're studying at home in a lab go,\n\n166\n00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:47.339\nRonnie I'm not gonna get\na server certificate.\n\n167\n00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:52.036\nWell you have a chance to get 30 day or\n90 day trial certificate depending on\n\n168\n00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:55.500\nwhere you go, but\nbe careful with this, right?\n\n169\n00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.850\nIf you get it,\n\n170\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.430\npay attention to what they're telling\nyou as you fill out those forms.\n\n171\n00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.540\nTry and see if they'll give\nyou a wildcard certificate.\n\n172\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.140\nUsually the name on it,\nis gonna be an asterisk.\n\n173\n00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.030\nSo just hit the asterisk.ITProTVdemo.com.\n\n174\n00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.710\nAnd that will allow you to put it on\nmultiple machines if you need to,\n\n175\n00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.260\nto get everything set up for ADFS.\n\n176\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.070\nAnd that's usually the one that you want.\n\n177\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.380\nYou want to be able to put\nit on to your ADFS server,\n\n178\n00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.100\nthe one that's actually doing\nall the work internally.\n\n179\n00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.500\nYou also want to put it on to your web\nproxy server as well and that will help\n\n180\n00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.610\nyou to get it set up without you having\nto go, I have a certificate on one but\n\n181\n00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.490\nI have it on the other one, you want both\nof those to have the certificate on it.\n\n182\n00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:41.082\nSo, take a look at that when you talk\nabout getting an ADFS certificate.\n\n183\n00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:44.350\nYou have to import that in, and\nwe'll show you how to do that as well.\n\n184\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.960\nIdeally don't forget the placement in the\ntopology normally is gonna be on the DMZ,\n\n185\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.710\nor is gonna be really a true proxy which\nyou're gonna have two network interfaces,\n\n186\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.920\none inside of your network and\none going outside of the network.\n\n187\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.470\nThis is not a recommended\nconfiguration in a production network.\n\n188\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.775\nSo, in other words, if you're working for\na company and you're saying hey,\n\n189\n00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:10.595\nI'm gonna do this they're\nprobably gonna say no.\n\n190\n00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:13.810\nBut if you ask them can\nI place one in the DMZ?\n\n191\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.080\nThat's probably gonna be a better\naspect of what you're gonna do.\n\n192\n00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.650\nBut what about in a lab setting?\n\n193\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.040\nIn a lab setting like what\nI'm setting up right now,\n\n194\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.400\nI did the real proxy server setting.\n\n195\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.920\nI put one interface on the public side.\n\n196\n00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.400\nI put one interface on\nthe internal side as well.\n\n197\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.030\nAnd the reason why is I wasn't gonna setup\nanother firewall and do all that and\n\n198\n00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.720\nget everything done because\nit was just a lab setting.\n\n199\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.000\nBut in your networking, if you are not\nsure about the network configuration, make\n\n200\n00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.040\nsure you consult whoever is actually part\nof that network infrastructure team and\n\n201\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.990\ntell them,\nhere's what I need to be able to do.\n\n202\n00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.290\nAnd then, let them know, and\nthey'll get it set up for you,\n\n203\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:59.120\nat least help guide you along in what\nthe next steps are going to be, okay.\n\n204\n00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.070\nSo very important types of prerequisites\nfor us as we get that set up.\n\n205\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.470\nSo let's take a look at what we\ndo with this information then.\n\n206\n00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.680\nNow that we have that,\nI'm going to simply connect over to my\n\n207\n00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.380\npublic DNS registrar, okay,\nso mine is hover.com and\n\n208\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.410\nI race to that a couple of times here,\nbut we do a lot of cover.com.\n\n209\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.200\nI like it.\nIt's very easy to work with.\n\n210\n00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.200\n&gt;&gt; And it's free, right?\n\n211\n00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.721\n&gt;&gt; Well, no, hover.com itself is not free.\n\n212\n00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:27.294\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n213\n00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:28.170\nWe've got to explain this.\n\n214\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.870\n&gt;&gt; So this is one you'll pay, okay,\nso if you're saying well, Ronnie,\n\n215\n00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.280\nI'm doing this for a lab,\ndo I really need to do this?\n\n216\n00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.370\nWell, it's up to you, right?\n\n217\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.260\nYou don't have to do this.\n\n218\n00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:41.050\nBut at the same time, if you wanna get\nbetter at it, register a DNS name.\n\n219\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.300\nJust do your whole name as one word,\nor something very similar, and\n\n220\n00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.180\nyou'll probably be able to register the\nname for, let's say, 12, maybe $15 a year.\n\n221\n00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.136\nSo if you go-\n&gt;&gt; It's not bad.\n\n222\n00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:51.673\n&gt;&gt; I really only, yeah.\n\n223\n00:12:51.673 --> 00:12:52.577\nIt's not bad at all.\n\n224\n00:12:52.577 --> 00:12:54.819\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So if you do that, then you're fine and\n\n225\n00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:56.000\nyou're ready to go.\n\n226\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.810\nOkay?\nSo once that's up and running,\n\n227\n00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.879\nyou'll end up getting something\nthat will look similar to this.\n\n228\n00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:02.560\nI'm not gonna say all the time.\n\n229\n00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.052\nBut this is actually\nthe register records here.\n\n230\n00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:09.232\nAnd you'll see that right away I\ncreated an A name, an A record.\n\n231\n00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:16.870\nOkay, for adfs and the public IP\naddress it is going to be, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.140\nAnd that's important because right now\nthe way that I have it configured and\n\n233\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.370\nwhat's going on,\nit is not going to work for\n\n234\n00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.670\nme if somebody tries get access\nto MyOffice365 from the outside.\n\n235\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.210\nSo this is my host machine.\n\n236\n00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.360\nI'm on a Mac computer.\n\n237\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.962\nIf I change this over and\nI just try and do portaloffice.com,\n\n238\n00:13:38.962 --> 00:13:42.533\nand let's see, let me change this up.\n\n239\n00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:46.029\nAnd I'll use the only one that I\nactually have memorized the password to.\n\n240\n00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:50.325\n[LAUGH] So let's do itprotvdemo.com.\n\n241\n00:13:50.325 --> 00:13:53.226\nOops, I have to change this cuz\nthis actually ended up changing in\n\n242\n00:13:53.226 --> 00:13:55.940\nan earlier episode, and\nI always forget it.\n\n243\n00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.610\nNotice what it actually says there Zach,\nlook at the wording that it does,\n\n244\n00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.450\ntaking you to your\norganization's sign-in page.\n\n245\n00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.290\nNow, my organization sign-in page at\nthis point is only my ADFS server.\n\n246\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.760\nThe active directory federation server\ninside my internal network, which,\n\n247\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.550\nactually the host name is FS01.\n\n248\n00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.110\nIf I scroll out here and in a moment,\nit might take a little bit of time.\n\n249\n00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.470\nBut you end up seeing that\nthis will end up changing\n\n250\n00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.590\nto a record that I had\npreviously set at some point,\n\n251\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.530\nright, that says ADFS.ITPROTVdemo.com but\n\n252\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:40.500\nit will not know how to get there\nunless I've actually set up\n\n253\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.520\nthe managed domains here for\nme on hover and this record.\n\n254\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.290\nRight now it's looking for ADFS,\nand it's actually looking for\n\n255\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.350\nthis IP address right\nhere to get connected in.\n\n256\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.170\nIf it can find it, it will do that.\n\n257\n00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.718\nIf not,\nafter a while it's gonna end up failing.\n\n258\n00:14:57.718 --> 00:14:59.208\nSo it's not gonna be able to connect,\n\n259\n00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:01.127\nit's not gonna be able to\ndo what we need it to do.\n\n260\n00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:02.110\nBut those are just two steps.\n\n261\n00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.560\nSo now we've got that configured,\nyou know, hopefully,\n\n262\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.355\nif I have the Web access proxy\nserver set up, it should connect and\n\n263\n00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:12.195\nwe should be able to log in but\nright now I don't.\n\n264\n00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:14.370\nI don't have anything configured.\n\n265\n00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.470\nThere's what I was hoping for\nus to see in the end,\n\n266\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.360\nI was hoping it would\nbe a little bit faster.\n\n267\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.505\nYou'll notice right here,\nhere's what it should have failed over to,\n\n268\n00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:24.639\nADFS.ITPROVTVdemo.com.\n\n269\n00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:27.610\nWell, out on the Internet,\nthat's exactly what happened.\n\n270\n00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.505\nWe hit the Office365 portal, so I need\nto redirect you to your organization's\n\n271\n00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:37.510\nsign-on, which is going to be the web\naccess proxy called ADFS.ITPROVTVdemo.\n\n272\n00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.279\nWell now it went and I found that DNS\nregister record and if that's actually set\n\n273\n00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:47.189\nin there, okay, then it should find it and\nif the machine is up and operational,\n\n274\n00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:51.037\nit should be able to answer and\nrespond to this call right here.\n\n275\n00:15:51.037 --> 00:15:52.875\nNow you do have to be careful.\n\n276\n00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:54.493\nOnce again this is the networking side.\n\n277\n00:15:54.493 --> 00:15:57.377\nWhoever sets this up for you if you do it.\n\n278\n00:15:57.377 --> 00:16:03.020\nRemember that this can take up to\n48 hours to propagate out, okay.\n\n279\n00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.870\nSo it's not an immediate thing,\n\n280\n00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.860\ndon't think it's failed if\nyou don't hit it right away.\n\n281\n00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.087\nBut the way that we can\nchange that sometimes, okay,\n\n282\n00:16:11.087 --> 00:16:16.053\nis that we reduce let's say the actual\ntime delivered down to about 15 minutes.\n\n283\n00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:20.730\nAnd that way, we'll see if it actually\nkind of renews itself after a few minutes.\n\n284\n00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.850\nBut usually, let it sit, expect for\nit to take up to 48 hours to do so.\n\n285\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.070\nIt doesn't always take that,\n\n286\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:32.100\nsometimes it's within an hour,\nsometimes it's within 30 or 40 minutes,\n\n287\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:37.160\nsometimes it does take up to 48 hours to\npropagate out in the way that we need to.\n\n288\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.460\nSo that's actually set up for\nus right now for us to be able to do.\n\n289\n00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.320\nSo taking that information, now we've\nessentially set up a couple of these,\n\n290\n00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.400\nright, the public IP address, the public\nDNS record, the way that we need to.\n\n291\n00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.130\nNow, let's take a look at the host\nfile on the proxy server.\n\n292\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.670\nNow, I've already done this so\nwe could see it.\n\n293\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.800\nLet me show you.\n\n294\n00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.550\nLet me get over to the proxy server here.\n\n295\n00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.770\nOne more, there we go.\n\n296\n00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.900\nHere is is, the ADFS proxy server.\n\n297\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.860\nThis is going to become my\nproxy server for right now.\n\n298\n00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.520\nThe other thing that I have to do now that\nI've got that part set up, is I need to\n\n299\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.970\nmake sure that on my server itself,\nin the lab environment that I'm in,\n\n300\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.890\nI'm gonna need to take a look\nat those addresses here, okay?\n\n301\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.230\nThat machine is set up with\nthis public IP address.\n\n302\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:32.010\nI wanna verify that that's actually\ncorrect and good and working.\n\n303\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.750\nBecause of the way I have it set up as\nbeing a true proxy, it has also got\n\n304\n00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.280\nanother network adapter attached to\nthe inside of my network as well.\n\n305\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.640\nAgain, remember in a production network\nyou're not going to do this, but\n\n306\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.400\nin a lab setting that's exactly\nhow I'd have it set up.\n\n307\n00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.570\nSo on this one we\nare hopefully ready to go.\n\n308\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.180\nNow I'm starting to see maybe\nan issue that may arise like this\n\n309\n00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.100\npublic firewall on.\n\n310\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.680\nI normally don't expect to see\none of this being public but\n\n311\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.190\nthis one may have actually turned itself\nas public because it is a public one.\n\n312\n00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.815\nBut that may cause some issues so\nwe're gonna have to do a little bit of\n\n313\n00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:09.250\ntroubleshooting later on as we get\nthis configured and ready to go, okay?\n\n314\n00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.970\nSo I know that I have\nthat public IP address.\n\n315\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.780\nNext thing I need to do\nIs I need to go ahead and\n\n316\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.690\nset this up remember that\nideally this would in our DMZ.\n\n317\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.292\nSo this is not gonna have access\nto my own DNS server internally.\n\n318\n00:18:23.292 --> 00:18:29.010\nNow mine does, but ideally you're\nnot gonna have that on this machine.\n\n319\n00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:34.340\nSo the way that we get the machine then,\nto be able to use names for\n\n320\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:40.370\nname resolution is that we're gonna\nmanipulate the host file on this machine.\n\n321\n00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.121\nSo I'm simply going to find the host file,\n\n322\n00:18:46.942 --> 00:18:52.345\nUnder System 32, drivers, ect.\n\n323\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.310\nAnd once I'm here I'm going to type in,\nif I can type, notepad.\n\n324\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.850\nAnd then I'm looking for\na file called hosts.\n\n325\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.800\nWhen I do that,\nhere is what we're going to end up seeing.\n\n326\n00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.410\nAnd I added in a few records for\nus to pay attention to.\n\n327\n00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.404\nSo here is one that I removed at one\npoint, because I started doing this and\n\n328\n00:19:13.404 --> 00:19:16.509\nI realized I don't need it to\npoint at the internal name.\n\n329\n00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:23.788\nI need for adfs.itprotvdemo essentially\nto point to the ADFS server,\n\n330\n00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:28.980\nmy particular internal federation server.\n\n331\n00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:35.950\nSo now on my machine,\nwhen I get a request for ADFS ITProTVdemo,\n\n332\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.460\nI can also reach it from\nthe proxy server using this too.\n\n333\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:46.754\nIf not, I would have to do everything by\nthe IP address, which is 172.16.89.210.\n\n334\n00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:51.664\nSo I had actually left this in here\nto show you that even though I know\n\n335\n00:19:51.664 --> 00:19:57.080\nwhat the name of my machine is\nInternally for my federation server.\n\n336\n00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.210\nThat is not what I need.\n\n337\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:04.480\nI need the service name,\nwhich is gonna be adfs.itprotv.demo.\n\n338\n00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.160\nSo it's the service name that we're\nexpecting to see from the outside.\n\n339\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.250\nThat's what needs to go in here, okay?\n\n340\n00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.310\nSo by putting in this pound sign at the\nbeginning, or hashtag today, by putting\n\n341\n00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:21.330\nin this pound sign at the beginning, that\ncomments it out, it marks it out there.\n\n342\n00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.470\nI could have simply deleted it, but\nI want you to, that way you can see,\n\n343\n00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.530\ndon't put in the true FQDN of your\ninternal proxys of your internal\n\n344\n00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:35.970\nADFS server, but the service name is\nwhat you want to go in those spots.\n\n345\n00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.144\nOnce that's there, all you have to do is\nif you've launched your PowerShell or\n\n346\n00:20:40.144 --> 00:20:43.133\nyour command line tool,\ninside of, as administrator,\n\n347\n00:20:43.133 --> 00:20:44.835\nyou should be able to save this.\n\n348\n00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:54.289\nAnd that way you can verify\nping adfs itprotvdemo.\n\n349\n00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.580\n.com, and you're just verifying that\nit's gonna resolve the name, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.370\nSo I did see it is actually resolving.\n\n351\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.720\nMine is that special situation where\nI do have it set up on both sides.\n\n352\n00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.730\nSo I expect it to do that.\n\n353\n00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.540\nBut I'm just making sure\nthat the proper name, okay,\n\n354\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:18.410\nthe service name is resolving to\nthe actual ADFS server itself.\n\n355\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.350\nSo that's actually the key thing\non the host server that we need.\n\n356\n00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.430\nAll right, so from that point\nonce we get that, let me verify.\n\n357\n00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.470\nAnd let's see if there's\nany other information.\n\n358\n00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.260\nSo the operational ADFS,\nof course, if kind of key there.\n\n359\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.240\nAnd you wanna verify this along the way so\n\n360\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.590\nhow the heck do I verify\nthat this is operational?\n\n361\n00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.781\nNow let me type in the super\nlong password here.\n\n362\n00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:50.740\nAnd get access in, okay?\n\n363\n00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.510\nSo the way that we verify this previously,\nthat everything is still working,\n\n364\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:59.090\nand that we are able to make sure that\nthe federation server is working.\n\n365\n00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:05.110\nI lost the Azure AD Connect tool,\nI selected Configure\n\n366\n00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.027\nand then at the bottom here,\nnotice it says Verify ADFS Login.\n\n367\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.942\nAnd I click Next and\nthat's gonna ask me for credentials,\n\n368\n00:22:13.942 --> 00:22:15.896\nI'm gonna use the same credentials\n\n369\n00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:26.972\n&gt;&gt; And you're using the same password too,\n\n370\n00:22:26.972 --> 00:22:27.550\nright Ronnie?\n\n371\n00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.400\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nthis is connecting to Office 365 and\n\n372\n00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.380\nverifying that this is a global\nadministrative account that we have.\n\n373\n00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.140\nThen it's just asking us, hey change and\n\n374\n00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.920\njust type in another particular account\nthat should also have access in.\n\n375\n00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.700\nWell, I could do that except for\none thing,\n\n376\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.400\nI don't know anybody else's password.\n\n377\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.902\nSo I'm just gonna do that same thing,\nI'm just gonna use Cherokee's as well.\n\n378\n00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.798\nShe should have access in as\nbeing part of the organization.\n\n379\n00:23:02.457 --> 00:23:05.430\nAnd in a moment there,\nthat's all we're looking for.\n\n380\n00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.800\nSo I know it's a lot of work to go\nthrough, but we wanna verify that it's\n\n381\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.070\nsuccessfully logged into Microsoft Online,\nusing the security token, okay.\n\n382\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.480\nSo that is the key.\n\n383\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.770\nIs it actually now using\na token to sign in?\n\n384\n00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:21.900\nSo this means what?\n\n385\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:28.690\nWe now know this officially, officially,\neffectively I think [LAUGH] worked.\n\n386\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:29.504\n&gt;&gt; Effectively and officially.\n\n387\n00:23:29.504 --> 00:23:30.290\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think.\n\n388\n00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.700\nI was like no officially is not.\n\n389\n00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.152\nBut it effectively is working\nthe way that we want it to work.\n\n390\n00:23:35.152 --> 00:23:40.160\nAdding the proxy server in between\nadds an element in between and\n\n391\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.050\nnow we have to work through\nthat proxy to make it work.\n\n392\n00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.814\nOkay, so that's really our next set, but\n\n393\n00:23:45.814 --> 00:23:47.685\nwe want to verify that it works first,\nokay.\n\n394\n00:23:47.685 --> 00:23:51.636\nSo at this point, we know that it\nwill actually set up and work, but\n\n395\n00:23:51.636 --> 00:23:56.085\nwe still couldn't get connected from\nthe outside and this is where we go and\n\n396\n00:23:56.085 --> 00:24:00.959\nwe now start to The configuration, or\nactually I shouldn't say configuration,\n\n397\n00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:05.250\nthe installation, excuse me,\nof the web access proxy server, okay?\n\n398\n00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.570\nSo here it is on my web\naccess proxy server.\n\n399\n00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.990\nWe've met all the prerequisites,\nZach, okay?\n\n400\n00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.800\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n401\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.190\n&gt;&gt; We've set it up the way\nthat we needed to.\n\n402\n00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.340\nAnd now we need to run\nthrough the install.\n\n403\n00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.670\nThe easiest way to run through\nthe install, of course,\n\n404\n00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.530\nis through the server manager.\n\n405\n00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.590\nNow, can you do this in,\non through PowerShell if you want to?\n\n406\n00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.450\nAbsolutely, but I also want to show you\nthrough here, because this one actually,\n\n407\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:27.702\nbelieve it or not,\nit's a little bit trickier.\n\n408\n00:24:27.702 --> 00:24:32.710\nThe PowerShell way to do it is actually\na little bit easier to be able to do.\n\n409\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.960\nNow, the one element that I didn't\ndo at this particular point in time,\n\n410\n00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.470\ncuz I'm leaving it for\n\n411\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:44.000\na little bit of troubleshooting later on,\nis I didn't install the certificate, okay?\n\n412\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.350\nNow, if we want to actually be able to do\nthat, okay, that's what we should do now.\n\n413\n00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.580\nAnd actually,\nI do have it saying install now.\n\n414\n00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.830\nSo somewhere along the line I changed\nmy mind and said let's do this.\n\n415\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.080\nSo before I go any further in\nthe install part, let's go ahead and\n\n416\n00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.600\ninstall that certificate as well, okay?\n\n417\n00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.550\nNow, if you already obtained\nyour third-party certificate,\n\n418\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.160\ntwo ways that you're gonna do\nthis at home, you're gonna go and\n\n419\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.420\nbuy your own certificate online,\nokay, is what you're gonna do.\n\n420\n00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.808\nAnd they're gonna give\nyou that certificate.\n\n421\n00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:16.940\nYou're gonna pay whatever money you do, or\n\n422\n00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.950\nyou're gonna do one of\nthose trial certificates.\n\n423\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.710\nIt's relatively easy to get set up and\ndone.\n\n424\n00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.170\nWe showed you that in a previous\nepisode as well, okay?\n\n425\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.840\nOnce that's actually done,\n\n426\n00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:33.180\nyou now need to make sure that you can\nfind a copy of that certificate as well.\n\n427\n00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:38.090\nNow, what we're really looking for\nis the one that is the .pfx.\n\n428\n00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.150\nIt is the personal\ninformation exchange here.\n\n429\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.920\nIf I right-click,\nall I have to do is select Install, okay?\n\n430\n00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.670\nAnd it's ready to go.\n\n431\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.895\nBut we're not gonna do it that way, okay?\n\n432\n00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:52.170\nWe, of course,\nare gonna launch up the PowerShell.\n\n433\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.700\nAnd we don't even need PowerShell at\nthis point, it's actually just a regular\n\n434\n00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.050\ncommand line, but I'm gonna launch\nit from PowerShell anyways.\n\n435\n00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.315\nTo go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:04.910\nalso add in the certificate into\nmy certificate store, okay?\n\n437\n00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:10.673\nThe way we do that\n\n438\n00:26:10.673 --> 00:26:16.438\nis certutil dash\n\n439\n00:26:16.438 --> 00:26:20.980\nimportPFX.\n\n440\n00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.820\nNow, I need to remember where\nexactly that certificate store was.\n\n441\n00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.480\nIt's in my documents folder.\n\n442\n00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.300\nSo now,\nI need to actually enter in the path.\n\n443\n00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:38.879\nSo I do\nC:\\Users\\Admistrator\\Documents there.\n\n444\n00:26:38.879 --> 00:26:42.610\nI can do adfsdemo.com.\n\n445\n00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:44.040\nAnd then, I can start typing in.\n\n446\n00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.080\nAnd I'm looking for\nthe extension here to be the .pfx.\n\n447\n00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.474\nI hope you can see that.\n\n448\n00:26:51.474 --> 00:26:52.738\nThe .pfx file.\n\n449\n00:26:55.511 --> 00:26:59.160\nNow it's gonna ask me for the password,\nwhich is should be password protected.\n\n450\n00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.040\nAnd then if you're not sure,\nsomebody else should tell you.\n\n451\n00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.160\nAnd the reason why it's saying, hey,\n\n452\n00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.650\nyou can't do this because\nyou've already installed it.\n\n453\n00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.000\nI wanted to at least show you\nthat it could be done, okay?\n\n454\n00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.120\nSo as I said, it's already been completed.\n\n455\n00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.632\nObject already exist here.\n\n456\n00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:14.270\nCertificate's already in the store.\n\n457\n00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.290\nNow, we want this because, for\n\n458\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.860\nus to actually go ahead and\ncontinue to do this, right?\n\n459\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.070\nTo actually get it to work for\n\n460\n00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.130\nthe ADFS proxy server,\nwe need to do a couple of other things.\n\n461\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.510\nI need to get\nthe certificate's thumbprint.\n\n462\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.780\nSo if I change the directory inside of\nPowerShell, you've gotta be in PowerShell\n\n463\n00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.560\nto do this, to verify there, I can\nchange to another volume called cert.\n\n464\n00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.960\nThen I can do a \\LocalMachine\\my.\n\n465\n00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.870\nAnd when I do this,\nyou'll notice because I've actually\n\n466\n00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.020\ninstalled it a few times here,\nwhat we're looking for is this last one.\n\n467\n00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.110\nIf this is your first time doing it, it's\ngonna have all of these right here, okay?\n\n468\n00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.130\nYou're actually only looking for\n\n469\n00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.870\nthis one right here at the end, the one\nthat has all of the fully qualified.\n\n470\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:04.460\nYou start seeing this canonical name and\nO U and O U here.\n\n471\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.995\nThat is the one that you're looking for,\nokay?\n\n472\n00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:09.876\n&gt;&gt; Hey, Ronnie, I really would love to\nhave you continue on because this is\n\n473\n00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:12.111\nawesome, but I think we might\nhave to go into a part two.\n\n474\n00:28:12.111 --> 00:28:13.477\nWhat do you think?\n&gt;&gt; That sounds good,\n\n475\n00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:15.517\nwe are running a little bit low on time.\n\n476\n00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:19.060\nBut we'll continue to pick up\nfrom this point right here.\n\n477\n00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:19.900\nAnd then that way,\n\n478\n00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.280\nwe'll go ahead and show you also\nthe install of the web access proxy.\n\n479\n00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.320\n&gt;&gt; That said, it's be wonderful.\n\n480\n00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.320\nAnd this is install web access proxy.\n\n481\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.450\nPart two will be coming your way.\n\n482\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.990\nThis has been part one.\n\n483\n00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:32.150\nMake sure you watch both those and\nwatch everything in the Office 365 series.\n\n484\n00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.140\nRonnie did such a wonderful job.\n\n485\n00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.160\nAnd while you're at it, take a look at the\nrest of the videos in the course library.\n\n486\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.260\nThere are hundreds of videos.\n\n487\n00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.560\nThey're all designed to\nhelp you go further.\n\n488\n00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.990\nAnd tell everybody you\nknow about IT Pro TV.\n\n489\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.520\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n490\n00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.280\nThanks for watching.\n\n491\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.140\nI'm Zach

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.696\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nwatching ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:16.365\nhelping you learn where ever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.111\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:23.357\nThis is Install Web Access Proxy part two,\nand the one and\n\n9\n00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.935\nonly Ronnie Wong is here\ntoday to help us out.\n\n10\n00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:27.755\nRonnie, thanks so very much.\n\n11\n00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.365\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back on\nthis show Zach, as we continue on.\n\n12\n00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.175\nWe've already talked about\nthe prerequisites quite a bit, and\n\n13\n00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:35.295\nit took longer that I thought.\n\n14\n00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.750\nAnd that's essentially what\nends up happening when\n\n15\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.050\nyou let me talk about\na particular subject here.\n\n16\n00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.780\nSo we are.\n\n17\n00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm not going to stop you.\n\n18\n00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.950\n&gt;&gt; We are just continuing on.\n\n19\n00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.955\nWe are having a little bit\nof troubleshooting, but\n\n20\n00:00:45.955 --> 00:00:47.592\nI believe I figured out what the issue is.\n\n21\n00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:48.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At least that's what I think.\n\n22\n00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.174\nSo let's take a look at my screen,\nand this will kinda set you up here.\n\n23\n00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:56.175\nI started to try and type in the web\napplication proxy, and I normally do\n\n24\n00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.980\na tab and that normally fills it in so\nI don't have to type out the whole thing.\n\n25\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.700\nBut it's not letting me do it.\n\n26\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.830\nAnd I actually came to a conclusion that\nI've set this up in the wrong sequence\n\n27\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.370\nso far.\n\n28\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.240\nSo the great thing is I can install it,\nwhich is fine, but\n\n29\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020\nI can't set it up as my certificate\nthat I'm going to use for\n\n30\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.705\nthe Web Access Proxy if I don't have\nthe Web Access Proxy installed.\n\n31\n00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So at least that's my guess right now.\n\n32\n00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.670\nSo let's test out my theory and\nsee what happens from this point.\n\n33\n00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.373\nSo the great thing is we not got it\ninstalled, so that takes a relief off my\n\n34\n00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:33.409\nmind cuz there's so\nmany pieces that easily forgotten.\n\n35\n00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; But at this point we're gonna go back\n\n36\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.200\nto the server manager,\nthen I'm gonna click on Dashboard.\n\n37\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.240\nAnd we'll just get this installed and\nthen hopefully we'll be able\n\n38\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.300\nto get the certificate set up\nthe way that we need to as well.\n\n39\n00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.500\nOnce I select Dashboard, I have\nthe ability to add roles and features.\n\n40\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.230\nSo I'm going to select,\nAdd Roles and Features here, okay?\n\n41\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.132\nAnd then, begin the installation process.\n\n42\n00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:01.520\nRemember I've send this, you can do\nthis from PowerShell If you want to.\n\n43\n00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.010\nBut the PowerShell sides actually gonna\nbe a lot easier to get this done.\n\n44\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.160\nAnd if you do the Powershell side,\n\n45\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.870\nyou'll see it's really just like, it says\nsomething like install Web Access Proxy or\n\n46\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.530\nADFS Web Access Proxy,\nwhatever the terminology is.\n\n47\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.770\nBut this one is a little bit more tricky\nand you know in terms of its install.\n\n48\n00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.380\nNow I say that but\nsome people that like this, is fine.\n\n49\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380\nBut just look that up\non the PowerShell side,\n\n50\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.540\nmake sure you at least\nsee the syntax error.\n\n51\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.610\nAnd the great thing is, you'll install and\n\n52\n00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.180\nset the certificate up right in the same\ncommand that you would instead.\n\n53\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.920\nBut here we're gonna do it in\na two-step process using this.\n\n54\n00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.674\nSo click Next, and leave it at\nthe role based feature installation.\n\n55\n00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:44.052\nI'm going to select Next here,\nthen of course,\n\n56\n00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:47.380\nI'm going to choose the server\nthat I'm going to be using.\n\n57\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.260\nNow if you're actually doing this with\na real server farm, you may have two or\n\n58\n00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.460\nthree to choose from.\n\n59\n00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.780\nSelect the one that you're going\nto install this one on as well, so\n\n60\n00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.938\nI'm going to click Next here.\n\n61\n00:02:55.938 --> 00:03:00.530\nFrom this point, I'm going to need to\nselect something that's a little bit more\n\n62\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.280\nnot intuitive, right?\n\n63\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.170\nSo I would think that this\nwould be an ADFS proxy server.\n\n64\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.906\nSo I would think that I would install in\nthe Active Directory Federation Services\n\n65\n00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.566\nat this point, but\nthis would be incorrect.\n\n66\n00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.720\nSo don't do that, okay?\n\n67\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.390\nSo do not select this as being an option\nto install the Web Access Proxy.\n\n68\n00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.769\nIt now falls underneath,\nwell, Remote Access instead.\n\n69\n00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.202\nSo if I click on Remote Access,\n\n70\n00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:32.210\nwe are going to select here\na little bit different.\n\n71\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.635\nNow you might wonder why\nis it under Remote Access?\n\n72\n00:03:34.635 --> 00:03:37.713\nWell lets take a look here,\nlet me zoom in on description and\n\n73\n00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:40.870\nyou'll see right there,\nlook, Web Application Proxy.\n\n74\n00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.370\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n75\n00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.750\n&gt;&gt; That is what we're actually going\nto be taking a look at as well.\n\n76\n00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.033\nSo click Next here.\n\n77\n00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.092\nFrom this point, notice under features,\n\n78\n00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:52.923\nwe're not gonna really play around with\nany of these additional features cuz we\n\n79\n00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:55.940\ndon't need any for\njust the basic Web Access Proxy.\n\n80\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.620\nI'm going to select Next, and\nnow under Role Services though, okay?\n\n81\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.860\nThis is what we're looking for,\nas Web Application Proxy.\n\n82\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.960\nAnd click Next, and\nthen select the Web Application Proxy.\n\n83\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.929\nWhen I do that it's gonna say,\n\n84\n00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.210\nhey do you know that you have to\nset up the rest of this stuff too?\n\n85\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.844\nLet me go and add these features\nin this particular point and time,\n\n86\n00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.740\nthen I can click Next here.\n\n87\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.910\nWhen I do so, I'm gonna also put a check\nmark here in case it does need a restart.\n\n88\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.850\nSometimes it needs to restart to get\neverything set up the way that we want to.\n\n89\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.720\nSo I'm not gonna,\nI'd hate to walk away with a,\n\n90\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.621\nI just wanna be finished and install after\nfive or ten minutes and I'll come back and\n\n91\n00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:39.231\nfinish up the configuration at that point.\n\n92\n00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:43.020\nIf it needs a restart and you don't have\nthat, it's just gonna sit there and go,\n\n93\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.220\nhey this is waiting for\nyou to say yes, you wanna restart.\n\n94\n00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.070\nSo I'm just go let it do it's own\nthing here and click Install.\n\n95\n00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.850\nOn that point, it shouldn't take\ntoo long but you never know, right?\n\n96\n00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.920\nSo let's see, there it goes,\nthe installation features are starting.\n\n97\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.640\nThat's gonna start at\nthe top of the list and\n\n98\n00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.180\nwork it's way down and everything\nthat it needs to do to install and\n\n99\n00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.470\nget everything set up to be\nthat Web Application Proxy.\n\n100\n00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.860\nSo once we get that set up,\nnow at the end of this process,\n\n101\n00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.010\nit should give me the tools that\nI need to set that certificate up\n\n102\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.200\nto now where that Web Application Proxy or\n\n103\n00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.390\nWeb Access Proxy server is going\nto be able to get set up for us.\n\n104\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.410\nAnd even though it says Web Application,\nwe're really using it for Web Access,\n\n105\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.250\nwhich is going to be single\nsign-on in a federated services,\n\n106\n00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.140\nis what we're gonna do here.\n\n107\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.380\nSo notice there,\nthe feature is now complete.\n\n108\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.812\nAnd if I select Close at this\nparticular point in time,\n\n109\n00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:40.760\nI am not done with the configuration.\n\n110\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.950\nI've installed it.\n\n111\n00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.940\nDon't get me wrong it's there and\nI still need to set it up to make it work.\n\n112\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.910\nBut at this point, it is now at\nleast installed and ready to go.\n\n113\n00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.280\nSo let's go back over here to our window,\nand\n\n114\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.340\nI'm gonna close this out and\nopen it again.\n\n115\n00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.640\nAnd the reason why, I don't know, every\nonce in a while things kind of get cached\n\n116\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.920\nunusually at times, so I'm going to\nselect Run as the administrator again.\n\n117\n00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.275\nAnd here's where we'll kind of find out\nif I'm right or if I'm wrong, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:14.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\n\n119\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.230\ndo that as well, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.809\nSo if I type in Set, right?\n\n121\n00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.384\nBecause now that I have the certificate\ninstalled, I want to be able\n\n122\n00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:27.056\nto see if this will actually set it up for\nus here, there we go, okay?\n\n123\n00:06:27.056 --> 00:06:31.507\nSo notice that before, right,\nfrom the previous episode,\n\n124\n00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.990\nit didn't even let me type in Web and\nthen anything else.\n\n125\n00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.300\nHere I did a set dash and now that I've\ninstalled the Web Application Proxy,\n\n126\n00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.154\nnow it actually allowed me to run this,\nokay?\n\n127\n00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:49.160\nSo what I need though,\nis actually the thumbprint.\n\n128\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.270\nNow that's something I forgot.\n\n129\n00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.950\nI shouldn't have closed out, but I did.\n\n130\n00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.840\nWell let's see here,\nlet's see if I hit, there we go.\n\n131\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.041\nSo remember, all of this stuff here.\n\n132\n00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.964\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Here is what I need,\n\n133\n00:06:59.964 --> 00:07:03.151\nwhich is this last thumbprint line, okay?\n\n134\n00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:07.462\nThat's the one that I need to set up,\nand I'm just going to highlight it and\n\n135\n00:07:07.462 --> 00:07:11.103\ncopy it and then if I try and\nsee if I go back through here, oops.\n\n136\n00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:20.681\nNow if i do the Set-WebApplicationProxy,\nit is from here.\n\n137\n00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:27.440\nWait, I need run the application,\nproxy not application, sorry.\n\n138\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.685\nI need the SSL Certificate.\n\n139\n00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:31.862\nSo I showed you kinda wrong,\n\n140\n00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:34.620\nI was like why does that not look\nright according to my notes there.\n\n141\n00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.299\nSo this is the one that we're\nactually looking for instead,\n\n142\n00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:41.630\nSet -WebApplicationProxySslCertificate.\n\n143\n00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.376\n&gt;&gt; Okay, then I can do a dash space\n\n144\n00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:51.850\ndash thumbprint, and it's here\n\n145\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.610\nthat I can just go ahead and paste that\nand then go ahead and press Enter.\n\n146\n00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.880\nNow I don't wanna do this again cuz it can\nkind of mess some things up if you're not\n\n147\n00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.780\ncareful here, so I'm going to leave it\nas is cuz I know it was working before.\n\n148\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.210\nSo that's exactly what I did.\n\n149\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.630\nAnd when everything is done, you'll start\nseeing, you'll start generating these.\n\n150\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.200\nNow what the heck is this about?\n\n151\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.830\nThese are the times that\nthe Web Application Proxy was working and\n\n152\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.120\nit actually did generate this as being\nwhat's trusted in between us and\n\n153\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.080\nthe ADFS service as well, okay?\n\n154\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.320\nSo here's what we'll end up seeing right,\nat the very end here.\n\n155\n00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.400\nIs that it's going to say,\nlook there it is.\n\n156\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.863\nThe feature installation is\ncompletely done and over with, okay?\n\n157\n00:08:34.863 --> 00:08:38.607\nAnd the installation has now succeeded,\nokay?\n\n158\n00:08:38.607 --> 00:08:42.354\nSo we know that that's done,\nnow it means we are ready for\n\n159\n00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:45.890\nwhat we call\nPost Deployment Configuration as well.\n\n160\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.430\nAnd from this point, we need to go in and\nwe need to begin to configure and\n\n161\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.861\nget everything else ready for\nour configuration side of things, okay?\n\n162\n00:08:55.861 --> 00:09:00.730\nSo Zach, even though this is kind of\na very short part two, it was worth\n\n163\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.115\nus taking the time to go through-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n164\n00:09:03.115 --> 00:09:06.210\n&gt;&gt; And getting that stuff set up and\nready to go, okay?\n\n165\n00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.180\nBecause now that we've got that,\n\n166\n00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.310\nnow is the time that's gonna\nbecome a little bit trickier.\n\n167\n00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.500\nBut if we put all the prerequisites\nthe way that we needed to, okay?\n\n168\n00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.680\nThen that actually allows us to really\nfocus in on this configuration part and\n\n169\n00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.650\nultimately, testing is\nwhere we want to go.\n\n170\n00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.810\nSo Zach, that about rounds up\nat least the installation side.\n\n171\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.350\nWe still have a bunch of configuration\nto go through, but let's save that for\n\n172\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.530\na separate episode and that way we'll\nkind of keep everything nice and\n\n173\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.120\nlogical as well.\n\n174\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.700\n&gt;&gt; Perfect, perfect.\n\n175\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.600\nWell this has been\nInstall Web Access Proxy, Part 2.\n\n176\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.085\nThere is a part one, see them both.\n\n177\n00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:40.370\nI'm guessing we are go into\na configure Web Access Proxy\n\n178\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.570\nthat will be probably coming up.\n\n179\n00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.960\nRonnie, any last words before\nwe move on or we're all set?\n\n180\n00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.705\n&gt;&gt; Nope at this point, we've gotten\neverything set up the way that we need to.\n\n181\n00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:50.229\nThe configuration,\nthis is where if anybody runs into issues,\n\n182\n00:09:50.229 --> 00:09:52.590\nit's probably gonna be this part, okay?\n\n183\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.515\nBesides the certificate part\nlike what I showed you,\n\n184\n00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:57.600\nwhere I just had the order\nbackward in my notes and\n\n185\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.850\nI was just following along saying, yeah\nthat should work, and then when it didn't.\n\n186\n00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.080\nBut just realize, that you have to install\nit first before you can assign that\n\n187\n00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.970\nparticular certificate to\ndo what we need it to do.\n\n188\n00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.880\n&gt;&gt; Well you're doing a wonderful\njob Ronnie, as always.\n\n189\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.300\nAnd make sure you watch every single\nepisode of the Office 365 series.\n\n190\n00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.496\nYou'll be very happy that you do that.\n\n191\n00:10:14.496 --> 00:10:19.270\nAnd, by the way, when you're in the course\nlibrary, there's hundreds of other videos,\n\n192\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.300\nall kinds of different topics,\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n193\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.290\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV,\nthey'll be glad you did.\n\n194\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.890\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n195\n00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n196\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.444\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n197\n00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:36.683\n[MUSIC]\n\n198\n00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:38.905\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV\n\n",

ITPro.TV,\n\n6\n00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.262\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n7\n00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:19.785\nI'm your host, Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.063\nIn this episode, we are gonna configure\nWeb Access Proxy, and the one and\n\n9\n00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:26.689\nonly Ronnie Wong is here\nto help us out again.\n\n10\n00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.461\nThank you, Ronnie, appreciate it so much.\n\n11\n00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.849\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n12\n00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.217\nas we now take that next step in the idea\nof configuring a Web Access Proxy.\n\n13\n00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:37.331\nAs you saw on the previous episode,\n\n14\n00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:40.299\nthe installation is really\nnot super difficult.\n\n15\n00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.134\nIn terms of the install,\nit really is walking through a wizard, and\n\n16\n00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:44.438\nthen we're pretty much done.\n\n17\n00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:47.320\nBut there is a lot of\nplanning that goes on.\n\n18\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.797\nAnd those are considerations\nthat we should think about and\n\n19\n00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:51.640\nmake sure that we\nunderstand where they go.\n\n20\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.639\nMake sure we understand what may be\nmissing there, and now we are ready for\n\n21\n00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:56.486\nconfiguring.\n\n22\n00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:59.445\nIn other words, getting it ready\nto work the way that we need to.\n\n23\n00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:02.409\nWhich means that it should\nbe able to now take,\n\n24\n00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.442\nif somebody from my organization\nwants to go to Office 365.\n\n25\n00:01:06.442 --> 00:01:09.701\nFrom the outside of the organization,\nor even inside, at that point.\n\n26\n00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.038\nIt should be able to\ntake that information,\n\n27\n00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:18.189\nsend it to the Web Access Proxy,\nwhich I'm not gonna be able to say.\n\n28\n00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.361\nAnd then, of course,\nsend that into the federation server,\n\n29\n00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.904\nwhich then talks to, of course,\nour on premises Active Directory.\n\n30\n00:01:24.904 --> 00:01:27.458\nAnd issue out the token\nthe way that we need to.\n\n31\n00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.027\nIf all that's done and\nsuccessful, well, then,\n\n32\n00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:33.992\nwe've actually got it ready to go and\nready for service in the way that we need.\n\n33\n00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:35.615\nNow, once that's done, right?\n\n34\n00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:39.176\nWe may also run into other issues\nthat we haven't considered, so\n\n35\n00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.493\nwe'll talk about that at the very\nend of our episode as well.\n\n36\n00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:46.058\nAs we kind of think about some\nof the things can go wrong and\n\n37\n00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:50.529\nways that we can deal with it and\nthat should help us out in the end, too.\n\n38\n00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:55.159\nAll right, so let's pick up from this\nidea of configuring a Web Access Proxy.\n\n39\n00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.608\nSo here it is,\nI am on the proxy server itself.\n\n40\n00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:03.253\nAnd we have just really completed\nin our previous episode installing\n\n41\n00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:05.823\nthe actual Web-Application Proxy.\n\n42\n00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:09.165\nAnd now it tells us,\nconfiguration is required.\n\n43\n00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:13.675\nThe great thing is, there is another\nwizard for us to be able to walk through.\n\n44\n00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:18.021\nSo if I click on that link,\nit brings me up to this\n\n45\n00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:22.385\nWeb Application Proxy\nConfiguration Wizard.\n\n46\n00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:26.418\nNow, when we start to take a look\nat what we're seeing, right?\n\n47\n00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:29.913\nIt's a remote access server used to\npublish web applications that end users\n\n48\n00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:30.848\ncan interact with.\n\n49\n00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:35.481\nIt also provides proxy functionality okay,\nto the AD FS,\n\n50\n00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:40.218\nto help administrators to secure\naccess to an AD FS server.\n\n51\n00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:42.674\nSo that is kind of the key component,\nwe're not so\n\n52\n00:02:42.674 --> 00:02:45.731\nworried about all the other\napplications that are out there.\n\n53\n00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:51.321\nBut this is really about securing that\naccess between the outside world and,\n\n54\n00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.795\nof course, the Active Directory\nfederation server itself.\n\n55\n00:02:55.795 --> 00:02:58.359\nFrom that point, I'm going to click Next.\n\n56\n00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.979\nAnd this is where the wording,\nat least to me, everybody else may\n\n57\n00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.011\nhave better understanding of\nEnglish grammar than I do.\n\n58\n00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:10.406\nAnd the idea of actually\nless obtuse language.\n\n59\n00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:13.398\nBut, for me,\nthis is where it begins to fall apart and\n\n60\n00:03:13.398 --> 00:03:16.801\nwhere I’ve actually had issues\nbefore in getting it set up.\n\n61\n00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:20.533\nSelect the AD FS server, okay, to use for\n\n62\n00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:25.768\nthe Web Application authentication and\nauthorization.\n\n63\n00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:30.185\nNow, Zach, when I read that,\nmy mind automatically says, yeah.\n\n64\n00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:35.905\nIt's gonna be my AD FS Server that I've\njust set up a couple of episodes ago.\n\n65\n00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:37.170\n&gt;&gt; That's what it sounds like to me,\nRonnie.\n\n66\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.813\n&gt;&gt; That's what would I think, right?\n\n67\n00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:41.192\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That this is what has to happen here.\n\n68\n00:03:41.192 --> 00:03:45.062\nBut if you put in the fully qualified\ndomain name of your AD FS server,\n\n69\n00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:46.280\nit's going to fail.\n\n70\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.869\nYeah, so go figure.\n\n71\n00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:52.313\nAnd the key here is that you have\nto understand what they mean by\n\n72\n00:03:52.313 --> 00:03:54.285\nfederation service name.\n\n73\n00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:58.398\nSo this idea of the federation service\nname means I have to go back and\n\n74\n00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:00.501\nfigure out what that actually is.\n\n75\n00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:06.266\nSo let me scroll back over here to\nmy AD FS server itself and login.\n\n76\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.888\nAnd in a moment, I was hoping that\nit would pop up, but there it is,\n\n77\n00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:15.738\nit's already just sitting there,\nthat's just me being silly.\n\n78\n00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:20.457\nThen I'm gonna click on Tools,\nand select AD FS Management,\n\n79\n00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:23.560\nthat's what I'm going to select here.\n\n80\n00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.172\nSo now that I have got that selected\nin AD FS, if I right click on AD FS,\n\n81\n00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:35.646\nI am looking for\nan Edit Federation Service Properties.\n\n82\n00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:37.940\nAnd it is here.\n\n83\n00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:43.628\nAnd look at this, Federation Service name.\n\n84\n00:04:43.628 --> 00:04:44.292\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n85\n00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:49.961\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so the name of my\nserver though is fs01.itpro.tv.\n\n86\n00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.563\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n87\n00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:56.045\n&gt;&gt; But notice this,\nthis is adfsitprodemo.com.\n\n88\n00:04:56.045 --> 00:05:02.939\nSo on this one, on the Web Access Proxy\nserver that we're doing, right?\n\n89\n00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.882\nFederation service name, that is what\nshould match up if you are not sure.\n\n90\n00:05:07.882 --> 00:05:12.703\nGo back over here, make sure you find\nthe Federation Services Proxy Dialog box.\n\n91\n00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:17.067\nLook for the federation service name okay,\nvery key.\n\n92\n00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:21.149\nIf not, it's not going to work as\nmuch as you want to cry and scream.\n\n93\n00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:24.619\nAnd I know, because I've done it myself,\nand yell at it.\n\n94\n00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:28.871\nSo it is here, we're gonna do\n\n95\n00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:33.640\nadfsitprotvdemo.com, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.492\nNow the other thing that it's asking for,\nwhich is a little bit stranger.\n\n97\n00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:43.452\nEnter the credentials of a local\nadministrator account on the federation\n\n98\n00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:44.652\nservers itself.\n\n99\n00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:46.461\nSo it's asking me for\n\n100\n00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:51.495\nthe local administrator credentials for\nthis guy, okay?\n\n101\n00:05:51.495 --> 00:05:54.770\nBecause it's joined to the domain itself,\n\n102\n00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.739\nI know that I can actually use just\na domain account as well, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:05.087\nitprotvdemo, I'm gonna backslash.\n\n104\n00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:09.951\nAnd for us the administrator is\nactually gonna be administrator, and\n\n105\n00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.998\nthe password is a secret password for\nus, and click Next.\n\n106\n00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:14.825\nAll right,\n\n107\n00:06:14.825 --> 00:06:19.962\nnow this is also something else that\ncan kinda be a little bit strange too.\n\n108\n00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.991\nSo it doesn't seem like that there's\na lot of strangeness to this.\n\n109\n00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:25.023\nBut to me at least,\nthe naming and stuff like that,\n\n110\n00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:27.501\nyou don't know where to look if\nyou don't know where to look.\n\n111\n00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:28.803\nAnd you're just gonna guess at it and\n\n112\n00:06:28.803 --> 00:06:31.038\nyou're gonna keep coming back\nto this until you figure it out.\n\n113\n00:06:31.038 --> 00:06:31.664\n&gt;&gt; I can see that.\n\n114\n00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:37.501\n&gt;&gt; But, here, select a certificate\nto be used by the AD FS Proxy, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.473\nSo now you actually see a whole bunch\nof these proxy things here, and\n\n116\n00:06:40.473 --> 00:06:42.311\nthat's because I had set this up before.\n\n117\n00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:44.436\nAnd it's now already\nestablishing some things.\n\n118\n00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:50.057\nI'm gonna look for the certificate\nthat I already put in here, okay?\n\n119\n00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:53.608\nThis is the one that I installed\nright on the server itself.\n\n120\n00:06:53.608 --> 00:06:57.927\nAnd it's also the one that I set up for\nthe proxy server itself.\n\n121\n00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:01.256\nThe set-webapplication\nproxy SSL certificate, and\n\n122\n00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:06.111\nI put that thumbprint in there, that's\nthe one that I had set up before, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:10.488\nSo, I want that, now,\nthere is a chance though, okay,\n\n124\n00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:14.972\nif you click on this, and\nno certificate appears, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:17.019\nIf you click on View, and\n\n126\n00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:23.076\nit doesn't give you the ability to\nlook in that certificate here, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:25.956\nSo if you don't have this,\nand it doesn't show you one,\n\n128\n00:07:25.956 --> 00:07:28.776\nmore than likely one of two\nthings is happening, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:29.958\n&gt;&gt; You haven't bought one yet.\n\n130\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.081\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n131\n00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:34.748\nyou may not have actually got one first,\nand maybe three things, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:34.748 --> 00:07:38.190\nThe other one, of course, is that\nwhen you installed this certificate,\n\n133\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.703\nyou didn't put it into\nthe right certificate store.\n\n134\n00:07:40.703 --> 00:07:44.753\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Possible but not super possible.\n\n135\n00:07:44.753 --> 00:07:48.943\nBecause even if you don't do\nthe command line that I did,\n\n136\n00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:53.496\nall you have to do is right-click\non it and tell it to install.\n\n137\n00:07:53.496 --> 00:07:57.417\nAnd it will install automatically in\nthe right place the majority of the time.\n\n138\n00:07:57.417 --> 00:08:02.348\nBut if that's already done, it might be\nthat you didn't set up that certificate to\n\n139\n00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:07.500\nbe used just like we did using the set\nweb application as a sales certificate.\n\n140\n00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.400\nSo those are usually the three elements\nthat will get you on this part.\n\n141\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.430\nSo if that just doesn't show up, I would\ncheck one of those three to help you out,\n\n142\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.170\nand then verify, of course, that it is\ninstalled, it is in the right location and\n\n143\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.950\nthat you did set it up to use\nwhat the ADFS proxy here, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.070\nSo right now, you can see here,\ncertificate is intended for\n\n145\n00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.720\nthe following purpose here.\n\n146\n00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:34.510\nEnsures the identity of a remote computer,\nproves your identity to a remote computer,\n\n147\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:40.232\nand even has these particular numbers\nhere as well issued to ADFS ITProTV demo,\n\n148\n00:08:40.232 --> 00:08:42.630\nand you can see it came from Komodo.\n\n149\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.380\nAnd there we go, so mine's actually\nvalid for about 90 days actually.\n\n150\n00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.970\nSo you might be wondering, why 90 days?\n\n151\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.870\nCuz it's just a-\n&gt;&gt; It's a trial certificate.\n\n152\n00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, usually they're valid for about\na year is what they're normally valid for.\n\n153\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.800\nSo just kinda realize you\ndo have that ability there.\n\n154\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.689\nSo that is the one that\nyou want showing up here.\n\n155\n00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:10.048\nI click Next, now you can see that\nwe could've done this all using,\n\n156\n00:09:10.048 --> 00:09:12.975\nwell, of course, the PowerShell.\n\n157\n00:09:12.975 --> 00:09:15.855\nAnd that's because in the background\nthat's exactly what it did using\n\n158\n00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:17.050\nthis utility.\n\n159\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.430\nIt said, hey you're trying to run\nthis command when you first selected\n\n160\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.220\nto configure and\nI brought you up the configuration wizard.\n\n161\n00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.130\nThen, it went ahead and said,\n\n162\n00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.578\nyou're gonna be setting up the\nFederationServiceTrustCredentialSystemMan-\n\n163\n00:09:31.578 --> 00:09:36.190\nagementAutomationPSCredentials, and\nhere is the certificate you're going to\n\n164\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.690\ninstall directly on here and\nhere's the federation service name.\n\n165\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:45.590\nBelieve it or not, fairly easy to actually\nget installed even using PowerShell.\n\n166\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.340\nJust pay attention to this.\n\n167\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.455\nInstall dash web application proxy,\nand then normally you just do a dash\n\n168\n00:09:51.455 --> 00:09:54.569\ncertificate thumbprint,\nput the thumbprint there.\n\n169\n00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:57.797\nAnd then, of course, the Federation\nService name and it's off and\n\n170\n00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:58.767\nready to go, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:02.869\nAll right, so from that point,\nI am going to select Configure.\n\n172\n00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:07.278\nNow in the end here, there's one\nof two things that's gonna happen.\n\n173\n00:10:07.278 --> 00:10:09.990\nIt's either gonna tell me,\nI can't do it, okay?\n\n174\n00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.980\nOr it's gonna say, hey,\nyou're successful at doing this.\n\n175\n00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.220\nSo this is really kind of the frustrating\nplace a lot of times because it means\n\n176\n00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.190\nsomewhere along the line in\nthe path of setting it up,\n\n177\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.270\nit didn't get set up correctly\nif it doesn't happen.\n\n178\n00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.950\nAnd that's what you have to\nactually be able to do here.\n\n179\n00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.852\nSo at the end when it's\nactually configuring,\n\n180\n00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:29.530\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n181\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.620\nBecause it is now talking with\nthe federation server, trying to validate\n\n182\n00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.955\nthe certificate, trying to get everything\nkind of going the way that we want to.\n\n183\n00:10:36.955 --> 00:10:40.400\nBut this is kind of the waiting game,\nand what we're actually looking for\n\n184\n00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.380\nat the end is either an error\nmessage that we can troubleshoot or\n\n185\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.210\nwe're actually looking for something that\ntells us we are gonna be successful.\n\n186\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.620\n&gt;&gt; And\nwe had a question in the chat from Doug.\n\n187\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.990\nHe said, is that a false configuration?\n\n188\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.830\nCan you address that now or\nlater on we'll look at it?\n\n189\n00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.790\n&gt;&gt; The false configuration,\nwhat we're doing right now, no.\n\n190\n00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.986\nThis is actually a real configuration.\n\n191\n00:10:57.986 --> 00:10:58.797\n&gt;&gt; It is, yeah.\n\n192\n00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:04.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're actually setting\nthis up right now and it just depends.\n\n193\n00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.860\nSo right now we're essentially\ntaking a long time.\n\n194\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.089\nThis is what we are looking for\nat the very end, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:14.425\nWeb application was\nconfigured successfully.\n\n196\n00:11:14.425 --> 00:11:15.666\n&gt;&gt; Hey.\n\n197\n00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:18.370\n&gt;&gt; So yes, that is what we're\nactually looking for here.\n\n198\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:18.960\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n199\n00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.940\nif the web application is now\nconfigured successfully, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.500\nWe can now close out of this,\nokay, and try and\n\n201\n00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.490\nverify that the configuration is going\nto work the way that we need to.\n\n202\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.580\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nhow are we gonna test this out?\n\n203\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.420\n&gt;&gt; Well there's a couple of\ndifferent ways we can test it out.\n\n204\n00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.880\nWe already showed previously where we said\nthat the federation server we knew was set\n\n205\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.540\nup correctly because we were\nusing the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n206\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.350\nIt said, I verify that I can connect\nusing this service token, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.330\nSo we know that that works.\n\n208\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.530\nBut the next step, of course, is actually\ntest if the web proxy server is working.\n\n209\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.580\nSo let's do this in\na couple of ways as well.\n\n210\n00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.400\nSo I'm gonna actually\nswitch off of my machine.\n\n211\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.034\nHere's what the end result product is,\nis it kicked me into, of course,\n\n212\n00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:06.330\nRemote Access Management Console and\nthe Web Application Proxy.\n\n213\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.140\nI'm not so worried about this right now,\nso I'm just gonna leave that one alone.\n\n214\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.340\nAnd let's switch back over to my\n\n215\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.510\ndomain controller here as being\na test machine just for a moment.\n\n216\n00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.801\nIf I can remember that password.\n\n217\n00:12:27.277 --> 00:12:29.220\nThere we go.\n\n218\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.190\nAnd the easiest way is simple.\n\n219\n00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:36.470\nWe want to verify that we can\nconnect to portal.office.com.\n\n220\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.050\nNow when I tried this during\nthe middle configuration,\n\n221\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.850\nI had the federation servers set up and\nwe tried to log in.\n\n222\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:49.277\nIt didn't let us and that's because it\nwas missing that component where when we\n\n223\n00:12:49.277 --> 00:12:54.873\ntried to connect in Office 365, it said\nlet me send you over to your own sign on.\n\n224\n00:12:54.873 --> 00:12:58.590\nYour own authentication server to get what\nwe need to cuz all we want is a token.\n\n225\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.759\nWe don't care that you\nare signing on to me.\n\n226\n00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:04.497\nJust bring us back the token\nwhen you talk to that guy, okay?\n\n227\n00:13:04.497 --> 00:13:08.706\nWell it didn't know how to reach us, and\nthe reason why is that it didn't have that\n\n228\n00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:11.092\nweb application proxy\nset up to connect then.\n\n229\n00:13:11.092 --> 00:13:15.668\nBut now if I do portal.office.com and\n\n230\n00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:21.637\nI press Enter,\nnow it's gonna lead me to a sign on.\n\n231\n00:13:21.637 --> 00:13:29.110\nWe'll do share@itprotvdemo.com and\nclick Next.\n\n232\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.470\nNotice it is taking me to my\norganization sign in page and\n\n233\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:38.100\nyou see now where it's directly\nleading me in the ITPro TV demo, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.380\nAt this particular point it's saying,\nhey are you sure you want to do this?\n\n235\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.410\nSo let's do share app ITproTV, oops,\n\n236\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.449\nif I had the spell here, demo.com11\n\n237\n00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:10.220\n[LAUGH] I think I actually just typed\nthat in incorrectly there at that point.\n\n238\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.358\nBut this one, if I actually would've\ntyped in the password correctly here,\n\n239\n00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:16.085\nit probably would've worked.\n\n240\n00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:17.516\nAnd you might be wondering like,\nhow did I know that?\n\n241\n00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:22.572\nCuz I've tried this before, it's wanting\nthat other one, that's probably why.\n\n242\n00:14:22.572 --> 00:14:27.297\nLet me change that around here,\nso let's do itprotvdemo.\n\n243\n00:14:27.297 --> 00:14:29.825\nI was like, why did that not work,\nI just did this.\n\n244\n00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:36.140\nSo this one should be Cherokee and then,\n\n245\n00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:54.348\nAll right, so it's not finding it there,\nbut the good thing is it will work.\n\n246\n00:14:54.348 --> 00:14:56.660\nLet me prove to you a different\nway instead of this.\n\n247\n00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.260\nSo somewhere along the line,\nI've kinda messed that one up in this way.\n\n248\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.940\nI'm gonna go to my own host machine and\njust launch up browser, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.120\nSo I'm on a Mac,\n\n250\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.300\nthis is outside of my own network at this\npoint in time and we'll do the same thing.\n\n251\n00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.325\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is in the virtual\nmachine at this point.\n\n252\n00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:16.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep,\nthis is not that same machine anymore.\n\n253\n00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.980\nAnd this is even on a different network,\n\n254\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.680\nthis is actually the network\nthat's supplied to, well,\n\n255\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.430\nour network right here and\nnot even my own virtual machine network.\n\n256\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.862\nSo if we try this again.\n\n257\n00:15:27.862 --> 00:15:29.681\n[LAUGH] At least I hope it works.\n\n258\n00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:38.419\nSo there it's actually able to redirect\nover to my own web application\n\n259\n00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:41.041\nproxy service at this point, okay?\n\n260\n00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:47.356\nJust trying to do that secret password,\n\n261\n00:15:50.722 --> 00:15:55.694\nSelecting and this is how you know that\nthe web application proxy works, okay?\n\n262\n00:15:55.694 --> 00:16:00.460\nI am now able to sign in,\nlet me not do that for right now, okay?\n\n263\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.951\nSo you are now able to see, here it is.\n\n264\n00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:04.536\nI am logged in as Cherokee.\n\n265\n00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:10.520\nCherokee's account essentially went when\nwe did this, right, went to Office 365.\n\n266\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.020\nOffice 365 says I\nrecognized your username.\n\n267\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.405\nThat should be redirected over to\nthis web application proxy server\n\n268\n00:16:17.405 --> 00:16:20.110\nADFS.ITProTv.demo.\n\n269\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.440\nIt found the DNS registration\nto send it there and\n\n270\n00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.120\nthen once it got there it is the web\napplication proxy server that was now also\n\n271\n00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.530\nconnected to the internal\nfederation server that\n\n272\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.900\nallowed the federation server to\nconnect over to the on premises.\n\n273\n00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:41.170\nActive Directory authorize that, send\nthat information back to the ADFS server.\n\n274\n00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.360\nIssue the token out and then the web\napplication proxy server says that,\n\n275\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.380\nhere's your token from outside network and\nwe can get access in, okay?\n\n276\n00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:56.390\nSo at this point, we do have where we\ncan access this from the outside and\n\n277\n00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.620\nthat's what the web application\nproxy server did for us.\n\n278\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.470\nNow on the inside where you saw me kinda\nflub it and it's probably because I was\n\n279\n00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.320\njust typing it too fast and it says,\nhey, you actually have a bad request.\n\n280\n00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.600\nIt's not saying that it's\nan issue on their end, right?\n\n281\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.460\nThe issue 400 is on my end,\nso somewhere along the way-\n\n282\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.740\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you fat fingered it.\n\n283\n00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.830\n&gt;&gt; Fat fingered it, or I just was\nnot typing in the correct format, or\n\n284\n00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.670\nthe request that I was trying to make.\n\n285\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.910\nIt didn't understand what I was\ntrying to do at that point.\n\n286\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.850\nBut if everything else is working, that\nmeans that the web application proxy is\n\n287\n00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.380\nset up correctly the way that we need to.\n\n288\n00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.425\nAnd that is the key, right?\n\n289\n00:17:30.425 --> 00:17:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's from the outside, we can get in,\n\n290\n00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.180\nand we now know that this particular\naccount is using that service access token\n\n291\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.720\nto make sure that everything is up and\ngoing as well, okay?\n\n292\n00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.070\nSo once that's done, and\nyou've got that set up and ready to go,\n\n293\n00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:50.240\nthere's a few other things that we have to\ntalk about when we get this done as well.\n\n294\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.920\nThis is as good of a system as it is and\n\n295\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.080\na lot of systems depend\non something like this.\n\n296\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.530\nZach, if there's a component that as solid\n\n297\n00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.590\nas this is cause it keeps us from\nhaving to worry about sending passwords\n\n298\n00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.790\nover to an unsecured domain somewhere or\nto across the internet somewhere,\n\n299\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:16.400\nthat the hard part about this though\nis a component of this breaks.\n\n300\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.400\nWell now I don't have access not only\nto internally on my network, but\n\n301\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.660\nI don't have access to Office 365 as well.\n\n302\n00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.530\nSo if somewhere along the line,\nlet's say that my Active Directory,\n\n303\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.440\nmy domain controllers, for one reason or\nanother lost their network connectivity,\n\n304\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.020\nsomebody unpulled,\nsomebody pulled the cable.\n\n305\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.930\nSomebody put the port that is on another\nview or whatever it's no longer worker.\n\n306\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:44.540\nWell now I have a bunch users that\ncan't get access to any place and\n\n307\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.120\nif we need access to Office 365,\nwe need to be able to do that.\n\n308\n00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.430\nWhat if we're actually migrating or we're\nactually upgrading internal components and\n\n309\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.310\nnow we've kind of moved something around,\nand this connection breaks.\n\n310\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.670\nNow we're in trouble.\n\n311\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:06.930\nSo Zach, this is a great setup, and it's\nsomething that organizations love to use.\n\n312\n00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.900\nBut the planning of this also includes\nwhat happens when disaster hits.\n\n313\n00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.920\nWhat do we have to do if this does\nnot work the way that we want it to?\n\n314\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.510\nAnd this is where we might actually\ntry to do two things here.\n\n315\n00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.220\nOne, is that we might actually\nimplement what we call some type of\n\n316\n00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:28.490\na passwords synchronization,\na temporary fall back situation.\n\n317\n00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.760\nIn other words, if it doesn't work there,\nlets get it to actually look for\n\n318\n00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.820\npasswords here and\nthen get it setup to ready to go.\n\n319\n00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.990\nWe need to talk about that idea of\nimplementing some type of password\n\n320\n00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.230\nsynchronization effort there.\n\n321\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.840\nThe other thing that we can do, of course,\nif we were ever not sure, is to migrate\n\n322\n00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.340\naway from the federation service itself\nand to go back to simply a managed type of\n\n323\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.870\nsituation where we're only managing let's\nsay password synchronization as well.\n\n324\n00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.300\nSo it just depends on what\nyou have to be able to do and\n\n325\n00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.670\nwhat you're willing to do as well.\n\n326\n00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.830\nSo that's what we want\nto take a look at too.\n\n327\n00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:14.940\nNow, what we're going to do of\ncourse is we are going to go to\n\n328\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.500\nour primary federation server here.\n\n329\n00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.550\nAnd remember that if you're doing this and\n\n330\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.460\nyou have multiple federation servers\nyou've gotten setup in a farm for\n\n331\n00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.100\nredundancy, one of them is gonna\nbecome the primary server.\n\n332\n00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.450\nYou're looking for that primary server.\n\n333\n00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.690\nFor me,\nit's just this one right here, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.590\nThis is my primary server.\n\n335\n00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.440\nIt is from here that I\ncan run PowerShell and\n\n336\n00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.250\nget connected to Microsoft\nonline to do what I need to do.\n\n337\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.582\nSo first thing I'm gonna\ndo is setup my credentials,\n\n338\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.288\nTo do so.\n\n339\n00:21:00.395 --> 00:21:01.256\nAnd then.\n\n340\n00:21:05.615 --> 00:21:06.520\nI have to remember.\n\n341\n00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.610\n&gt;&gt; So,\nRonnie now that we have the credentials.\n\n342\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.840\nWe're trying to connect now, right?\n\n343\n00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.700\nIs that it?\n\n344\n00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've kinda should asked\nthat question because we don't know\n\n345\n00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.540\nwhere we're connecting.\n\n346\n00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.320\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, the very fact is\n\n347\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.040\nam I trying to connect to\nthe federation server?\n\n348\n00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.720\nAm I trying to connect to office 365?\n\n349\n00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.510\nBecause we're normally\ntrying to access Office 365,\n\n350\n00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.770\nif something goes down,\nit's not really the federation service.\n\n351\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.360\nIt's going to be the Office 365 side.\n\n352\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.300\nSo we've got the credentials, now let's\ngo ahead and make that connection in.\n\n353\n00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.960\nI'm going to do a connect\ndash MSOL service,\n\n354\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.300\nthen I can even add in\na little verbose here.\n\n355\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.934\nTell it to select\nthe credentials hopefully.\n\n356\n00:21:47.156 --> 00:21:50.180\nCredential, now press Enter.\n\n357\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.870\nVerify that I am connected into\n\n358\n00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.170\nthe Microsoft online service\nat this particular point.\n\n359\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.770\nNow because we're dealing with the fact\nthat the federation server could be down,\n\n360\n00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.920\nor the Active Directory domain users and\ncomputers, in other words or\n\n361\n00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.710\ndomain controller could be down,\n\n362\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.310\nconnectivity issue whatever it might be\nyou just still need to get connected.\n\n363\n00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:16.160\nWhat I want to do is I want to pretty much\nimplement what we'll call a password sync,\n\n364\n00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.140\ntemporary type of fall back, okay?\n\n365\n00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the way that we do this,\n\n366\n00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:24.860\nthough, is not by leaving the federation\nserver in place right now,\n\n367\n00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.420\nas far as the federated identities here,\nwe need to do a convert command.\n\n368\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.380\nSo if I wanted to, and\nthis is only for this time, okay?\n\n369\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.677\nSo if I do a convert- MSOL\n\n370\n00:22:37.677 --> 00:22:42.512\ndomain Here.\n\n371\n00:22:46.704 --> 00:22:50.460\nNotice that I actually have two\ndifferent things that I have, okay?\n\n372\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.550\nSo I'm just actually kind of tabbing\nbetween them I have a convert MSL domain\n\n373\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:01.190\nto standard, and I have a convert MSL\ninto federated, I'm gonna say it wrong.\n\n374\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.790\nMSOL domain to federated, but\nright now mine is actually federated cuz I\n\n375\n00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.620\njust finished doing\neverything that I needed to.\n\n376\n00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.080\nI'm gonna need to convert this back\nto standard for a little bit of time.\n\n377\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.683\nThen I'm gonna select the domain name and\nthis is gonna be,\n\n378\n00:23:16.683 --> 00:23:21.203\nitprotvdemo.com.\n\n379\n00:23:21.203 --> 00:23:28.836\nAll right,\nI'm gonna do a -skipuserConversion,\n\n380\n00:23:28.836 --> 00:23:33.173\ncause I'm not really telling\n\n381\n00:23:33.173 --> 00:23:38.330\nit to actually convert anybody.\n\n382\n00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.180\nI'm just saying convert it to a domain\nright now, but leave the users alone.\n\n383\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.890\nSo I'm gonna do a true here.\n\n384\n00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:51.140\nThen I'm gonna issue a pass-password file.\n\n385\n00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:54.345\nAnd now, we're gonna locate\na password file somewhere else.\n\n386\n00:23:54.345 --> 00:23:55.895\nAnd let's call this one temppasswords.txt.\n\n387\n00:23:55.895 --> 00:24:02.049\nNow when we do something like this,\nwhat are we really doing?\n\n388\n00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:04.989\nWe're pretty much telling that\nat this particular point in\n\n389\n00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:06.470\ntime when I run this, right?\n\n390\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:12.280\nI don't really wanna convert the entire\ndomain over to standard permanently, okay?\n\n391\n00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.528\nWhat I'm actually implementing at this\npoint here is to convert it to standard\n\n392\n00:24:17.528 --> 00:24:22.454\njust for a temporary time, allow\nessentially the users not to worry about\n\n393\n00:24:22.454 --> 00:24:28.040\nusing the Federated services, but to have\na temporary password file here, okay.\n\n394\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.559\nSo yeah okay, temporary passwords file\nthat now, when users try to connect in,\n\n395\n00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:36.480\nthey'll go ahead and they’ll be able\nto actually log against this and\n\n396\n00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.680\nOffice 365 will check\nagainst this instead.\n\n397\n00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.206\nSo that's what we're\nactually telling it to do.\n\n398\n00:24:41.206 --> 00:24:44.754\nSo if I press enter there,\nit's not gonna run through them,\n\n399\n00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:47.410\nit's gonna take some time for us here.\n\n400\n00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:51.004\nIt's actually kind of bogging.\n\n401\n00:24:51.004 --> 00:24:53.116\nAnd the reason why, it's saying hey,\n\n402\n00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:57.340\nyou shouldn't do this as somebody inside\nthe organization, I should be doing\n\n403\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:00.552\nthis as a global administrator\naccount if I were to do this.\n\n404\n00:25:00.552 --> 00:25:04.460\nSo I'd log back in as global\nadministrator dot itpro.tv.\n\n405\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.970\nNow the reason why I didn't do this,\n\n406\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.917\nokay because I really didn't want to\nactually take the time to do that.\n\n407\n00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:12.010\nCuz there's one more command\nI want us to be able to run.\n\n408\n00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.567\nBut this is the command that you would run\nand instead in these credentials here.\n\n409\n00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:19.651\nWhat I should've actually mentioned is,\nthat's the account that you wanna use is\n\n410\n00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:22.060\nthe global administrator\ncredentials to do so.\n\n411\n00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:28.659\nAnd that's the account that set up the\nactual domain or the Office 365 itself.\n\n412\n00:25:28.659 --> 00:25:32.735\nSo that's the one that you wanna use\nbecause it doesn't want you to sign in\n\n413\n00:25:32.735 --> 00:25:34.512\nusing a particular username and\n\n414\n00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:38.030\npassword that's already inside\nthat may be affected by this.\n\n415\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.069\nOnce that is done and\nyou are now ready to go back,\n\n416\n00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:45.460\nin other words, you've verified\neverything is back up and working.\n\n417\n00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.301\nYou simply do a convert-msldomain,\n\n418\n00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:54.581\nwhich I can't spell domain\nto Federated again, and\n\n419\n00:25:54.581 --> 00:25:59.990\nthen you provide the domain\nname itprotvdemo.com.\n\n420\n00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:07.656\nAnd then you also want to do\nsupportmultipledomain or domains here.\n\n421\n00:26:07.656 --> 00:26:12.358\nI don't know if that's actually no it is,\nokay.\n\n422\n00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:16.945\nTo port multiple domains\nwith an s at the end.\n\n423\n00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:20.816\nI couldn't actually see\nit there with an s.\n\n424\n00:26:20.816 --> 00:26:23.290\nNow you’re probably saying,\nwhy would you do that?\n\n425\n00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.397\nBecause remember, we still need to have\neverybody connect in and I wanna add in\n\n426\n00:26:27.397 --> 00:26:31.380\norganizations later on that's doing\nthis or if I've already gone ahead and\n\n427\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.010\ncreated multiple federations,\npartner companies, everything.\n\n428\n00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.190\nI wanna make sure that everything\nis supported back through here.\n\n429\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.759\nSo that's why I need that last part, but\n\n430\n00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:41.844\nwe're just turning\nthe Federated Services back on.\n\n431\n00:26:41.844 --> 00:26:47.298\nSo this is good for that temporary fix,\nokay, in theory, right.\n\n432\n00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:51.412\nWhen our, on-premises domain\ncontroller isn't working and\n\n433\n00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:54.288\npeople still need access to Office 365.\n\n434\n00:26:54.288 --> 00:26:55.630\nThis will do so.\n\n435\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.985\nNow the problem though,\nZach, with this, is simple.\n\n436\n00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:01.972\nAll this takes time, so\nit's not gonna be seamless.\n\n437\n00:27:01.972 --> 00:27:06.782\nUser doesn't realize something is wrong,\nand so once you actually do that,\n\n438\n00:27:06.782 --> 00:27:10.560\nyou'll still need to verify and\nyou'll still need to test.\n\n439\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.321\nYou'll still need to do all that, but\nat that point it should end up working.\n\n440\n00:27:14.321 --> 00:27:18.666\nWhen you turn it back to Federated, that\nparticular temporary password file should\n\n441\n00:27:18.666 --> 00:27:22.822\nagain kind of be deleted, in other words,\nget rid of it, cuz you shouldn't have\n\n442\n00:27:22.822 --> 00:27:26.710\nanybody's passwords there for\nyou to kind of look at as well, okay.\n\n443\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.358\nSo just kinda realize that that's what\nwe're actually talking about when we\n\n444\n00:27:29.358 --> 00:27:30.386\nstart to do this here, okay.\n\n445\n00:27:30.386 --> 00:27:32.950\nSo that will help us\nto implement that too.\n\n446\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.035\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, would you say we're\ngonna make this permanent and\n\n447\n00:27:35.035 --> 00:27:37.132\nthen we're gonna switch it off,\nis that where we're going?\n\n448\n00:27:37.132 --> 00:27:39.801\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the very fact is,\nwith Federation Services,\n\n449\n00:27:39.801 --> 00:27:42.440\neverything kind of working\nthe way it is is fine.\n\n450\n00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.294\nIt's good,\nas long as your organization needs it, but\n\n451\n00:27:45.294 --> 00:27:47.978\nyou might find out where\nyou don't need it anymore.\n\n452\n00:27:47.978 --> 00:27:51.670\nAnd that means you are going\nto go ahead and switch it off.\n\n453\n00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.324\nSo, the commands that we want\nto be able to run here, right?\n\n454\n00:27:54.324 --> 00:27:58.086\nAnd so let's take a look at those domains,\nso I am gonna type in a get-domains,\n\n455\n00:27:58.086 --> 00:27:59.499\nhere, domain, sorry.\n\n456\n00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:06.755\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's a little bit of red there.\n\n457\n00:28:06.755 --> 00:28:11.604\n&gt;&gt; Get-msoldomain, I'm getting too\nexcited is what I'm actually doing, okay?\n\n458\n00:28:11.604 --> 00:28:15.860\nSo let me hit that so that all of that\nstuff is, actually let me do it this way.\n\n459\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.929\nThat's what happens when I\nget too excited here okay?\n\n460\n00:28:19.929 --> 00:28:21.641\nSo get-msoldomain,\n\n461\n00:28:21.641 --> 00:28:27.050\nI don't know why I can't remember\nthe MSOL, it should be fine.\n\n462\n00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.272\nRemember when we talked about that\nidea where we turned it back on and\n\n463\n00:28:30.272 --> 00:28:31.638\nwe setup multiple domains?\n\n464\n00:28:31.638 --> 00:28:32.278\nThis is why.\n\n465\n00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:36.020\nThese are the multiple domains here that\nwe might be able to support one day.\n\n466\n00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.820\nAnd you'll see there's two\ntypes of authentication for us.\n\n467\n00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.400\nThere's the federated and\nthen there's a standard.\n\n468\n00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.646\nStandard is really these two managed ones\nthat we have right now as well, okay.\n\n469\n00:28:45.646 --> 00:28:50.468\nSo if I want to convert ITPRO.TV\ndemo back to a standard, okay and\n\n470\n00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:53.448\njust kinda say hey, from this point on,\n\n471\n00:28:53.448 --> 00:28:57.795\nwe're not gonna do the federated\nsingle sign-on stuff.\n\n472\n00:28:57.795 --> 00:29:00.238\nWe would, again, plan that out,\n\n473\n00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:05.144\ntake a look at how long it's gonna\ntake for us to get everything done.\n\n474\n00:29:05.144 --> 00:29:12.290\nBut the end result of what we would add\nnow is set, MsolDomainAuthentication.\n\n475\n00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.712\nThen we would change\nthe authentication here to,\n\n476\n00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:18.321\nmanaged, is what we would do, okay?\n\n477\n00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:25.154\nAnd that point,\nit would be domainname itprotvdemo,\n\n478\n00:29:25.154 --> 00:29:30.210\nwhich I can't spell, demo.com okay.\n\n479\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.700\nSo that would be the actual\ncommand that we would run.\n\n480\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.580\nThere's a few other things that\nI still need to show in terms of\n\n481\n00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:37.900\nwhat we have to do.\n\n482\n00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.631\nWhere a little bit of troubleshooting\nas well so at this point,\n\n483\n00:29:40.631 --> 00:29:43.271\nI'm just gonna show you\nthe commands instead of running it.\n\n484\n00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:46.029\nOkay, so\nthat we can actually still use everything.\n\n485\n00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:47.530\nNow can I convert it back?\n\n486\n00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.839\nYes, but I don't want to by chance\nmess something up for right now and\n\n487\n00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:55.970\nmake it not work in the future for\nall the things that we have to do.\n\n488\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.988\nBut this is something that you can\ndo if you're starting to think about\n\n489\n00:29:58.988 --> 00:30:01.406\ndisabling the Federated Server and\nturning it back in.\n\n490\n00:30:01.406 --> 00:30:04.920\nMake sure you take a look\nat this command as well.\n\n491\n00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.931\nIf you only need a temporary\nfallback solution because\n\n492\n00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:11.269\nyou're having to troubleshoot\nthe Federated Service, but\n\n493\n00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:14.486\nit's still not working even\nthough you've got it set up.\n\n494\n00:30:14.486 --> 00:30:18.584\nThen you can use the other one where we\nare implementing that temporary password\n\n495\n00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:20.390\nsync with a password file.\n\n496\n00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:25.790\nThen we're gonna run that other command\nwhere we converted it to the standard,\n\n497\n00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.370\nand then we used a password\nfile at the end.\n\n498\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.614\nSo those are really two different\ntroubleshooting things that we can do when\n\n499\n00:30:32.614 --> 00:30:36.009\nour Federated Services begins\nto show some other troubles.\n\n500\n00:30:36.009 --> 00:30:41.614\nNow of course in terms of just\ntalking about just troubleshooting,\n\n501\n00:30:41.614 --> 00:30:44.267\nmake sure that if you haven’t,\n\n502\n00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:49.920\ntake a look at your Federation Services\nevent logs too, okay.\n\n503\n00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.150\nSo do not overlook these event logs.\n\n504\n00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.550\nAnd you'll see I have\nseveral warnings here, but\n\n505\n00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:58.280\na lot of them have also dissipated, too.\n\n506\n00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.012\nAnd the other one, of course,\nis the Event Manager.\n\n507\n00:31:01.012 --> 00:31:05.290\nNow I haven't spent a lot of time\non this particular issue here.\n\n508\n00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.029\nBut if you're going to take a look\nat your Federation Services,\n\n509\n00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:13.736\nyou can expand out Application and\nService Logs.\n\n510\n00:31:13.736 --> 00:31:19.453\nAnd then ADFS here and Admin, and\nthis will actually let you know whether or\n\n511\n00:31:19.453 --> 00:31:22.464\nnot everything is good, so here it is.\n\n512\n00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.286\nADFS detected,\n\n513\n00:31:23.286 --> 00:31:28.050\nall service certificates have appropriate\naccess given to the ADFS service account.\n\n514\n00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.936\nBut I do have a warning, and this one\nis saying hey, not all of the actual\n\n515\n00:31:32.936 --> 00:31:37.762\nUPN suffixes, right, values exist\nin this particular enterprise.\n\n516\n00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:40.907\nIt's balking at the very fact I\nstill have that on Microsoft.\n\n517\n00:31:40.907 --> 00:31:43.935\nI didn't actually have a certificate for\nit as well, but\n\n518\n00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:48.240\nyou can see where you can start to take\na look especially looking for errors here.\n\n519\n00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:53.128\nAnd even these warnings may help to\ngive you a little bit more time to take\n\n520\n00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:57.890\na look and verify that ADFS is\nworking the way that you want to.\n\n521\n00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.435\nSo in these last few episodes here,\n\n522\n00:31:59.435 --> 00:32:02.380\nZach, we've actually implemented\nthat web access proxy server.\n\n523\n00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:07.054\nWe've verified that it worked, and we're\nnow going in and just kind of saying,\n\n524\n00:32:07.054 --> 00:32:08.978\nsometimes even after the set up,\n\n525\n00:32:08.978 --> 00:32:12.705\nwe might find out that we have to\nkind of temporarily disable it.\n\n526\n00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:16.670\nOr we may even prepare to, after a while,\nsay we don't want that anymore.\n\n527\n00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.226\nLet's go ahead and move just off of that.\n\n528\n00:32:19.226 --> 00:32:22.443\nThat is the end result command,\nbut there's a lot of planning for\n\n529\n00:32:22.443 --> 00:32:23.507\nthat dash to happen.\n\n530\n00:32:23.507 --> 00:32:26.536\nSo think about all the stuff that's\ntied in, and then whether or\n\n531\n00:32:26.536 --> 00:32:29.240\nnot you're actually ready\nto separate everything out.\n\n532\n00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.820\nSo there's a little bit more for\nus to actually do there.\n\n533\n00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:36.166\nBut at least from this point,\nwe are now ready and set up for\n\n534\n00:32:36.166 --> 00:32:39.280\nFederation Services and that identity.\n\n535\n00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.119\nAnd that's probably what you'll actually\nsee in most organizations that are trying\n\n536\n00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.210\nto get this thing setup is this\nis the way it's gonna operate.\n\n537\n00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.424\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you Ronnie,\nconfigure web access proxy, great episode.\n\n538\n00:32:49.424 --> 00:32:52.674\nMake sure you catch all\nthe episodes from before, and yet\n\n539\n00:32:52.674 --> 00:32:57.520\nyou to come because you will be very glad\nthat Office 365 does a wonderful job.\n\n540\n00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.845\nAnd check out all of the other\nvideos in our course library.\n\n541\n00:32:59.845 --> 00:33:01.058\nThere’s hundreds of

forward with learning\na little bit more about, of course, well,\n\n14\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.900\nOffice 365, and we've already done a lot,\nZach, during this entire series.\n\n15\n00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.790\nAnd kind of the last\nthird of what we've done\n\n16\n00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.800\nis really about setting up of course ADFS,\nthe Active Directory Federation Services,\n\n17\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.770\nas well as using this with Office 365.\n\n18\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.720\nAnd producing a single sign on\nis what we've actually done.\n\n19\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.690\nSo when you actually\ngot all that setup and\n\n20\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.080\none of the last things that we\ndid once we got everything setup.\n\n21\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.436\nOf course is that we tested it, and we\nwere actually able to verify that we could\n\n22\n00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:07.011\nget in using the federation service\nusing the web proxy server.\n\n23\n00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:09.680\nEverything that was setup\nthe way that we want to.\n\n24\n00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680\nSo now when we start talking about\nthe customization what are we\n\n25\n00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.210\nreally talking about and\nwhy does it really matter.\n\n26\n00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.563\nIt really doesn't matter per se in terms\nof the functionality of things, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:26.317\nBut it does matter if you're really\nsetting this up for your own company and\n\n28\n00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:29.177\nyou wanna make sure that everybody,\nthat's using it for\n\n29\n00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:33.490\nyour company, feels like it's customized,\nthat it was designed for your company.\n\n30\n00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.040\nThat it came from your company, that's\nwhat this particular episode is about that\n\n31\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.400\nwe're gonna take a look at and see.\n\n32\n00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.810\nThere are different customization options,\nbut before we do that, let's go ahead and\n\n33\n00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.570\nshow you what we normally actually did\nsee when we first signed in, okay?\n\n34\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.280\nSo right now, currently right,\n\n35\n00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.260\nwe want to make sure that we have kind of\nwhere our are bearings are right, okay?\n\n36\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.070\nSo we have our on-premises\nActive Directory server set up.\n\n37\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.350\nWe also have our ADFS server, right?\n\n38\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.570\nThat we have ready to go, our federation\nserver, and I've only got one,\n\n39\n00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.370\nbut we have that set up.\n\n40\n00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.370\nWe also have the web access proxy\nthat is also set up for us as well.\n\n41\n00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.717\nSo that means that every time that I\nwant to log into ITProTV Demo's Office\n\n42\n00:02:18.717 --> 00:02:25.115\n365 account, what it's gonna do, it's\ngonna redirect me to the web access proxy.\n\n43\n00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:28.531\nAnd then that is gonna get\nauthenticated through the ADFS back to\n\n44\n00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:30.590\nthe Active Directory On-premises.\n\n45\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.350\nAnd then I'll be issued a token\nto get access into Office 365.\n\n46\n00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.250\nSo if I'm coming from\nthe outside of that network.\n\n47\n00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.370\nThat's what's gonna happen.\n\n48\n00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.210\nSo let's go to my computer here for a\nmoment and this is on my own host machine.\n\n49\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.910\nI'm working on the ITProTV network.\n\n50\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.830\nNow the ITProTV network is\noutside the ITProTV demo network.\n\n51\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.220\nSo this means it's gonna\ngo outside my firewall.\n\n52\n00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.340\nIt's gonna come back in and\n\n53\n00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.540\nit's gonna find exactly what we need to,\nand then that's what's gonna happen.\n\n54\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.210\nSo if I try and\ndo just a regular sign on here,\n\n55\n00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.870\nto portal.office.com and I press Enter.\n\n56\n00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.280\nYou'll see that I've been testing\nwith Cherokee's account so\n\n57\n00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.860\nhers is already there and\nwaiting to go, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.580\nSo at this point I pick this account,\nand notice what it actually says.\n\n59\n00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.296\nSo from the outside, right, it is\ngoing out and it's coming back in and\n\n60\n00:03:23.296 --> 00:03:25.114\nit's finding now, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:29.829\nAdd public IP address where my\nweb access proxy server is and\n\n62\n00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.470\nthat is the server it ended up hitting.\n\n63\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.250\nAnd then from that point,\nnotice this page right here.\n\n64\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.485\nIt's not a bad looking page,\nit's actually quite serene.\n\n65\n00:03:40.485 --> 00:03:42.098\nIt kind of leads you to some peace.\n\n66\n00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:43.550\n&gt;&gt; It's calming and blue.\n\n67\n00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.860\n&gt;&gt; It is kind of bluish and calming.\n\n68\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.600\nBut it's a generic page, okay?\n\n69\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.860\nIt's what Microsoft says, at least let's\nstart off with something fairly generic,\n\n70\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.720\nsomething fairly nice\nthat people can then,\n\n71\n00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.230\nat that point if they choose to, customize\nsome of the elements that you see on here.\n\n72\n00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.250\nSo for example,\nover on the left hand side over here.\n\n73\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.190\nWe can customize this as well.\n\n74\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.821\nNow I don't have a picture, but\n\n75\n00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:12.397\nif I wanted to post a picture let's\nsay of my workplace I could do that.\n\n76\n00:04:12.397 --> 00:04:14.540\nYou might wonder like\ncan that really be done?\n\n77\n00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.280\nYes it can,\n\n78\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.410\nyou can do it through of course, Office\n365 itself inside the portal management.\n\n79\n00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.190\nWe're gonna do it through PowerShell\nbecause that's where they tend\n\n80\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.490\nto see a lot more, so\nwe're gonna do it that way instead.\n\n81\n00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, we could even put a picture\nof you up there couldn't we?\n\n82\n00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.355\n&gt;&gt; We could but that would be dangerous.\n\n83\n00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:31.352\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To actually do something like that,\n\n84\n00:04:31.352 --> 00:04:35.610\nthey would try to get people to never sign\nin to their Office 365 account again.\n\n85\n00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.068\nBut overall though,\n[LAUGH] from this point right,\n\n86\n00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:40.649\nwe could actually put that image and\nwe could do that.\n\n87\n00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:44.104\nEven at ITProTV,\nwhen I sign in to our ITProTV account, is\n\n88\n00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:49.310\nactually the front image, the front door\nof our building is what actually shows.\n\n89\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.230\nSo, that way I know that if this is\nmy first or second time using this.\n\n90\n00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.289\nSign in here, yeah,\nthat's the building that I went in to.\n\n91\n00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.980\nIt's my first or second day,\nI know exactly where it is.\n\n92\n00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.490\nSo we can customize something like that.\n\n93\n00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.760\nWe can also, of course,\n\n94\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.000\ncustomize even this element right here\nif we wanted to, to be able to do this.\n\n95\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.310\nWe can add our own logo in there.\n\n96\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.093\nSo if I had a professional logo or if\nsomebody actually knew how to do a logo,\n\n97\n00:05:15.093 --> 00:05:16.843\nme, I don't know how to do a logo.\n\n98\n00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:20.505\nBut if I wanted to, I could change\nthis and add in a logo if I wanted to.\n\n99\n00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:25.750\nI could even change the sign in\nwith your organizational account.\n\n100\n00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.930\nWe can add in more elements here too,\neven at the bottom of the page down here.\n\n101\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.490\nLet me see if I can zoom in so\nthat we can see it.\n\n102\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.510\nA little bit better.\n\n103\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.120\nRight here, I can remove this\nparticular copyright if I wanted to.\n\n104\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.330\nAll of that's actually very important\nthat we can actually be able to do.\n\n105\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.850\nAnd I can even add additional elements.\n\n106\n00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.480\nIf I wanted to add in a link for\nmy help desk page, I could do that.\n\n107\n00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.270\nIf I wanted to add in another link for\nprivacy information, as well or\n\n108\n00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.740\neven leading me to the home\npage of my own website.\n\n109\n00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.625\nI could add all that in there\nright here on this sign in page to\n\n110\n00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:06.180\nmake it customized, so\n\n111\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.104\nthat when you go here this is where you\nare going to end up seeing is not this.\n\n112\n00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:17.050\nBut perhaps a customized web page or\na customized sign in page instead.\n\n113\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.690\nSo all those are elements and\nthere's actually even more, but\n\n114\n00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.230\nwe'll get to that a little bit later.\n\n115\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.520\nI just wanted at least get a started and\n\n116\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.160\nunderstanding what we're actually\ncustomizing from this point, okay?\n\n117\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.300\nSo now that you understand somebody's\nelements that we can do, I wanted us to,\n\n118\n00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.600\nof course, just at least get a couple\nof things that we could change.\n\n119\n00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.686\nSo let's take a look at this,\nactually this one,\n\n120\n00:06:39.686 --> 00:06:43.813\nyou can see where I've actually\nmisspelled it right here, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:43.813 --> 00:06:48.280\nSo notice this one is itrprotvdemo.\n\n122\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.501\nSo somewhere along the line\nwhen I was setting this up,\n\n123\n00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.460\nI actually mistyped it\nright there as well.\n\n124\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.460\nSo we can change that and get some of\nthe other things there if we want to, but\n\n125\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.060\nthose are some of\nthe one's that we wanna do.\n\n126\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.790\nSo we're gonna change the company name on\nour sign in page is what we're gonna do to\n\n127\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.910\nhelp us to get started, right?\n\n128\n00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.360\nSo I'm going to hopefully, let me see if I\ncan actually scroll to the right one here,\n\n129\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.380\nI'm gonna scroll over to my\nActive Direct Federation Server.\n\n130\n00:07:20.342 --> 00:07:23.768\nAnd from here, I've got PowerShell launch\nstop cuz I knew we're going to be doing\n\n131\n00:07:23.768 --> 00:07:24.850\nthis some PowerShell.\n\n132\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.780\n&gt;&gt; Right often.\n&gt;&gt; I want to have an launch stop\n\n133\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.892\nin as the Administrator at this point.\n\n134\n00:07:28.892 --> 00:07:33.560\nAnd so working with the PowerShell right,\ngetting everything set up.\n\n135\n00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.150\nI had made an assumptions Zach,\nthat we need to go ahead and\n\n136\n00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.830\nconnect into Microsoft Office Online.\n\n137\n00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.277\nNow, there's Office 365.\n\n138\n00:07:43.277 --> 00:07:48.010\nBut we really don't have to since the\nconfiguration is on my own ADFS server.\n\n139\n00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.416\nI really don't have to worry about that.\n\n140\n00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:53.534\nSo, from here, I can just launch this and\n\n141\n00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:59.780\ndo a Set-AdfsGlobal, and\nI'm gonna use the tab, autofill.\n\n142\n00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.660\nAnd what I'm looking for\nis the GlobalwebContent.\n\n143\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.151\nFrom that point I can add in options.\n\n144\n00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:11.928\nI can do a -CompanyName and\ninstead of the I-T-R-P-R-O that\n\n145\n00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:18.658\nI had at some point when I typed that\nthing in, I can do inside of quotes here.\n\n146\n00:08:18.658 --> 00:08:23.582\nITPROTVDEMO and I can do a .com, so\n\n147\n00:08:23.582 --> 00:08:31.050\njust to try to add that in\nhere to make it work right.\n\n148\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.330\nSo now that I've got that done at this\npoint of course what we would want to do\n\n149\n00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:41.090\nis also take a moment here and\nrestart the service as well.\n\n150\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.830\nSo I've already pulled\nup the Server Manager.\n\n151\n00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.170\nWe can, of course,\ndo this from PowerShell as well.\n\n152\n00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.050\nBut if I can scroll down over here,\n\n153\n00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.730\nI can also see that the service is\ncurrently running, which is what we want.\n\n154\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.530\nAnd if you're like me,\n\n155\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.480\nsometimes you don't realize all\nthe ways that you can do things.\n\n156\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.730\nI didn't realize I could just right-click\non this thing and Restart the Services.\n\n157\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.500\nSo I just wanted to show you another\noption that we could do as well, okay?\n\n158\n00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.328\nSo hopefully that will actually restart\neverything the way that we want it to.\n\n159\n00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:14.320\nAnd now, for us,\nthat particular information should change.\n\n160\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.275\nInstead of doing this thing one at a time,\n\n161\n00:09:17.275 --> 00:09:21.418\nI'm gonna add in a couple of\nother ones to help us out here.\n\n162\n00:09:21.418 --> 00:09:23.596\nBut actually, let's go ahead and\nsee it, why not?\n\n163\n00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:26.160\nI don't see why we can't do this.\n\n164\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.070\nI'm gonna get a new window.\n\n165\n00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.553\nAnd everything else should\nbe ready to go here, so\n\n166\n00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:39.630\nif I do portal.office.com.\n\n167\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.380\nSo Cherokee's account again,\n\n168\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.590\nlet's see what happens when it takes\nus to the organization sign on page.\n\n169\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.440\nAnd notice right away\nyou can see right there,\n\n170\n00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.690\nwhere a change from the ITRPRO, the wrong\nthing that I had when I first set this up.\n\n171\n00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.300\nThat's cuz I'm blind,\nis what ended up happening.\n\n172\n00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.180\nI didn't even see it during the whole\ntime we are doing the Active Directory\n\n173\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.060\nfederation services.\n\n174\n00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.669\n&gt;&gt; So my question to you at this point\nwould be, would you consider, I mean,\n\n175\n00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:10.418\nall the customization you need to be\ndoing you should do that in PowerShell?\n\n176\n00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:13.011\nIs that what you're saying or?\n\n177\n00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the majority you don't\nhave to do in PowerShell, but for\n\n178\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.560\nthe exam I would make sure I take\na look at the PowerShell lines.\n\n179\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.230\nMake sure you understand that.\n\n180\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.690\nRemember that,\nif anything can be done in PowerShell and\n\n181\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.960\njust about everything can\nbe done in PowerShell.\n\n182\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.770\nBut at least something as simple as this,\n\n183\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.920\nbeing able to recognize which of the\nfollowing is gonna help you to do that.\n\n184\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.990\nEspecially in PowerShell is gonna\nhelp you out in getting ready for\n\n185\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.770\nthe exam as well, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.661\nSo the other thing that we can do, and\n\n187\n00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:41.991\nif I had a logo that\nwould actually help here.\n\n188\n00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:47.450\nBut we can also add in\na company logo to this as well.\n\n189\n00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.750\nAnd I don't think I actually have a logo.\n\n190\n00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.470\nBut let me show you the command\nline to do something like this,\n\n191\n00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.740\nis what I want to do here.\n\n192\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.780\nSo I need to flip back through here,\nokay, to help us out as well.\n\n193\n00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.910\nSo the next one here would be where we at,\nso do a set, and\n\n194\n00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.190\nis pretty much the same\ncommand except now,\n\n195\n00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.380\nwe're gonna change this for\nour sign in description a little bit.\n\n196\n00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.330\nSo I am gonna do the set\nGlobalwebContent here, and\n\n197\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.710\nI am gonna type SignInPageDescriptionText.\n\n198\n00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.140\nAnd at this point inside\nof the parentheses here,\n\n199\n00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.820\nwe are also gonna need to also\nadd in a the less than and\n\n200\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.030\nthen p, and then close that\noff our little paragraph here.\n\n201\n00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:42.350\nAnd type sign in to ITPROTVDEMO.\n\n202\n00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.230\nOops, if I can spell.\n\n203\n00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.733\nRequires something like,\n\n204\n00:11:56.733 --> 00:12:01.626\nlet's see, username and password.\n\n205\n00:12:01.626 --> 00:12:05.769\nSomething like that.\n\n206\n00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:09.397\nAll right.\n\n207\n00:12:09.397 --> 00:12:14.097\nNow the other thing that we can also do is\nthat you can actually tell it to actually\n\n208\n00:12:14.097 --> 00:12:17.200\ndo some different actions if you want to.\n\n209\n00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.985\nSo you can actually even do something\nlike this where you can check, click.\n\n210\n00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:26.270\n[LAUGH] And we're gonna do\njust a reference here a href.\n\n211\n00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:34.944\nEquals, and at this point,\nyou would also put in your\n\n212\n00:12:34.944 --> 00:12:41.080\nparticular ADFS server reference\nif you were to do this.\n\n213\n00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.930\nNow mine, I'm not exactly sure cuz\nI don't really have anything to\n\n214\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.700\nmake this work officially.\n\n215\n00:12:51.382 --> 00:12:55.758\nActually this is gonna be fs01-itpro\n\n216\n00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:02.221\nTvdemo.com.\n\n217\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.520\nAnd then you would have the other thing,\n\n218\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.400\nso the one that I'm copying\nhere is device registration.\n\n219\n00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.190\nIs what it's gonna be.\n\n220\n00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:18.331\nSingle quote.\n\n221\n00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:23.420\nWe can tell them to actually click here.\n\n222\n00:13:25.227 --> 00:13:26.450\nClose that out.\n\n223\n00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:33.930\nWith an a for more information.\n\n224\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.623\nOops, this is where I do not know my,\n[LAUGH] my HTML.\n\n225\n00:13:43.343 --> 00:13:44.732\nFor more information.\n\n226\n00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:57.240\nOnce again just closing out\nthe paragraph Something like that.\n\n227\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.280\nNow I may get red alert cuz I don't know\nif I've typed in everything correctly\n\n228\n00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.240\nbecause I can't really see\neverything really easily.\n\n229\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.320\nBut if accepts it and\n\n230\n00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.220\neverything is actually ready to go then\nthis would also add in the change.\n\n231\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.020\nNow, I don't exactly have\neverything set up, but\n\n232\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.950\nlets see what it actually\ngives us as we've done this.\n\n233\n00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.470\nI'm going to restart that web\nservice again, just in case,\n\n234\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.640\nand just let it kind of let\nit finish what we need to do.\n\n235\n00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.560\nNow we'll take a look from\nthe outside once again.\n\n236\n00:14:40.844 --> 00:14:42.194\nLet's see what it gets us.\n\n237\n00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.001\nSo here you can see where it\nchanged the information and\n\n238\n00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:51.700\nadded it in right down here, okay?\n\n239\n00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.470\nSo you can see where we're continuing\nto change this and add in even more and\n\n240\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.350\nmore information to do so.\n\n241\n00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.770\nCustomizing it with the company\nlogo helps to provide a little bit\n\n242\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.840\nmore customization.\n\n243\n00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.090\nNow if you're saying, Ronnie,\nwhere in the world do I get all this stuff\n\n244\n00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.750\nthat you're talking\nabout to be able to do?\n\n245\n00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.870\nThe great thing is,\nI actually have a link for\n\n246\n00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:17.330\nyou that will be also\nin our show notes too.\n\n247\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.538\nAnd this is, of course, from what\nWindows itself, so the IT Pro Center,\n\n248\n00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:27.950\nADFS user signin customization and we just\ndid a couple of these is what I did, okay?\n\n249\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.910\nSo right here at the top, let me leave\nthat so if you have to be trying to\n\n250\n00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:36.530\nwrite furiously right across the top\nthere, I'll leave it for a second.\n\n251\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.781\nBut this is kind of one of the pages\nthat gives you just about every\n\n252\n00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:45.190\nPowerShell command that you want to\nbe able to think about and do and\n\n253\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.731\nget ready for the exam as well, okay?\n\n254\n00:15:47.731 --> 00:15:48.610\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful.\n\n255\n00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.680\n&gt;&gt; So that was a good one and\nyou will see those in the show notes.\n\n256\n00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.260\nIt'll be a clickable link that will\nbring you directly to this page.\n\n257\n00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.391\nNow, if by scrolling down here, I didn't\nwanna do everything cuz I was like,\n\n258\n00:15:58.391 --> 00:16:00.110\nthis stuff you should explore on your own.\n\n259\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:04.097\nBut just like I pointed out,\nadding in your own company logo, change\n\n260\n00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:08.938\nthe illustration that you have, Sign-in\ndescription, home and privacy links.\n\n261\n00:16:08.938 --> 00:16:11.674\nBut if you continue to\nscroll down through here,\n\n262\n00:16:11.674 --> 00:16:14.390\nyou can see there's actually a lot more.\n\n263\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.810\nThe one thing I didn't talk about was\neven right down here at the bottom,\n\n264\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.540\nI mentioned it at the beginning of\nthe show about the 2016 Microsoft.\n\n265\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.490\nThat's the one that's\nshowing on my page here.\n\n266\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.910\nAnd I can even remove that.\n\n267\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.050\nNow, I would think, okay, well,\nthat doesn't sound too difficult.\n\n268\n00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.650\nCuz I thought, well,\nlet's do that one for the show, but\n\n269\n00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.220\nthen I started to look into this one.\n\n270\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.960\nAnd when I clicked on that link,\nI was like this is great.\n\n271\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.600\nIt shows you step by step, which is great.\n\n272\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.620\nBut then I started saying, okay, so\nnow we're gonna create a custom theme,\n\n273\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.550\nwe're gonna export the theme by\nspecifying an output folder, and\n\n274\n00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.820\nthen we're gonna add in all of this.\n\n275\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.867\nAnd now all the sudden I was like let's\nlet's you do that one on your own.\n\n276\n00:16:56.867 --> 00:16:58.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can do that.\n\n277\n00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.597\nAnd that was just for\nsimply removing the copy.\n\n278\n00:17:01.597 --> 00:17:04.681\nThis is not for, the lines that we did,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n279\n00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:08.491\nit's bad enough that you had to watch\nme type, but this you would have had to\n\n280\n00:17:08.491 --> 00:17:11.780\nactually watch me go my gosh,\nlook at all this other stuff.\n\n281\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.080\nAt the end the result would right here.\n\n282\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:19.730\nSo this is a great web page for you to\nhave a resource as you're getting ready.\n\n283\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.850\nThe most common ones are kind of of\nthe ones we did, okay, right there, right?\n\n284\n00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.830\nChanging the company name.\n\n285\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.580\nAdding in a particular description\nthe way that you want to.\n\n286\n00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.730\nAnd even adding in some additional\nlinks which we didn't actually do.\n\n287\n00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.840\nBut you can add in these help desk links\nthat appear at the bottom of the page.\n\n288\n00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.020\nOr a home page link if you want to,\nor a privacy link.\n\n289\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.460\nAll that's actually very good\nthat you can also add in\n\n290\n00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.496\nthat will help you out as well, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:52.380\nBut taking a look at information like this\nand the customization, that will at least\n\n292\n00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.270\nget you started when you are actually\ngoing to have to take a look\n\n293\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.130\nat do you want to just work with the\ngeneric or would you rather be customized?\n\n294\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:05.650\nAnd if you wanted to be customized,\nall of these will lead you exactly in\n\n295\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.790\nhow that's going to be done and\nyou'll actually be able to follow.\n\n296\n00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.970\nSo here, on this one on the privacy link,\n\n297\n00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.450\nyou can see it's not\nvery difficult at all.\n\n298\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.010\nYou just replace your particular\nlink with what you want to here, and\n\n299\n00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:23.270\nyour own servers, and then you'll be ready\nto go and operational as well, okay?\n\n300\n00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.500\nSo it is very nice.\n\n301\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.120\nIt is a called out objective\non the exam itself.\n\n302\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.130\nSo when you go did we really\nneed to spend time doing this?\n\n303\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.630\nYes.\n\n304\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.060\nIt is one of those unusual things when\nthey call it out, and that's specific, and\n\n305\n00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.060\nyou go, really,\nare people going to want t do this?\n\n306\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.130\nThere's one thing that they really wanna\ndo is customize that particular interface\n\n307\n00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.560\nto make that happen.\n\n308\n00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.460\nSo remember, just like I did, because\nwe've been connecting to MSOL online for\n\n309\n00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:57.440\neverything, I automatically assumed that I\nhad to connect there as well to do this.\n\n310\n00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.880\nBut you don't, you just have\nto work with the local server.\n\n311\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.040\nSo go to your ADFS server, and\nwhen you do that, at that point\n\n312\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.340\nyou can customize it directly from there\nand the changes happen immediately.\n\n313\n00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.160\nThe thing that you shouldn't forget,\n\n314\n00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.490\nand even though it doesn't state\nit in every part, I go ahead and\n\n315\n00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.420\nI restart the service after I make\nthe customization just to make sure.\n\n316\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.368\nNow, does that mean you should do\nthis during a regular business day?\n\n317\n00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:23.098\nNo, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:23.098 --> 00:19:25.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Every time you're restarting\n\n319\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.600\nthat service, if somebody's logging in it\ncould cause a little bit of a headache.\n\n320\n00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.360\nSo I would wait until you're towards\nthe end of the business day or\n\n321\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.770\neven after the business hours, and\ntry this on your own before you do that.\n\n322\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.850\nCuz if you start doing it during\nthe height of your business day, and\n\n323\n00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.580\npeople are not able to log on as you\ncontinue to just restart the service to\n\n324\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.210\nsee how it actually ends up looking and\nit changes it piecemeal at a time,\n\n325\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.650\npeople are gonna get annoyed\nat you as you do this.\n\n326\n00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.690\nAnd even though annoyance is not really\nour particular concern a lot of times,\n\n327\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.640\nit can cause a lot more phone calls.\n\n328\n00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.130\nIt can be a lot more interrupting\nto your day than you think.\n\n329\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.540\nSo take a little bit of time,\n\n330\n00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.600\nset that aside before you choose\nto do something like this.\n\n331\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.440\nBut overall, though,\n\n332\n00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.670\nZach, this is actually a fairly good way\nto think about some of the things that we\n\n333\n00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.180\nare going to customize, and make sure we\nactually take a look at that link there.\n\n334\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.250\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job as usually, Ronnie.\n\n335\n00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.860\nCustomize ADFS sign in page,\nthat's the name of this episode.\n\n336\n00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.479\nAnd in fact, you should see all\nthe episodes of the Office 365 series.\n\n337\n00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:23.726\nHelp you prepare for that exam.\n\n338\n00:20:23.726 --> 00:20:26.755\nAnd while you're in the course library,\nhundreds of other videos, and\n\n339\n00:20:26.755 --> 00:20:30.350\nthey're all designed to do one thing,\ntake you further, check that out.\n\n340\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.220\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITPROTV,\nthey'll be very glad you did.\n\n341\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.850\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n342\n00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n343\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.888\n&gt;&gt; And we will see you soon.\n\n344\n00:20:39.888 --> 00:20:43.283\n[MUSIC]\n\n345\n00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:46.294\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching

[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; You're\n\n4\n00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:11.694\nwatching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:14.182\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n6\n00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:16.400\nhelping you learn everywhere you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.920\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n8\n00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.340\nAs we continue on with Office 365,\n\n9\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.240\nand this episode is Analyze Reports and\nMonitor Service Health.\n\n10\n00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.970\nWhat does that mean?\n\n11\n00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.290\nWell there's only one guy I can think\nof who can help us with that, and\n\n12\n00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.890\nthat's Ronnie Wong, he's right here.\n\n13\n00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.110\nRonnie thanks for joining us.\n\n14\n00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n15\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.750\nas we continue on with Office 365 And now\nwe're moving into what really are almost\n\n16\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.910\nthe final phase of what we're taking a\nlook at of course which is now monitoring.\n\n17\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.090\nWe've set up quite a bit of different\nthings inside of office 365,\n\n18\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.210\nshowing you how to connect, how to\ncreate users, how to manage them a bit.\n\n19\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.180\nTalk about some of the requirements that\nare necessary then of course connecting to\n\n20\n00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.170\non premises services while using ADFS and\neven a web proxy.\n\n21\n00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.420\nSo we've gotten all of that configured and\ndone and\n\n22\n00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.810\nnow of course as things are running along\nwhat we've gotta realize is something that\n\n23\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.270\nI really don't like thinking about in\ndoing, which is the idea of monitoring and\n\n24\n00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.380\nstarting to analyze reports and\nverifying whether or\n\n25\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.490\nnot things are actually doing what\nthey say that they are doing.\n\n26\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.340\nIt's real easy at least for me, right?\n\n27\n00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.790\nTo think like I put good hard,\neffort and work into making sure things\n\n28\n00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.270\nI should configured correctly, I shouldn't\nhave to worry about it from this point.\n\n29\n00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.420\nBut the reality is, is moving parts, okay?\n\n30\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.000\nNot only we changing inside of our network\ninfrastructure inside a lot of times,\n\n31\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.620\ndon't forget Microsoft Office online or\nOffice 365 itself it is\n\n32\n00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.920\nalso a constantly changing\nservice that's out there for us.\n\n33\n00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.230\nTrying to make it better for\n\n34\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.360\nall the subscribers, which means\nsometimes things can kinda get changed,\n\n35\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.848\nand they move around they don't work\nexactly the way that we want to.\n\n36\n00:02:02.848 --> 00:02:06.670\nAnd our end, when things change and\nwe misconfigure something again,\n\n37\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.870\nbecause we've change something,well\nthat means we have to monitor it\n\n38\n00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.942\na little bit better and\nthat's what we're gonna be heading into.\n\n39\n00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:17.790\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie in an enterprise environment\nwould use an admin do the monitoring?\n\n40\n00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.340\nWas that something you would assign\na user to take care of for you?\n\n41\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.207\n&gt;&gt; Well, it wouldn't be an end user per\nse,someone that is just logging into\n\n42\n00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:28.760\nOffice 365 or using Office 2016.\n\n43\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.640\nThat we would normally assign\nthe idea of monitoring to.\n\n44\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.590\nBut it's going to be someone maybe\non the IT team that may have to be\n\n45\n00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.430\nable to do this.\n\n46\n00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.718\nOr whoever's assigned to\nthe Office 365 monitoring or\n\n47\n00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:43.040\nadministering side that would\nactually be doing this.\n\n48\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n49\n00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.400\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nsome of the elements that are actually\n\n50\n00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.270\ninvolved there.\n\n51\n00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.930\nAnd of course take a look at\nthe utilities that we normally do find\n\n52\n00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.340\nin taking a look at this.\n\n53\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.010\nSo when we start to begin\nto take a look at it.\n\n54\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.720\nWhat are some of the tools\nthat are available to us so\n\n55\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.110\nthat we can learn a little bit more about\nthe state of the health that we have?\n\n56\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.030\nAs well as what has happened in the past.\n\n57\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.760\nOne of the hard parts that\nI really don't like but\n\n58\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.330\nit's something that you've got\nto get used to doing right?\n\n59\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.810\nIs the idea of looking through\nreports of seeing past actions and\n\n60\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.100\nthen being able to use what we\nlearned from those reports to make\n\n61\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.070\ngood decisions for\nthe network as it actually proceeds on.\n\n62\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.700\nFor your connections and for everything\nelse, so one of the hardest part,\n\n63\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.640\nat least on my end,\nis taking the time to slow down and\n\n64\n00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.930\nnow analyze and monitor certain\ntypes of reports that are out there.\n\n65\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.060\nSo that's what we are gonna jump\ninto first, so here on my screen.\n\n66\n00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.640\nI've gone ahead and I've logged in\nas the global administrator for\n\n67\n00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.510\nITProTV demo, logged in.\n\n68\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.520\nAnd now we need to get access to what we\ncall some of the different reports that we\n\n69\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.230\ncan analyze that are available\nto us through Office 365.\n\n70\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.640\nAnd what we are going to do is we're going\nto focus in really on these two last\n\n71\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.360\ntiles that we see right here.\n\n72\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.890\nThe admin center of course.\n\n73\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.510\nAnd then there's actually this one which\nis I don't want to say relatively new.\n\n74\n00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.690\nIt's not exactly brand new but\n\n75\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.810\nin comparison to the other ones here,\nrelatively new.\n\n76\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.830\nThe security and compliance center.\n\n77\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.180\nIf I click on security and\ncompliance center.\n\n78\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.000\nThen for my Office 365 variety Pro TV demo\nI have a lot of different security and\n\n79\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.790\ncompliance tools that I have available\nover on the left hand navigation pane.\n\n80\n00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.630\nAnd I scroll down through here\nI can see alerts, permissions,\n\n81\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.260\nclassifications, data loss prevention,\ndata governance.\n\n82\n00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.250\nThreat management search and\n\n83\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.580\ninvestigation, service assurance,\nand look there.\n\n84\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.400\nLet me see if I can zoom in.\n\n85\n00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.590\nReports so I'm going to select reports.\n\n86\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.390\nAnd when I do that it will\nexpand out a little bit further.\n\n87\n00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.590\nAnd notice there's actually a Dashboard,\nthere's ability for\n\n88\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.220\nme to download those reports, there's also\na way I can manage different schedules.\n\n89\n00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.720\nLet me just select Dashboard for\nright now,\n\n90\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.540\nthat way we can kind of see a chart or\na graphic use of our Office 365 and\n\n91\n00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.100\nsome of the policies that\nare actually in here too.\n\n92\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.810\nSo not only do we see these types\nof reports, there is some that is\n\n93\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.530\ndata loss prevention policies,\nwe don't have any policies set up.\n\n94\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.610\nNotice I can see top and senders and\nreceivers, spoofing emails,\n\n95\n00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.170\nspam detection here, sent and\nreceived emails, supervision.\n\n96\n00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.710\nThose are some of the different ones\nthat are just rated right there for\n\n97\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.920\nus to be able to do.\n\n98\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.290\nWe of course can even download some\nof these reports if we choose to,\n\n99\n00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.890\nto take a look as well okay.\n\n100\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.350\nSo actually if I select view all\ndownloads I'll see if there's anything.\n\n101\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.380\nThere's nothing actually for\n\n102\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.870\nus to review because I haven't\nactually set up anything to do that.\n\n103\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.360\nBut as you go ahead and\n\n104\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.998\nconfigure some of the different services,\nall the reports will be right here.\n\n105\n00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:09.040\nNow if you're saying, Ronnie, we didn't\nreally configure a lot of the different\n\n106\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.340\nservices, such as exchange online.\n\n107\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.110\nWe didn't configure Skype for business.\n\n108\n00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.600\nWe didn't configure the SharePoint,\nor the OneDrive, or any of that.\n\n109\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.280\nWell, that's where you go into\nthe 70-347 show that we did.\n\n110\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.630\nAnd you'll see right there,\nwe configured a lot of things.\n\n111\n00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.680\nI'm not gonna say every\nsingle little thing.\n\n112\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.120\nBut we configured quite a bit over there.\n\n113\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.771\nAnd that's when all these\nreports can actually fill in and\n\n114\n00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:39.284\nallow us to monitor the things\nthat we want to, as well.\n\n115\n00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:39.955\n&gt;&gt; And you know what, Ronnie?\n\n116\n00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:43.433\nRight there, then I wanna jump in and just\nsay, that's why the course library is so\n\n117\n00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:44.770\ninvaluable to everybody.\n\n118\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.700\nJump in there and take a look at all\nthe videos that are available to you.\n\n119\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.210\nAnd you can review all\nthat as you go forward.\n\n120\n00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.860\nI just wanted to say that.\n\n121\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so there's a lot that\ncan actually show up here.\n\n122\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.785\nThings like different audit\nlogs that may be here.\n\n123\n00:06:56.785 --> 00:07:01.830\nMail protection reports for\nyour email is also going to be here.\n\n124\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.570\nPortal email hygiene reports you\nmay also go in to exchange portal\n\n125\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.620\nthrough the admin center to get there\nas well, and then also right here too.\n\n126\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.570\nSo this is kind of the new center for\n\n127\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.990\nall those reports being being gathered\nin one particular location and place.\n\n128\n00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.230\nThey all tend to be exactly right here.\n\n129\n00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.740\nNow the other thing that we also have,\nalong with those reports, since I didn't\n\n130\n00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.360\nreally set up any of that for\nthis particular trial portal that we have.\n\n131\n00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.770\nAnd its ironic,\nthis particular trial is about to end,\n\n132\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.245\ntowards the end of our show [LAUGH]\nwhich is actually kind of good but\n\n133\n00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:40.086\nat the same time,\nthere's actually more for us to do.\n\n134\n00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:43.260\nSo lets Search and investigation.\n\n135\n00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.771\nUnder search and investigation,\nnotice that there's also a content search.\n\n136\n00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:52.139\nIf I'm looking for actual documents and\ndifferent things that I have, but\n\n137\n00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.855\nthen there's also this\naudit log match okay.\n\n138\n00:07:54.855 --> 00:07:59.812\nThis allows us to go through and\nessentially find audit logs and then we\n\n139\n00:07:59.812 --> 00:08:06.210\ncan also add in of course, okay, the\nactivities between certain dates or users.\n\n140\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.320\nFiles or folders here we can see all that,\nwe can even show results for\n\n141\n00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.400\nall activities or\nfilter it down a little bit more.\n\n142\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.910\nLet me see it, I can scroll and\nit shows us a little bit more\n\n143\n00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.610\non some of the different things that\nwe want to be able to find and do.\n\n144\n00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.160\nNow, at the end of all these, right?\n\n145\n00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.080\nIf you are starting to do this notice\nyou can start the recording of user and\n\n146\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.100\nadmin activities as well.\n\n147\n00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.970\nSo, there is a lot of\ndifferent features right here.\n\n148\n00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:37.570\nTo give you a big 360,\nshould say 365 degree view.\n\n149\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.615\n360 degree view of the way\nthat you're using Office 365.\n\n150\n00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:43.792\nWho ever is actually using it,\n\n151\n00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:48.940\nit can all show up through this\ntypes of tools that are available.\n\n152\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.240\nNow, we're not spending a lot of time\ndemonstrating the use of these tools.\n\n153\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.090\nWhat we want you do,\nof course, is to think about\n\n154\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.940\nif I needed to take a look at\npast performance of Office 365 so\n\n155\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.130\nI can make better decision about\nwhat's coming up in the future.\n\n156\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:07.280\nWe're pretty much gonna look into reports\nand then we're also gonna look into\n\n157\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.510\nthe audit to essentially help us out\nto do what we need to do, right?\n\n158\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:17.540\nNow, there's actually one that you can do\nwithout ever logging in to Office 365.\n\n159\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.261\nIf one reason or another, let's say\nthat this is what ends up happening and\n\n160\n00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.747\nyou are out and about, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:27.495\nAnd all the sudden you get an email\nfrom Zach that, says, hey,\n\n162\n00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:30.220\nI can't connect to Office 365.\n\n163\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.140\nWell, for me,\nright now in the way that we have a setup,\n\n164\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.220\nthere's a lot of pieces that could\nbe missing at this point, right?\n\n165\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.680\nThe proxy server could be down,\nthe federation server could be down,\n\n166\n00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.760\nit could be my domain controller that\nwould block the authentication and\n\n167\n00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.510\nthe authorization of everything.\n\n168\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:52.930\nIt could be that Office 365 itself could\nbe experiencing difficulties and issues.\n\n169\n00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.082\nCould be, but if you are out in about and\nyou are not back at the office and\n\n170\n00:09:57.082 --> 00:10:00.520\nyou're going,\nhow do I eliminate some of these things?.\n\n171\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.602\nWell, with Office 365 though,\nyou can always go to\n\n172\n00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:10.798\nthis particular link,\nstatus.office365.com.\n\n173\n00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:17.000\nThis is the official Office\nservice health status.\n\n174\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.410\nAnd it will tell you,\nwhether or not everything\n\n175\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.620\nis running at least from the Office side,\nwhether the perspective is good.\n\n176\n00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.140\nThere are currently no\nknown issues preventing you\n\n177\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.560\nfrom signing into your Office\n365 dashboard here, okay?\n\n178\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.120\nService health dashboard\nthe you can go in and\n\n179\n00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.470\nwe're about to take a look at\nthe service health dashboard.\n\n180\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.670\nSo you can actually go in there and see\nwhat maybe happening, but that this point\n\n181\n00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:51.750\njust this may actually let you know,\nhey, it's not on the Office 365 side.\n\n182\n00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:56.740\nNow I may have to start troubleshooting\nthe web access proxy or the ADFS server or\n\n183\n00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.990\nmy domain controllers or\nwhatever the links are in between.\n\n184\n00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.000\nIn other words,\nit may be an issue on my side and\n\n185\n00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.110\nall the things that I've set up to try and\nmake it work.\n\n186\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.510\nSo, it at least helps you eliminate\nsome of what you might need to do, but\n\n187\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.964\nthis you can tell right away and say, hey,\n\n188\n00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:17.040\nno nothing should be preventing you\nfrom or anybody from getting access.\n\n189\n00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.210\nSo if it an access problem let's\nfind out what the errors are and\n\n190\n00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.110\nlet's troubleshoot from there, okay?\n\n191\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.520\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So it's a great little utility.\n\n192\n00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.410\nIt doesn't really show much more\nthan this particular idea, but\n\n193\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.950\nit is something that we can also end\nup seeing that could be good, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.715\nNow notice this service\nhealth dashboard here, okay?\n\n195\n00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:42.900\nThe service health dashboard is again,\na relatively newer concept.\n\n196\n00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.481\nOn the exam objectives,\n\n197\n00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:49.009\none of the things that they call out\nis that in the past on Office 365.\n\n198\n00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:54.560\nYou could of course subscribe\nto an RSS feed, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.950\nAn RSS feed allows you to run an RSS\nreader that you might have on smart phone\n\n200\n00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.480\nand get connected and that way you can get\nthese reports the way that you want to.\n\n201\n00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.670\nBut when I click on this link right here,\nokay?\n\n202\n00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.176\nSo I will have this link inside\nof the show notes for you, so\n\n203\n00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:13.796\ndon't worry about trying to\nwrite it down right now, okay?\n\n204\n00:12:13.796 --> 00:12:15.422\nBut notice it says,\n\n205\n00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:21.067\nhey subscribe to the Office 365\nservice help dashboard RSS feed and\n\n206\n00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:26.260\nyou can do this through Outlook and\neven the date on it, right?\n\n207\n00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.900\nAugust 12, 2015, you might go,\nwell, that's pretty old.\n\n208\n00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.790\nBut notice that right here on the bolded,\n\n209\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:39.310\nwe have deprecated the Service\nHealth Dashboard RSS Feed, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.950\nSo, even as of 2015, and they still\ncall it out on the exam objectives,\n\n211\n00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.680\nbut is not in service, it is deprecated.\n\n212\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.340\nSo you will not have access to this\nif you try to connect from here.\n\n213\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.540\nFor service health updates,\n\n214\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.990\nyou can go directly to their service\nhealth status to be able to do this.\n\n215\n00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.950\nSo it's right here that you can go and\ncheck this out and even show you\n\n216\n00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:07.200\nexactly where to go on the service health\nand from that point, you can do that.\n\n217\n00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.890\nNow, for us to connect into that,\n\n218\n00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.996\nI'm going to select view my service heath,\nselect, try to click on it.\n\n219\n00:13:13.996 --> 00:13:19.360\nThe service health dashboard because\nI've already logged on as Cherokee once,\n\n220\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.250\nit bring me directly into the service\nhealth dashboard under the admin center.\n\n221\n00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.700\nSo some services has posted advisories.\n\n222\n00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.900\nNotice that Exchange Online right\nnow has one particular advisory.\n\n223\n00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.588\nIf I click on that, I can see that hey,\n\n224\n00:13:36.588 --> 00:13:41.295\npeople are having a problem\ncompleting mailbox migrations here.\n\n225\n00:13:41.295 --> 00:13:45.750\nMy 23 mailboxes are actually\ngonna be affected if I do this.\n\n226\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.960\nSo it's probably actually not happy\nsince I don't have a lot of these\n\n227\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.000\nthings assigned here but\nthen also my Office Portal, okay?\n\n228\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.550\nAdmins may notice that the usage\nreports do not contain data\n\n229\n00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.950\nfrom the last few days.\n\n230\n00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.700\nExactly like what we showed you,\nwe don't have any data.\n\n231\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.820\nAlso, a part of that may be that I'm\nusing a trial subscription, they'll say,\n\n232\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.580\nwe're not gonna record all this data for\na trial, pay if you want the data, okay?\n\n233\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.390\nSo it actually does make\nsense as you start to see\n\n234\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.290\nsome of these different services.\n\n235\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.390\nBut notice the rest of this\nis actually still good.\n\n236\n00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:22.410\nAnd you'll also see it will end up\nreporting as being healthy, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.200\nSo once we have everything\nreported as being healthy,\n\n238\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.380\nthat's a good sign that\nwe can continue on.\n\n239\n00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:33.790\nIf there's any instances, I can select\ninstances here snd then advisories.\n\n240\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.340\nOnce again,\nthe advisories show up here too.\n\n241\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.480\nSo they filtered out from\nall to the two different\n\n242\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.310\ncategories that they wanted us\nto be able to take a look at\n\n243\n00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.100\njust through that service help\nmonitoring if we want to, okay?\n\n244\n00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.620\nSo normally when we start to\ndo something like this, right?\n\n245\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.470\nAll these utilities that I've mentioned so\nfar, okay?\n\n246\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.170\nWhether it's the status page or whether\nwe're talking about the RSS feed which is\n\n247\n00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:03.560\nnow deprecated or even the service\nhealth dashboard is really good, okay?\n\n248\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.439\nIt really at least gives you\nkind of a picture of the health,\n\n249\n00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:12.484\nof the way that Office 365 is working,\nbut the key here in understanding is\n\n250\n00:15:12.484 --> 00:15:17.467\nthis designed for really administration\nof one particular tenant, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:21.616\nSo, if you actually have a single tenant,\nthese are the ways to go.\n\n252\n00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:26.876\nBut the reality though of a lot of\nenterprises that are relatively big or\n\n253\n00:15:26.876 --> 00:15:30.890\nlarger than what I\nnormally end up managing.\n\n254\n00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.446\nIs that it probably means instead of using\nany of these tools that we showed you,\n\n255\n00:15:35.446 --> 00:15:40.206\nyou're probably gonna use other tools that\nMicrosoft would rather you use which of\n\n256\n00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:43.215\ncourse comes in the form\nof what we call SCOM, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:43.215 --> 00:15:47.663\nThe System Center Operations Manager\ninstead, okay?\n\n258\n00:15:47.663 --> 00:15:53.263\nSo when we start to talk about that,\nthat is a whole entire suite.\n\n259\n00:15:53.263 --> 00:15:57.321\nUtilities and tools that are out there,\nand the system that's out there,\n\n260\n00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.544\nthat can show you everything\nthat you ever possibly dreamed\n\n261\n00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:04.490\nof in terms of services and everything\nelse that you want to be able to do.\n\n262\n00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.900\nNow, how does that fit\nin to Office 365 and\n\n263\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.950\nhow do we get something like that working?\n\n264\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.610\nWell, we are not going to get it all\nworking cuz I don't have an SCOM server\n\n265\n00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.320\nand everything else set up.\n\n266\n00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.201\nBut what you do is you download\n\n267\n00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:26.548\nthe Microsoft System Center\nManagement Pack for Office 365.\n\n268\n00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:31.480\nAnd it's here they tell you what the\ndetails are on the package itself as well\n\n269\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.070\nas system requirements of what\nit actually is gonna run on.\n\n270\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:41.060\nSo, notice on this one Supported\nOperating Systems I'm running 2016 here.\n\n271\n00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.752\nOffice Management Pack for operations\nmanager designed to use the following\n\n272\n00:16:44.752 --> 00:16:49.900\nversion here, systems and\noperations manager has to be there, okay?\n\n273\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.740\nSo, for that's what is actually\ndesigned but notices it say,\n\n274\n00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.660\nits not designed for\na dedicated Office 365 subscription.\n\n275\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.800\nSo this is when there's actually gonna\nbe multiple tenants that you might be\n\n276\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.250\nmanaging or a large enterprise in which\nyou do have that system out there and\n\n277\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.140\navailable to you, okay?\n\n278\n00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.960\nSo it is a lot, there's a ton of\nfunctionality that's right here.\n\n279\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.080\nBut that's where you'll\nprobably get more power out and\n\n280\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.650\nin that sense right your pride.\n\n281\n00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.200\nIf you are starting to do something\nlike that, you'll be asked familiar with\n\n282\n00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:27.350\nthe operations center management as you\nwill with the idea Office 365, okay?\n\n283\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.890\nSo, those are kind of two ganglia, right?\n\n284\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.530\nUsually a single attendant management\nyou're going multi-tenant you're probably\n\n285\n00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.160\ngoing to end up using something like\nSystem Center Operations Manager instead.\n\n286\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.636\nUse the connection pack here or\nthe Management Pack to\n\n287\n00:17:43.636 --> 00:17:48.020\nactually make that work for\nyou with Office 365.\n\n288\n00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.790\nIt even gives you install instructions.\n\n289\n00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.320\nAnd it'll tell you you need to see,\n\n290\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.290\nof course, their Management Pack\nOperations Guide to get everything setup.\n\n291\n00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.420\nSo that is another utility.\n\n292\n00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.080\nSo think about that, right?\n\n293\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.420\nMultiple tenancies that you might have or\n\n294\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.480\nyou have multiple domains or\nmultiple force that's going on.\n\n295\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.250\nProbably that's gonna be using something\nlike System Center Operations Manager.\n\n296\n00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.300\nSingle ones, you can use\nthe service help dashboard, okay?\n\n297\n00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.700\nThat's what it comes down to\nIn the end as well, okay?\n\n298\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:24.071\nAll right, so at that particular\npoint what else do we have to think\n\n299\n00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:30.354\nabout then for being able to at least\nmanage the service help of Office 365?\n\n300\n00:18:30.354 --> 00:18:34.908\nWell, this means we also need\nto focus in on PowerShell just\n\n301\n00:18:34.908 --> 00:18:37.720\na little bit to help us out as well.\n\n302\n00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.073\n&gt;&gt; I was just going to say,\nwhy don't we look at PowerShell.\n\n303\n00:18:40.073 --> 00:18:40.700\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n304\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.301\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And I put this in the notes because\n\n305\n00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:49.550\nthis is actually kind of one of the most\ncomprehensive links to possibly\n\n306\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:54.470\nany command that could show up in 340s and\nthe 7-346 exam.\n\n307\n00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.650\nIt doesn't mean that everything\nwill show up, but here,\n\n308\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.010\neven fairly recently and\nby comparison to the recording date.\n\n309\n00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.090\nSo about a month later, okay?\n\n310\n00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.704\nHe actually says he just recently\nwas successful on the exam and\n\n311\n00:19:09.704 --> 00:19:14.938\nhere's all the possible commands\nthat may appear for the 346 exam.\n\n312\n00:19:14.938 --> 00:19:18.328\nIt's a great resource and\nhe breaks it down by categories as well.\n\n313\n00:19:18.328 --> 00:19:25.300\nSo here is management, if I scroll down a\nlittle bit further Azure rights management\n\n314\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:32.200\nwhich we also have seen in our show,\nAzure Directory ADFS, so good one.\n\n315\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.390\nAnd then even though I scroll\ndown monitoring, okay?\n\n316\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:41.300\nSo when we start talking about this idea\nof Office 365 monitoring here, okay?\n\n317\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.770\nYou do have to remember that\nif you're doing this, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.574\nThere are gonna be a few and\n\n319\n00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:52.071\nthey do focus on in some that we don't\nreally concentrate right here in 346.\n\n320\n00:19:52.071 --> 00:19:54.520\nAnd that is the Exchange management.\n\n321\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.460\nMake sure you check out the 347\nshows where we've gone through\n\n322\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.820\na lot of these particular commands\nespecially dealing with Exchange Online.\n\n323\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.990\nSo when you start seeing this you\nmight see something like this.\n\n324\n00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.690\nYou need to remember at\nleast at this point.\n\n325\n00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.100\nIf you're gonna try and run these\ncommands, it's probably not gonna be\n\n326\n00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.240\navailable to you even if you\ndo the connect.msolonline.\n\n327\n00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.290\nYou will probably need,\n\n328\n00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.670\nlet me see if I can scroll up here without\ngiving everybody a headache of some sort.\n\n329\n00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.630\nWell there it is.\n\n330\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.520\nYou will probably also need\nthe connect to Exchange Online\n\n331\n00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.440\nto make that command happen, okay?\n\n332\n00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.330\nSo if you do not connect to Exchange\nOnline then you'll probably not be able to\n\n333\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.890\nrun those other commands that\nwe've talked about, okay?\n\n334\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.160\nSo some of these are actually\nrelatively intuitive\n\n335\n00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.550\nas we start naming a few of these, right?\n\n336\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:56.770\nTo enable the mailbox auditing for us to\nmonitor the health here we can do that.\n\n337\n00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.190\nWe can also add in owner\nactions auditing if we want to.\n\n338\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.150\nWe can enable or\n\n339\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:07.500\ndisable admin auditing which is different\nthen of course regular user auditing.\n\n340\n00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.440\nStale mailbox reports are possible.\n\n341\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.050\nUsage reports are also\npossible as well and\n\n342\n00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:20.280\nyou can even do some that are time based\n7 days, 90 days, past 10 days, okay?\n\n343\n00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.050\nAll of these are possible\ntypes of monitoring\n\n344\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.220\nsituations that we might\nfind ourselves in.\n\n345\n00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.180\nBut they're very specific, right?\n\n346\n00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.010\nThey seem to really start with Exchange\nand that's what they're really looking at.\n\n347\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.870\nSo even though the rest of the exam\nobjectives that we've covered\n\n348\n00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.662\nthroughout the entire series, it really\ndidn't cover setting up Exchange Online.\n\n349\n00:21:41.662 --> 00:21:45.490\nWe didn't cover doing any of that,\nenabling the service that didn't do any of\n\n350\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.260\nthat here, they still might expect you to\nknow a little bit about monitoring that.\n\n351\n00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.911\nSo that means that this particular exam\nyou may also have to take a little bit of\n\n352\n00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:57.776\ntime and\neither learn about Exchange Online and\n\n353\n00:21:57.776 --> 00:22:00.009\nsome of the commands running there.\n\n354\n00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:04.003\nOr you can watch the 347 show on\nthe Exchange Online portions and\n\n355\n00:22:04.003 --> 00:22:06.910\nalso take a look at that as well, okay?\n\n356\n00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:12.610\nSo a very important aspect of what\nwe can actually be able to do, okay?\n\n357\n00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.120\nSo getting that information down and\nunderstanding that,\n\n358\n00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:21.790\nthat it's not gonna be a complete\n100% PowerShell based exam.\n\n359\n00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.600\nBut you will see that there are some\nof these things that are that\n\n360\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.890\nare very possible and you want to make\nsure that you take a look at as well.\n\n361\n00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.310\nNow, along with this, right, we still\nhave to actually think about the idea\n\n362\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.790\nof dealing with service interruption and\nwhat we can monitor there and\n\n363\n00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.768\ntake a look at there.\n\n364\n00:22:38.768 --> 00:22:39.950\nBut we're gonna save that for\n\n365\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.740\nanother episode instead of lumping\nit all up together right here.\n\n366\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.820\nSo in this one we've talked about of\ncourse analyzing different reports.\n\n367\n00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.358\nWe've also taken a look at these service\nhealth management of some of the ways that\n\n368\n00:22:51.358 --> 00:22:53.154\nwe can deal with Office 365.\n\n369\n00:22:53.154 --> 00:22:55.860\nSo Zach, that's a good place for\nus to end this episode.\n\n370\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.890\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic and when it's reported\nto monitor service health.\n\n371\n00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.110\nWonderful episode and there's other\nepisodes in the Office 365 series.\n\n372\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.099\nSee them all as we mentioned earlier\nyou can go to our course library and\n\n373\n00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:06.678\nthere's hundreds of videos there.\n\n374\n00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:09.610\nYou can see the 347 and so much more.\n\n375\n00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.100\nAll designed to help you go further.\n\n376\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.330\nAnd tell everybody you know about\nIT Pro TV they'll be mighty glad you did.\n\n377\n00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.810\nThanks for watching, I'm Zack Memos.\n\n378\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n379\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.076\n&gt;&gt; And

00:00:10.954\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.800\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n5\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.180\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.020\nI'm your host Zach Memos as we\ncontinue on with Office 265,\n\n7\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.630\nIsolate Service Interruption.\n\n8\n00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.403\nWhat's that all about?\n\n9\n00:00:23.403 --> 00:00:25.622\nWell, Ronnie Wong is just\nthe guy to tell us about it.\n\n10\n00:00:25.622 --> 00:00:27.430\nRonnie, good to see you,\nthanks for being here.\n\n11\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.200\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on the show, Zach,\n\n12\n00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.550\nas we continue to take\na look at Office 365.\n\n13\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.100\nAnd now we're talking about\nservice interruptions here.\n\n14\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.370\nNow a lot of times for us,\nwe've got to remember that because\n\n15\n00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.490\nwe're now dealing with cloud services\nas well as on-premise services.\n\n16\n00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.025\nThat we will have,\nit is possible and try not to,\n\n17\n00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:51.356\nwhat we call service interruptions\nthat end up happening.\n\n18\n00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:53.549\nAnd when those service\ninterruptions happen,\n\n19\n00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:57.328\nyou then have to be able to isolate\nwhether it's actually the Office 365 side,\n\n20\n00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.780\nor whether it's something\nthat's happening from your end.\n\n21\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.132\nThe great thing to think about that's\nright, is if you're ready to a system\n\n22\n00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:09.896\nadministrator somewhere, you have the\nbasic networking troubleshooting skills\n\n23\n00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:13.178\nthat you need to at least\ntroubleshoot your end, right?\n\n24\n00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:16.789\nTo verify that your machine\nhas the proper IP address,\n\n25\n00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.640\nit is able to connect and\ntalk to the components that you need to.\n\n26\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.160\nSo for example, if you're using federated\nservices, you know that the federated\n\n27\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.080\nservices server itself,\nneeds to connect let's say perhaps to\n\n28\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.500\nof course the Web Access Proxy Server,\nas well as to our domain controller.\n\n29\n00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.810\nSo you can ping in between those devices,\nto verify that that's what happening.\n\n30\n00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.350\nYou of course can also use\nthat Azure AD connect tool,\n\n31\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.330\nto verify that you have the connectivity\nup to the Cloud the way that you need to.\n\n32\n00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.138\nBut at least you know some\nof those basic things, okay,\n\n33\n00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:55.920\nthat everything is actually working and\ndoing what you need to on the inside.\n\n34\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.254\nBut once that's done,\nthen we can turn of course to take and\n\n35\n00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:05.471\nlook at the idea is this really\nan Office 365 service interruption?\n\n36\n00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:09.595\nSomething that we can deal with, something\nthat we have to be able to try and\n\n37\n00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.840\nfigure out.\n\n38\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.540\nThe tools that we're really focusing in\non for this episode and even the previous\n\n39\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.090\nepisode, we're really more centered\naround the single tenancy, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.270\nThat's you setting up the way that\nwe did right here in the lab,\n\n41\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.160\nwhich is really one domain connecting\nto one tenant up in Office 365.\n\n42\n00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.760\nAnd so, there's a lot of these tools\nthat are out there and available and\n\n43\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.700\nMicrosoft has made them that way.\n\n44\n00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.369\nBut keeping track of all of them\nis a little bit challenging cuz\n\n45\n00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.870\nthey're so many.\n\n46\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.770\nIn real life more than likely if\nyour company is already running\n\n47\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.530\nsomething like the Microsoft System\nCenter Configuration Manager, or\n\n48\n00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.560\nMicrosoft System Center Operation Manager,\n\n49\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.850\nall those system center things,\nthat Microsoft loves to put out there.\n\n50\n00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.600\nYou're probably gonna use those\ntroubleshooting tools that are built in\n\n51\n00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.660\nthere, cuz there are so\nmany different options that are available.\n\n52\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.280\nBut if you're doing that, that means\nthat's gonna be a whole different side of\n\n53\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.750\nthings where you're probably gonna have to\nget a little bit more familiar with that.\n\n54\n00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.999\nSo if you're a company that's\nalready using a pre-existing system,\n\n55\n00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.516\nthat means you'll have to learn the\ntroubleshooting from their end as well,\n\n56\n00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:16.189\nand to understand the way that\nthose tools end up working.\n\n57\n00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.946\nTo help you to monitor better\nthe health as well as the idea here\n\n58\n00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:24.960\nof anything that can\ninterrupt our services too.\n\n59\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.504\nBut for us, since we're actually working\nwith a single domain and a single tenant,\n\n60\n00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:33.093\nwe're gonna show you some of the tools\nthat have been set up there.\n\n61\n00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:36.084\nAnd we've been talking about some of\nthe ones you can't use anything, but\n\n62\n00:03:36.084 --> 00:03:37.461\nthey are on the exam objective, so\n\n63\n00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:39.568\nI'll at least tell you about\nthis is what we'll do.\n\n64\n00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:43.313\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, in an enterprise situation,\nwho would you designate this duty to?\n\n65\n00:03:43.313 --> 00:03:47.415\n&gt;&gt; Yeah well, that's actually a good\nquestion, right, so it depends on the way\n\n66\n00:03:47.415 --> 00:03:50.721\nthat they have it setup as far\nas what you're responsible for.\n\n67\n00:03:50.721 --> 00:03:54.589\nIf you're the responsible one to actually\nadministrate as well as manage and\n\n68\n00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:55.202\nmaintain.\n\n69\n00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.580\nThat's gonna be your responsibility\nis to do some of this stuff and\n\n70\n00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.280\nto know about it as well.\n\n71\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.110\nSo, if you're going for\nyour MCSA in Office 365,\n\n72\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.680\nyou at least have to know the basics\nthat we're gonna be telling you.\n\n73\n00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.630\nIn other words,\nknow what tools are actually available for\n\n74\n00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.931\nyou, in a particular scenario or\nsituation,\n\n75\n00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.651\nwhere you start to take a look\nat what you may need to do.\n\n76\n00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.901\nNow overall, though, it might be\nwhere it is assigned to another team,\n\n77\n00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:22.530\nwhere your particular\nimplementation part is over.\n\n78\n00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.240\nAnd now what you do is you tell them,\nhere it is,\n\n79\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.490\nthere are tools available for you to\nmonitor and maintain this on your own.\n\n80\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.050\nBut if you're also in that support role,\nyou may have to step back in and\n\n81\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.330\nbe able to do some of things as well.\n\n82\n00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.625\nSo if you're the one that's\ncontracted to set this up,\n\n83\n00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:44.763\nthere are some of these tools that you\ncan run for your client to help and\n\n84\n00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:48.435\nto help them get set up and\nverify that everything is working.\n\n85\n00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.345\nBut most of the time you're probably\ngoing to let the client do as much as\n\n86\n00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:54.710\npossible on their end, since you might be\nresponsible for more than one company.\n\n87\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.175\nAnd that means your service time, is gonna\nbe limited and valuable to each customer.\n\n88\n00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:02.993\nAnd you can't override, you can't say I'm\ngoing to spend 15 minutes more with this\n\n89\n00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:05.518\nguy than this guy if you're\non that tight time schedule.\n\n90\n00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:07.790\nYou'll have to do what you can do here,\nokay?\n\n91\n00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.829\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n92\n00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:12.480\ntake a look at one of the things that\nthey really want us to be familiar with.\n\n93\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.210\nThat's already kind of made and pre-built\nfor us inside of the Office portal itself.\n\n94\n00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.120\nSo I'm signed in as our global\nadministrator from inside\n\n95\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.590\nof the domain here itprotvdemo,\nwhich is Cherokee.\n\n96\n00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.240\nAt this point,\nwhen we start to look around at\n\n97\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.935\nthe different things that we can do,\nI'm gonna select the Admin tile.\n\n98\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.720\nAnd once I'm actually\ninside the Admin Center,\n\n99\n00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.480\nit's gonna just pop-up\na new tab over here.\n\n100\n00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.070\nIf I scroll down toward the bottom and\n\n101\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.256\ngo to Setup, actually I'm not\ntelling you Setup, it's Support.\n\n102\n00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:49.080\nI was like,\nI looking right at it I was like, no,\n\n103\n00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.820\nI'm supposed to be going to Support and\nI still clicked on Setup.\n\n104\n00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.420\nWe're gonna select Support here, okay?\n\n105\n00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.447\nSupport gives us this ability,\nif we want to,\n\n106\n00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:02.592\nto establish and\nopen up a new service request.\n\n107\n00:06:02.592 --> 00:06:05.660\nAnd what that allows us to do\nis start to ask questions and\n\n108\n00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.000\nyou see it popped up over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n109\n00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.710\nSays, need help?\n\n110\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.980\nGet started,\ntell us what you need help with.\n\n111\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.025\nSo let's say that I'm\nactually typing in adfs,\n\n112\n00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:18.267\nI was hoping it actually\nshow something here.\n\n113\n00:06:18.267 --> 00:06:24.021\nIt's not doing adfs, let's just do that\nadd domain, cuz I just see it right here.\n\n114\n00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.372\nSo if I needed to add in another domain,\n\n115\n00:06:26.372 --> 00:06:29.525\nthese are simple ones that\nhave already been asked.\n\n116\n00:06:29.525 --> 00:06:33.924\nI can select that, and now on\nthe right hand side it gives me a list\n\n117\n00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:38.407\nof articles that are ready here,\nwhich is perfectly fine for us,\n\n118\n00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:42.445\nbecause it means I don't have\nto go any further than this.\n\n119\n00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:47.239\nTo add in a domain to quickly add\na GoDaddy domain if I want to or\n\n120\n00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:50.059\neven just an FAQ on domains, okay?\n\n121\n00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:54.901\nSo we can go ahead and do that, let's\nsay certificates here for an example.\n\n122\n00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:03.767\nSo if I select things like Certificates, I\nmight be adding in things like, let's say,\n\n123\n00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:05.996\nan SSL certificate for Exchange 2013.\n\n124\n00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:10.300\nLet me pick that one instead,\nnotice it pops up another tab.\n\n125\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.010\nAnd now it brings me to valuable help that\nis right here that shows me pretty much\n\n126\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:22.040\nwhat I need to do if I'm wanting to add\nthis into the exchange to do that, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.112\nNow, if I don't, if I say, hey,\nI don't find what I'm really looking for\n\n128\n00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.909\nor it's not fitting what I want.\n\n129\n00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.952\nI can also select down here\nto let us call you, okay, and\n\n130\n00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:36.513\nthis is what will allow you to\nadd in your contact number, and,\n\n131\n00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:41.550\nit normally tells you right here\nwhat the expected wait time is.\n\n132\n00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.151\nSo this number can change,\nbut, usually it says,\n\n133\n00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.580\nexpected wait time right\naround 10 minutes.\n\n134\n00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.587\nBut once you get that number in there,\nit will tell you, expect a call within so\n\n135\n00:07:50.587 --> 00:07:52.553\nlong, and this is what you have to do.\n\n136\n00:07:52.553 --> 00:07:57.233\nAnd today's phone systems, it's a little\nbit tricky to actually be able to tell us,\n\n137\n00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:01.848\nbut essentially you're looking for a phone\ncall that's probably gonna It might get\n\n138\n00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:03.941\nfiltered out if you're not careful.\n\n139\n00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.770\nI do not know exactly where this\nsupport center is gonna come from.\n\n140\n00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.680\nSo you'll just have to go kind of, all\nright, I'm expecting a call in the next\n\n141\n00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.940\nten minutes, so it's better if\nyou do one of two things here.\n\n142\n00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.880\nIf you have a direct line at work,\ndon't tell them to call the front desk and\n\n143\n00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.400\nget routed though, that's not a good\nthing, give them your direct line.\n\n144\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.900\nIf not, I recommend your own personal\nnumber that they can call you back on.\n\n145\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.970\nThey're going to ask you to confirm\nthe account, in other words,\n\n146\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.420\nthe tenant administrator who set this up.\n\n147\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.510\nIt's gonna ask you that information,\nit's gonna ask you to verify,\n\n148\n00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.850\nwhat's the company address,\nwhat email address was stuff sent to?\n\n149\n00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.690\nSo that way they can verify that you do\nhave the account that you're talking about\n\n150\n00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.210\nand then they can help you to troubleshoot\na couple of different things, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.690\nSo, it is possible that we can\nget a lot of help this way.\n\n152\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.870\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie,\nthis might be a silly question, but\n\n153\n00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.880\ndo they have a live online chat,\nis that available?\n\n154\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.400\n&gt;&gt; On this one, it's not so\nmuch available, right?\n\n155\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.120\nThis one they want to have a direct\ncontact with you that's gonna always be\n\n156\n00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.650\na personalized engineer on their end,\nwhat they call an engineer,\n\n157\n00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.320\nthat will essentially walk\nyou through certain things.\n\n158\n00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.028\nSo for example, when I was setting\nthis up for another domain for\n\n159\n00:09:15.028 --> 00:09:17.843\nour Office pro side, for\none reason or another,\n\n160\n00:09:17.843 --> 00:09:22.260\nI could not get the domain that I\nwanted registered inside of Office 365.\n\n161\n00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.362\nI've done it plenty of times before and\nit's just not working,\n\n162\n00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:27.540\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n163\n00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.920\nSo I essentially opened up this\nparticular support ticket and\n\n164\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.140\ntold them this is what\nI'm having an issue with.\n\n165\n00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.271\nAnd within 30 minutes or so\nthey had called me back and\n\n166\n00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:41.847\nwe had tried just about every possible\ncombination of things that we could try.\n\n167\n00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:45.232\nAnd then they said well,\nlet me see if I can escalate this and\n\n168\n00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:48.824\nit was really the following morning\nthat they called me back and\n\n169\n00:09:48.824 --> 00:09:52.245\nthey weren't willing to say\nwhat they needed to say.\n\n170\n00:09:52.245 --> 00:09:54.628\nCuz I think they were afraid they\nwere going to hurt my feelings.\n\n171\n00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:57.700\nBut they called me back and said,\nwe just don't believe it's on our end,\n\n172\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.760\nwe believe it's on your end and I said,\nwell thank you for letting me know that,\n\n173\n00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.030\nbut let me check because I didn't know if\nit was on my end or not, I just assumed\n\n174\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:12.240\nthat I had done this before, using a hover\nagain and getting everything set up.\n\n175\n00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.660\nThat's exactly, that would be right okay?\n\n176\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.560\nSo inside my hover account,\nif you've actually seen the entire series,\n\n177\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.960\nyou've actually seen two\ndomains listed there.\n\n178\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.290\nOne was itvprotvdemo.com and\nthe other one is itprotvdemo.org.\n\n179\n00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.630\nWell, I didn't realize\nI knew that I had used\n\n180\n00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.910\nthe itprotvdemo.com before\ninside of hover.net.\n\n181\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.580\nBut I didn't realize that the\nitprogvdemo.org, at one point, had been\n\n182\n00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.380\nmoved, in other words, it had been\ntransferred to another domain registrar.\n\n183\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.520\nSo, that's why it wasn't working,cuz\nI didn't even check, I just assumed\n\n184\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.160\nthat it was right and that it was hover\nand so I entered in all that stuff.\n\n185\n00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.176\nI went to hover and\nI just started to try and do stuff and\n\n186\n00:10:57.176 --> 00:11:00.407\nthen I realized something,\nit wasn't working, okay?\n\n187\n00:11:00.407 --> 00:11:03.720\nSo even though I thought I was\nentering it into .org I was entering\n\n188\n00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.120\nit to the .com that I already had set up.\n\n189\n00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.770\nAnd that's why it wasn't working cuz\nI was just clicking through stuff,\n\n190\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:09.910\nworking quickly,\n\n191\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.560\nnot even paying attention to that except\nthat I entered in the wrong domain name.\n\n192\n00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.650\nBut once I figured out where that was,\ngot everything transferred back over,\n\n193\n00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.130\nit worked and they were right.\n\n194\n00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.690\nIt was just on our end instead.\n\n195\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.950\nSo they can help you to\ntroubleshoot a lot more.\n\n196\n00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.289\nSo this idea of actually being able to\ncreate a service request is really a good\n\n197\n00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:31.761\nidea because it does put you in the direct\ncontact with a live person that can help\n\n198\n00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:32.890\nyou out.\n\n199\n00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.340\nSo don't expect that always,\n\n200\n00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.770\non the very first call,\nthat they're going to fix every issue.\n\n201\n00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.570\nThey may tell you, hey,\ncan we set up another phone call, or\n\n202\n00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:47.000\nthey may tell you, can I call you\nback in two hours or in three hours.\n\n203\n00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.660\nAnd then they'll be pretty\nmuch right on schedule or\n\n204\n00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.090\nwithin 10 to 15 minutes of that schedule.\n\n205\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.126\nAnd call you right back at\nthat particular point in time.\n\n206\n00:11:55.126 --> 00:11:59.280\nSometimes it may be where they also ask,\ncan you install this so\n\n207\n00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.460\nthat we can see what you're\nseeing in your screen?\n\n208\n00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.940\nSo that of course depends on your security\nsettings inside your domain whether or\n\n209\n00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.420\nnot you will allow something\nlike that to happen.\n\n210\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.740\nSo just be aware, okay, and\nif they're doing something like that,\n\n211\n00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.450\nthey won't move stuff around, they'll be\nvoicing it to you like, please click here\n\n212\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.110\non the admin center, please do this, and\nyou'll actually be interacting with them,\n\n213\n00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.030\nthey'll just see your\nscreen as you're doing it.\n\n214\n00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.940\nSo it's a really neat system to help you\nto walk through it at the same time,\n\n215\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.910\nyou're not just doing it passively there.\n\n216\n00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.018\nBut anytime you want to,\nyou can disconnect that call and\n\n217\n00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.329\nthat will be over with.\n\n218\n00:12:33.329 --> 00:12:35.800\nBut it is a good system to do so.\n\n219\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.170\nNow a lot of times when you're\ndoing something like this,\n\n220\n00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.400\nthe recommendation is,\n\n221\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.530\nthat you are actually going to be logged\nin as one of those global administrators.\n\n222\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.840\nSo this one, I logged in as a global\nadministrator of the domain.\n\n223\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.506\nBut if you're doing this for the company\nthat you are helping out, you can log in\n\n224\n00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:56.417\nas your own tenant administrator\naccount to help them out to do so.\n\n225\n00:12:56.417 --> 00:13:00.164\nYou're probably going to need to do\nthat if you really wanted this call\n\n226\n00:13:00.164 --> 00:13:04.230\nnumber to come back because that's\nthe information you're going to need to\n\n227\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.104\nverify that you actually do have\nthe valid account and everything else,\n\n228\n00:13:08.104 --> 00:13:11.120\nthat you're not just getting this for\nfree.\n\n229\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.300\nSo, it is because you're paying for\n\n230\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.890\nit, that's what's normally happening here,\nokay?\n\n231\n00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.470\nSo that's one of the things\nthat we can do, okay?\n\n232\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.930\nNow, another aspect of service\ninterruption, especially if you can't get\n\n233\n00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:29.430\nanything working, is this one has been\naround for a long, long time here, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.640\nAnd this one is called,\nthere's two names to this thing,\n\n235\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.560\nI don't know why there's two\nparticular names to this here.\n\n236\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.550\nThe way that I've always learned\nit is through this URL right here.\n\n237\n00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.302\nSo as long as I can remember Office365\nbeing out there and that's been for\n\n238\n00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:46.350\na few years now.\n\n239\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.114\nIt's always been\nthe testconnectivity.microsoft.com.\n\n240\n00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:53.730\nAlways, okay?\n\n241\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.800\nSo,I always called it\nthe Test Connectivity Center,\n\n242\n00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.230\nat least just as an alias.\n\n243\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.670\nCuz that's what I recognized\nthe URL as being.\n\n244\n00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.585\nBut notice what the actual\nname is called here,\n\n245\n00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:09.420\nMicrosoft Remote Connectivity Center,\nokay?\n\n246\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.940\nMicrosoft Remote Connectivity Center,\nAnalyzer.\n\n247\n00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.387\nNow, we're gonna skip over this\nblue part for just a moment..\n\n248\n00:14:16.387 --> 00:14:19.350\nAnd I wanna concentrate on what's here.\n\n249\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.221\nWe'll go back to the blue part,\nI promise you.\n\n250\n00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:21.961\nBut here,\n\n251\n00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:26.970\nI just want us to focus in on what it\nallows us to at least be able to do.\n\n252\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.855\n&gt;&gt; And Ronnie, do they actually use\nthe abbreviation RCA for that, or no?\n\n253\n00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:30.429\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n\n254\n00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:33.285\n&gt;&gt; They do?\nYeah, that is actually what this thing is,\n\n255\n00:14:33.285 --> 00:14:37.020\nis that that remote connectivity,\nthat, what do they call it?\n\n256\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.206\nRemote connectivity analyzer here,\nI couldn't remember what the A stood for.\n\n257\n00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:44.730\n&gt;&gt; The remote connectivity analyzer,\nsounds good, I like that.\n\n258\n00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is,\nit kinda rolls off the tongue here.\n\n259\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.940\nNow you can test what we want to.\n\n260\n00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.396\nSo usually, at least at the beginning,\nif there's anything, you're gonna select\n\n261\n00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:59.868\nOffice365 and then notice that you have\nthese options that are available, okay?\n\n262\n00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:06.008\nYou have there's\nthe Office365 General Tests here, okay?\n\n263\n00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:09.970\nSo, you can test for DNS connectivity,\nwhich is actually good.\n\n264\n00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:15.770\nFor us, the Office365 sign on test is\nprobably a good one as well, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.960\nAnd it says this test will validate your\nability to log on with Office 365 with\n\n266\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.310\nyour on premises credentials and\nvalidates basic ADF configurations.\n\n267\n00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.790\nSo if you are experiencing issues,\nokay, and\n\n268\n00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.060\nwhat's the major issue that could\nliterally end up happening?\n\n269\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.482\nYou get everything setup and\nall of a sudden,\n\n270\n00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:39.799\nyou cannot go to portal.office.com, okay?\n\n271\n00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:42.670\nAnd you think it doesn't happen,\nit can happen.\n\n272\n00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.390\nYou can't get logged in and\nyou go, wait a minute.\n\n273\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.494\nI'm the global Global Administrator for\nthe, no, you shouldn't be, but,\n\n274\n00:15:48.494 --> 00:15:49.775\nit may be where it locks you out.\n\n275\n00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:55.818\nBecause your account is tied now inside of\nwhat ADFS, as a federated account here.\n\n276\n00:15:55.818 --> 00:15:59.995\nWell, this means you can try and\ngo to here if you need to.\n\n277\n00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:04.795\nAnd because I'm gonna have to actually\nbe logged in to Office 365 I can run\n\n278\n00:16:04.795 --> 00:16:07.274\nthis single sign-on test right here.\n\n279\n00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:09.310\nAnd it should reveal to\nme some information.\n\n280\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.485\nNow the information that it reveals,\nlimited in help.\n\n281\n00:16:12.485 --> 00:16:15.620\nI'm not gonna tell you it's gonna\nfix everything cuz it's not.\n\n282\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.922\nIt really is just an analyzer, which means\nit's gonna dump out possible fixes that\n\n283\n00:16:19.922 --> 00:16:22.332\nyou may actually have to investigate and\ntry.\n\n284\n00:16:22.332 --> 00:16:26.510\nBut it can help you to be able to do\nsomething like that if we need to, okay?\n\n285\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.762\nIf I had issues with ActiveSync\nhere to allow me to do something or\n\n286\n00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:38.570\nwith Exchange Web Services here, what we\nused to call OWA or OWA a lot of times.\n\n287\n00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.540\nOther Office connectivity tests,\nInternet email tests, you name it.\n\n288\n00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.070\nWe can do all of that from just\na single page without ever signing on.\n\n289\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.970\nSo let's just select this one as an\nexample, which is a single sign-on test.\n\n290\n00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:52.070\nAnd I click Next here.\n\n291\n00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.630\nAnd now at this point, it's gonna say,\nhey, what's the account that I wanna use?\n\n292\n00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.570\nAnd I'll just use the account that we've\nbeen using pretty much through the entire\n\n293\n00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.225\nshow here along with\nthe incredibly long password.\n\n294\n00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:06.506\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Super secret.\n\n295\n00:17:06.506 --> 00:17:08.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] it is pretty secret.\n\n296\n00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:13.064\nI have to type it in again?\n\n297\n00:17:13.064 --> 00:17:16.555\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just to make sure we're not\n\n298\n00:17:16.555 --> 00:17:17.155\nfat-fingering.\n\n299\n00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n300\n00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.090\nAnd now you'll have two options.\n\n301\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.070\nMost of us outside of,\nI'm gonna assume, the European Union,\n\n302\n00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.970\nwe're probably gonna\npick the default anyways.\n\n303\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.345\nI think that there are some, I wanna say\nnot only just the European Union, but\n\n304\n00:17:36.345 --> 00:17:39.187\nI think Germany is where\nthis 21Vianet is from.\n\n305\n00:17:39.187 --> 00:17:41.720\nSo I don't know why\nthat sticks in my mind.\n\n306\n00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.840\nI could be absolutely wrong.\n\n307\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.640\nBut I think it's somewhere inside\nof Europe is what we're gonna do.\n\n308\n00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.100\nSo we're just gonna leave the same one.\n\n309\n00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.890\nI understand that I must use\ncredentials of a working account for\n\n310\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.160\nmy Exchange domain to be tested.\n\n311\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.380\nI acknowledge here.\n\n312\n00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.640\nSo I don't know cuz I didn't\nset up anything Exchange.\n\n313\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.800\nBut I should have an account there.\n\n314\n00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.950\nSo now I need a VN5PVY.\n\n315\n00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.070\nSelect verify and then, I know,\nover in the lower right hand corner,\n\n316\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.870\nI mean as small as it can be,\nperform test.\n\n317\n00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.350\nSo now you'll see at the bottom it\nis trying to perform a test and\n\n318\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.030\nsee what goes on here.\n\n319\n00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.031\nAnd that's what we're actually looking at,\nright?\n\n320\n00:18:22.031 --> 00:18:26.189\nSo, in the end result if I'm not\nexactly sure what can happen,\n\n321\n00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:27.840\nhere's what should be.\n\n322\n00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.569\nNow this should end up working fine cuz\nI was able to log in to Microsoft Office\n\n323\n00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.619\nonline, using those same credentials.\n\n324\n00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:35.810\nThat should work, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:40.630\nNow the other thing that you also end\nup seeing, this is where we come back.\n\n326\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.686\nIt says connectivity failed.\n\n327\n00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:45.570\nThat's actually good for us, okay?\n\n328\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:50.935\nThe reason why it's good is cuz I wanna\nshow you this helpful thing, okay?\n\n329\n00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:51.871\nI know that it works.\n\n330\n00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:53.015\nSo somewhere along the line,\n\n331\n00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:55.550\nI don't know why this one failed\nhere cuz I was able to connect in.\n\n332\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.070\nI still have federation services running.\n\n333\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.628\nBut when you take a look at these details\nhere that really doesn't mean much to me.\n\n334\n00:19:03.628 --> 00:19:08.764\nSet-Cookie: org, O-R-G,\norigination request and\n\n335\n00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:12.670\nexpiration dates and stuff like that.\n\n336\n00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.485\nIt even shows a log on path.\n\n337\n00:19:14.485 --> 00:19:16.700\nIt shows secure only.\n\n338\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.420\nSo it doesn't show me anything if\nI continue to expand that out.\n\n339\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.090\nNotice it actually got to this point.\n\n340\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.470\nIt says, hey, it went through those steps.\n\n341\n00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.420\nThey validated.\n\n342\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.970\nIt does see the DNS names, and says,\nhey, there's a specific test here\n\n343\n00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.800\non port 443 to ensure it's\nlisted an opening, opened here.\n\n344\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.920\nAnd then it's saying,\nhey, how do I resolve it?\n\n345\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.680\nSo from there you can click on that.\n\n346\n00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.700\nAnd then it tells you, once again, look,\n\n347\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.650\nit brings you to essentially a TechNet\npage for you to set that up.\n\n348\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.760\nSo it didn't like something that\nit actually ended up seeing,\n\n349\n00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.960\neven though it did let me in before.\n\n350\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.290\nAnd then it ultimately tells me there\nwas a network error that occurred while\n\n351\n00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.250\ncommunicating with the remote host.\n\n352\n00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.260\nBut somewhere along the time,\nit looks like it actually just timed out\n\n353\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.170\nis what it did in terms\nof the elapsed time.\n\n354\n00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.750\nSo that's fine for us because it\nactually does at least show us Or\n\n355\n00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.190\na test fails in that sense.\n\n356\n00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.090\nNow here is the next part.\n\n357\n00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.770\nWhat if you'd gotten to\nthis point where it doesn't\n\n358\n00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.430\nget you anywhere just like this does?\n\n359\n00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.230\nWell now, notice that in this blue box,\nAnnouncing Microsoft Support and\n\n360\n00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.010\nRecovery Assistant.\n\n361\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.782\nRCA MSRA here or\n\n362\n00:20:25.782 --> 00:20:30.710\nactually they call this\none the MCA as well.\n\n363\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.900\nSo this particular connectivity analyzer\n\n364\n00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.430\ntool is something that\nyou can download instead.\n\n365\n00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.937\nSo now you actually see where it\nchecks for license, verified users,\n\n366\n00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:43.252\nnetwork protocols here.\n\n367\n00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:46.370\nBut this is designed to work offline.\n\n368\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.910\nAnd that's where you go, hey,\nif you're not exactly sure.\n\n369\n00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:54.871\nIt also says you can install Support and\nRecovery Assistant for Office 365.\n\n370\n00:20:54.871 --> 00:21:00.880\nThe new\nMicrosoft Client Performance Analyzer.\n\n371\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:07.350\nSo if I select that link,\nIt now brings me to, well, here, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:12.990\nSo the Office 365\nClient Performance Analyzer.\n\n373\n00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:17.568\nAnd it tells you something which you're\ngonna see a couple of times in our list at\n\n374\n00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:18.910\nthis point.\n\n375\n00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.530\nThis has been deprecated, okay?\n\n376\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.941\nSo even though it tells you it's brand\nnew on that test connectivity site,\n\n377\n00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:30.772\nthat particular site itself is not exactly\none that they say you should rely on this\n\n378\n00:21:30.772 --> 00:21:31.277\nthing.\n\n379\n00:21:31.277 --> 00:21:34.190\nThey actually recommend that\nyou do just real test to rely.\n\n380\n00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:38.089\nYou can still use\nthe Exchange Analyzer as well.\n\n381\n00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.783\nAnd then you can run it in Support and\nRecovery Assistant.\n\n382\n00:21:40.783 --> 00:21:43.260\nAnd you can also see some other things.\n\n383\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.311\nSo you're saying, well,\nRonnie, that didn't work.\n\n384\n00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:47.938\nWhy did you show it?\nBecause part of what you see in the exam\n\n385\n00:21:47.938 --> 00:21:48.758\nobjectives.\n\n386\n00:21:48.758 --> 00:21:53.682\nSo this particular tool if they ask you\nabout this is probably not gonna be\n\n387\n00:21:53.682 --> 00:21:55.470\navailable to you as well.\n\n388\n00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.170\nAll right, so\n\n389\n00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.090\nthose particular tools there, now let\nme close out of that one for right now.\n\n390\n00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.610\nAnd that brings us to, look,\n\n391\n00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.010\nanother tool that they mentioned\nin the exam objectives.\n\n392\n00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.610\n&gt;&gt; Joy.\n\n393\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.980\n&gt;&gt; And right across the top there,\n\n394\n00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.325\nyeah, you see retirement of\nthe Lync Connectivity Analyzer tool.\n\n395\n00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:17.525\nSo it is still listed as one of\nthe objectives in that final objective\n\n396\n00:22:17.525 --> 00:22:18.305\ncategory that we have.\n\n397\n00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:19.295\n&gt;&gt; So that's good to know then.\n\n398\n00:22:19.295 --> 00:22:21.465\n&gt;&gt; It is good to know that it is there.\n\n399\n00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:25.558\nBut, if you're working with Skype for\nbusiness, okay, so\n\n400\n00:22:25.558 --> 00:22:28.595\nif you're working with Skype for\nBusiness, you've gotta realize that\n\n401\n00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:32.970\nthe predecessor to Skype for\nBusiness was Microsoft Lync, okay?\n\n402\n00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:38.040\nNow, because Microsoft Lync is still kind\nof the backend of everything, Skype for\n\n403\n00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.950\nBusiness essentially is\nthe front end of everything.\n\n404\n00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.305\nSo even though you don't see where it says\nSkype for Business Connectivity Analyzer\n\n405\n00:22:45.305 --> 00:22:48.433\ntool, if you're having\na connectivity issue with Skype for\n\n406\n00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:53.650\nBusiness what they're saying is you should\nuse Lync Connectivity Analyzer Tool, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.060\nSo even though you should use that,\nthe very first line,\n\n408\n00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.170\nas some of you may have noticed, the\nLync Connectivity Analyzer Tool has been\n\n409\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.570\nretired and is no longer even\navailable for public download, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.610\nSo it says if you're interested\nwe can provide the tool\n\n411\n00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:15.470\nin the form of a tool that would\nbe better to assist you for this.\n\n412\n00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.640\nThe unusual thing about this,\n\n413\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.970\neven though it's actually from\nthe Supportability Program Manager,\n\n414\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.100\nit doesn't have a link here-\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n415\n00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.195\n&gt;&gt; To show you what particular tool.\n\n416\n00:23:26.195 --> 00:23:31.074\nSo somewhere along line, you have to make\nan official request that will say hey,\n\n417\n00:23:31.074 --> 00:23:34.945\nwe can actually do a better tool for\nyou to be able to run and see and\n\n418\n00:23:34.945 --> 00:23:36.770\ndo what needs to happen here.\n\n419\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.060\n&gt;&gt; Would that be a Skype\nConnectivity Analyzer tool, Ronnie?\n\n420\n00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:39.827\n&gt;&gt; Yes, this is the same.\n\n421\n00:23:39.827 --> 00:23:44.085\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it may be where it is\ncalled the Skype Analyzer tool.\n\n422\n00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:48.527\nBut in the back end even in the PowerShell\nwhen you start typing it in for Skype for\n\n423\n00:23:48.527 --> 00:23:53.169\nBusiness and all of that, you're actually\nseeing where it actually says Lync a lot\n\n424\n00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:55.786\nof times when you do\nthat PowerShell command.\n\n425\n00:23:55.786 --> 00:23:57.070\nSo it's not Skype for Business.\n\n426\n00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:58.804\nIt's Lync is what you\ngenerally end up seeing.\n\n427\n00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.219\n&gt;&gt; And that's what we should know for\nthe exam?\n\n428\n00:24:00.219 --> 00:24:03.361\n&gt;&gt; Yep, but\nthis is the one that they recommend.\n\n429\n00:24:03.361 --> 00:24:06.805\nThe recommendation though\nin reality is deprecated.\n\n430\n00:24:06.805 --> 00:24:11.140\nAnd the ironic thing about this, right?\n\n431\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:16.005\nIs that the exam objectives were\nactually updated I think right\n\n432\n00:24:16.005 --> 00:24:20.242\nbefore this announcement or\nright after this, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:24.597\nSo the objectives that we've\nworked the entire show off of was\n\n434\n00:24:24.597 --> 00:24:27.540\nactually based around June of 2017.\n\n435\n00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.394\nSo in that sense, it's like they\nretired it and then they said yeah,\n\n436\n00:24:31.394 --> 00:24:35.701\nit's still out there, so it didn't get\nto at least the exam objective side that\n\n437\n00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:38.234\nMicrosoft has officially\nretired this tool.\n\n438\n00:24:38.234 --> 00:24:39.808\nSo what does that mean for you?\n\n439\n00:24:39.808 --> 00:24:43.948\nIt means that if you're studying for\nthis particular exam, you may find out\n\n440\n00:24:43.948 --> 00:24:47.776\nthat they still refer to it even\nthough you won't be able to access it.\n\n441\n00:24:47.776 --> 00:24:53.474\nSo make sure you kind of keep that in\nmind as you continue to see that, right?\n\n442\n00:24:53.474 --> 00:25:00.311\nA couple more here, and this is actually\na pretty good one as well, okay?\n\n443\n00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:04.979\nThis particular tool is what is\ncalled the free/busy issues in\n\n444\n00:25:04.979 --> 00:25:08.240\nthe exchange hybrid environment.\n\n445\n00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.622\nNow what is that about?\n\n446\n00:25:09.622 --> 00:25:13.733\nOkay, well, the very fact is, when\nyou're connected to Exchange Online and\n\n447\n00:25:13.733 --> 00:25:17.659\nyou've got an Exchange server on premises,\nyou got an Exchange online and\n\n448\n00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:19.558\nthey have to talk and communicate.\n\n449\n00:25:19.558 --> 00:25:23.866\nYou might find out that you get unusual\nfree and busy issues that end up\n\n450\n00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:27.888\nhappening where it's not functioning\nthe way that you need to.\n\n451\n00:25:27.888 --> 00:25:32.060\nWell, this particular troubleshooting\ntool is a guide that allows you\n\n452\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.131\nto walk through some\nparticular steps here, okay?\n\n453\n00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:39.514\nDescribes how to troubleshoot free/busy\nissues that occur in a hybrid\n\n454\n00:25:39.514 --> 00:25:42.240\ndeployment is what it's saying.\n\n455\n00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.520\nFor tenant administrators, okay?\n\n456\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.060\nThis is a key here, okay?\n\n457\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.066\nNow, if you're actually doing this, this\nis not for just your Exchange admin, okay?\n\n458\n00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:53.960\nAnd you might go, Exchange admin?\n\n459\n00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.516\nDo we have one of those in Office 365?\n\n460\n00:25:55.516 --> 00:25:57.558\nYes, we actually did, right?\n\n461\n00:25:57.558 --> 00:26:00.136\nSo, if you roll back in your\nmemory a little bit earlier,\n\n462\n00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:02.550\nyou've been watching this in sequence.\n\n463\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.744\nRight at the beginning of the series,\nwe showed you there was actually eight or\n\n464\n00:26:07.744 --> 00:26:12.246\nnine different administrators that\nyou can assign to people here.\n\n465\n00:26:12.246 --> 00:26:15.886\nBut remember that this is for\na tenant administrator.\n\n466\n00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:18.396\nThis is what I made Cherokee's account and\n\n467\n00:26:18.396 --> 00:26:22.868\nthe original one that I used to setup\nthe account as well, is one that you do.\n\n468\n00:26:22.868 --> 00:26:25.993\nSo now, notice we're not\ngonna walk through this for\n\n469\n00:26:25.993 --> 00:26:30.710\nour particular series, because it can,\nthis is you just, how does it work?\n\n470\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.334\nWe begin by asking you questions and\n\n471\n00:26:32.334 --> 00:26:36.350\nthen we'll take you through situations of\ntroubleshooting steps for your situation.\n\n472\n00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.754\nSo essentially,\na flow chart is what they're doing or\n\n473\n00:26:39.754 --> 00:26:44.574\na phone tree is what they're doing for\nyou and you're walking through this.\n\n474\n00:26:44.574 --> 00:26:49.914\nSo first, you begin by answering these\nquestions of what you can do and\n\n475\n00:26:49.914 --> 00:26:55.000\nwhat you can't do to best describe\nthe issue that you're facing.\n\n476\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.771\nThen from that point,\nlet me scroll on down.\n\n477\n00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:03.281\nOnce you selected, let me select one,\nmy users cannot see free or\n\n478\n00:27:03.281 --> 00:27:06.110\nbusy for non premise users, okay?\n\n479\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.919\nSo let's, like that.\n\n480\n00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:11.260\nNotice that it added in\na second dot at this point.\n\n481\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.116\nSo, at the beginning we only had one.\n\n482\n00:27:13.116 --> 00:27:16.710\nNow it's saying, hey,\ndoes your free/busy work on premises?\n\n483\n00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:22.246\nYour free and\nbusy that you can set for your users.\n\n484\n00:27:22.246 --> 00:27:25.395\nAnd you can say yes, and\nnow you'll see it'll continue to walk\n\n485\n00:27:25.395 --> 00:27:28.200\nyou through the methods that\nyou want to troubleshoot.\n\n486\n00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.136\nAnd they're saying,\n\n487\n00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:31.999\nthis should be easy enough that you\nshould solve this in three steps.\n\n488\n00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:35.959\nSo it gives you of course, step by step,\nand what you might want to do and\n\n489\n00:27:35.959 --> 00:27:39.608\nverify that everything is actually\ndone the way that you need to.\n\n490\n00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:42.630\nIf it solved your issue, you select Yes.\n\n491\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.148\nAnd there you go.\n\n492\n00:27:43.148 --> 00:27:45.770\nThank you, congratulations,\nyour issue was resolved.\n\n493\n00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.083\n&gt;&gt; Yehey.\n&gt;&gt; So it allows you to troubleshoot in\n\n494\n00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:52.383\nthat way by simply asking those\nquestions that are available for\n\n495\n00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:54.700\nyou to be able to go and see, okay?\n\n496\n00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.760\nNow, there is one last tool that\nis officially mentioned for\n\n497\n00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.905\nour particular objectives here, which\nis gonna be the Microsoft Support and\n\n498\n00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:10.706\nRecovery Assistant for Office 365, okay?\n\n499\n00:28:10.706 --> 00:28:12.160\nGo figure, okay?\n\n500\n00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.130\nMicrosoft Support and\nRecovery Assistant for Office 365.\n\n501\n00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.927\nThis one will help you out, okay?\n\n502\n00:28:18.927 --> 00:28:22.080\nProblems with Outlook itself, okay?\n\n503\n00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.600\nOutlook stops responding,\npeople can't receive emails,\n\n504\n00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.817\nOutlook keeps trying to disconnect.\n\n505\n00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:30.970\nProblems with email on your phone, okay?\n\n506\n00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.727\nProblems with setting up\nOffice apps if you need to.\n\n507\n00:28:34.727 --> 00:28:37.221\nOr are using OWA,\nwhich they don't call anymore,\n\n508\n00:28:37.221 --> 00:28:40.470\nIt's called Outlook on the Web anymore,\ncan't sign in.\n\n509\n00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.355\nOr if you're using one of the business\ndynamics products that are there, or\n\n510\n00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:46.187\nbusiness intelligence products.\n\n511\n00:28:46.187 --> 00:28:50.680\nIt gives you all of that help\ndesk available for you to go.\n\n512\n00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.627\nAnd you simply download it, and\nwhen you download it you can run it and\n\n513\n00:28:54.627 --> 00:28:57.637\nbe able to do some of those\nthings that you want to do.\n\n514\n00:28:57.637 --> 00:29:02.404\nNow, this is gonna be a download really\nfor Windows itself and not so much for\n\n515\n00:29:02.404 --> 00:29:03.910\na Mac computer.\n\n516\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.680\nSo make sure you are on a Windows\ncomputer if you do this, okay?\n\n517\n00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.740\nBut this should again walk you through\na troubleshooter that will allow you\n\n518\n00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.260\nto test those connectivities out and\nto do everything that you need to do.\n\n519\n00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.796\nSo this one is actually very good and\nit's very specific for\n\n520\n00:29:19.796 --> 00:29:21.575\nus here with some of the ones.\n\n521\n00:29:21.575 --> 00:29:25.733\nAnd I would take a look at this website\nand even download it onto your Windows\n\n522\n00:29:25.733 --> 00:29:28.109\ncomputer and\njust take a look at it as well.\n\n523\n00:29:28.109 --> 00:29:32.303\nIf it asks you for an account, make sure\nyou actually do have a valid Office 365\n\n524\n00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:35.390\naccount and you should be off and\nready to go.\n\n525\n00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:39.680\nBut overall, Zach those are kind of\nthe basic tools especially when we can't\n\n526\n00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.379\nget connected when there is a service\ninterruptions that goes on.\n\n527\n00:29:43.379 --> 00:29:46.810\nAll these tools that we've just showed\nyou right here in this episode should\n\n528\n00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.408\nbe helpful.\n\n529\n00:29:47.408 --> 00:29:53.366\nAnd you should be make sure you're\nfamiliar with at least what particular\n\n530\n00:29:53.366 --> 00:29:59.610\nissue aligns with what tool when you\nare ready to get set up for the exam.\n\n531\n00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.170\nSo, make sure you review them and\n\n532\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.469\nmake sure you take a look at some of\nthem that you are not familiar with.\n\n533\n00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:05.809\n&gt;&gt; Wonderful job, as usual, Ronnie.\n\n534\n00:30:05.809 --> 00:30:08.909\nManaging Office 365 identities and\nrequirements, and\n\n535\n00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:11.330\nthis has been isolate\nservice interruption.\n\n536\n00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.978\nGreat episode.\n\n537\n00:30:11.978 --> 00:30:16.500\nThey're all great episodes and\nI invite you to watch all those Office 365\n\n538\n00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:21.050\nepisodes, because they're called up in\nthe end exam and you wanna do that.\n\n539\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.622\nAnd also check out everything\nin the course library,\n\n540\n00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:27.237\nhundreds of other videos and they're\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n541\n00:30:27.237 --> 00:30:29.370\nTell them what you know about ITProTV too.\n\n542\n00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.411\nThey'll be very glad you did.\n\n543\n00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:31.730\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n544\n00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.890\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n545\n00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.767\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you very soon.\n\n546\n00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:41.249\n[MUSIC]\n\n547\n00:30:41.249 --> 00:30:43.798\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.301\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:10.975\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:15.430\n&gt;&gt; Hello and thank you for choosing IT Pro\nTV, helping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.800\nI'm your host Zach Memos.\n\n7\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.830\nAs we continue on with Office 365, in fact\nthis is a bonus episode of Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.900\nDisabling AD federation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.560\nWe built up the federation and\nnow we're gonna [LAUGH] tear it all down.\n\n10\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.980\nAnd our IT expert Ronnie Wong is\nhere to help us out with that.\n\n11\n00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.430\nRonnie, good to see you sir.\n\n12\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for\nhaving me back on to the show Zach.\n\n13\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.350\nThere is no doubt that's exactly\nwhat we are going to do.\n\n14\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.830\nWe are going to pretty much take away\nsome of the things that we ready build up\n\n15\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.510\nfrom the actual show\nthat we've been doing,\n\n16\n00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.380\nwhere at the end of everything\nthat we talked about, right?\n\n17\n00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.509\nEnabling this getting this to work\nwith our on-premises active directory,\n\n18\n00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.905\nusing the federation services as well as\nestablishing a web access proxy server.\n\n19\n00:00:57.905 --> 00:01:02.846\nIt was a lot to set up, a lot to get done\nand some of the things that we had to do,\n\n20\n00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:07.090\nit did actually involve quite\na few components into it.\n\n21\n00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.380\nBut there are times when we are going\nto have to just disable this and\n\n22\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.950\nto get it working.\n\n23\n00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.090\nSo, Zach, when we start to have\nto do something like that,\n\n24\n00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.080\nwe really need to be careful, because it's\nnot just the idea that I can just go well,\n\n25\n00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.170\nwhy don't I just turn off something and\ndon't have to worry about it?\n\n26\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.438\nWe end up breaking stuff and that's why we\nwanted to take at least a short episode\n\n27\n00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:32.703\nhere, and talk about the idea\nof disabling these services.\n\n28\n00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:33.591\n&gt;&gt; And not to mention,\n\n29\n00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.800\nthere's all kind of dependencies\nthat could be considered as well.\n\n30\n00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.350\nBut, Ronnie, why would we wanna\ndisable the AD Federation?\n\n31\n00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.482\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's go ahead and talk about it,\ncuz that's a good issue for\n\n32\n00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:44.947\nus to think about and consider.\n\n33\n00:01:44.947 --> 00:01:46.684\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\n\n34\n00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.960\nI'm gonna show you what\nthe set-up is currently.\n\n35\n00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.235\nNow, you've been watching the Office\n365 show, I was about to say 346 show.\n\n36\n00:01:55.235 --> 00:01:57.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is actually 70-346, but\n\n37\n00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.390\nif you've been watching\nthe Office 365 shows,\n\n38\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.750\nyou've seen us essentially\nbuild up this model right here.\n\n39\n00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.790\nWe first started off in the show where\nwe just established Office 365 and\n\n40\n00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.500\nadded users in there.\n\n41\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.278\nOnce we got that point we've started using\nthe Azure Active Directory a little bit.\n\n42\n00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:21.403\nThen we added in of course our domain and\nstarted the idea of doing what we call\n\n43\n00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:26.691\na password synchronization using the\nAzure AD Connect tool to get us working,\n\n44\n00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.170\nand to get us going in\nthe way that we want it to.\n\n45\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.360\nBut even at that particular point\nwhen we take a look at doing that,\n\n46\n00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.130\nthe only thing that we're\nreally trying to do, okay.\n\n47\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.640\nWas establish what we call\na single sign-on, or technically,\n\n48\n00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.680\na same sign-on, not exactly\nsingle sign-on, but same sign-on.\n\n49\n00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.250\nAnd what that means is that there's\nan account over here which has got its own\n\n50\n00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.640\nsource of authority over\ninside of the ITProTV demo.\n\n51\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.793\nAnd then over here of course in your\nOffice 365 cloud, you have once again,\n\n52\n00:02:58.793 --> 00:03:04.123\nanother Azure Active Directory that is\nit's own source of authority, as well.\n\n53\n00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:10.590\nBut by using that synchronization tool,\nwe matched up accounts, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.140\nWhat was over here,\nalso got matched up over here as well, and\n\n55\n00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.510\nthat doesn't mean that\nwe're using one account.\n\n56\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.398\nIt means two accounts that\nare essentially identical,\n\n57\n00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:26.039\nso that way as a user logs on,\nif he needs access to his on premises.\n\n58\n00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.000\nHe's checking against the source\nof authority over here, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.851\nIf he logs on to Office 365,\n\n60\n00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:36.050\nhe's checking against the source\nof authority over there.\n\n61\n00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.700\nIt doesn't matter that both of\nthem have the same password and\n\n62\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.580\nthe same username,\nthey're two separate sources of authority.\n\n63\n00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.550\nAnd they are synchronized so\nthat when if a change occurs\n\n64\n00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.250\nover in the on-premises side,\nit will actually use the active directory\n\n65\n00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.020\nsynchronization to sink up and make\nsure that it matches over here as well.\n\n66\n00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.510\nSo, that way, when we start to do that,\nthe users end point.\n\n67\n00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.120\nIt looks like that they're\nreally only signing on to\n\n68\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.230\nusing one account in the very end of it.\n\n69\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.380\nBut overall though, it is really\nestablished with two, is what we have.\n\n70\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.890\nNow, we started realizing something,\neven though that can be done and\n\n71\n00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.500\nthat's probably the easiest\nway to manage things.\n\n72\n00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.200\nThat way the end user doesn't\nget confused about, well,\n\n73\n00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.690\nwhich password do I need to use?\n\n74\n00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.710\nWhich account do I need to use?\n\n75\n00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.897\nWe just established a format, we tell\nthem your username is gonna essentially,\n\n76\n00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:30.569\ngoing to be your email address.\n\n77\n00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.716\nYour password's gonna be the same, whether\nyou login to a machine right here in my\n\n78\n00:04:34.716 --> 00:04:38.580\ndomain, or whether you log on to\nOffice 365, it's gonna be identical.\n\n79\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.210\nSo to them, it's just really\none username one password, and\n\n80\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.530\nthey don't really careless actually\ntwo separate sources of authority.\n\n81\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.020\nYou and I care, but\nthey don't really care, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.120\nSo that's what we started to establish.\n\n83\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.820\nBut when we started to\nsay what we want to do,\n\n84\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.270\nis we want to use a single source\nof authority at this point.\n\n85\n00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.998\nThat is now when we needed\nthe Active Directory Federation Services,\n\n86\n00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:06.851\nor ADFS implemented.\n\n87\n00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:11.819\nOnce we had everything set up,\nwe went ahead and we configured,\n\n88\n00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.720\nthe Active Directory Federation\nserver itself.\n\n89\n00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.160\nAnd we showed you how to do that install,\nand how that also ended up applying, so\n\n90\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.432\nthat was the very first step that we did.\n\n91\n00:05:22.432 --> 00:05:23.787\nNow by doing this,\n\n92\n00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:30.170\nwhat really ended up happening is that\nwhen the user was inside the domain, okay?\n\n93\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.852\nThen they would go ahead and\nlogin to Office 365, but when they did so,\n\n94\n00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:40.711\nthey were told by Office 365 that\nthey needed to check in with\n\n95\n00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:45.496\ntheir own login server essentially\nis what they needed to do.\n\n96\n00:05:45.496 --> 00:05:50.027\nAnd they redirects them over to the ADFS\nserver, and then the ADFS server\n\n97\n00:05:50.027 --> 00:05:54.810\nchecks against your on-premises\nActive Directory at this point.\n\n98\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.310\nAnd when they actually authorize or\nauthenticate, they'll say,\n\n99\n00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.570\nyes, he can get in.\n\n100\n00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.490\nAnd then the ADFS server will issue us\na service token is what it will do,\n\n101\n00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.370\nand will present that so\nthat we can get access over here or\n\n102\n00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.350\neven access anywhere else\ninside of our own network.\n\n103\n00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.020\nSo now that's all tied to one account,\nnow even though that worked for\n\n104\n00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.310\nusers inside a domain.\n\n105\n00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.441\nI don't have it let me put\nsomebody inside that domain.\n\n106\n00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.473\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So even though that would actually work\n\n107\n00:06:21.473 --> 00:06:25.419\nfor a user inside the domain,\nit doesn't necessarily work for\n\n108\n00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.748\nusers outside of the domain if I\ndon't have a web proxy setup either.\n\n109\n00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:34.850\nA web proxy allows me to establish a\nboundary so that the person on the outside\n\n110\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.440\nof the network, does not have direct\naccess to internal resources here.\n\n111\n00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.580\nSo with that web access proxy set up,\nhe stands in between\n\n112\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.820\nwhere he has an outside interface and\npossibly an inside interface as well.\n\n113\n00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.453\nNow that's a true proxy,\nmost of the time in a production network,\n\n114\n00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:57.021\nwe're not gonna ever set\nanything up this way.\n\n115\n00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.960\nIn the lab environment, this is\nexactly how we have it set up, okay?\n\n116\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.734\nSo with this,\n\n117\n00:07:01.734 --> 00:07:06.330\nhere's essentially the way that it would\nbe done inside the reproduction network.\n\n118\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.549\nWe would have a firewall or multiple\nfirewalls in this way, where there,\n\n119\n00:07:10.549 --> 00:07:13.452\nof course, is the public network outside.\n\n120\n00:07:13.452 --> 00:07:18.307\nOffice 365 out on the internet,\nhover.com, let's say that we're also\n\n121\n00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:22.279\nconnected to another partner\nnetwork somewhere else as well.\n\n122\n00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.255\nAnd then we have our firewall,\n\n123\n00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:29.730\nthat sets us off to three separate\nnetwork locations through the firewall.\n\n124\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.703\nSo we put our\nActive Directory Federation server or\n\n125\n00:07:32.703 --> 00:07:36.376\nat least this time,\nwhat we would actually call our web proxy,\n\n126\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.034\nOur Web Proxy server out here\nin what we call a DMZ and\n\n127\n00:07:43.034 --> 00:07:46.739\nthat way it is exposed\nto the external traffic.\n\n128\n00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:48.985\nBut even when it communicates internally,\n\n129\n00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:52.210\nit still has to go through\nthe firewall for protection as well.\n\n130\n00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.015\nSo you can do it this way, or\nyou can set up two firewalls,\n\n131\n00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:57.760\nit's just up to your network and\nhow that's done.\n\n132\n00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.539\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhat does all of this do for us?\n\n133\n00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.291\nIt now allows for the outside user\nwhen they want to go to Office365.\n\n134\n00:08:05.291 --> 00:08:09.979\nIf I have traveling sales people,\nI have people that are always, you know,\n\n135\n00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:14.800\nthey're always on the go, and\nthey're not always inside the office.\n\n136\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.059\nIt allows them to be able to take their\nlaptop wherever they go when they access\n\n137\n00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:20.670\nOffice365.\n\n138\n00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:26.870\nOffice365 essentially redirects them, and\nthey hit a proxy server instead, the proxy\n\n139\n00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.680\nserver will actually either allow them\nto connect them to the ADFS or it won't.\n\n140\n00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.430\nThat's pretty much the idea.\n\n141\n00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.500\nSo we don't need a proxy server if\nthe only people that are gonna connect in,\n\n142\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.740\nare only from my internal network.\n\n143\n00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.446\nBut if I'm needing a balance of both,\nexternal users,\n\n144\n00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:47.010\nas well as internal users connecting in,\nthen I will need to do that.\n\n145\n00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.809\nSo now that I've got that setup,\nall that setup, to disable this, yes.\n\n146\n00:08:50.809 --> 00:08:52.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now, you might be wondering why?\n\n147\n00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.020\nWhy would we ever disable something\nlike this once we get it set up?\n\n148\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.210\nWell, think about all\nthe pieces involved here, okay?\n\n149\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.370\nEven in this basic diagram, don't get me\nwrong, it's a little bit complicated.\n\n150\n00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.440\nOn my end, in other words, what I'm\nresponsible for, I'm not Microsoft, but\n\n151\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.580\nwhat I'm responsible for and\nwhat my team is responsible for,\n\n152\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.580\nweb proxy server, as well as the DNS\nrecords that I have to manage.\n\n153\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.910\nThe ADFS, the Actual Federation Server\nitself, my entire domain and all this\n\n154\n00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.650\nstuff that's going on there, or any one of\nthose components that ends up breaking in\n\n155\n00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.900\nthis chain of things, it means somebody's\nnot gonna be able to access the resources,\n\n156\n00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.130\ninternally, nor out on Office 365.\n\n157\n00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:41.850\nSo if something internally breaks,\nsuch as the ADFS server, well,\n\n158\n00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.790\nnow I don't have two separate accounts.\n\n159\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.860\nIt is Office 365 is redirecting them,\nand they're looking for\n\n160\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.500\nthat service token,\nthat's all they're looking for.\n\n161\n00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.790\nWell, if I can't issue out a service token\nbecause the ADFS server is broken, well,\n\n162\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.290\nthat's why it might be a consideration\nthat we have to think about.\n\n163\n00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.300\nOr if for one reason or another,\nthe domain controller is down,\n\n164\n00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.780\nand there is no authentication\nbeing handed back out.\n\n165\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.780\nWell, once again,\nthat is a break in the chain of things.\n\n166\n00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.180\nExternal users not being able to connect\nin, well, in that point, we gotta actually\n\n167\n00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.080\ntroubleshoot all three possible components\nif we're not sure which one it is.\n\n168\n00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.705\nWe need to start what is closest,\nof course, to where the problem resides,\n\n169\n00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.529\nwhich would be with the proxy server.\n\n170\n00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:28.601\nIf the proxy server is showing everything\nis good, then I need to move on to\n\n171\n00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:32.280\nthe ADFS server and then at that\npoint I need to move on internally,\n\n172\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.320\nto see if everything is actually set\nup to respond the way that we want to.\n\n173\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.110\nSo that can be a long process and\nI still have, and that maybe for\n\n174\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.790\none user you can't get in.\n\n175\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.360\nWhat if now it spreads to 25 users or\n30 users, now, all of a sudden,\n\n176\n00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.180\nthe problem magnifies.\n\n177\n00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.850\nSo there are a few things that can be\ndone, and when the troubleshooting steps\n\n178\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:57.690\nthat we mentioned that we could do if\nthis is happening, we might think,\n\n179\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.030\nlet's just permanently disable this and\nthen don't worry about it.\n\n180\n00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.337\nWell, that's not a recommendation.\n\n181\n00:11:02.337 --> 00:11:05.610\nActually, even saying, hey, let's just\ntake the proxy server out of this,\n\n182\n00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.148\nthis is not going to be recommended,\n\n183\n00:11:07.148 --> 00:11:10.446\nbecause there are things that are now\nhappening that rely on the proxy server.\n\n184\n00:11:10.446 --> 00:11:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.\n\n185\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.660\n&gt;&gt; So what we can do, is we can\ntemporarily disable this environment, and\n\n186\n00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:22.960\nwe can have them authenticate using a list\nof passwords inside of my server itself\n\n187\n00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.690\nwhere I have everything stored, and then\nthat way they can still get access in.\n\n188\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.460\nBut at the same time,\nthat is a temporary solution for us.\n\n189\n00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.910\nOnce we do something like that,\nit means at some point,\n\n190\n00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.720\nwe're gonna actually put everything\nback into place the way that we want to.\n\n191\n00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.270\nSo instead, we may consider the idea of,\nnow that I've got everything up and\n\n192\n00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.590\nrunning the way that it should be,\nokay, how do I take it down?\n\n193\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.910\nWhat do I need to do to make sure\nthat this ends up working, okay?\n\n194\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.390\nSo let's verify that we've got\nthings working the way that I said.\n\n195\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:59.380\nOutside, as well as internally,\nis this going to work in this way?\n\n196\n00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.020\nOkay.\n\n197\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.060\nSo here it is.\n\n198\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.070\nI'm on my own host machine at this point.\n\n199\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.180\nIf I bring up just a web browser,\nI'm running on a Mac right now.\n\n200\n00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:13.630\nIf I do portal dot office dot com,\nI'm connecting in and\n\n201\n00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.760\nit automatically connected me\nright through to Office 365.\n\n202\n00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.473\nNow notice, I'm logged on as Cherokee,\n\n203\n00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:24.281\nwho has of course been our\npersona that we've been using.\n\n204\n00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:24.943\n&gt;&gt; Global admin.\n\n205\n00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:28.250\n&gt;&gt; She's our global admin and\nfor the domain.\n\n206\n00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:29.707\nAnd we're able to do this, and\n\n207\n00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.354\nI didn't have to present\nmy credentials again, okay.\n\n208\n00:12:32.354 --> 00:12:35.118\nSo not only was it saved in the browser,\nbut it actually,\n\n209\n00:12:35.118 --> 00:12:37.881\nwhen the first time I logged in,\nit actually said, hey,\n\n210\n00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.220\ndo you wanna make sure that this\nworks the way that it does.\n\n211\n00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:47.520\nSo if I wanted to log out,\nlet me see if I can sign out here So\n\n212\n00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.020\nnow it's gonna hang on for\na moment while they sign out.\n\n213\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.780\nAnd there we go.\n\n214\n00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.380\nIt says close out of the browser.\n\n215\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.310\nIt verifies, I signed out.\n\n216\n00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.880\nBut I click sign in, notice this,\nright here I can pick the account.\n\n217\n00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.340\nAnd there it is, it's saying,\nit's taking me to my own sign-in server.\n\n218\n00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.970\nAnd it's right here.\n\n219\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:12.520\nI can click sign in, so I know that\nthis is hitting my web proxy server.\n\n220\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.580\nAnd it also is hitting\nthen my ADFS server,\n\n221\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.090\nwhich of course, talked to the domain\ncontroller and I'm able to get in.\n\n222\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.110\nSo that's from the outside,\n\n223\n00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:25.500\nsuch as if I was sitting at a coffee\nshop somewhere using their hotspot.\n\n224\n00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.960\nIf I go internally to a machine, so\nthis is from within my own domain here.\n\n225\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.570\nAnd I've just signed in as\nthe administrator, to make it easy for us.\n\n226\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.730\nSo here it is, this is one that's\njoined to the ITProTV demo domain,\n\n227\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.670\nit's internal for our network.\n\n228\n00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.657\nAnd now if I do portal.office.com\n\n229\n00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:56.865\nSame thing where I get access and I go And\n\n230\n00:13:56.865 --> 00:14:02.510\nnow notice, it's taking me to the internal\nsite where I can possibly sign in.\n\n231\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.221\nSo I know also, internally,\nit is taking me where I want to go.\n\n232\n00:14:14.846 --> 00:14:19.338\nAnd there we are, we are going to, I'm not\ngonna worry about staying signed in too\n\n233\n00:14:19.338 --> 00:14:22.570\nmuch for\nright now cuz I'm gonna take it down.\n\n234\n00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.975\nSo I know both sides are working\nexactly the way that I want to.\n\n235\n00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:30.056\nBut anyone of these elements\nthat's not working at the point,\n\n236\n00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:33.400\nit can cause tremendous problems, okay?\n\n237\n00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.190\nSo if I now realize,\nI don't really want this anymore,\n\n238\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.000\nsomebody makes the decision\nwe don't want it.\n\n239\n00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.920\nIt means we have to go ahead and\nstart this process of disconnecting or\n\n240\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.470\ndisabling from Office 365 as well.\n\n241\n00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:57.040\nSo I'm gonna log back in here,\nwhere I have my Azure AD Connect Tool.\n\n242\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.293\nAnd I probably don't have to do that,\nbut I like doing that from here.\n\n243\n00:15:04.508 --> 00:15:06.600\nIf I can remember the password.\n\n244\n00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.912\n&gt;&gt; That's your secret\npassword [CROSSTALK].\n\n245\n00:15:08.912 --> 00:15:09.639\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:10.831\nEvery time I think I do.\n\n247\n00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:18.270\nSee?\n\n248\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:18.770\nOkay.\n\n249\n00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.440\nAll right, now,\nthere's a couple ways to do this, Zach.\n\n250\n00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.361\nSo I'm gonna show you the old school way,\nwhich is through PowerShell to do this.\n\n251\n00:15:27.361 --> 00:15:27.916\n&gt;&gt; Uh-hm.\n\n252\n00:15:27.916 --> 00:15:29.931\n&gt;&gt; And then, we're gonna show you, well,\n\n253\n00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:33.962\nprobably the way that you're gonna want to\ndo this because it guides you along, and\n\n254\n00:15:33.962 --> 00:15:37.930\nhelps you to make sure that everything\nis set up to do this here, okay?\n\n255\n00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.482\nSo I'm gonna launch a PowerShell,\nclick on the start button,\n\n256\n00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.570\nright click on Windows PowerShell.\n\n257\n00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.015\nI'm gonna run this as administrator.\n\n258\n00:15:45.015 --> 00:15:48.264\nAll right, so now that I'm\nactually logged into PowerShell,\n\n259\n00:15:48.264 --> 00:15:50.791\nsince we're gonna do\nthis through PowerShell.\n\n260\n00:15:50.791 --> 00:15:56.645\nI need to establish my credentials first,\nthat I'm gonna be using to connect in.\n\n261\n00:15:56.645 --> 00:15:58.586\nSo from here, I'm gonna create a variable.\n\n262\n00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.034\nAnd tell it to ask for my credentials.\n\n263\n00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:14.210\nAnd now this is where I have to\nkind of zoom in a little bit.\n\n264\n00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.280\nI'm going to sign in as\nthe tenant administrator here.\n\n265\n00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.463\nBecause I do not want to be a part\nof that domain in that is federated,\n\n266\n00:16:25.463 --> 00:16:30.505\nas I do this it's actually\nglobaladmin sorry,\n\n267\n00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:36.318\nglobaladmin@itprotvdemoco.onmicrosoft.com.\n\n268\n00:16:36.318 --> 00:16:40.130\nSo that was the initial domain\nthat was essentially set up.\n\n269\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.032\nI've copied the password.\n\n270\n00:16:44.075 --> 00:16:46.960\nNow I'll click OK, and then zoom back out.\n\n271\n00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.150\nSo if I copied the right password, I'm\nokay, if I didn't, then it's gonna ask me\n\n272\n00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.500\nfor the right password at some point\nin time, is what it's gonna do.\n\n273\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:00.520\nOf course need to connect, so\nI'm gonna do a connect-msolservice that\n\n274\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.730\nwill connect me up to Office 365,\ngonna ask me for my credentials here.\n\n275\n00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.389\nHere's the moment of truth again.\n\n276\n00:17:11.054 --> 00:17:12.530\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n277\n00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.340\nSo this is good.\n\n278\n00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.210\nIt means I am now connected.\n\n279\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:19.355\nNow I want to take a look at the domains,\nso\n\n280\n00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:23.270\nI'm gonna just do a get-domain here.\n\n281\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.960\nWhoop, not domain, get-msoldomain.\n\n282\n00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.429\nSee, I always forget that part and\nI shouldn't, but I do.\n\n283\n00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:32.390\nAnd what I'm looking for is right there.\n\n284\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.660\nOkay, notice the verified status\nas well as the authentication.\n\n285\n00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.490\nIt is now called federated at this point.\n\n286\n00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.990\nThat is the one that I'm going to need\nto actually work with right here.\n\n287\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.470\nSo I want to make sure that that\nchanges to the term managed,\n\n288\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.260\nis what I want to make sure that\nthat ends up happening here, okay?\n\n289\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.940\nNow, when you do this,\n\n290\n00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.730\nyou've got a couple of things that you\ncan do to just simply turn it off.\n\n291\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.193\nBut since we're actually doing this\nkind of really in the background and\n\n292\n00:18:01.193 --> 00:18:03.361\nmaking sure that this is turned off for\ngood.\n\n293\n00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:07.948\nWe need to connect not only to Office 365,\nwhich we've just done,\n\n294\n00:18:07.948 --> 00:18:11.617\nwe now need to connect to our\nADFS server as well, okay?\n\n295\n00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:19.990\nSo it is here,\nI'm gonna do set-msolADFSContext.\n\n296\n00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.660\nAnd now it's gonna ask me for\nthe computer.\n\n297\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.170\nThis is where I put in the fully qualified\n\n298\n00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:32.354\ndomain name of the actual\nfederation server.\n\n299\n00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:44.386\nSo that makes me have\na connection with both.\n\n300\n00:18:44.386 --> 00:18:48.628\nThe federation server and\nnow, as well as Office365.\n\n301\n00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.610\nI am now connected.\n\n302\n00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.398\nNow, the simple command\nwhich is kind of neat here,\n\n303\n00:18:55.398 --> 00:19:01.030\nis Convert-MsolDomain and\n\n304\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.880\nnotice that there is actually one\nthat says, MSOLDomainToFederated.\n\n305\n00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.260\nIf this had said standard,\n\n306\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:15.180\nI could use this some that says\nMsolToFederated, but if I do this instead.\n\n307\n00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.230\nI'm just hitting the Tab key.\n\n308\n00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.300\nI want you to see that\nthere's both of them.\n\n309\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:25.448\nSo the one that I want is\nconvert MsolDomainToStandard.\n\n310\n00:19:25.448 --> 00:19:28.800\nThen I need to type in\nthe name of the domain.\n\n311\n00:19:36.131 --> 00:19:39.990\nThen there's a skip\nuser conversion option.\n\n312\n00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:45.600\nNow on this one,\nI can actually do a dollar sign true or\n\n313\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.207\na dollar sign false, okay?\n\n314\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:53.130\nNow if I wan t to convert everybody\nat one time and do this for real, and\n\n315\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.350\nI would make sure that everyone's account,\ninstead of being a federated account,\n\n316\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.860\nis now going to be\na single standard account.\n\n317\n00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.430\nI need to issue the word false there.\n\n318\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:07.150\nIf I was temporarily doing this because\nI just don't know what's wrong but\n\n319\n00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.370\nI do want to use federated services,\n\n320\n00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:14.350\nI'm gonna leave that as being true\ninstead, okay, where it says skip.\n\n321\n00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:18.670\nSo we wanna say, if I'm gonna do it\ntemporarily, we want it to say true.\n\n322\n00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:22.116\nWe're doing this permanently,\nwe're gonna leave this as false,\n\n323\n00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:24.359\nis what we are going to do or\nturn it to false.\n\n324\n00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:29.591\nThen PasswordFile.\n\n325\n00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:38.305\nOn this one user.\n\n326\n00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:41.260\nPasswords.txt.\n\n327\n00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.580\nNow, this is very important right now,\nokay?\n\n328\n00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.813\nBecause we don't want to really disrupt\nanybody any longer than we have to,\n\n329\n00:20:48.813 --> 00:20:53.310\nby doing what we're doing here,\nwe're saying take the domain,\n\n330\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.866\nconvert it back to a managed domain.\n\n331\n00:20:55.866 --> 00:21:00.490\nUsers convert them back to a standard but\nduring this time,\n\n332\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:06.070\ntemporarily, user passwords\nare going to be listed in this text.\n\n333\n00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:13.750\nNow, this means that for\nthe Office 365 side, when we do this,\n\n334\n00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.618\nall of those passwords over there\nare going to be reset automatically.\n\n335\n00:21:18.618 --> 00:21:19.834\nYikes, okay?\n\n336\n00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:20.860\n&gt;&gt; Woo.\n\n337\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.700\n&gt;&gt; But even if you do so\nright, when they're reset,\n\n338\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.250\nbecause now they're actually\nseparating two different accounts,\n\n339\n00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.910\nthey're not reset to actually\na different password.\n\n340\n00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.510\nThey're actually gonna reset to whatever\nthese passwords are right here as well.\n\n341\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:39.830\nSo we'll be able to still log on, users\nshould be able at that point to log on.\n\n342\n00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:44.180\nIf for some reason the federated service\nwasn't working while it's federated,\n\n343\n00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.960\nthis is actually a temporary\npassword file that will\n\n344\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.180\nkind of let them log on at the point\nin time that they need to.\n\n345\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.634\nSo I think that that's all\nthat I need right there.\n\n346\n00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:01.380\nWe have to give it a moment here.\n\n347\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.044\nIt's either gonna spew out red text\nat us or it's gonna accept it and\n\n348\n00:22:04.044 --> 00:22:04.715\nwe are gonna go.\n\n349\n00:22:04.715 --> 00:22:09.218\nSo now, lets us see here,\nif I can pull, okay, there we go.\n\n350\n00:22:09.218 --> 00:22:12.259\nPlease wait while the system\nconverts user to standard\n\n351\n00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:15.200\nMicrosoft Online Services identity.\n\n352\n00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.960\nLet me see if I can scroll over.\n\n353\n00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.810\nThis involves setting a temporary\npassword on converted users.\n\n354\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.250\nThis process can take well now,\n\n355\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.940\nthe reason why it can take long it\ndepends on how many users that we have.\n\n356\n00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.630\nSo this is actually kind of a very,\nit can take a long time so\n\n357\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.380\ndon't be in a hurry about this.\n\n358\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.123\nI know it sounds strange, but\nby sending it this way right, users now,\n\n359\n00:22:37.123 --> 00:22:41.171\nif there's an immediate change\nto happen once this is done.\n\n360\n00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:45.730\nThat's what you should see is that users\nshould now be able to log on, okay?\n\n361\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.800\nThis is a great way to temporarily\ntroubleshoot what's going on.\n\n362\n00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.280\nDo not just go, I'm just going to remove\nthe [LAUGH] ADFS server long ago.\n\n363\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.690\nWe'll just get rid of it and\neverything will actually work that way.\n\n364\n00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.970\nIt won't because Azure AD\nis still expecting\n\n365\n00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.050\nthe federated service\nidentity to continue on.\n\n366\n00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.366\nNow, Zach, do you have a question?\n\n367\n00:23:07.366 --> 00:23:08.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I sure did.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.\n\n368\n00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.820\n&gt;&gt; So the users, are they gonna\nbe notified on automatically\n\n369\n00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.130\nthat there's a temporary password issued?\n\n370\n00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.890\nOr is that something that\nhas to go through admin?\n\n371\n00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no,\nthey are not gonna be notified.\n\n372\n00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.650\nSo there's a couple of other things that\nwill have to actually be able to do,\n\n373\n00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.390\nas we continue on through here, okay?\n\n374\n00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.040\nSo at this point we need to set up,\n\n375\n00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.170\nsomething else as well which is to\nreset the domain authentication.\n\n376\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.250\nSo set-msol which I finally\nremembered at least, this time.\n\n377\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.950\nMsolDomainAuthentication.\n\n378\n00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.130\nAnd then the authentication method,\n\n379\n00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:45.030\nwe're no longer gonna use\nthe ADFS which is the federated.\n\n380\n00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.420\nWe are going to use Managed instead.\n\n381\n00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.840\nSo, I'm just using the Tab to show\nyou the two options that are there.\n\n382\n00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:55.670\nSo, I'm changing this from federated to\nnow Managed as what we are going to do.\n\n383\n00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:03.553\nThen the DomainName, Itprotvdemo.com.\n\n384\n00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.840\nAnd press Enter.\n\n385\n00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.770\nNow, that didn't seem bad at all.\n\n386\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.561\nSo, on these steps, right, that should\njust about complete the entire process\n\n387\n00:24:14.561 --> 00:24:17.739\nhere, but\nwe're not actually completely done yet.\n\n388\n00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:25.700\nLet me do a get-msoldomain, and\nthis is our first verification.\n\n389\n00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.390\nThe itprotvdemo, now, has actually\nbeen managed the way that we need to.\n\n390\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.130\nNow, Zack, we are not completely done yet.\n\n391\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.510\nThere's still a few things\nthat we have to do.\n\n392\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.234\nBut I'm noticing that the time,\nthat we're really out of this.\n\n393\n00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:39.900\n&gt;&gt; It is gone.\n\n394\n00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.732\n&gt;&gt; And that means that we still need\nto do just a few more things, but\n\n395\n00:24:42.732 --> 00:24:46.089\nlet's carry this into a part two, so\nI don't try to rush to finish this, and\n\n396\n00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:49.360\nwe'll make sure that we actually show\neverything that we need to, okay?\n\n397\n00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.060\n&gt;&gt; And we appreciate it Ryan,\nwe really do.\n\n398\n00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.190\nThis is a bonus episode of Office 365.\n\n399\n00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.151\nThis is a disabling AD federation part\none, and there will be a part two.\n\n400\n00:24:58.151 --> 00:25:02.131\nMake sure you see that as well and\nsee everything in the Office 365 series.\n\n401\n00:25:02.131 --> 00:25:03.200\nYou'll be glad you did.\n\n402\n00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.090\nAnd when you're in there, the course\nlibrary, hundreds of other videos,\n\n403\n00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.880\nall designed to help you go further.\n\n404\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.722\nAnd tell everybody you know about ITProTV.\n\n405\n00:25:10.722 --> 00:25:11.810\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n406\n00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.180\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n407\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:13.780\n&gt;&gt; And

          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.582\nWelcome to IT pro TV,\nI'm your host Don Pezet [CROSSTALK]\n\n2\n00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:12.000\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.001\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITProTV,\n\n4\n00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.495\nempowering the world\nthrough engaging learning.\n\n5\n00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:17.725\nI'm your host, Zach Memos.\n\n6\n00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.915\nAs we continue on with\nManaging Office 365, Identities and\n\n7\n00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:27.495\nRequirements bonus episode and that's\ndisable AD or Disabling AD Federation.\n\n8\n00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.625\nThis is part two, we have\na disabling AD federation part one.\n\n9\n00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:31.975\nMake sure you see that as well.\n\n10\n00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:33.630\nRonnie, good to see you again.\n\n11\n00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.370\nRonnie Wong You is going to bring\nus all the information we need.\n\n12\n00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.381\nThanks for being here.\n\n13\n00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:40.651\n&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Zach for\nhaving me back to continue on and\n\n14\n00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.878\nhopefully to complete\nthis idea of removing\n\n15\n00:00:43.878 --> 00:00:48.800\nthe Active Directory Federation\nthat we have with Office 365.\n\n16\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000\n&gt;&gt; And in the first episode, we kinda\nbrought you up to that point where\n\n17\n00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.110\nit looks like everything is over and done.\n\n18\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.320\nSo, let's go back and\ntake a look at our screen and\n\n19\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.370\nwe'll jump right into it without\na lot of other things here.\n\n20\n00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.450\nSo, here it is, we now see that everything\nhas turned from federated to up here at\n\n21\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.117\nthe top where we ran it at the beginning\nto verify that we were federated.\n\n22\n00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:13.346\nNow, we went through, and of course we ran\nthe different commands to set our context,\n\n23\n00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:16.282\nwe converted the domain\ninto a standard domain,\n\n24\n00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:21.570\nwe also took the time to make sure that\nthose users were also converted as well.\n\n25\n00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.030\nThen we set the domain authentication\nback to manage here, and\n\n26\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.990\nthen I showed you the domain,\neverything is done.\n\n27\n00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.960\nNow once that's all done, you may want\nto wait just a little bit of time.\n\n28\n00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.990\nBecause even though you just typed in the\ncommands, remember you and I do not know,\n\n29\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.350\neven though we're connected to Office365,\nwhere that command ultimately ends up.\n\n30\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.222\nSo that means, it might take a little bit\nof time before it's propagated through\n\n31\n00:01:47.222 --> 00:01:52.730\nOffice 365 and your domain making sure\nthat everything is actually set and\n\n32\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.410\neverything is recognized on their end.\n\n33\n00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.160\nSo you do, you have to patient.\n\n34\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.020\nDo not rush through this.\n\n35\n00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020\nDo not think that it has\nto be immediate here.\n\n36\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.920\nIt might just take a few minutes\nbefore everything is actually done.\n\n37\n00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.640\nNow the reason why I\nwanted to stress that,\n\n38\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.800\nis that once we've got\neverything to that point.\n\n39\n00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.350\nRemember that what I told\nyou in the previous episode,\n\n40\n00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.440\nthat when you finish this process and\nit's converted over to manage here,\n\n41\n00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.900\nall of the Azure user\naccounts that are up there,\n\n42\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.810\nright, okay, those particular\npasswords are going to be reset.\n\n43\n00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.410\nAnd this is what we ended up seeing here\ntoo, where it actually takes a temporary\n\n44\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.600\npassword on these converted users now,\nthat all those are now reset.\n\n45\n00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.130\nSo, users are not going to be\n\n46\n00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.940\nable to connect in to Office 365 because\nthey've been reset at this point.\n\n47\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.170\nNow, the other thing that we have,\nis that even though we've taken away that\n\n48\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.000\nfederation itself, it doesn't mean\nthat we've completely abandoned\n\n49\n00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.770\nthe idea of using a synchronization\nespecially with the passwords.\n\n50\n00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.949\nIt means that that synchronization\nmay still be up and available there.\n\n51\n00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.200\nAnd if it is, we now have to go back and\nthink about this idea.\n\n52\n00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.860\nLet me see if I can bring up my\ndiagram for us one more time.\n\n53\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.540\nSo, that we can take a look\nat something as well, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.338\nSo, I need to go back to here and\nthis should be,\n\n55\n00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:23.090\nlike I said, I should change that to\nsame sign on at this point instead.\n\n56\n00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.590\nSame sign on, as well, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.770\nNow, remember that this is what our\ngoal is essentially going to be, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.300\nAnd now we've broken\nthe federation itself.\n\n59\n00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.763\nSo it sounds like a Star Wars\nmovie at this point.\n\n60\n00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:40.920\nNo, no-\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] federations part.\n\n61\n00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.805\n&gt;&gt; That's a Star Trek.\n\n62\n00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.669\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm mixing realms there.\n\n63\n00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.391\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Star Trek.\n\n64\n00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.820\n&gt;&gt; People are going to sue me or\nthey're going to hate me for good.\n\n65\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.440\nBut this is what we have, right?\n\n66\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.880\nWe're essentially breaking that service.\n\n67\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.720\nBut it doesn't mean that the\nsynchronization itself is broken, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.300\nSo we've just kind of said look\nwe're going to remove this because\n\n69\n00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.930\neven with the Active Directory Federation,\nthe source of authority,\n\n70\n00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.340\nokay, resides over here.\n\n71\n00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.410\nSo, even before that, we essentially said,\ninstead of having two source of authority,\n\n72\n00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.950\nnow we're actually going to enable it and\nhave a single source of authority.\n\n73\n00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.390\nAnd that for us, if we take,\nif you watch our episodes and\n\n74\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.920\nnow resides as the on\npremises active directory.\n\n75\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.560\nSo, even though the passwords\nhave changed over here,\n\n76\n00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.140\nthis is still the source of authority and\nthere is\n\n77\n00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.940\na possibility that synchronization\ncan still happen across here too.\n\n78\n00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.860\nNow why is that important?\n\n79\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.320\nBecause it didn't change all my\npasswords over here in my domain.\n\n80\n00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.680\nSo what do I really want to do?\n\n81\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.410\nI want to build and\nsynchronize everything, okay, so\n\n82\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.540\nthat the passwords I'm using\nover here on my on premises\n\n83\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.310\nare going to synchronize across,\nand let me change that arrow.\n\n84\n00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.240\nBecause I kind of, let me do this here.\n\n85\n00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.408\nLet me make it, so\nthat this actually works.\n\n86\n00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:59.110\nWe want it to synchronize this way\nin terms of our passwords now.\n\n87\n00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.450\nEverything that's on premises now\ngets synchronized to the cloud.\n\n88\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.210\nBut for us to do this in\nthe immediate fashion as we can,\n\n89\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.100\nit means we have to force\nthe synchronization to happen, okay?\n\n90\n00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.070\nSo that's what we are going to do.\n\n91\n00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.957\nNow, before I do that,\nI wanted to test something out as well.\n\n92\n00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:17.700\nNow, let me launch up the browser.\n\n93\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.880\nSo everything right now is broken, okay.\n\n94\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.260\nAt least that's my assumption it's broken.\n\n95\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.290\nWe took a few minutes in between our part\none and our part two, and we'll now see.\n\n96\n00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.980\nSo if I select share.itvprotvdemo, now it\ntakes me, look at that from the outside.\n\n97\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.750\nIt says an error occurred.\n\n98\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.210\nAn error,\ncontact your administrator for more.\n\n99\n00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.250\nAnd if I click on the error details here,\nokay,\n\n100\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.600\nit's now saying something is actually\nan error, it doesn't show me a lot.\n\n101\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.906\nBut it's really saying that\nyou can't get in, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:51.323\nAnd that's kind of the problem.\n\n103\n00:05:51.323 --> 00:05:55.290\nAnd it's still redirecting me\nto my own federation server.\n\n104\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.630\nSo that is from the outside\nof the network.\n\n105\n00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.320\nAll right, so\nwe know that that part is broken.\n\n106\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.770\nNow, let me go internally here for\na moment to\n\n107\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.650\ninside of my network and\nhere's what I did, okay.\n\n108\n00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.497\nSo, I went ahead and did this so that\nwe wouldn't have to see me doing this.\n\n109\n00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:17.070\nNow, notice that when I signed out,\ncuz I originally had signed in, I went and\n\n110\n00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.520\nsigned out and was going to sign back in.\n\n111\n00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.006\nBut look at this,\neven the part in signing out.\n\n112\n00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:26.110\nSign Out, sorry but\nwe're having a problem signing you out.\n\n113\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.800\nWe've received a bad\nrequest at this point.\n\n114\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.060\nIf I scroll down into the bottom,\nright behind my head here,\n\n115\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.970\nyou actually see something now and\nyou'll see why there's a problem.\n\n116\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.790\nSo the same service that we had\nbefore that was enabled request,\n\n117\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.870\nrequested, federation realm object here.\n\n118\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.540\nIn other words it says what,\nit does not, does not exist anymore.\n\n119\n00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.030\nSo, we are now told essentially\nthis is broken, well now\n\n120\n00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.845\noutside or inside of the network,\nI've got a really big problem.\n\n121\n00:07:02.845 --> 00:07:03.387\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:07:03.387 --> 00:07:07.371\n&gt;&gt; So, this is not working one way or\nanother one, okay, so\n\n123\n00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:09.600\nthat is what is happening.\n\n124\n00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.740\nI'm laughing at Mike's statement in the\nchat cuz an error occurs like Rodney knew\n\n125\n00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.310\nwhat is gonna happen.\n\n126\n00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.520\nThat's because it's normally my standard\noperating procedure, errors happen, okay.\n\n127\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.400\nSo I pretty much can guess,\nabout 60% of the time,\n\n128\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.668\nI'm gonna end up with an error here, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:24.668 --> 00:07:28.450\nBut overall [LAUGH] though, on the sign\nout process that we have, whether we're\n\n130\n00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.630\nlogging in or logging out, I've broken the\nactual way that this is suppose to work.\n\n131\n00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n132\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.920\n&gt;&gt; So, that's where we have an issue,\nright?\n\n133\n00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.960\nSo people that think that they can just,\nlet me just uninstall,\n\n134\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.270\nor yeah uninstall, the Active\nDirectory Federation service role and\n\n135\n00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.900\nthen everything will\nkinda just sync back up.\n\n136\n00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.470\n&gt;&gt; No, it wont.\n\n137\n00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.935\n&gt;&gt; It's not working, okay.\n\n138\n00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:56.513\nSo it's really not doing all the things\nwhere, you're not in trouble, okay.\n\n139\n00:07:56.513 --> 00:07:58.194\nSo what do most people do?\n\n140\n00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:02.705\nThey kind of go, boo, we need this to\nwork, so they try and get it to work\n\n141\n00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:07.390\nagain, by putting everything back\ninto place, and hoping for the best.\n\n142\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.870\nAnd now, you kind of tried to fix\nsomething that was broken, but\n\n143\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:15.335\nyou didn't realize it was broken before,\nand now you're in a conundrum, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:19.376\nSo, that's why you wanna be careful\nhere on the steps that we're doing.\n\n145\n00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:22.970\nSo let me go back over to\nour domain controller.\n\n146\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.860\nThe reason why I'm going back over here is\n\n147\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.742\nthis is also the server where my\nAzure AD connect tool is also running.\n\n148\n00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:34.984\nAnd I want to run from PowerShell here,\n\n149\n00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:41.937\nI'm gonna import- module AD,\noops, I could spell it, Sync.\n\n150\n00:08:41.937 --> 00:08:44.961\nApparently, I can't spell, ADSync, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:46.880\nSo I'm gonna run this from PowerShell.\n\n152\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.704\nI can run it from the AD Connect tool.\n\n153\n00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:52.896\nA little bit more involved, but we'll\ntalk about that in just a moment here.\n\n154\n00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:59.702\nI want to Start-ADSyncSyncCycle.\n\n155\n00:08:59.702 --> 00:09:01.764\nNow, pay attention, okay?\n\n156\n00:09:01.764 --> 00:09:06.043\nNow, this doesn't mean that,\non this part, right?\n\n157\n00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:10.264\nIt's the syntax that I want\nyou to pay attention to.\n\n158\n00:09:10.264 --> 00:09:15.641\nFor me I kept typing this wrong\nbecause I kept typing in ADSyncCycle.\n\n159\n00:09:15.641 --> 00:09:20.100\nBut notice what it actually says,\nADSyncSyncCycle.\n\n160\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.318\nYeah, so be aware, if you're really\ntrying, don't just assume like I did.\n\n161\n00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:27.910\nNo, of course, it's ADSyncCycle,\nit'll just work.\n\n162\n00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.484\nNope, it's ADSync,\nwhich is actually the module itself,\n\n163\n00:09:31.484 --> 00:09:33.804\nthen it's the SyncCycle that we want.\n\n164\n00:09:33.804 --> 00:09:38.198\nSo I'm gonna tell it to start\na full synchronization.\n\n165\n00:09:38.198 --> 00:09:42.204\nI'm gonna initiate PolicyType here,\nlet me zoom out just a bit, so\n\n166\n00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:44.090\nthat we can see it.\n\n167\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.719\nAnd there's two types as well.\n\n168\n00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:48.260\nAnd I'm just using the Tab key to help us.\n\n169\n00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.207\nDelta means just sync whatever's\nchanged at this point in time, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:52.207 --> 00:09:55.280\nOr I can do the Initial here.\n\n171\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.504\nOr I can do something unspecified.\n\n172\n00:09:57.504 --> 00:10:00.605\nNow, I'm gonna just pick between\nthe two that I really understand,\n\n173\n00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.410\nwhich is of course delta,\nwhich means changes.\n\n174\n00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.337\nInitial means full, okay?\n\n175\n00:10:05.337 --> 00:10:07.473\nThat's what we really want here, okay?\n\n176\n00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:12.574\nSo at this point,\nI want to actually implement a full sync\n\n177\n00:10:12.574 --> 00:10:18.759\nfrom the on-premises Active Directory\nside, up into the Azure AD.\n\n178\n00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.770\nAnd in theory, okay?\n\n179\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.262\nThis is where it takes a little\nbit of time again to make sure\n\n180\n00:10:24.262 --> 00:10:26.059\nthat everything is working.\n\n181\n00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:31.025\nBut in theory, if all this is actually\nworking, I usually give it two to five\n\n182\n00:10:31.025 --> 00:10:36.240\nminutes before I go and check everything,\nbecause it does take time to sync up.\n\n183\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.150\nSo the great thing is this one does\nshow me a success which is what I want.\n\n184\n00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.897\nBut if I wait two to five minutes,\nand I type this in again, or\n\n185\n00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:47.984\nI type in the delta and\nit still shows me a success,\n\n186\n00:10:47.984 --> 00:10:52.640\nit means I have actually successfully\ndone it instead of getting an error.\n\n187\n00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.334\nIf I get an error, it means somewhere\nalong the process I didn't fully\n\n188\n00:10:56.334 --> 00:10:58.725\ndisconnect everything\nthat I thought I did.\n\n189\n00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.963\nSo at this point here,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n190\n00:11:01.963 --> 00:11:04.715\nAll right, so now I'm going to connect and\n\n191\n00:11:04.715 --> 00:11:09.390\nsee just a couple other things\nthat we need to do as well, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.031\nSo from here, I'm gonna go back out\nfrom the outside, and this time I wanna\n\n193\n00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:18.760\ncheck a few things as the global tenant\nadministrator, I wanna check this.\n\n194\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.259\nIf I go back to portal.office.com.\n\n195\n00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:30.766\nI'm gonna pick this\nGlobal Administrator and Sign In.\n\n196\n00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:34.310\nNow let's see, I don't wanna stay signed\nin so I'm not gonna worry about it, okay?\n\n197\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.941\nSo now I'm actually in here.\n\n198\n00:11:38.941 --> 00:11:42.962\nNow, I don't have to do this,\nI'm really checking on the Azure side.\n\n199\n00:11:42.962 --> 00:11:45.711\nDid the federation turn off yet, okay?\n\n200\n00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:48.076\nSo I could actually go\nto portal.azure.com, but\n\n201\n00:11:48.076 --> 00:11:51.818\nI like going through here, because this\nis what I'm more familiar with, okay?\n\n202\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:57.894\nSo if I select this, I'm now inside\nas the global administrator,\n\n203\n00:11:57.894 --> 00:12:01.013\nthe one that set up the ITProTV demo site.\n\n204\n00:12:01.013 --> 00:12:02.370\nI'm going to select Admin.\n\n205\n00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.973\nAnd then when I scroll\ndown to Admin Centers,\n\n206\n00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:12.690\nall the way down to the very bottom,\nI can select Azure AD.\n\n207\n00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.893\nAs always,\nyou can always go to portal.azure.com and\n\n208\n00:12:18.893 --> 00:12:23.569\nlog in at the same time, as long as you\nhave the right credentials to log in.\n\n209\n00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:27.248\nOver on the left-hand side, I'm gonna\nchoose Azure Active Directory, and\n\n210\n00:12:27.248 --> 00:12:28.557\nmake sure you can see that.\n\n211\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.342\nAnd then in the center column,\nI'm gonna scroll down to Domain names.\n\n212\n00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.766\nAnd then over here on the right\nwhere it says ITProTVDemo.\n\n213\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.488\nAnd this is what we're looking for, okay?\n\n214\n00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:48.390\nNotice right here,\nit did actually accept the changes here.\n\n215\n00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.464\nNotice FEDERATED,\nit is not federated anymore.\n\n216\n00:12:51.464 --> 00:12:53.760\nThe status is Verified No.\n\n217\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.680\nTo configure itprotvdemo for federated\nsign-on to your Azure Active Directory.\n\n218\n00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.261\nRun the Azure AD Connect\non your local network, and\n\n219\n00:13:04.261 --> 00:13:07.436\nthat will go ahead and\ndo that for you as well.\n\n220\n00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:10.396\nSo, this is all good it's verifying that\n\n221\n00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:15.880\nwe now know that the Azure side is\nseeing this as not being federated.\n\n222\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.461\nWe now have the sense that if everything\nis right, if not I may have to wait a few\n\n223\n00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:23.299\nmore minutes or\nmaybe even a little bit of time.\n\n224\n00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:24.666\nIt really depends on the number of users.\n\n225\n00:13:24.666 --> 00:13:28.767\nI don't have that many users,\nI say that, there's about almost 30, but\n\n226\n00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.769\nit doesn't really matter, right?\n\n227\n00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.227\nBut it may take more time than we think,\nso\n\n228\n00:13:33.227 --> 00:13:37.960\ngive it a few more minutes to be able\nto do what it needs to do here, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.657\nSo at least we can verify something\nlike this that it is actually\n\n230\n00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:43.832\ngoing to end up working here, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:48.146\nSo now, let me see if I can sign\nout of everything here, and\n\n232\n00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:52.656\nI'm just gonna close that one and\njust completely sign out.\n\n233\n00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:53.810\nGood, okay?\n\n234\n00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.036\nI just wanna make sure everything\nis actually signed out.\n\n235\n00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.530\nLet's launch a new browser.\n\n236\n00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.134\nDo portal.office.com.\n\n237\n00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:07.476\nAnd now let's see if we can get access in.\n\n238\n00:14:07.476 --> 00:14:13.021\nSo this may work, it may not, depending\non how long it takes for everything.\n\n239\n00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.626\nIf I can remember the password,\nI don't know why,\n\n240\n00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:18.544\nall of the sudden the password\nwent blank in my head here.\n\n241\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.301\nAnd there we go, okay?\n\n242\n00:14:30.301 --> 00:14:35.534\nSo you can see where just waiting\na few minutes, I can now sign on.\n\n243\n00:14:35.534 --> 00:14:38.190\nAnd this is from outside of the network,\nwhich is good.\n\n244\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.369\nThen I should also be able to, let me\nclose that out, make sure it's cleared\n\n245\n00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:48.859\nout, its cache and everything, and\nwe'll launch this browser again.\n\n246\n00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:53.610\nAnd we'll try from the inside,\ninside of the domain.\n\n247\n00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.571\nSelect the one that's internal.\n\n248\n00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:15.698\nAnd there we go, we have now successfully\ndid away or disabled our AD federation.\n\n249\n00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:18.970\nAnd now users should be\nable to gain access in.\n\n250\n00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.857\nAnd all that happened at the very end,\nright?\n\n251\n00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:23.750\nWhen I synchronized all\nthose passwords back up.\n\n252\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.514\nBecause we didn't have those\npassword synchronizations,\n\n253\n00:15:26.514 --> 00:15:28.145\nit wasn't gonna work for anybody.\n\n254\n00:15:28.145 --> 00:15:32.313\nSo there may be a disruption in terms\nof service that we're gonna have.\n\n255\n00:15:32.313 --> 00:15:36.282\nI just realized it can be done and\nall that's actually going to help us out,\n\n256\n00:15:36.282 --> 00:15:38.050\nonce we get there, okay?\n\n257\n00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.451\nAll right, so now it's like we\nknow that we can do this but\n\n258\n00:15:42.451 --> 00:15:45.775\nRonnie is PowerShell really the way to go?\n\n259\n00:15:45.775 --> 00:15:48.021\nWell yeah, it is,\nit pretty much really is.\n\n260\n00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:52.828\nBut at the same time, let's say,\nRonnie there is no way.\n\n261\n00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:56.655\nIf that happens, I'm just gonna call a\nconsultant cuz PowerShell is just too much\n\n262\n00:15:56.655 --> 00:15:57.770\nI do not want to do that.\n\n263\n00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.403\nWell, we showed you in just five or\nsix commands here,\n\n264\n00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:01.966\nWhere you can actually do this.\n\n265\n00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:03.655\nPatience is the key.\n\n266\n00:16:03.655 --> 00:16:07.570\nAnd the problem that you're gonna have in\na production network is you're gonna be as\n\n267\n00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.060\nimpatient as you can.\n\n268\n00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.000\nAnd the reason why is somebody is\nscreaming, I can't get access,\n\n269\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.530\nI can't get access.\n\n270\n00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.710\nYou just gotta work through and\nsay just give me a little bit of time.\n\n271\n00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.470\nAnd I'll let you know when\neverything is back up and running.\n\n272\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.120\nAnd you should be able to get\naccess in that I showed you here.\n\n273\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.510\nIt actually is working.\n\n274\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.330\nThere was no special magic\nI did in the background.\n\n275\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.810\nNo other setup that I did to\nmake sure that this is working.\n\n276\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.670\nThat this was a fully operational web\naccess proxy along with a federated\n\n277\n00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.340\nservice, along with a domain controller\nand Office 365, and it all worked.\n\n278\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.580\nNow, I wanna show you just one\nother thing, since we are here and\n\n279\n00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.510\nwe've got just a few more minutes as well,\nokay?\n\n280\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.590\nSo because PowerShell is so\n\n281\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.370\npowerful, yes, you do need to learn it\nbecause the world is moving towards that.\n\n282\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.373\nAs much as I'd like to say, no,\nwe're going to hang on to our GUI,\n\n283\n00:16:56.373 --> 00:16:59.338\nthere's gonna be times when you're\nnot gonna be able to do that.\n\n284\n00:16:59.338 --> 00:17:03.350\nBut the great thing is all the stuff\nthat we did, there is an easier process.\n\n285\n00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.400\n&gt;&gt; Then by all means, enlighten us Ron.\n\n286\n00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.840\n&gt;&gt; The easier process to doing all this,\nright,\n\n287\n00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:16.100\nwhen it comes down to it is going to\nbe using the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n288\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.090\nSo I'm gonna launch\nthe Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n289\n00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.861\nWe're not gonna run this again, but\n\n290\n00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:23.473\nat least take you through some of\nthe steps here to get to this point, okay?\n\n291\n00:17:23.473 --> 00:17:26.879\nSo this is the same tool where we took\nI think three or four episodes and\n\n292\n00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.740\ntrying to show you all the options\nthat are available here, okay?\n\n293\n00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.580\nSo now let's actually\npause this scheduling.\n\n294\n00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.320\nNow, if I'm really not sure I'm gonna get\nall these options that are available.\n\n295\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.380\nSo there's a couple of things that\nyou'll want to, of course be able to do.\n\n296\n00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.560\nOnce you get to this point, you are going\nto select, hey I want to essentially\n\n297\n00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:53.540\nremove the Azure Federation Services or\nthe Active Directory Federation Services,\n\n298\n00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.150\nchange the user sign on and\nthen click Next.\n\n299\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.840\nFrom here of course you're\ngonna provide the credentials.\n\n300\n00:18:03.346 --> 00:18:05.170\nAnd you do wanna pay attention.\n\n301\n00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.567\nSome of them are gonna ask you for\nyour domain credential.\n\n302\n00:18:07.567 --> 00:18:10.450\nSome of them are gonna ask you for\nyour Azure AD credentials.\n\n303\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.480\nIn theory they should be the same but\nnot always.\n\n304\n00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.869\nIt just depends on your organization.\n\n305\n00:18:21.823 --> 00:18:26.130\nI'm going to see if I didn't\nfat-finger that there.\n\n306\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.370\nAnd this is where you begin the change,\nokay?\n\n307\n00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.190\nSo here it is.\n\n308\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:37.420\nAccording to Azure AD Connect, this is\nstill what federated with everything.\n\n309\n00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.460\nSo if I didn't want that,\n\n310\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.310\nI could actually select that password\nsynchronization, right there.\n\n311\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.960\nThis is good, once again,\nif you're saying, I need to troubleshoot.\n\n312\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.800\nI need to see if the federation\nservice is actually the issue.\n\n313\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.240\nI can just change the password\nsynchronization and\n\n314\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.190\nthen put this check box here.\n\n315\n00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.900\nSo that's the same as that\noption that I showed you,\n\n316\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.240\nwhere it said skipped the user,\nwhat is it?\n\n317\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.990\nSkipped user, conversion, okay?\n\n318\n00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.060\nI wanted to make sure\nI'm telling you right.\n\n319\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.600\nSkip user conversion.\n\n320\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.830\nThis would actually be\nchanging it to true instead.\n\n321\n00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.750\nSo I can tell it, don't convert all those.\n\n322\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.140\nAnd from that point on,\n\n323\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.740\nwe would actually just follow that\nthrough in whatever it actually asks us.\n\n324\n00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.212\nSo if I wanted to enable\nsingle sign-on with that,\n\n325\n00:19:20.212 --> 00:19:23.958\nI would also put this check box here,\nand then continue through to next here.\n\n326\n00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:29.420\nNow, notice, actually let me\nput this warning up, okay, so\n\n327\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.260\nthat you'll actually know.\n\n328\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.545\nChanging from federation to password\nwill require all user passwords to be\n\n329\n00:19:34.545 --> 00:19:35.965\nre-synchronized.\n\n330\n00:19:35.965 --> 00:19:38.740\nSo this is the process that\nwe ran manually, okay?\n\n331\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.540\nBut notice it says it\ncould take a few hours.\n\n332\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.200\nSo even though ours was almost\ninstantaneous, I say almost.\n\n333\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.444\nI've talked all the way\nthrough it to try and\n\n334\n00:19:47.444 --> 00:19:49.638\ngive us a little bit\nmore time is what I did.\n\n335\n00:19:49.638 --> 00:19:51.700\nBut it may take a few hours.\n\n336\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.020\nSo don't think that this\nis an immediate process.\n\n337\n00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.020\nSo when are you gonna do this?\n\n338\n00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.790\nYou're probably gonna do it after work or\non a weekend.\n\n339\n00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:58.920\nI know you don't want to do that.\n\n340\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.150\nBut that's probably the best time\nto do it instead of when you\n\n341\n00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.450\nhave 500 people on Monday\nmorning trying to get access.\n\n342\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.360\nProbably not a good time to do it.\n\n343\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.920\nBut using a test account,\ndo that and get ready to go.\n\n344\n00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.130\nAnd that's what you'll end up doing there.\n\n345\n00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.776\nSelect Next.\n\n346\n00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.038\nAnd maybe, okay.\n\n347\n00:20:17.038 --> 00:20:19.080\nNow you'll enter in the credentials.\n\n348\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.810\nAnd when that's done,\nit will configure it for you, okay?\n\n349\n00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.875\nSo you run through that process.\n\n350\n00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.267\nAnd I'm gonna back all the way out so\n\n351\n00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.650\nI don't have to actually\nrelaunch this again.\n\n352\n00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.911\nOnce you change the user sign on,\n\n353\n00:20:31.911 --> 00:20:37.749\nthen you go up to the customized\nsynchronization options.\n\n354\n00:20:37.749 --> 00:20:40.554\nAnd you go ahead and\nuse your credentials again.\n\n355\n00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.156\nYou get connected in.\n\n356\n00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:56.960\nAnd now you verify the directory\nthat you're doing.\n\n357\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.240\nAnd then the synchronization.\n\n358\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.450\nYou want to make sure that you\nactually sync up what you want to.\n\n359\n00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.000\nWhether that's everything or\n\n360\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.630\ndo you actually just want to sync\nup a particular select domain.\n\n361\n00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.800\nI'm gonna just leave it as is.\n\n362\n00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.400\nAnd this is the other thing that you\nwant to verify which is right here.\n\n363\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.890\nYou wanna use a password synchronization,\nmake sure that that's turned on.\n\n364\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.270\nBecause you're gonna need it.\n\n365\n00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.740\nIf you don't synchronize the passwords,\nremember that when we do thi,\n\n366\n00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.530\nwhen we disconnect using the other part,\nit resets what?\n\n367\n00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.060\nAll of the Azure passwords.\n\n368\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.390\nAll of them that are inside that domain.\n\n369\n00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.510\nSo that's why it's important\nthat you also have what?\n\n370\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.680\nThat global tenant administrator,\nthe one that set it up.\n\n371\n00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.890\nSo his account is not reset because\nnot actually a part of that domain.\n\n372\n00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.910\nSo just remember that as you do this here.\n\n373\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.261\nSo you wanna make sure of course at least\nthe password synchronization is actually\n\n374\n00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:44.962\nset as well.\n\n375\n00:21:44.962 --> 00:21:47.708\nAll right, so\nafter that of course you would configure.\n\n376\n00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:49.990\nAnd then it would actually go for you.\n\n377\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.878\nBut we did all that manually.\n\n378\n00:21:51.878 --> 00:21:56.770\nAnd you can go right in\nhere to do the same thing.\n\n379\n00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.829\nNow all that's up to you.\n\n380\n00:21:57.829 --> 00:22:02.061\nBut I did want to at least show you,\nit can be done.\n\n381\n00:22:02.061 --> 00:22:06.462\nAnd it's something that you don't want\nto just say, just take it off and\n\n382\n00:22:06.462 --> 00:22:09.390\nwe'll deal with the heartaches later.\n\n383\n00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.060\nIt is not what you want to be able to do.\n\n384\n00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.640\nAt the end of everything, once everything\nis done and over with especially through\n\n385\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.650\nAzure AD Connect, you go into where it\nactually shows you the configuration.\n\n386\n00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.080\nSo view the current configuration.\n\n387\n00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.530\nAnd it's here that what we\nwant to be able to see.\n\n388\n00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.730\nI don't know why I'm telling you.\n\n389\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.450\nLet me see here.\n\n390\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.240\nYep, so\nwhat we're actually looking to see right,\n\n391\n00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.770\ndid you actually have the password\nsynchronization enabled back.\n\n392\n00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.550\nIs everything actually the way that\nyou expected to be in terms of\n\n393\n00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.580\nwhat you're seeing, okay?\n\n394\n00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.965\nSo all that's actually gonna be there.\n\n395\n00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:49.071\nAnd if it's federated it will\nalso show you right here too.\n\n396\n00:22:49.071 --> 00:22:51.430\nMine currently is not.\n\n397\n00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.100\nSo I remember seeing that\na little bit earlier too.\n\n398\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.750\nBut that's what you also\nend up seeing as well.\n\n399\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.960\nSo just take the time and\nnotice both them.\n\n400\n00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.440\nThis is not officially called out on\nthe exam objectives itself as far as\n\n401\n00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.620\nremoving it.\n\n402\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.200\nBut it is part of what I believe\nis something that you may\n\n403\n00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.320\nchoose to do to confirm that,\nhey this is something that can be done.\n\n404\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.620\nSo don't worry if somebody says,\nset this up.\n\n405\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.840\nYou can go I don't know how to\nactually back out of this if I need to\n\n406\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.590\nkinda get everything back up and\nrunning quickly, do it now, okay?\n\n407\n00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.890\nThe other part that you can do,\n\n408\n00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:30.920\nof course, is don't wait until\nfull implementation to do this.\n\n409\n00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.740\nYou may choose instead to do\nthis during your pilot, right?\n\n410\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.830\nSo you can run this during your pilot,\nmake sure everything is up and running,\n\n411\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.430\nmake sure it's actually good.\n\n412\n00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.630\nAnd that's all synchronized and\nthat's working.\n\n413\n00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.080\nAnd when that ends up happening,\nthen you don't worry about it so much\n\n414\n00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.700\nwhen it comes time for true onboarding\nof everything that you need to do, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.050\nSo Zach, overall though,\nI think this is a good place for\n\n416\n00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:58.610\nus to help round out some of\nthe knowledge that we need in Office 365.\n\n417\n00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.430\nBut really even without having to say\nit's part of the exam content itself.\n\n418\n00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.220\nBut it's also good to watch if you're\nright there at the end anyways.\n\n419\n00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.800\nBecause it's gonna help you out in making\nsure that you've got all the logic in\n\n420\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:15.340\nmind, of how the ADFS works together,\nwith everything else.\n\n421\n00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.570\nAnd then how you back out\nof it when you need to.\n\n422\n00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.270\nSo it really is gonna be helpful to you.\n\n423\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.470\n&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Ronnie.\n\n424\n00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.390\nBonus information and it's disabling AD\nfederation part 2, there was a part 1.\n\n425\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.010\nMake sure you see both of them.\n\n426\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.180\nWonderful content for you.\n\n427\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.409\nIn fact all the Office 365 episodes are\nfull of content you can use and should.\n\n428\n00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:36.984\nAnd when you're in our course library\nthere's hundreds of other videos.\n\n429\n00:24:36.984 --> 00:24:39.830\nAnd they're all designed to help\nyou go further, so check that out.\n\n430\n00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.610\nTell everybody you know\nabout ITProTV as well.\n\n431\n00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.580\nThey'll be glad you did.\n\n432\n00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.120\nThanks for watching, I'm Zach Memos.\n\n433\n00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.100\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n434\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.457\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you again soon.\n\n435\n00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:53.056\n[MUSIC]\n\n436\n00:24:53.056 --> 00:24:55.010\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.392\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.392 --> 00:00:11.913\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:13.186\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\n\n6\n00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:16.162\nchoosing ITPRO.TV,\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n7\n00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:20.227\nI'm your host Zach Memos,\nas we continue on with Office 365.\n\n8\n00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.483\nAnd today's topic is document and\nemail protection, and\n\n9\n00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:27.749\nwe've asked Ronnie Wong to help us out\nwith that because he knows what to do.\n\n10\n00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:28.803\nRonnie, good to see you, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:32.370\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you again for\nhaving me back on the show Zach.\n\n12\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.152\nRemember what we are actually\ncovering today as we begin,\n\n13\n00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:44.093\nis gonna be really bonus content to\nthe Office 365 show, for exam 70-346.\n\n14\n00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:48.466\nAnd the reason why I wanna emphasize that\nis because you're probably not gonna be\n\n15\n00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.880\ntested on this material,\n\n16\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.670\nbut it is good material for you to\nunderstand as an Office 365 administrator.\n\n17\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.830\nWhen it comes on implementation of certain\ntechnologies that you'll find inside\n\n18\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.130\nof Office 365.\n\n19\n00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.550\nAnd we wanted to make sure that we\ntalked about this idea of document and\n\n20\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.790\nemail protection a little bit more.\n\n21\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.000\nBecause during the show we\ndid address it to a point\n\n22\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.240\nin which we started to talk\nabout Azure Rights Management.\n\n23\n00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.730\nAnd we also saw the idea of\nthe Azure Information Protection.\n\n24\n00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.680\nSo in that sense we did see a portion\n\n25\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.980\nof what Azure rights\nmanagement can really do.\n\n26\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.660\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nwhat is the problem here though?\n\n27\n00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.110\nWhat are we trying to\nisolate here at this point?\n\n28\n00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.830\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to it, the\nthing that we showed on the show itself\n\n29\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.170\nis that we emphasize that small sliver,\nwhich is really dealing with encryption.\n\n30\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.090\nProtecting our data using\nsome type of encryption.\n\n31\n00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.140\nAnd we showed where just implementing this\nallows users to really have it seamless,\n\n32\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.020\nand that's what we think about, right?\n\n33\n00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.600\nIs using some type of\nprotection like that.\n\n34\n00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.630\nBut in the end result of this though,\nit could be that for\n\n35\n00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.650\nwhat we're actually doing is not enough,\nokay?\n\n36\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.782\nAnd the problems that we have of course is\nwith the overall idea of what in the world\n\n37\n00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:09.626\nis wrong with the way that we protect\ndata in today's places as well, okay?\n\n38\n00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:12.163\nSo we're gonna take in a high level,\nvery high level.\n\n39\n00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:13.588\n&gt;&gt; 5,000 foot view.\n\n40\n00:02:13.588 --> 00:02:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, 5,000 foot view of some of\nthe things that we do in the enterprise,\n\n41\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.460\nto talk about protecting the data and\nsome of those issues that we do, okay?\n\n42\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.020\nSo first and foremost here\nwhen we start to take a look,\n\n43\n00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.270\none of the issues happens to be,\nof course, people, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.520\nAnd what I mean by that\nare people that use the email and\n\n45\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.360\nthe documents themselves.\n\n46\n00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.000\nAnd this is not addressing them\nas being something that's bad.\n\n47\n00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.730\nIt's just that when we think about,\nright, everybody sees security and\n\n48\n00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.970\nsees protection being something\na little bit different.\n\n49\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.690\nWe all think at some point in time\nbecause we're behind this nice,\n\n50\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.900\nsecure what we call a domain boundary,\nwell that means that the documents that I\n\n51\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.980\nuse inside of my domain,\nthey're protected.\n\n52\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.650\nIt also means emails that I tend to send\ninside are gonna be protected as well.\n\n53\n00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.180\nBut not everybody has the same level\n\n54\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.040\nof understanding of what\nthat protection may be.\n\n55\n00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.507\nSo you may have an inconsistency\nin what they actually do see and\n\n56\n00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.383\nthink is really the protection of that.\n\n57\n00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:18.712\nSo in that way it might\nbe a training issue,\n\n58\n00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:22.793\nwhere we don't actually let them know\nhow we're protecting the data, and\n\n59\n00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:26.001\nwhy they need to use some of\nthe protections that we offer.\n\n60\n00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.455\nIt may be that somebody just goes,\nI haven't used it before in five or\n\n61\n00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:31.731\nten years,\nwhy do I need to use it now, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:35.576\nSo now you have that inconsistency, and\nso that person begins to spread out,\n\n63\n00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:39.087\nI wouldn't worry about that,\njust send it, just do what you need to.\n\n64\n00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:40.991\nJust get that document\nwhere it needs to go,\n\n65\n00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.001\nand don't worry about\nall the other stuff so.\n\n66\n00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.469\n&gt;&gt; They could expect ongoing training,\n\n67\n00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.715\nalways keeping up to date\ncurrent technologies.\n\n68\n00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:53.099\n&gt;&gt; Right yeah, so users are a big part of\nthose issues that we tend to face that\n\n69\n00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.140\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n70\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.020\nThe other one though that comes\ndown to it also depends on\n\n71\n00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.120\nwho is actually responsible for\nprotecting the data itself.\n\n72\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.120\nSo the term that you'll hear,\nof course, in this arena,\n\n73\n00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.250\nat least a generic term,\nis what we call data custodians.\n\n74\n00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.970\nData custodians are the ones that\nreally implement the technology\n\n75\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.080\nthat helps us to protect that.\n\n76\n00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.177\nThe problem is that is shifts though,\nokay?\n\n77\n00:04:20.177 --> 00:04:22.577\nSo, it might be Zach is an executive at\n\n78\n00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:23.867\nthe company,\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n79\n00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:28.691\n&gt;&gt; And if he's an executive at\nthe company, he may send something and\n\n80\n00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.237\neven though he marks it as internal only,\nokay?\n\n81\n00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:36.934\nOr he doesn't mark it and he goes,\nall right, everything that I say or do or\n\n82\n00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:40.470\nput down on paper should\njust be internal only.\n\n83\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.820\nWell, how does the data custodian\nknow what's actually supposed to be\n\n84\n00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.740\nreally guarded as being secret and\nprivate and needs protection, and\n\n85\n00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.870\nwhich is just public information?\n\n86\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.950\nIf Zach forgets them then he comes out and\ngoes,\n\n87\n00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.310\nI don't know why you don't understand\nthat I'm the CEO of this company.\n\n88\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.150\nI'm an executive of this company,\n\n89\n00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.860\neverything that I say is\nprotected communication.\n\n90\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.670\nWell, now you're actually putting that on\nresponsibility of the person that's just\n\n91\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.230\nimplementing technology, to decide for\nZach whether it's protected or not.\n\n92\n00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.990\nSo, they have to make that decision\nwhen the decision should really\n\n93\n00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.960\ncome from Zach himself.\n\n94\n00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.350\nSo in that sense, even custodians,\n\n95\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.060\ntechnical handlers of the data,\nnow have to decide on which particular\n\n96\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.840\ndata to protect ,and which isn't\nconsidered protected at times, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.320\nAnd that means it's gonna be inconsistent\nthroughout the organization as well.\n\n98\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.380\nAnd this is where we also have\nissues dealing with that, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.880\nSo those problems, and\nthose issues arise from, well really,\n\n100\n00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.880\nthe idea of assumption on Zach's part,\nI'm picking on Zach here,\n\n101\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.940\nas an executive of just saying,\nRonnie should know, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.650\nHe should absolutely know that everything\nthat comes out in my office should be\n\n103\n00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.990\nabsolutely protected,\nencrypted with whatever do.\n\n104\n00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.130\nI shouldn't have to worry about it,\nit should just happen.\n\n105\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.870\nWell, then he sends out a happy\nbirthday message to somebody.\n\n106\n00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.492\nDoes that actually need to be protected?\n\n107\n00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:05.950\nAnd Zach calls that's silly,\nyou shouldn't have protected that one.\n\n108\n00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.480\nWell, but\nhe said everything at one point, so\n\n109\n00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.210\nhe's having to make that decision and\nthen Zach does that same thing.\n\n110\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.370\nUse your best judgment, well, then at that\npoint, he's changed the game again, okay?\n\n111\n00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.830\nSo, there are issues that we have to deal\nwith in that sense, in that scenario.\n\n112\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.730\nWhich really shouldn't reside in the data\ncustodian, it should be the data owner.\n\n113\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.446\nThe one that originates the data or\nthe one that's actually responsible for\n\n114\n00:06:29.446 --> 00:06:32.127\nthe data, as who should also\nthink about that as well.\n\n115\n00:06:32.127 --> 00:06:34.255\n&gt;&gt; Best practices and so forth, right?\n\n116\n00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:39.225\n&gt;&gt; Right, now the other issue that may\nbe problematic that we have to also\n\n117\n00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:44.585\naddress of course, as far as email and\ndocument protection goes,\n\n118\n00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:48.430\nis the technology that we put in place\nto help us to do some of the stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.350\nNow in that particular\nidea of the technology,\n\n120\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.710\nwe have to worry about all the technology,\nright?\n\n121\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.500\nNot only where does the data reside right\nnow, but where is it going to end up to.\n\n122\n00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.860\nSo I might be able to protect\ndata that comes in to my laptop.\n\n123\n00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.080\nIt might be a Windows base laptop and\nI can Implement things like group policy,\n\n124\n00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.920\nI can do stuff like that,\nand make that work.\n\n125\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.940\nBut what if I'm on a Mac laptop, and\ngroup policy doesn't seem to apply there,\n\n126\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.350\non the Linux laptop, and\ndoesn't apply there.\n\n127\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.580\nWell now, it becomes inconsistent.\n\n128\n00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.350\nOr, we move on to those devices\nthat really aren't designed for\n\n129\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.810\nany type of production, such as the idea\nof smartphones, the idea of tablets.\n\n130\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.600\nThese particular devices in which\nwe all become accustomed to for\n\n131\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.510\nthe sake of convenience, but there's\nno real protection there in that one.\n\n132\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.260\nSo we have to worry\nabout end user devices.\n\n133\n00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.800\nAnd then at some point, we're probably\ngonna limit the type of devices that\n\n134\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.130\nwe're gonna allow to get access into our\ndata and to our company as well, okay?\n\n135\n00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:51.458\nThen of course, even security devices\nthat we put on our network to help us.\n\n136\n00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:55.745\nMost of the security devices, most,\nI'm not saying all of them, most of\n\n137\n00:07:55.745 --> 00:08:00.587\nthe security devices that we implement,\nOn networks tend to guard the perimeter,\n\n138\n00:08:00.587 --> 00:08:06.270\nin other words blocking bad guys from\nthe outside, from getting inside, okay?\n\n139\n00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.270\nThat's usually how we do it,\n\n140\n00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.890\nwhether we're talking about some\ntype of network access control.\n\n141\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:16.670\nOr we're talking about using some type\nof NGFW, the Next Generation Firewall.\n\n142\n00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:22.110\nOr using a web application firewall,\nwhatever it might be, it\n\n143\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.420\nreally is about protecting access from the\noutside and from getting inbound, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.240\nSo that's where we had that.\n\n145\n00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.640\nThen does protect us in that sense.\n\n146\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.120\nBut it really doesn't protect\neven data on the inside as well.\n\n147\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.760\n&gt;&gt; That's what I was gonna ask you,\nwhat do we have or\n\n148\n00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.560\nwhat can we have in place for\nthe inside of our enterprise?\n\n149\n00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.200\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,\n\n150\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.890\nthose are some of the things that\nwe have to actually think about.\n\n151\n00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.730\nWell, inside then we'd have to use kinda\nthe standard technologies that we've\n\n152\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.573\nalready talked about.\n\n153\n00:08:48.573 --> 00:08:52.982\nMaybe some type of access control policy.\n\n154\n00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:57.000\nIt maybe where we implement\nthings like whitelisting and\n\n155\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.690\nblacklisting of certain things as well.\n\n156\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.350\nSo there are policies\nthat we can set in place,\n\n157\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.260\nmaybe even internally to help us out\na little bit more to get that done.\n\n158\n00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.920\nThat's where were heading is that\nidea that we'll call policy's\n\n159\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.910\nthat we might see.\n\n160\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So even though\n\n161\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.260\nwe might protect ourselves\nat certain boundaries.\n\n162\n00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.400\nNow we move into the realm that we've\nbeen dealing with in Office 365,\n\n163\n00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.400\nis that data not only exists on premises.\n\n164\n00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.400\nBut data may also exist in the Cloud\njust like Zack is talking about.\n\n165\n00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.315\nNow, some of those\nprotections that you set for\n\n166\n00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:31.860\non-premises itself,\nit doesn't apply in the Cloud anymore.\n\n167\n00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.130\nSo this is where it becomes\na little bit more and\n\n168\n00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.370\nnow you have to manage multiple systems.\n\n169\n00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:40.720\nTurn on the management of things up in\nthe Cloud as well as on-premises, and\n\n170\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.260\nnow we've got a couple of\nother complication, right?\n\n171\n00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.780\nComplexity levels that we've add in.\n\n172\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.390\nSo there are many problems\nthat we can address,\n\n173\n00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.970\nthat we can think about\nwhen it comes down to\n\n174\n00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.890\nprotecting especially things like our\ndata, like our documents, and our email.\n\n175\n00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.516\nNow, the system that we're talking about,\nokay?\n\n176\n00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:05.940\nThat we've also shown in\nthe show really does kind of\n\n177\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.260\nhelp us in every aspect of what we're\ndealing with even on something like this.\n\n178\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.580\nBut it's real effort of what we're talking\nabout,of course is rights management when\n\n179\n00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.600\nwe get to it.\n\n180\n00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.190\nBut this is actually kind of a key\naspect of something that we do need to\n\n181\n00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.560\nunderstand, okay?\n\n182\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.979\nIs all the protections we've\njust talked about, okay?\n\n183\n00:10:24.979 --> 00:10:31.790\nAs far as protecting data, it helps, but\nit doesn't fully protect the data itself.\n\n184\n00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.600\nIt is really about protecting\ndevices that house the data.\n\n185\n00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.390\nIt is about protecting the data\npathway and communication themselves.\n\n186\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.830\nEncryption, okay, is the only one that's\nreally about protecting the data itself.\n\n187\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.320\nAnd even encryption has its own problems,\nZach.\n\n188\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.390\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The very fact is somebody can steal\n\n189\n00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.940\nthat particular key that I said this is\nthe key you use to unlock my data, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.520\nSo, Zach, somewhere in between\nsomebody could make a copy of it.\n\n191\n00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.290\nAnd then I send it,\nthey make a copy of the data.\n\n192\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.670\nThey can unlock the key as well\nbecause they made a copy of the key.\n\n193\n00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.660\nSo, even encryption itself\ncan have some issues.\n\n194\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:12.410\nSo we addressed it in the show when we\nused Azure Rights Management to help us\n\n195\n00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.310\nout And we showed where you can implement\nsome type of encryption And that was\n\n196\n00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.250\na part of it and that's really kind of the\nbig part that I emphasized in the show.\n\n197\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.351\nBut it really is just a small sliver\nof some of the things that we have to\n\n198\n00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.076\ndo, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:25.076 --> 00:11:27.487\nBut we also have to realize something,\n\n200\n00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:31.220\nthat even though there\nare problems that are there.\n\n201\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.135\nThose are not the only thing that we\naddress when it come to protecting data\n\n202\n00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:37.030\nand the email as well, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.000\nAnd that is the realm of what we call\nbusiness requirements that we may\n\n204\n00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.930\nactually think about too.\n\n205\n00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:47.360\nSo let's take from the example here, the\nexample that is used with Zach just for\n\n206\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.680\na moment, okay?\n\n207\n00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.000\nIn that particular example,\n\n208\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.960\nokay, where Zach is saying,\nhere is the protected email.\n\n209\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.790\nWell, what if Zach actually\nsends an email and\n\n210\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.720\nhe says, this should only go out to\ncertain people in the organization, okay?\n\n211\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.770\nSo there's an email group that he creates\nthat he only sends it out to those people.\n\n212\n00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.000\nWell now let's say that Ronnie\nis one of those people and\n\n213\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.210\nhe didn't like being dressed down by\nZach publicly in the way that he did for\n\n214\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.900\nnot handling his documents\nthe way that he wants to.\n\n215\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.430\nAnd now,\nwhat does Ronnie do with that email?\n\n216\n00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.510\nOkay, he might just go I'm gonna forward\nthis to so and so, so and so, so and\n\n217\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.410\nso outside of this group.\n\n218\n00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.354\n&gt;&gt; Not good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, it's not good, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:30.354 --> 00:12:33.970\nBut at the same time,\nit's not protected anymore, right?\n\n220\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.590\nOnce it got in my hands, whatever\nZack said, it should be protected.\n\n221\n00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.990\nNow it's in my hands,\nI forward that on to whoever I want to.\n\n222\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:46.400\nWell, I may need to actually implement\nin terms of policies of saying,\n\n223\n00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.320\nit can't do that.\n\n224\n00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.240\nOnce it gets to them,\n\n225\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.320\nthey're not suppose to send it to\nanybody outside of the organization.\n\n226\n00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.344\nWell, we may actually have to\naddress something like that.\n\n227\n00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:56.407\nThe same thing with our documents,\n\n228\n00:12:56.407 --> 00:13:00.160\nthey shouldn't leave our\norganization as well, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.580\nSo in that sense we're actually\neven being seen by somebody else\n\n230\n00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.540\noutside of the organization So\nwe have to think about that too.\n\n231\n00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.850\n&gt;&gt; What about attacks Ronnie?\n\n232\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.978\nWhat about being attacked from\nthe outside into the enterprise as well?\n\n233\n00:13:11.978 --> 00:13:15.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that\nattacks are another thing, right?\n\n234\n00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:18.040\nSo the idea that even internally we have\n\n235\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.150\nissues that we have to deal with in terms\nof protecting emails and documents.\n\n236\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.800\nWe also have to worry about the compliance\nissues that maybe there that can be easily\n\n237\n00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.960\nviolated.\n\n238\n00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.710\nWe also have to defend against\nattacks as well, right?\n\n239\n00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.320\nSo this idea of attacks by something\nlike an unauthorized user, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.010\nWell, how do we protect against\nthat if they steal the data itself?\n\n241\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.280\nWell, our protection right now is\nwhatever our protection is, but\n\n242\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.980\nwhat if it's actually just doing\nsomething using access control.\n\n243\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.470\nWe move it,\nwe move that document off our drives and\n\n244\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.430\nthey store it onto their own laptop.\n\n245\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.130\nA lot of times those particular things\ndon't transfer onto another device and\n\n246\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.470\nnow is unprotected.\n\n247\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.630\nSo you have to worry\nabout attacks like that.\n\n248\n00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.960\nYou can also think about malicious\nsoftware that elevates it's own privileges\n\n249\n00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.470\nto be able to run whatever they need\nto to get access to that document.\n\n250\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.570\nSo you can even have malicious software\ndo something like that as well.\n\n251\n00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.130\nOr it might be the idea of\nmalicious software that is\n\n252\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.930\nactually has authorized\naccess at some point.\n\n253\n00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.640\nThey've stolen some credentials,\nthey've spoofed something and\n\n254\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.540\nnow they're also able to\ndo what they want to.\n\n255\n00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.490\nSo malicious users with some\ntype of authorization can do it,\n\n256\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.510\nunauthorized attacks,\nmalware, you name it.\n\n257\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.120\nAll these are things that we\nalso need protection from too.\n\n258\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.750\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back to this, how does\nAzure Rights Management protect us?\n\n259\n00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's actually the key\npoint that we really want to get to.\n\n260\n00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.850\nSo, this whole show is really about\nfilling in that gap that we need.\n\n261\n00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.650\nSo let me go back and\nshow you this point as a reminder\n\n262\n00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.670\nof some of those things that\nwe've already done, okay?\n\n263\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.030\nSo I've actually turn it off so\nthat we can see it.\n\n264\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.540\nSo one of the first things when we\nwent into Azure Right Management,\n\n265\n00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.000\nyou've got a couple of options,\nof course there's PowerShell.\n\n266\n00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.530\nAnd you can go through the interface.\n\n267\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.050\nAnd I wanted to show you at least\nthe steps through the interface\n\n268\n00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.180\nof what we had enabled, but I turned\nit off after we were done with this.\n\n269\n00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:09.700\nSo I just selected the Admin Center.\n\n270\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.590\nFrom the Admin Center,\n\n271\n00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.410\nthat brought me to Settings where I\ncan scroll down on the left-hand side.\n\n272\n00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.820\nAnd then I selected Services and Add-ins.\n\n273\n00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.990\nFrom there, I scroll down and I look for\nMicrosoft Azure Information Protection.\n\n274\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:29.270\nNow if you're going, Ronnie you mentioned\nthat Azure Rights Management and\n\n275\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:34.960\nAzure Information Protection are actually\nidentical when it comes don to it,\n\n276\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.380\nit's just a change.\n\n277\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.560\nYes and no, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.540\nSo when you start looking at it is what\nyou're going to find first to help\n\n279\n00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.787\nyou to navigate to where you need to be,\nokay?\n\n280\n00:15:45.787 --> 00:15:49.459\nSo from this point you select that and\nyou click on that link,\n\n281\n00:15:49.459 --> 00:15:53.347\nand then once you do that,\nI want to show you, right here you'll\n\n282\n00:15:53.347 --> 00:15:57.821\nsee that it actually says Manage your\nInformation Protection Settings.\n\n283\n00:15:57.821 --> 00:16:01.236\nAnd when you do so, notice it flipped\nyou right into rights management.\n\n284\n00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:02.023\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n285\n00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:05.960\n&gt;&gt; So this is why I said that, it pretty\nmuch is kinda the same thing here.\n\n286\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.520\n&gt;&gt; It's linked.\n\n287\n00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.420\n&gt;&gt; But in reality, Azure Information\nProduction is the bigger picture, okay?\n\n288\n00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.270\nSo this one at the very beginning,\nit begins.\n\n289\n00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.270\nIt says rights management safeguard\nyour emails, and documents,\n\n290\n00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.450\nand helps you securely share\nthis data with your colleagues.\n\n291\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.960\nTo enable rights management,\nyou just click Activate.\n\n292\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.600\nAnd that's all you're doing,\nas you're simply activating it.\n\n293\n00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.910\nFrom this point, you are actually\nactivating it, not only for\n\n294\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.670\nthings like email, and your documents, but\nnotice even for exchange which is gonna be\n\n295\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.980\nemail, SharePoint which manages\nof course our documents.\n\n296\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.960\nAnd then of course,\neven the servers themselves, so\n\n297\n00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.790\nthis really does protect essentially\nworkflows that we have in place.\n\n298\n00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.330\nAnd we select Activate at that point, and\n\n299\n00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.680\nnow Rights Management essentially\nis gonna be activated.\n\n300\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.930\nAnd all we're really looking for\nnow, of course,\n\n301\n00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.440\nis gonna be our Rights Management is\nactivated, with the green check mark.\n\n302\n00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.740\nAnd that sets into place\na couple of different things.\n\n303\n00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.580\nSo the Azure Information Protection,\n\n304\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.500\nwhich is kind of the umbrella term that\nwe're using, the technology driving\n\n305\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.940\nAzure Information Production, is what\nwe called the Azure Rights Management.\n\n306\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.385\nAnd the activation is as\nsimple as just a few click.\n\n307\n00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:23.100\nNow of course, do not forget that this\n\n308\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.010\nwill normally also require a little\nbit of additional subscription.\n\n309\n00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.860\nSo I think it's actually $2 a month,\nor maybe $4 a month.\n\n310\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.390\n&gt;&gt; Not gonna.\n\n311\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but whatever it is, right, it's\nprobably gonna be worth it because it's\n\n312\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.770\ngonna protect your data\nin a different way.\n\n313\n00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.490\nSo back to Zach's question here.\n\n314\n00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.884\nSo now that, I'm hoping this for fresh\nat least old point of what you're asking\n\n315\n00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:44.025\ninto that seeing and\ndoing to a little bit, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:44.025 --> 00:17:45.230\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n317\n00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.255\n&gt;&gt; So let's talk about what\nthe whole thing really does for us?\n\n318\n00:17:48.255 --> 00:17:51.210\nRights Management provides a solution for\n\n319\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.890\neverything that we have\nactually talked about, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.370\nAnd it does it in a couple of ways.\n\n321\n00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.580\nWhen we think about\nthe idea of the encryption,\n\n322\n00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.300\nwhich is what I emphasize during the show,\nis really a small part of it.\n\n323\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:04.980\nBut most end-users,\n\n324\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.480\nthat's what they're gonna see as\nbeing the big part of it, okay?\n\n325\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.010\nMost end-users don't care about the other\nthings that are actually involved in it.\n\n326\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.400\nBut we as administrators, should\nunderstand how powerful this is, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.050\nWhen we go into the realm of Rights\nManagement, what we are saying is that,\n\n328\n00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.980\nwe are protecting the data in this way.\n\n329\n00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.900\nIt's not only about encryption, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:33.190\nBut, what it is though, it actually says,\nhere's how we grant access.\n\n331\n00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.600\nIf you have a valid user name and\n\n332\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.690\npassword, then you can\nget access to that data.\n\n333\n00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.170\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n334\n00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.850\nIt's about identity protection\nis what it's about, right?\n\n335\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.720\nSo it actually links the protection\nof your documents and\n\n336\n00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.130\nyour emails, to your identity itself.\n\n337\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.130\nYou get to decide, how far that stuff\ntravels, and how it doesn't travel.\n\n338\n00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.920\nSo for example, let's go back to that.\n\n339\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.620\nLet me show you a diagram here, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.380\nSo, let's take it like this here, okay?\n\n341\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.550\nAnd this is kind of a reminder, okay?\n\n342\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.540\nSo, if Cherokee sends me a document that's\nactually attached to an email that's\n\n343\n00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.080\nsent to me, and I say, I need to\ntake that particular attachment, and\n\n344\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.300\nI store it into a shared drive,\nZach at some point, he has also\n\n345\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.610\naccess to that shared drive, he can look\naround, he can do whatever he wants to.\n\n346\n00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.820\nLet's say that, he has read and\nexecute permissions to do so, for\n\n347\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.260\nwhatever reason he has them, okay?\n\n348\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.520\nHe though, can take that file just like\nI described a little bit earlier here.\n\n349\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.520\nHe can take that, and\nhe can forward it out to, let's say,\n\n350\n00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.480\nDaniel over here at outlook.com, okay?\n\n351\n00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.940\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwhat if we didn't want that to happen?\n\n352\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.180\nWhat if we didn't want it to live here,\nokay?\n\n353\n00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.160\nWell, this is where Rights\nmanagement helps us out.\n\n354\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.505\nBecause first and foremost,\nwhen we start dealing with the idea of\n\n355\n00:19:51.505 --> 00:19:56.490\nRights Management,\nit is about policy-based protection,\n\n356\n00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.380\nand our document retention itself or\nour data retention itself, and\n\n357\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.290\nthat means I can create a policy,\nor for Zach, if we want to.\n\n358\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.360\nWhere he says,\nthis is only to go to this one group.\n\n359\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.520\nSo it doesn't matter,\n\n360\n00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.500\nif Ronnie stores it here, If Zach wasn't\na part of that group, guess what?\n\n361\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.240\nHe doesn't get access to that file, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.820\nThat's what it can come down to,\nif we wanted to.\n\n363\n00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:28.590\nIt doesn't matter that Zach had access to\nthe entire folder that I have access to,\n\n364\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.410\nit just says,\nif Zach's not a part of that group,\n\n365\n00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.500\nbecause of the policy, and\nhe doesn't get access to it, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.710\nWe can even have it in this point here,\nwhere we actually set it up to say,\n\n367\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.710\nlook, we're protecting it to where\nthis is not gonna happen either.\n\n368\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.930\nWhere is not meant to leave\nthe organizational e-mail.\n\n369\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:54.480\nSo, that means, if he doesn't have a dot,\nlet's say a itprotvdemo.com address,\n\n370\n00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.060\nand it doesn't get to be sent\nout here to outlook.com, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.067\nWe can even add in protection like that,\nto help us out in that way, okay?\n\n372\n00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:05.620\nAnd this is probably more common.\n\n373\n00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.560\nMost of us have actually seen this before,\nif you bought a piece of music out on\n\n374\n00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.030\nthe internet,\nI think I addressed this during the show.\n\n375\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.660\nIf you've actually downloaded from\nwhatever Google Play, or Amazon, or\n\n376\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.630\nwhatever it is, and you got,\njust take my copy and put it on.\n\n377\n00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.810\nDon't do that, okay?\n\n378\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.780\nBut, do that it's not looking for what,\nit's looking for someone's identity.\n\n379\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.920\nFor Zach's identity, for my identity, and\n\n380\n00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.840\nit doesn't see that, then it goes,\nyou're not authorized to use this.\n\n381\n00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.320\nWell this is a kinda the same system here.\n\n382\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.070\nWhere does our offer and\nprotection based on my identity instead,\n\n383\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.910\nnot based on the DevicesOtron, whether it\ncan track a billion lines of code or not.\n\n384\n00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.430\nIt's saying you're not\nthe person you claim to be,\n\n385\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.310\nyou don't have the valid username,\npassword.\n\n386\n00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.350\nYou don't have the protection,\n\n387\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:54.640\nyou don't have the ability to unlock this,\nif you don't have it, okay?\n\n388\n00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.930\nSo, that's why this is\nactually an important concept,\n\n389\n00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.460\nin what we actually end up doing here.\n\n390\n00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.910\nSo in that sense, that is what's\ncalled Rights Management service, is\n\n391\n00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:08.570\nit's actually protecting those documents\nlike that, regardless of where they are.\n\n392\n00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.770\nIf they're inside of my protected domain,\nor\n\n393\n00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.060\nif they're outside the protected domain.\n\n394\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.030\nThey're protected first by encryption,\nwhich is again is the lowest level.\n\n395\n00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.300\nBut then by my own identify, if I want to.\n\n396\n00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.230\nSo it has a link to my identity.\n\n397\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.780\nSo even if they got to Daniel's inbox.\n\n398\n00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.840\nDaniel tries to open up and\nsays, prove it.\n\n399\n00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.717\nAnd Daniel doesn't have the actual\nauthentication on his machine, or\n\n400\n00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:35.860\nhis particular software to say yes,\nI am that person that is allowed to see.\n\n401\n00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.589\nSo, if it's not there, it's not there.\n\n402\n00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:40.980\nAnd is all based on\nthe policy that we set.\n\n403\n00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:46.120\nSo it's really, really good, cuz that\nmeans that now, if Zach actually marks it\n\n404\n00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.340\nas being confidential, he can restrict\nit to that group that he wants to.\n\n405\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.130\nHe can limit to whatever he wants to.\n\n406\n00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.600\nIt's not really based around encryption.\n\n407\n00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.301\nSo encryption's a part of it, but\nit's not really the whole thing, okay?\n\n408\n00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:02.727\nWith the Azure Information Protection,\nand what it does for us,\n\n409\n00:23:02.727 --> 00:23:08.235\nIt allows us to go ahead and classify our\ndata in other words our document itself.\n\n410\n00:23:08.235 --> 00:23:12.270\nIt allows to be able to add labels for\nthe protection that we want,\n\n411\n00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.180\nit protects our company's emails, and\ndocuments by allowing us to do that, and\n\n412\n00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.180\nthen in the background Azure Rights\nManagement as a system, it uses\n\n413\n00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.690\ndigital certificates, to essentially\nmanage the rest of that system here.\n\n414\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.860\nSay, here's a policy that Zach set,\nor that was set for\n\n415\n00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.090\nZach's emails, as they come out that,\nthis is what has to happen to them.\n\n416\n00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.060\nSo, it can be that way, and\nthere's multiple polices that can be set,\n\n417\n00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.480\nit doesn't only have to be one.\n\n418\n00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.480\nBut you name it, it can do that.\n\n419\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.600\nSo the entire system itself,\nin terms of Azure Rights Management,\n\n420\n00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.250\nit is bigger than the way that we\njust described it on the show.\n\n421\n00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.145\nSo if you're saying, well why did you\nonly describe it that way on the show?\n\n422\n00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:53.640\nBecause that's what was really called\nout for the exam objectives itself.\n\n423\n00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.792\n&gt;&gt; And that's what's important.\n\n424\n00:23:54.792 --> 00:23:57.744\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and so\nthis one is just to kind of help\n\n425\n00:23:57.744 --> 00:24:01.611\nyou to set more context To\nwhat you're gonna see there.\n\n426\n00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:04.087\nWhen you get in to the 70-347 show,\n\n427\n00:24:04.087 --> 00:24:07.697\nwe'll show you how this also\nintegrates in with Exchange and\n\n428\n00:24:07.697 --> 00:24:12.490\nsome of the other products that you\nalso see, to help you out there too.\n\n429\n00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.970\nSo we'll be doing that show as well,\nso make sure you check that out.\n\n430\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.170\nBut we just wanted to provide a little\nbit more information just in case you\n\n431\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.340\nthought Azure Rights Management is really\nall about just the idea of encryption.\n\n432\n00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.910\nIt really isn't, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.610\nIt really goes to the whole concept,\n\n434\n00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.060\nright, that it can protect our data\nregardless of where it goes, okay?\n\n435\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.540\nAnd then secondly,\nit is tied to our identity as well.\n\n436\n00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.700\nAnd that's all set up by starting\noff with that single check mark.\n\n437\n00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.310\nAnd then from that point, it can expand\nas we now can create policies behind it.\n\n438\n00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.095\nAnd once we do that, everything now gets\nprotected as it actually is inside of our\n\n439\n00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:53.250\norganization or\neven moves outside of the organization.\n\n440\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.460\nSo Zach, that's really kind of the thought\nthat I wanted to make sure that everybody\n\n441\n00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.370\nunderstood, as we kind of\nadded in this bonus episode to\n\n442\n00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.370\nfill out some of the knowledge\ngaps that we may,\n\n443\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:07.040\nhave especially about something like\nAzure Rights Managements cuz it's huge.\n\n444\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.110\nAnd this is something that\nwe're not gonna get away from.\n\n445\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.610\nThis is an increasingly\npopular technology.\n\n446\n00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.070\nAnd it is gonna be something that you\nare gonna have to be familiar with.\n\n447\n00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.500\nSo I recommend that you check\nout Azure Rights Management.\n\n448\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.130\nGo to Microsoft's website and\nlook up docs.microsoft.com, and\n\n449\n00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.870\ntype in Azure Rights Management.\n\n450\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.580\nIt is worth your time and\neffort to understand it better.\n\n451\n00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.410\nBecause this is gonna be the wave of\nthe future in terms of data protection,\n\n452\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.480\nbecause it goes so far.\n\n453\n00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.131\nProtecting my data even outside\nof my organizational boundaries,\n\n454\n00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:42.352\nthat's incredible.\n\n455\n00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:46.814\nIt means I don't have to, not that I\nshouldn't worry about it, but it means if\n\n456\n00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:51.370\nI have this on, right, I do not have\nto worry as much about it than I think.\n\n457\n00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.180\nSo it really does help.\n\n458\n00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.576\nThis actually puts a little\nbit more peace in my mind,\n\n459\n00:25:56.576 --> 00:26:01.709\nthat even if somebody were to steal my\ndata, okay, if they don't have the keys,\n\n460\n00:26:01.709 --> 00:26:06.322\nif they can't break my identity code,\nthen I'm actually okay with it.\n\n461\n00:26:06.322 --> 00:26:08.710\nIt's not that I'm okay with\nthe fact that it left.\n\n462\n00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:11.400\nBut I'm actually going, okay,\nI know it's still protected.\n\n463\n00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.240\nBecause I have a system in place that\nprotects the data regardless of its\n\n464\n00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.630\nlocation.\n\n465\n00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.660\nAnd I'm pretty cool with that, okay?\n\n466\n00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.878\nSo Zach,\nthat's pretty much what I wanted to share.\n\n467\n00:26:20.878 --> 00:26:23.116\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, document and email protection,\n\n468\n00:26:23.116 -->
