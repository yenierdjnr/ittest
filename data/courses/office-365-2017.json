show.\n\n3\n00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:15.134\nThis particular overview is actually meant\nto help you to not only get ready for\n\n4\n00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:19.568\nthe exam, but to also prepare you for\nimplementing Office 365 for\n\n5\n00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:23.105\na company or for\na customer that you may have, as well.\n\n6\n00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:24.315\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n7\n00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:27.714\ntake a look at what you have to do\nto get through this exam, as well.\n\n8\n00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.282\nSome of the exam details.\n\n9\n00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:32.776\nI simply took a search engine that\nI launched up through my browser.\n\n10\n00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.981\nTyped in exam 70-346.\n\n11\n00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.581\nThat number is gonna be very helpful for\nyou.\n\n12\n00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:41.741\nAnd also take a note at\nthe exam title itself.\n\n13\n00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.559\nManage Office 365 Identities and\nRequirements.\n\n14\n00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.528\nBoth of those are going to be necessary\nas you register for the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:53.731\nWhether it's through Pearson VUE\nonline portal itself, or\n\n16\n00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.685\nwhether you go to a Pearson VUE center and\nyou decide to register manually,\n\n17\n00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.602\nboth of those are actually\ngonna be used at some point.\n\n18\n00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:03.448\nThey're either gonna ask you for\nthe name of the exam, or\n\n19\n00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:05.939\nthey're gonna ask you to\nverify the exam number,\n\n20\n00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.058\nyou'll need to know both of them to make\nsure that you can get scheduled in, okay?\n\n21\n00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:14.417\nThis particular exam itself\nhas been around for a long,\n\n22\n00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:19.532\nI say a long time, a while,\nat least since February of 2014.\n\n23\n00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:24.825\nSo it is a relatively mature\nexam in terms of what we see.\n\n24\n00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:30.315\nNow that doesn't mean that this exam\nthough in what we've also prepared for\n\n25\n00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:32.989\nin the show is going to be old, okay?\n\n26\n00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.263\nAnd that is because, as of June 2017,\n\n27\n00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.719\nthe exam itself has been updated.\n\n28\n00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.457\nSo make sure you check this out, okay?\n\n29\n00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:49.991\nIf you're actually of course past June of\n2017, you're gonna need to download and\n\n30\n00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:54.806\nreview all of the changes that were\nmade to the exam objectives themselves.\n\n31\n00:01:54.806 --> 00:02:00.129\nThe exam objectives are actually broken\nout into six different domains divided\n\n32\n00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.464\nup by different percentages that you may\nactually end up seeing as well, okay?\n\n33\n00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:10.242\nSo those domains of course will divide up\ninto skills that you'll need to be aware\n\n34\n00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:10.746\nof too.\n\n35\n00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:15.424\nNow just when we talk about those\nskills and understanding them,\n\n36\n00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:19.861\nit doesn't mean that those\nare limited to those skills only.\n\n37\n00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.807\nIf I flip on over here,\nthis is where that link takes you.\n\n38\n00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.647\nHere is the latest exam\nobjectives according\n\n39\n00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:29.411\nto the site that they've changed here, and\n\n40\n00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:34.132\nyou can see where it says, document\nshows changes to scoping statements.\n\n41\n00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:38.196\nThese changes were\neffective as of June 2017.\n\n42\n00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:43.170\nYou wanna make sure that you are prepared\nfor this exam, not only by, of course,\n\n43\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.244\nunderstanding what\nthe skills measured are, but\n\n44\n00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:48.754\nnotice who should take the exam itself.\n\n45\n00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:49.912\nSo at this point,\n\n46\n00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:54.408\nyou have to actually be experienced\nin a couple of different things.\n\n47\n00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:57.148\nAnd this is what I want\nyou to focus in on.\n\n48\n00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:01.840\nCandidates should have experience\nwith Office 365 admin center, and\n\n49\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.231\nunderstanding of Microsoft Exchange\nOnline, Skype for Business,\n\n50\n00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:11.625\nSharePoint Online, Office 365 ProPlus,\nand Windows Azure Active Directory.\n\n51\n00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:14.875\nAnd it also includes experience\nin service descriptions,\n\n52\n00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:18.710\nconfiguration integration services,\nwith identity management and\n\n53\n00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.264\non premises infrastructure, to support\nsome of the business requirements here.\n\n54\n00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:28.110\nSo this is not meant for someone is just\nsaying, hey, I'm just jumping at this and\n\n55\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.792\nI should just jump right into Office 365.\n\n56\n00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:35.064\nNow it doesn't mean that can't do that,\nknow it means it's gonna be much more\n\n57\n00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:39.142\ndifficult for you if you don't have\nsome of those skills already set down,\n\n58\n00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:43.111\nor if you're not familiar with\nthe products that are listed right here.\n\n59\n00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:48.361\nSo my suggestions, of course,\nis that before you end up just taking even\n\n60\n00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:53.609\nthis first exam, make sure you also\ntake a look at the 70-347 skill\n\n61\n00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.687\nobjectives there as well to understand\nhow you enable the services and\n\n62\n00:03:58.687 --> 00:04:03.679\nmanage those services as well to get\nall those things up an running and\n\n63\n00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.636\nunderstand those products too, okay?\n\n64\n00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:10.541\nSo that way you'll be familiar with some\nof the requirements that they're talking\n\n65\n00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.498\nabout this way too.\n\n66\n00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:15.301\nSo once you have that in your mind and\nyou're ready to go,\n\n67\n00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:19.598\nhere are some of the episodes\nthat we should be covering, okay?\n\n68\n00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:24.196\nUnderneath the provisioning,\nwe talk about provisioning tenants, okay?\n\n69\n00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.366\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n70\n00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.992\nAnd how do we begin to do it?\n\n71\n00:04:26.992 --> 00:04:28.953\nAnd what are the best practices for those?\n\n72\n00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:34.307\nWe also begin to add in and configure,\nof course, a custom domain.\n\n73\n00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:39.762\nAnd when we talk about, we'll also talk\nabout of course the use of DNS ownership.\n\n74\n00:04:39.762 --> 00:04:43.610\nWe'll also take a look at registering\nthose DNS records the way that we need\n\n75\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.230\nto as well.\n\n76\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.809\nAnd the updating and\nverifying domain settings.\n\n77\n00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:52.427\nThe ones that we see in red are of course,\nthe added end objectives that we had,\n\n78\n00:04:52.427 --> 00:04:57.560\nor a change objective that has been\nput in place since June of 2016.\n\n79\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.866\nWe also go through planning a pilot and\n\n80\n00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:02.686\nwe'll take a look at\ndelegating pilot users.\n\n81\n00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:07.191\nWe will also end up running some of these\ndifferent tests here that they talk about.\n\n82\n00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:12.043\nAs well as understanding the use\nof the fast track Office to\n\n83\n00:05:12.043 --> 00:05:15.516\nonboard Office 365 services as well.\n\n84\n00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:19.749\nWe'll also of course configure all\nof our DNS records that we need to,\n\n85\n00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.933\nwe'll take a look at that as well and\nmake sure that they are working.\n\n86\n00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.067\nClient connectivity, we will of\ncourse address client connectivity.\n\n87\n00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:32.877\nWe'll talk about the ability to protect\nall of our files and documents the way\n\n88\n00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:37.771\nthat we want to with the integration with\nthe Azure Rights Management as well.\n\n89\n00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.279\nAnd we'll see some of\nthe set up templates for\n\n90\n00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.926\nRights Management to\nhelp us to protect email.\n\n91\n00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:48.569\nWe'll manage the administrator\nroles that are there and available.\n\n92\n00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.844\nWe'll talk about those roles briefly,\nmake sure you\n\n93\n00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:56.666\nunderstand where you configure those for\nyour users inside of Office 365.\n\n94\n00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:59.797\nWe'll also take a look at\ncloud identity management,\n\n95\n00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:04.372\nwhere we configure password management,\nas well as user and security groups.\n\n96\n00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:08.226\nWe'll also of course,\nimplement the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n97\n00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:11.285\nThis is probably the biggest update,\n\n98\n00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:15.785\nat least since the last domain\nwas updated here, okay?\n\n99\n00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:19.801\nNow it's not that they didn't call this\nout on a previous iteration of the exam.\n\n100\n00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:23.941\nIt's just that the tool may have been\navailable, but the tool may not have been\n\n101\n00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:27.023\navailable, because it was in\ntransition for a long time.\n\n102\n00:06:27.023 --> 00:06:30.379\nBut we'll actually get that\nimplemented when we prepare for\n\n103\n00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:33.424\nsingle sign on Active Directory for\nAzure AD Connect.\n\n104\n00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:36.049\nWe'll set up the Azure AD Connect\ntool itself and\n\n105\n00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:39.827\nthen we'll actually show you how to\nmanage Active Directory users and\n\n106\n00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:43.176\ngroups using the Connect tool\nwhile it's actually in place.\n\n107\n00:06:43.176 --> 00:06:46.600\nAnd we'll talk about the topology\nthat needs to be implemented as well.\n\n108\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.806\nThen probably the largest scope of\nwhat we'll deal with is the idea here\n\n109\n00:06:51.806 --> 00:06:57.622\nof using and implementing single sign-on\nbetween your on-premises domain,\n\n110\n00:06:57.622 --> 00:07:02.222\nas well as your Azure Active\nDirectory Federation Services and\n\n111\n00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.413\nyour domain up there as well.\n\n112\n00:07:04.413 --> 00:07:08.629\nSo we will, of course, plan out for\nActive Directory Federation Services.\n\n113\n00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.542\nWe'll install and manage the actual\nfederation server itself,\n\n114\n00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:17.174\nincluding the certificates, and\nwe'll also implement a proxy server too.\n\n115\n00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:20.797\nSo we'll see all that information that's\ngoing to be available there, too.\n\n116\n00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:25.632\nLastly, of course, we'll spend a little\nbit of time taking a look at reports.\n\n117\n00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:28.432\nWe'll talk about how we\ncan monitor to health,\n\n118\n00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:32.633\nand isolate service interruption\nusing the tools that are available.\n\n119\n00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:36.462\nIn this last section we also see some\nof these tools are deprecated and\n\n120\n00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:40.767\nwe'll mention some of the things that\nwe might have to be able to understand.\n\n121\n00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:44.412\nBut even though they're deprecated they're\nstill called out on the exam objectives.\n\n122\n00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:46.874\nSo make sure you pay attention there too.\n\n123\n00:07:46.874 --> 00:07:52.124\nBut overall though, if this seems like\nwhat you're heading your career towards,\n\n124\n00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:56.474\nor you're gonna be managing Office 365,\nthis is a great place for\n\n125\n00:07:56.474 --> 00:08:00.155\nyou to begin to understand how\nto get all that configured.\n\n126\n00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:04.544\nAnd you'll also be able to prepare for\nthis first exam and your MCSA.\n\n127\n00:08:04.544 --> 00:08:08.237\nSo, if you're ready to do that,\njoin us in the very next episode.\n\n128\n00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:14.379\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
