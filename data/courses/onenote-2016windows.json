00:00:11.700\nI'm your host Vonne Smith.\n\n4\n00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.300\nIn this course overview,\nwe are going to be discussing,\n\n5\n00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.120\nwell, what is this whole show about?\n\n6\n00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.820\nWho should be watching this show,\nwhat is our target audience?\n\n7\n00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.980\nWhat should I know before\nwe get started and\n\n8\n00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.840\nany extra tidbits that you might have for\nme.\n\n9\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.990\nSo let's talk about the topics.\n\n10\n00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.650\nWell, this is one show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.770\nThere is not any different levels, okay?\n\n12\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.700\nSo ti's just OneNote 2016.\n\n13\n00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.210\nWe cover everything from\nthe very beginning.\n\n14\n00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.230\nWe start with well, what is OneNote?\n\n15\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.130\nAnd what's the difference between\nOneNote 2016 and OneNote for Windows 10.\n\n16\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.890\nYeah.\n\n17\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.290\nSame product or named the same but\ntwo different products.\n\n18\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.470\nSo we clarify that and\n\n19\n00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.220\nget you started with exactly what\nthis whole product can do for you.\n\n20\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.860\nThen we talk about the file structures,\nlike what is the .one file and\n\n21\n00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.500\nhow and what happens when we first install\nthis product onto our machines and\n\n22\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.170\nsome of those default installation\nfeatures that happen.\n\n23\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.000\nWe explore the interface and\nhow to navigate within the product and\n\n24\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.380\nalso navigating within notebooks.\n\n25\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.290\nBecause in OneNote we\nare creating notebooks, just\n\n26\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.770\nlike in Excel we're creating workbooks,\nand I tend to mix those up sometimes so\n\n27\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.670\nyou might hear me refer to them as\nworkbooks throughout these episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.710\nWe're then going to create our first\nNotebook with sections and pages.\n\n29\n00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.930\nAnd then we have a whole section or\nwhole episode on note worthy options,\n\n30\n00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.540\ngoing over the different options\nwithin the program that we will\n\n31\n00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.410\ncover in future episodes in\nthe adding content section but\n\n32\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.460\njust to kind of give you a nice\noverview of all of them in one place.\n\n33\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.350\nLike I said,\nthen we get on to adding content.\n\n34\n00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.090\nWe're gonna be adding in text, images,\ntables, drawings, audio and video.\n\n35\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.370\nWe'll also talk about the Web Clipper and\nhow we can actually copy content from\n\n36\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.600\nthe internet because that's usually\na lot of places where we're going to be\n\n37\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.060\nfinding and researching information\nabout our different projects and\n\n38\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.670\nputting them into our digital notebooks.\n\n39\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.650\nWe'll talk about what is a quick note,\nwhere do they go?\n\n40\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.460\nWhy do I wanna use them?\n\n41\n00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.060\nWhat about linked notes,\nsomething specific in One Note 2016.\n\n42\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.430\nAnd then how do I handle attachments and\nthen adding them as printouts?\n\n43\n00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.680\nAnd what about links?\n\n44\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.180\nNot just our regular web links\nthat we think about with URLs, but\n\n45\n00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.240\ninternal links that we can actually\nuse as navigation within a notebook.\n\n46\n00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.750\nThen we move on to organizing and\nmanaging our content.\n\n47\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.710\nSo organize and manage.\n\n48\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.320\nTalking about tags, what are those and how\nthey can help us organize our information.\n\n49\n00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.690\nI need to tag something as a to do list or\nI need to tag something as important.\n\n50\n00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.270\nThen I can go and find those tags and\nreally help me keep organized and\n\n51\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.660\nmanage my content.\n\n52\n00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.120\nWe'll also talk about the powerful search\nfeature within OneNote, whether you're\n\n53\n00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.210\nsearching a page, a section, a notebook,\nor all of your notebooks that you have.\n\n54\n00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.330\nWe'll also manage sections and\npages, copying or moving.\n\n55\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.840\nDifferent ways that we can\nmerge our sections together.\n\n56\n00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.120\nWe then move on to proofing and\n\n57\n00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.080\nreview, things that are across most of\nour office programs like spellcheck.\n\n58\n00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.800\nBut there's a couple of other things\nspecific in OneNote that we will go over.\n\n59\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.530\nAnd then we talk about printing our\nOneNote notebooks and then exporting\n\n60\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.070\nthem out to other options such as a PDF,\nor what is a OneNote package.\n\n61\n00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.670\nCollaboration and\n\n62\n00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.290\nsecurity, that something that is really\nbig within all of our office providers.\n\n63\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.300\nHow we can collaborate in\nreal time with other people.\n\n64\n00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.160\nWhen we're researching or\ndoing a project within an organization,\n\n65\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160\nlots of time you're\nworking with other people.\n\n66\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.120\nSo how do we share a notebook?\n\n67\n00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.030\nHow do we integrate this with our\nOutlook and our Skype applications,\n\n68\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.960\nour other Office applications, to be able\nto collaborate with other people, or\n\n69\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.750\njust really how I can\njust be more efficient\n\n70\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.010\nwith sharing information with\nthe integration in Outlook?\n\n71\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.220\nWe actually have two parts in\nthat particular episode, and\n\n72\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.800\nthen password security.\n\n73\n00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.970\nHow can I secure certain parts\nof my notebooks, because\n\n74\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.305\nI've shared out a notebook with you, but\nI don't want you to see this one section.\n\n75\n00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.395\nSo we will learn how to\npassword protect a section.\n\n76\n00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:34.090\nThat's the only place you can do\nis the section, not on your pages.\n\n77\n00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.600\nNow we take a look at OneNote\non other platforms, so\n\n78\n00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.390\nI will show you how OneNote looks and\nbehaves on an iPad,\n\n79\n00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.050\nan iPhone, we do online,\nso we do OneNote online.\n\n80\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.150\nI also review it on a Macintosh\noperating system, and\n\n81\n00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.200\nalso giving you a quick overview of it\non a Windows 10 operating system and\n\n82\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.260\nwe even threw in an Android\nepisode on there.\n\n83\n00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.290\nSo just a nice review\nof what is it gonna do,\n\n84\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.670\nnot a very in-depth part of how to\nuse it strictly for the iPhone but\n\n85\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.310\nat least it'll get you stated in how it\ncompares and contrasts from the desktop\n\n86\n00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.620\nlocal installation of OneNote 2016,\nbut those are our topics.\n\n87\n00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.820\nSo who should be watching this show?\n\n88\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.970\nAnybody that wants to\nlearn all about OneNote.\n\n89\n00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.510\nWe start from the very beginning and\nthen we go all the way through it.\n\n90\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.690\nSo I would say any Office user,\n\n91\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.470\nwhether you're in Office 365 or in you\ncould just say an office in general.\n\n92\n00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.300\nMaybe your office is just your house.\n\n93\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.900\nThat's fine too.\n\n94\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.740\nAnd this is specifically for\nWindows users.\n\n95\n00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.230\nIf you're on a Macintosh platform\nyou could get the gist of it, but\n\n96\n00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.130\nthey are decently different between\nWindows and Mac and other platforms,\n\n97\n00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.890\nand even Windows 10 version of OneNote,\nwhich we cover in there.\n\n98\n00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.890\nSo I would say, anybody who wants to\nlearn the basics to an intermediate usage\n\n99\n00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.460\nof OneNote, this is the show for you.\n\n100\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.280\nWhat do you need to know about?\n\n101\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.720\nJust some Windows basics,\ndo you know where the Start menu is?\n\n102\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.800\nDo you know what the notification area is,\nand if you don't I show you.\n\n103\n00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.910\nSo just some basic\ninformation to get started,\n\n104\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.920\nyou do not have to have any\nprior knowledge of this product.\n\n105\n00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.260\nIt is from the very, very beginning,\n\n106\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.920\nall the way through the advanced\nfeatures of OneNote.\n\n107\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.840\nOneNote's only so deep.\n\n108\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.650\nIt's not like say, Word, or Excel that\nwe have three different levels in Word,\n\n109\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.060\nwe had essentials, advanced and expert.\n\n110\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.160\nFor this,\nthere's only one series because just that.\n\n111\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.600\nOkay?\nIt's nice, it's a great product,\n\n112\n00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.270\nI really like this one.\n\n113\n00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.760\nAnd then any other information or\nknowledge you have about using Outlook or\n\n114\n00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.450\nusing Word, this will all help because\na lot of your office products are similar\n\n115\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.230\nin nature, like the interface with\nthe ribbon and things like that.\n\n116\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.930\nSo, that will definitely help you,\nbut it is not required.\n\n117\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.590\nExercise files and notes.\n\n118\n00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.620\nNow, this is something that, for my shows,\nI usually have exercise files for\n\n119\n00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.730\nyou to follow along like,\nif you've watched the Word series.\n\n120\n00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.930\nThere is usually a file for\nevery specific episode,\n\n121\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.010\nand then you follow along with that.\n\n122\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.106\nThis show's a little bit different, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:23.106 --> 00:07:26.690\nThere are episode notes, so all the notes\nthat I say hey, refer to that for\n\n124\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.820\nthe link, you have that for\neach individual ones, and\n\n125\n00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.400\nthey're all wrapped up in\nthis particular overview.\n\n126\n00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.800\nBut I don't have individual files for\neach episode.\n\n127\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.620\nWhat I suggest is following along,\ncreate your own,\n\n128\n00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.000\nand when I'm making a new notebook,\nyou make your own notebook.\n\n129\n00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.100\nWhen I add a picture, you add a picture.\n\n130\n00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.590\nSo everything that I'm doing,\nyou're more than welcome to follow along\n\n131\n00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.820\nas you create your own pages and sections\nand your content and everything like that.\n\n132\n00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.830\nSo there's nothing that I really have\nready for you and it is a continuous, it's\n\n133\n00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.212\ncontinuously building on each episode as\nwe go through to make a very large [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:08:06.212 --> 00:08:11.600\nkind of disjointed notebook because I'm\njust using it as demonstration purposes.\n\n135\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.210\nBut I figure you might want\nthe finished notebooks that I did for\n\n136\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.390\nthis particular series.\n\n137\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.260\nAnd I have a lot of pictures of cats and\na lot of information about cats.\n\n138\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.730\nBut, you're more than\nwelcome to take that,\n\n139\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.630\nopen that particular OneNote notebook and\npage through it,\n\n140\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.900\nand thumb through it, and be able to\nmix and match it all on your own.\n\n141\n00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.270\nIt might not make any sense, like I said,\n\n142\n00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.390\nbecause I do a lot of practice\nwithin that notebook.\n\n143\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.650\nSo I would not take the finished\nnotebook that's in this overview\n\n144\n00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.970\nas a study guide for\nthis particular product.\n\n145\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.090\nAnd you'll see as we go\nthrough the episode,\n\n146\n00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:54.160\nyou'll, the finished file, you'll see\nthe end result of those episodes.\n\n147\n00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.080\nBut I figured, why not?\n\n148\n00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.490\nGo ahead.\n\n149\n00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.514\nHave a notebook with lots of cats.\n\n150\n00:08:58.514 --> 00:09:03.490\n[LAUGH] And anything extra that we need to\nknow about, there are always more options\n\n151\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.950\nin all of our Microsoft products,\nreally any product, that is.\n\n152\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.560\nI might show you the three\ndifferent ways to do it, but\n\n153\n00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.080\nthere's like a fourth and a fifth way.\n\n154\n00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.560\nI might not cover every\nsingle one of them.\n\n155\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.390\nSo definitely check it out and find other\noptions on your own like searching for\n\n156\n00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.060\nthe answers.\n\n157\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.665\nYou know there's a total pool of,\n\n158\n00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:25.680\na plethora of information\nout there on the Internet.\n\n159\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.440\nSo do a search, find out.\n\n160\n00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.630\nIf something is not working,\nsearch for it.\n\n161\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.240\nI do that.\nIn a lot of these episodes I try to cover\n\n162\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.640\nthose things that I had a question about\nit, so I try to answer it for you.\n\n163\n00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.930\nBut I'm sure there's many,\nmany more because everybody has\n\n164\n00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.198\na different reason of why\nthey use every product.\n\n165\n00:09:43.198 --> 00:09:46.630\nOneNote is very personalized.\n\n166\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:52.170\nYou're going to organize your information\nand take notes the way the you understand,\n\n167\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.040\nand the way that I do things might not\nbe the same way that you do things.\n\n168\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.930\nSo this is a very individualized product.\n\n169\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.460\nSo keep that in mind and just,\n\n170\n00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.630\none way that somebody uses a notebook is\nnot necessarily the way that you do it.\n\n171\n00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.250\nThat's okay, to each his own.\n\n172\n00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.330\nIt's all good, because we should\nbe just having fun with this.\n\n173\n00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.650\nThat's the whole reason why we're here,\nis to make learning fun.\n\n174\n00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.000\nNow if you're like but\nyou didn't say anything about updates, and\n\n175\n00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.200\nyou have in big letters normally.\n\n176\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.730\nWell, normally I'd tell you that your\nOffice products always have updates and\n\n177\n00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.150\nit's always changing, so\nif there's changes that's fine.\n\n178\n00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.440\nWell this product is slightly different,\nand\n\n179\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.270\nyou'll see why as we go into more in\ndepth in our introduction episode.\n\n180\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:40.390\nBut they're not going to be updating\nwith new features for this particular\n\n181\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.330\nproduct because of them migrating\nover to another version of one node.\n\n182\n00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.520\nLike hmm, that sounds interesting.\n\n183\n00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.740\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n184\n00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.960\nWell, what you'll have\nto do is stay tuned and\n\n185\n00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.155\ngo ahead and see our introduction episode,\nand I will see you real soon.\n\n186\n00:10:56.155 --> 00:11:02.230\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n\n",
