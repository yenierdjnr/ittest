00:00:13.623\nI'm your host Vonne Smith, and in this\ncourse overview, we are going to be going\n\n4\n00:00:13.623 --> 00:00:18.080\nover well, what exactly are we gonna\ncover in this particular series?\n\n5\n00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.880\nWho is this series for, do we need to\nknow anything before we get started,\n\n6\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.960\nand any extra tidbits that\nI have might for you.\n\n7\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.060\nSo, what are we gonna talk about?\n\n8\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.980\nWhat we're gonna talk about\nfrom the very beginning,\n\n9\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.750\nwe're gonna introduce what is OneNote?\n\n10\n00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.180\nWhy do we use it?\n\n11\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.890\nWhat would I benefit from\nby using this application?\n\n12\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.368\nAs we're gonna identify that, talk about,\nthere's OneNote for Windows 10 but\n\n13\n00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:44.184\nthen there's OneNote 2016.\n\n14\n00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:46.230\nAre they different?\n\n15\n00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.545\nThey are, so that's why we have\ntwo separate series on it.\n\n16\n00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:53.670\nWe're getting started with\nthe actual application\n\n17\n00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.910\nby talking about a Microsoft account or\nan Office 365 account.\n\n18\n00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.911\nWe talk about two different types of\nusers of this product, because of\n\n19\n00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:09.211\ncourse it is a application that works on\nthe operating system, not with Office 365.\n\n20\n00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.550\nYou don't have to have that there.\n\n21\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.530\nSo we're gonna get in, get started with\nsigning in, what about opening and\n\n22\n00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.280\nclosing our notebooks?\n\n23\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.510\nWhat is OneDrive?\n\n24\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.250\nWhere is it?\n\n25\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.680\nOr at least that's where we're going\nto be putting our files into, so\n\n26\n00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.000\nwe cover all of that in this introduction.\n\n27\n00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.850\nWe also talk about the interface\nof the application.\n\n28\n00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390\nMaking sure you understand\nwhere the ribbon is,\n\n29\n00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390\nhow to get around in your notebook,\nand actually create a notebook.\n\n30\n00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.920\nWe'll start a brand new one and\ncreate our sections and our pages.\n\n31\n00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.402\nThen we'll move into adding content into\nthose notebooks with text, tables, images.\n\n32\n00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:45.800\nWe're gonna draw in there,\nwe have a lot of cool drawing tools.\n\n33\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.040\nAnd we're also going to add\nin links within our notebook.\n\n34\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.960\nAnd I normally think links\nas like out to a website or\n\n35\n00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.480\nsomething like that,\nwe're talking about internal links.\n\n36\n00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.770\nIt's more of like cross referencing and\n\n37\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.510\nit's actually used to help navigate\nin the content of your notebooks.\n\n38\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.600\nWe're also going to be copying from\nthe web and talk about the web clipper,\n\n39\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.738\nwhich is really cool.\n\n40\n00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:13.130\nAnd what OneNote does\nautomatically when we go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.170\nget information from the Internet.\n\n42\n00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.140\nWe'll also insert some attachments,\nwe'll talk about the PDF print out and\n\n43\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.970\nwe'll also add audio and\nvideo into our pages.\n\n44\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.110\nThen we'll move into our topic of\norganizing and managing those notebooks.\n\n45\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.180\nWe're gonna tag stuff up,\nwhat does that do for\n\n46\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.020\nus and\nhow does it help organize ourselves?\n\n47\n00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.970\nWe'll also be using this search\nfunctionality of OneNote, so\n\n48\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.910\nhey I don't remember where I\nput the stuff about the cats.\n\n49\n00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.610\nOr I mean, it's gonna be everywhere but\nwe wanna go ahead and search for\n\n50\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120\nthat, so\nwe'll go through the search options.\n\n51\n00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.270\nWe'll also have a whole episode\non that is called organize and\n\n52\n00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.830\nmanage where we're going to be\nmoving sections, moving pages.\n\n53\n00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.860\nHow do we make section groups?\n\n54\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.960\nWe're going to be going over all of that.\n\n55\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.668\nStuff that may be covered in other places,\nbut\n\n56\n00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:06.244\nwe try to keep it one\nnice central location.\n\n57\n00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:10.486\nAnd then we're also gonna talk about\nour history with our page versions and\n\n58\n00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:11.980\nour deleted notes.\n\n59\n00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.740\nWe're going to proof which isn't nearly as\nextensive as some of our Office products.\n\n60\n00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.490\nWe'll print, and then we'll also\ntalk about the inversive reader,\n\n61\n00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.210\nwhich can be really handy and\nhelpful for specific audiences.\n\n62\n00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.110\nMore towards people maybe learning\nanother language, or learning English,\n\n63\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.907\nor how to help with readers,\nand maybe more graceful level.\n\n64\n00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:36.550\nAnd maybe as an educator, or\na parent, you could go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.340\nuse that to help somebody\nwith their reading.\n\n66\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030\nAnd we'll move in to collaboration\nsecurity, sharing is caring, so\n\n67\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.870\nwe'll learn how to share notebooks.\n\n68\n00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.760\nAnd then sometimes with notebooks,\n\n69\n00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.490\nyou might not want people\nto see certain places, so\n\n70\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.480\nwe're gonna learn about how to password\nprotect sections in our notebooks.\n\n71\n00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.630\nAnd we'll also talk about how\nOneNote works with emails and\n\n72\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.610\nmeetings which could be Outlook,\nwe have that Outlook aspects since we\n\n73\n00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.093\nwill have an account whether it's free or\na full Office 365.\n\n74\n00:04:08.093 --> 00:04:13.470\nI bet how you can use that to your\nadvantage and collaborating with others.\n\n75\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.520\nWho is this for?\n\n76\n00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.580\nAnybody really, you do not even have\nto use Office products, you can just\n\n77\n00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.080\nhave a computer with Windows 10, that's\nall you need to be able to use this.\n\n78\n00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.670\nSo it can cover everybody,\n\n79\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.160\nwhether you're an Office user as in\ncapital O with the Office 365 or\n\n80\n00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.830\njust you're in an office,\nyou're self employed, right?\n\n81\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.190\nYou just want this in your personal life.\n\n82\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.800\nHow can I use it to help organize it cuz\nthis is the digital notebook application\n\n83\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.480\nand it's really, really handy.\n\n84\n00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.100\nSo it can go across all spectrum\nof work and personal life.\n\n85\n00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.410\nWe start at the very\nbeginning with our basics and\n\n86\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.320\nwe move up into an intermediate\nlevel of OneNote.\n\n87\n00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.963\nThe nice thing is this\nprogram is not too deep.\n\n88\n00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:06.020\nThere's not as much we need to know\nin comparison to Word or Excel.\n\n89\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.090\nSo I would say it's a fairly easy and\nintuitive application,\n\n90\n00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.870\ndo you need to know anything?\n\n91\n00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.100\nNot really, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.510\nYou need to have Windows,\nthat's one thing.\n\n93\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.050\nSo you definitely need to be a Windows\nuser and you do have to have Windows 10.\n\n94\n00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.340\nAnd having maybe some basic\nknowledge of the operating system,\n\n95\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.530\nthat would definitely help.\n\n96\n00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.980\nDo you know where the File Explorer is?\n\n97\n00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.180\nDo you know where the start menu is?\n\n98\n00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.790\nBecause I just kinda do it,\nI don't fully explain everything.\n\n99\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.700\nSo maybe a little bit of just\nusing a computer could help.\n\n100\n00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.070\nYou don't have to have any\nknowledge of OneNote or\n\n101\n00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.890\nreally any of the Office products,\nbut its always helpful, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.200\nSo if you know a little bit about Word,\nyou know a little bit about a Microsoft's\n\n103\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.050\naccount whether you've already\nused one because you play on Xbix,\n\n104\n00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.280\nthat might be kind of nice.\n\n105\n00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.230\nNormally in my series I have files,\n\n106\n00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.590\nI have exercise files that I use for\nyou to follow along with.\n\n107\n00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.460\nIn this particular series,\nI don't have any.\n\n108\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.142\nI don't have any exercise files,\n\n109\n00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:08.988\nbecause what I'd really like\nyou to do is create your own.\n\n110\n00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:11.140\nWhen I'm creating a notebook,\nyou create a notebook.\n\n111\n00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.120\nWhen I insert an image,\nyou insert an image.\n\n112\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.994\nSo I don't have specific resources for\nyou to work with.\n\n113\n00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:21.220\nThis is an application that\nyou could start from scratch.\n\n114\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.370\nAnd just get in there, start playing\naround with it, follow along, but\n\n115\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.510\nwe do have the episode notes.\n\n116\n00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.150\nBut I do refer to hey go ahead and\n\n117\n00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.450\nfind the PDFs of the notes that I'm\nreading from when I do the episodes.\n\n118\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.090\nThat is included, but\nthere are now exercise files.\n\n119\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.920\nSide note, if you wanted a notebook,\n\n120\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.400\nyou could get them from\nthe OneNote 2016 series.\n\n121\n00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.380\nBut since it's a little different,\n\n122\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.090\nyou might not actually be able to\nuse those now that I think about it.\n\n123\n00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.380\nSo you know what,\njust create your own, you'll be fine.\n\n124\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.990\nWhat do we need to know?\n\n125\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.490\nI just mentioned there is another series,\nand I do cover OneNote in other platforms,\n\n126\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.360\nmeaning on a Macintosh environment, on\nan Android phone, on a iPhone, on an iPad.\n\n127\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:12.800\nSo we just kind of glaze over it, this\nparticular version of 104 Windows 10 is\n\n128\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.360\ngoing to be the most applicable\nto your other platforms, okay?\n\n129\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.230\nThere are always gonna be little\ndifferences here and there but\n\n130\n00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.630\nif you wanna check that out,\nI would go to that particular series.\n\n131\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.490\nAnd if you just wanna learn more about\nthe OneNote 2016, we do talk about how\n\n132\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.060\nthis particular product, this meaning\nOneNote 2016 sorry let me clarify that.\n\n133\n00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.410\nIs not going to be archaic\nto Microsoft anymore and\n\n134\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.120\nthe Windows 10 version is going\nto become the new default.\n\n135\n00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.340\nSo that third bullet point on the side\nright here updates happen it's\n\n136\n00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.130\ngonna happen a lot in this product.\n\n137\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:54.020\nI foresee this particular product being\nupgraded pretty significantly, pretty\n\n138\n00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.923\nregularly, over the course to kinda get\nit up to speed to where it was in 2016.\n\n139\n00:07:59.923 --> 00:08:03.230\nSo updates are going to happen,\nthings are going to change in this.\n\n140\n00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.700\nAnd of course,\nthere's always other options with that.\n\n141\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.090\nI try to cover everything, but\nI might have missed a few things.\n\n142\n00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.300\nSo there's always going to be other\nways to do the same things that\n\n143\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.860\nI'm doing on the screen.\n\n144\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.560\nYou might find some different ways, and of\ncourse, since we're gonna have all these\n\n145\n00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.310\nupdates, and we might find other ways\nto do things, there's good answers.\n\n146\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.890\nAnd go see the Microsoft support pages,\njust go ahead, and\n\n147\n00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:28.010\nuse your favorite search engine,\nand find the information about it.\n\n148\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.090\nDefinitely make sure you type\nin OneNote for Windows 10,\n\n149\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.580\nbecause you might find information\non 2016 that's not going to match.\n\n150\n00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.529\nSo be careful about that when you\nare searching for your answers.\n\n151\n00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.980\nEverybody uses products for different\nreasons maybe you work, maybe you don't.\n\n152\n00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.110\nMaybe you're a stay at home parent, that's\nsomething that you can still utilize\n\n153\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.460\nthose products in your everyday life and\nit can be really, really helpful for you.\n\n154\n00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.080\nAnd of course, when you're learning,\nI want you to have fun, try it out.\n\n155\n00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.210\nThat's the way that we\nlearn all these things,\n\n156\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.270\nis just get in there, see what it can do.\n\n157\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.439\nWatch these episodes, and then you try it\nout on your own, and have fun doing it and\n\n158\n00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:09.867\nI will see you very soon\nin some future episode.\n\n159\n00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:16.625\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
